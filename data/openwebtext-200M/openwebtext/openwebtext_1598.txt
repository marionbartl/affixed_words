Olivia Judson on the influence of science and biology on modern life .
The lights go down .
The room fills with music — a pulsating hip - hop rhythm .
And then , over the music , you hear the voice of Richard Dawkins reading a passage from “ On the Origin of Species ” by Charles Darwin : “ Whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction .
For only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed . ”
So begins one of the most astonishing , and brilliant , lectures on evolution I ’ve ever seen : “ The Rap Guide to Evolution , ” by Baba Brinkman .
Brinkman , a burly Canadian from Vancouver , is a latter - day wandering minstrel , a self - styled “ rap troubadour , ” with a master ’s degree in English and a history of tree - planting ( according to his Web site , he has personally planted more than one million trees ) .
His guide to evolution grew out of a correspondence with Mark Pallen , an evolutionary biologist and rap enthusiast at the University of Birmingham , in Britain ; the result , as Brinkman tells us , is “ the only hip - hop show to have been peer - reviewed . ”
It is also , I suspect , the only hip - hop show to talk of mitochondria , genetic drift , sexual selection or memes .
For Brinkman has taken Darwin ’s exhortation seriously .
He is a man on a mission to spread the word about evolution — how it works , what it means for our view of the world , and why it is something to be celebrated rather than feared .
To this end , he has concocted a set of mini-lectures disguised as rap songs .
When he comes to human evolution , for example , he has the audience sing along in call - response fashion to “ I ’m a African ” — a riff on an earlier song of that name by the radical , pan-Africanist hip - hop duo Dead Prez .
The point of Brinkman ’s version is that because humans evolved in Africa , we are all Africans : pan-Africanism meets population genetics .
A few moments later , he ’s showing a video of individuals of the social slime mold Dictyostelium discoidium streaming together while rapping about how cooperation evolves .
( Dictyostelium is notorious , in some circles , for its strange life - style .
Usually , an individual Dictyostelium lives alone as a single cell .
But when food is scarce , the single cells come together and form a being known as “ the slug ” ; this crawls off in search of better conditions .
When it finds them , the slug develops into a stalked fruiting body , and releases spores .
But here ’s the mystery : not all members of the slug get to make spores — and thereby contribute to the next generation — so why do they cooperate ? )
It ’s surreal stuff .
But the clever part is that the show works at different levels .
If you are up on evolution you will be amused by the in - jokes and amazed by the erudition .
If you know nothing about evolution , you will certainly be entertained , and you may even learn something .
( The delivery is so fast , and the material so broad , that it ’s hard to tell how much will stick on one hearing ; but for enthusiasts , there ’s a CD .
It ’s good ; I ’ve been listening to it all afternoon . )
The lyrics are , for the most part , witty , sophisticated and scientifically accurate ; and they lack the earnest defensiveness that sometimes haunts lectures on evolution .
I spotted one or two small slips — a confusion of the praying mantis with the Australian redback spider ( oh no ! ) — and there are a few moments of poetic license that a po-faced pedant might object to .
Otherwise , it ’s pretty rigorous .
Brinkman can’t resist taking a few pot-shots at creationists ( “ Darwin got it going on / Creationism is . . . dead wrong . . . ” ) , and he devotes one rap to refutations of creationist arguments .
But by and large , he proselytizes about evolution not by attacking its deniers , but by revealing the subject ’s scope , from natural selection to the evolution of human culture and language .
At the same time , he teases the audience , sends up post - modernism , mocks himself and satirizes the genre of hip - hop , all with fizzing energy and spell - binding charisma .
Like I said , astonishing .
I saw “ The Rap Guide to Evolution ” last week in Barnstaple , a small town in the west of England .
But this week , Darwin got it going on for a few days at the Bleecker Street Theatre , off Broadway .
If you are in New York — go .
Unlocked car doors and discarded cigarette butts could leave smokers and motorists lighter in the pocket thanks to tough new fines to be enforced from today .
Police will fine motorists in the Yarra Ranges up to $ 358 for leaving their car doors unlocked or windows down .
Meanwhile , roaming inspectors are on patrol in Melbourne enforcing fines up to $ 234 for unbinned butts .
From today , smokers face a $ 234 on - the - spot fine for throwing away a burning cigarette and $ 117 for littering an extinguished butt .
Melbourne Lord Mayor Robert Doyle said cigarette butts were the city ’s biggest source of litter , with up to 11,000 cleaned off the streets each day .
Guy Kewney has been remembered with fondness by the tech industry
The technology world has been mourning the death of one of its most influential writers , Guy Kewney .
Guy died aged 63 on 8 April after battling bowel and liver cancer .
He had been writing about technology since the 1970s , including long stints with publications such as PC Magazine and Personal Computer World .
He had blogged and tweeted about his illness and , in his final days , his daughter Lucy - herself a technology writer - took over his Facebook page .
She informed his 588 Facebook friends of his death with the simple words : Guy is gone .
On Facebook and Twitter , his many industry contacts remembered him with fondness .
In its tribute to him , technology news site The Register described him as " the man who made Britain love computers " .
He was a regular contributor to BBC technology stories .
Guy interviewed both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs before either was famous but his most infamous interview took place in 2006 .
He was lined up to speak to the BBC News Channel about a legal wrangle between Apple and the Beatles case , but in a now famous blunder , a Congolese graduate - Guy Goma - who was waiting in the BBC lobby to be interviewed about a job as a data support cleanser - took his place live on TV .
The resulting interview has gone down in television history .
As well as paying tribute to his eccentricities and indomitable journalistic style , many of his friends and colleagues remember Guy 's devotion to his family .
He is survived by his wife Mary and two daughters .
I recently pick up a jar of Grace ’s jerk seasoning ( center ) from Superstore and I was shocked by how good it was !
While it was very spicy ( this is to be expected with jerk seasoning ) , it was full of flavours unique to Caribbean cuisine .
Jerk seasoning principally relies upon two items : allspice ( called “ pimento ” in Jamaica ) and Scotch bonnet peppers ( among the hottest peppers on the Scoville scale ) .
The seasoning also includes cloves , cinnamon , scallions , nutmeg , thyme , and garlic , salt , pepper .
I made jerk chicken by covering six chicken thighs with 3 tablespoons of Grace ’s jerk seasoning and baking the chicken in the over for around 25 minutes at 375F .
The chicken was spicy , moist and delicious !
It also froze and re-heated well .
NEW YORK ( AP ) — Combatting child abuse is a cause with universal support .
Yet a push to create a national database of abusers , as authorized by Congress in 2006 , is barely progressing as serious flaws come to light in the state - level registries that would be the basis for a national list .
In North Carolina , an appeals court ruled last month that the registry there is unconstitutional because alleged abusers had no chance to defend themselves before being listed .
In New York , a class - action settlement is taking effect on behalf of thousands of people who were improperly denied the chance for a hearing to get removed from the state registry .
And the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a case this fall arising from the plight of a California couple whose names remain on that state 's registry years after they were cleared of an abuse allegation made by their rebellious teenage daughter .
" Nobody wants to be seen as soft on child abuse — and that 's gotten us where we are , " said Carolyn Kubitschek , a New York attorney who has waged several court battles over the registries .
" In the state of New York , it is still almost impossible to get off the list . "
More than 40 states have the abuse registries — which are distinct from the better - known registries of convicted sex offenders that every state makes publicly available on the Internet .
The abuse lists are n't accessible to the public , but are used by day - care centers , schools , adoption agencies and other entities to screen people who want to adopt , be foster parents or get a job working with children .
Even critics of the registries say they can serve a vital purpose in barring perpetrators of serious abuse from roles where they would interact routinely with children .
It 's the process underlying many of the registries that has come into question — and their potential to entangle innocent people as well as wrongdoers .
A person does n't have to be convicted or even charged with a crime to get listed .
Under the general practice in most states , entries are based on a child protection investigator 's assertion that the person committed an act of abuse or neglect ; hearings or appeals , if granted at all , often come long after the name is entered .
" Anybody can call a child abuse hotline and report abuse — anybody , including your ex-spouse who hates you , your landlord who 's trying to evict you , " Kubitschek said .
By law , she said , child protection services must investigate each call — and their subsequent reports can lead to a person 's placement on an abuse registry before they are notified or allowed to defend themselves .
The problems with due process were highlighted last year in an interim report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , which has been directed by Congress to assess the feasibility of a national child abuse registry .
" Strong due process protections could necessitate significant changes to CPS investigation processes in some states that could be costly to implement and may discourage participation in a national registry , " the HHS report said .
The report also questioned whether a national registry might be plagued by " false positives " affecting innocent people sharing a name with a perpetrator .
The potential problems will be assessed by a new HHS - commissioned study over the next two years , examining the state registries , gauging the states ' interest in participating in a national registry , and trying to determine if one is indeed needed .
" Would a national registry in fact be useful to states ? " said Barbara Broman , an HHS official who oversaw preparation of the interim report .
" We do not know the answer to that question . "
Congress authorized a national child abuse registry in 2006 as part of the Adam Walsh Act , named for a Florida boy abducted and murdered in 1981 .
His father , John Walsh , hosts the TV series " America 's Most Wanted . "
Among those urging faster progress toward a national registry is Sen.
Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. , who says such a list would help track child abusers who cross state lines to avoid detection and offend again in the new location .
" It does n't make any sense at all that while we try to watch sex offenders like hawks , we let child batterers , who physically batter children , slip through the cracks , " he told a news conference last month .
However , Howard Davidson of the American Bar Association 's Center on Children and the Law , said most people on the state registries are accused of neglect , not battering or other physical abuse .
Davidson supports use of the registries to screen potential adoptive or foster parents .
But he questions whether they 're a suitable tool for employers to vet job applicants because of inconsistencies in the level of proof required to register a name .
A disproportionate number of people on the registries are poor , Davidson said , decreasing their chances of successfully challenging an unfair inclusion on the list .
Even the National Child Abuse Coalition , a major player in Washington in advocating on behalf of abused children , is cautious about the proposed national registry .
Tom Birch , the coalition 's legislative counsel , said there are many unanswered questions about the registry 's costs and how it would reconcile differences in the states ' definitions and handling of child maltreatment .
" Rushing ahead to create a national registry is not the way to go at this point , " he said .
" It would need to be done right . "
While the abuse registries remain out of the spotlight in most states , there have been some notable recent developments .
Among them :
___
California has had a series of cases involving people who were exonerated of abuse allegations yet struggled to get their names off the state 's Child Abuse Central Index .
One such case is scheduled to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court this fall .
Lawyers say it will draw attention to the registry debate even though the issue before the justices involves a dispute over Los Angeles County 's position in the case — not some of the more fundamental issues raised during their nine - year legal battle .
The couple , Craig and Wendy Humphries of Valencia , were arrested in 2001 after their daughter , then 15 , accused them of abuse ; their younger children were placed in foster care .
State courts ruled the allegation was false but they remain on the list of 800,000 names .
In 2008 , a federal appeals court found the registry system unconstitutional because there 's no way for the innocent to clear their names .
The ruling empathized with the Humphries as " living every parent 's nightmare . "
Esther Boynton , the Humphries ' attorney , is frustrated by what she considers a slow , piecemeal government response to the ruling .
" It shows how the defendant is circling the wagons , how hard they will fight , " she said .
" This goes on and on and on .
My clients are living through that . "
Boynton knows the ordeal firsthand — she was placed on the abuse index in 1990 after accidentally splashing her 17 - year - old daughter with hot coffee .
Only three years later , applying for a volunteer job , did she learn she was on the list ; it took two more years of litigation to get removed .
Later , Boynton represented a Bakersfield stockbroker , Scott Whyte , who had been accused of child abuse by an ex-girlfriend in 1986 .
Whyte avoided contact with their son for years , worried that another allegation might land him in prison , before he was cleared and won a 2007 court ruling upholding his right to challenge the index system .
Despite the vindication ,
Whyte says being on the registry left lasting scars .
" I will never get over this — it is still oozing out of me , " he said in a telephone interview .
" I think I 've given up my anger , but I have to continually readdress that .
Forgiveness was so difficult . "
Boynton says the officials responsible for the registries have good intentions , with the aim of protecting children , but often overlook the harm that can befall people wrongly placed on the lists .
" If they do look , they 'll see that parents and children have a shared interest , " she said .
" Accurate information helps everyone .
Inaccurate information can pull people apart unfairly . "

North Carolina 's Court of Appeals ruled in March that the state 's registry process was unconstitutional because it gave suspected abusers no chance to defend themselves prior to being listed .
The ruling also required a higher standard of proof before a name could be entered .
Sherry Bradsher , director of the state 's Division of Social Services , said the legislature would amend the law to conform with the ruling .
Temporarily , she said , the roughly 8,000 names on the list will not be made available — but their long - term status is uncertain .
The law was challenged by Kelly Holt , whose name had been on the list since 2007 even though he denied abusing his son and was never charged with a crime .
His attorney , Miriam Thompson , said the unanimous appeals court ruling brought tears to her eyes with its eloquent affirmation of the right to due process .
" I have two daughters — I 'm all for protecting them , " Thompson said .
" But you 've got to provide a better system before you accuse someone and put them on that list .
That 's a punishment , a state action with consequences .
Before you do that , you 've got to prove it . "
___
In New York State , lawyer Thomas Hoffman is representing thousands of people who may have been improperly denied the chance for a hearing to get removed from the state abuse registry .
Hoffman says somewhere between 17,000 and 25,000 requests for hearings were terminated prematurely by the Office of Children and Family Services between 2003 and 2007 — in many cases with the request letters simply shredded .
Under a proposed class action settlement , the state has agreed to restore their right to a hearing and promised not to allow employers access to their names in the meantime .
However , Hoffman says it may take years for these hearings to be scheduled — which could leave many of the affected individuals in limbo while prospective employers get no response of any sort to screening requests .
" At least 50 percent of the people who get a hearing are exonerated , " Hoffman said .
" There are a lot of people who do n't belong there , and it 's taking too long to exonerate them . "
" There 's a good purpose for these lists , " Hoffman added .
" But you could have a divorce case , fighting over custody , the dad puts the kid in car with no seat belt on and the mom calls it in .
Suddenly you 're on the same list as the pedophile , and the employer does n't know difference . "
___
Missouri's Supreme Court , in a 2007 ruling , said the state 's method of placing people on the abuse registry was unconstitutional because it allowed a listing based solely on a state investigator 's determination .
Now , a hearing is required beforehand .
Since the ruling , disputes have flared over how many names should be removed from the registry .
" It 's a horrible thing to be on this list , " said Timothy Belz , the lawyer who won the 2007 case .
" You ca n't get a job as a teacher , a nurse .
You can't volunteer for your church 's nursery duty .
" If you 're a sex offender , your name does n't go on the list until you 're convicted , " Belz added .
" But if you 're a little late getting a kid to the emergency room after he cut his finger , you could be on the list for ever . "
Belz attributed the due- process problems to zealous legislators .
" You can't find a lawyer or judge who is n't shocked , " he said .
" Yet you go to the legislature and it 's like pulling teeth to get it changed .
All it takes is one kid to get molested , one horrible story , and the legislators just go nuts .
The legislature ought to require itself to cool off . "

Nico Rosberg believes Mercedes team - mate Michael Schumacher will be back at his best sooner rather than later .
Rosberg has outperformed Schumacher in all four qualifying sessions and grands prix so far this season , and following another disappointing drive in China there has been growing debate over the wisdom of Schumacher 's comeback .
While Rosberg lies second in the drivers ' championship with 50 points , Schumacher is down in tenth with ten points .
" I 'm happy to be ahead of him but I do n't know how long it will last , " Rosberg told Gazzetta dello Sport .
" I would have been happy just to be at his level .
Now I hope I can carry on competing with him .
" People have the wrong opinion of Michael , " he said .
" I thought that it would n't be a good thing to have him as team - mate ; instead , I 'm pleasantly surprised about it . "
This kid is so god - damned loud he could wake the dead .

On April 15 , I wrote a blog post about why I think Margaret Wente is wrong to say that universities are sitting ducks for reform because the system is overly focused on professors and research .
She said that professors , because of a sense of entitlement and because of tenure , think that they are above the citizenry .
In my last blog post , I took this idea apart .
In this post , I hope to start a conversation about how post - secondary education should be reformed .
Not to reduce the system in the thoughtless way Ms. Wente advocates , but to truly position Canada ’s citizens to be leaders in the Information Society that is upon us .
I want to emphasize that these are personal musings and should n’t be taken as a manifesto .
They are born of my experiences and life path .
I hope they are meaningful to you .
Education means to bring something out of someone , or to help someone reach personal potential .
To do this requires sustained human contact .
The professor - student relationship is exactly that – a relationship .
And human relationships need time , and kindness and patience to develop .
To bloom , relationships between people need space , and quiet as well as the opportunity to make mistakes and be forgiven .
Human contact does n’t develop well in a constantly stressful and overcrowded environment .
Being jostled , constantly waiting in endless line - ups , habitually not being able to enroll in the courses you want , not having a spare moment between waking and sleep .
All of this leads to distraction , anxiety and a lack of focus in both faculty and students .
It leads to a feeling of personal insecurity , of always feeling winded .
Of running forward in breathless anxiety .
But running where ?
There is no time to think about this and find out .
Downtime and quiet time is essential .
Structure is necessary , of course .
Structure provides order and predictability – stability , in a word .
However , there must be a large place for unstructured living .
I have heard the argument that giving students more leisure will lead to bad behaviour – drunken excess , drug - riddled partying , etc . I disagree .
I think that these phenomena are the result of too much stress and busyness coupled with only tiny windows for leisurely contemplation .
Too many options , too many requirements , and heavy expectations for “ productivity ” are to blame for this situation .
All of that structure and process infantilizes the students and transforms professors into service providers .
There is no room for wisdom .
No room for mastery of a craft .
No room for theoretical and philosophical contemplation .
How can this situation change ?
Allow me to speak a little of my personal experience .
I have been a part of the McMaster community since 2001 , when I was hired as the first professor in the brand new communication studies program .
Because the program was new , I was able to play a huge part in building it from the ground up .
Because the program was small and limited to a couple of hallways in Togo Salmon Hall , I got to know all of the students , and had a role to play in building our faculty team .
I watched as our program grew and matured and developed around me .
I watched our first cohorts of students mature and we changed the program to match their experiences .
I kept live connections with our alumni through the new social media available to me : Facebook , Twitter and , of course , through my website .
It all felt very familiar and familial – and continues to feel like that today .
Our communications program merged with McMaster ’s multimedia program in 2005 to form a new department .
This year , our department had the largest number of undergraduate majors in the faculty of humanities .
I am convinced that the smallness of our numbers and the intimacy of our space contributed to the special sense of community that we enjoy .
It has been a whirlwind journey through almost ten years of growth and building .
I have loved every minute ( even the tough , low ones ) .
What did I learn from this unique set of professional circumstances ?
I learned that a university education is born of the balanced interaction of five things :
Learning and mastering practical , professional skills .
If you do n’t know how to make things , it will be very hard for you to identify the good in things .
There is a limit to armchair criticism .
If you do n’t know how to make things , it will be very hard for you to identify the good in things .
There is a limit to armchair criticism .
Gaining an understanding of what those skills can do in the broader context of society , ethics , culture , economics , politics and , yes , perhaps even faith .
All skills have value and have impact on the country .
Gaining the theoretical frameworks to understand how your profession can have impact on your country is fundamental to being able to make ethical choices .

Mastering a discipline and thereby gaining a lens through which to understand your experiences in the world .
There is a wisdom that comes of having intimate and profound knowledge of your craft , discipline or trade .
It is solid .
It becomes your way of understanding the world around you .
If you are a communications person , you understand the world in terms of relationships between people and institutions and story - telling .
If you are an engineer , you see a world organized around and by machines , rationality and buildings .
Enlightened democracy comes of the conversation between people speaking credibly through these established “ lenses . ”

A sense of community with all other members of the university : faculty , students , staffers and service - people .
The Academy should be a community devoted to learning , contemplation , character development , and discovery .
The Academy should be a community devoted to learning , contemplation , character development , and discovery .
An open walking - bridge between the university and the other sectors of the country - at - large : government , industry and not - for - profits .
Professors , industry people and civil servants should have greater mobility between among the three sectors .
Right now , there is no flexibility and very little movement between these sectors .
This is specialization and “ sector atrophy ” is leading to a “ fragmented democracy , ” where experts rule over tiny fiefs with closed minds and exclusive power .
In a knowledge society , the way we categorize knowledge in the school system will be mirrored in government and commerce .
A society based on this kind of specialization can easily become a closed , stagnant technocracy .
That is to say , a society governed by its experts instead of by the breadth of its own people .
Openness , balance and flexibility are the keys to success for universities and colleges in 21st Century .
Not expert rule .
To accomplish these five things , you need a post - secondary education that makes room for students ( and professors ) to gain knowledge , life experience , wisdom and caring .
Our universities and colleges should be re-organized to make this happen .
Is it an impossible dream ?
Certainly not .
Building these institutions requires a basic material investment , of course .
It means proper buildings , better grounds and more shared public spaces in which students , professors and community members can interact .
Public spaces that also act as portals for the university to the other sectors .
Public spaces which are easily accessible , open and welcoming .
Places where people come together to observe , to share , to lounge , to eat and drink , to listen and to perform .
More importantly , this mission for universities and colleges requires a major cultural shift – away from the notion of a one - size - fits - all and one - speed - fits - all education .
This means breaking down the walls between colleges and universities – and not just by tacking on a “ College Year ” at the end of a four - year Bachelor ’s degree at university .
It means finding a way of integrating college and university curricula in a thoughtful way that makes passing from one system to the other seamless .
It means a thoughtful consideration of what colleges and universities contribute to the life of the mind and to the life of the hands .
How do skills and theory come together to forge people and citizens who are better equipped to seek the good life ?
A few years ago , Dr Geoffrey Rockwell and Dr Terry Flynn led a team that I worked on to develop a project like this for McMaster .
We were going to build an integrated college - university learning community in Burlington as a new campus for McMaster University .
This community would blend “ applied skills ” , theory , ethics , commerce and socio-cultural awareness in a small , urban , community - oriented campus environment .
Students would graduate from a 5 - year program with a college diploma , a bachelor ’s degree and a master ’s degree – while working on multi- year projects driven by socio-cultural , commercial or not - for - profit needs .
It was splendid .
And it would have worked .
Administrative priorities changed , and the “ Burlington Project ” ended up being a graduate education centre for our business school – a great project , but very different from the original , radical concept .
Our students are leading the way forward by adopting social media and choosing personal growth and development , rather than seeking the trappings of conventional success .
They are building Marshall McLuhan ’s Global Village .
They communicate quickly , learn fast and value emotional depth .
They are also profoundly lonely , often overwhelmed by choices and stressed out by what appears to be a society where order has been replaced by “ trends ” and “ information flows . ”
Business and politics are becoming much more Athenian in this way – rhetoric and persuasion are growing in importance and influence .
Rules are becoming norms .
Society is becoming symbolic .
Information is everywhere – no longer is information confined to libraries and professors ’ seminars .
Universities and colleges must adapt to this new reality .
Not by paring down to the “ bare bones ” or by superficially rebranding themselves .
Rather , they must become what they always should have been – open communities that serve society by permitting it to explore itself on campus .
They should be cosmopolitan and flexible .
The place of the professor is to help students and citizens ( through public scholarship ) navigate the ebb and flow of information .
To be a trusted mentor and guide .
To be an agent for change and a caring critic .
To be a participant in community life and a trusted friend to the learner .
There are as many ways of feeling the world , knowing it and navigating it , as there are individuals in Canada .
Each of us is born with a rich inner mental world .
Each of us has dreams and fears , inspirations and anxieties .
Each of us has a path to chart in our lives .
Our technologies have suddenly and very abruptly shattered the dams that held back information in the past .
We are flooded with ideas , images and feelings .
Universities and colleges should be safe and quiet places for us to explore ourselves .
Explore knowledge , and explore how the world works .
They should be open places .
People should be able go through their programs at different times during their lives .
They should be open places where seminars and lectures invite the public learn and debate the pressing issues of our times .
They should offer a constellation of diplomas , degrees , mini-courses , seminars , skill - building workshops , community learning , and distance - education programs .
Building this system will require a lot of thought .
The system needs to be restructured to respond honestly to the changes that the information society and new communication technologies are bringing in the way we live , do business , relate to each other and govern ourselves .
This sort of restructuring means new resources and a new investment .
But more crucially , it means collaboration – collaboration between policy makers , professors , students , parents , industry people , civil servants and media types .
To properly and honestly adapt the post - secondary education system is a gargantuan , multi - year endeavour .
But the 21st Century is the Century of Information and Communication .
And the post - secondary system is the key to success and leadership in the 21st Century .
It ’s time to wake up and re-build post - secondary education in an intelligent , caring and thoughtful manner .
The politician who leads the process of reform of post - secondary education for the 21st Century will join the pantheon of Canadian heroes .
NEXT TIME –
What does it feel like to be a professor or a student these days ?

Texas is reaching a crisis point , putting itself at risk of a civil rights lawsuit — or worse , a total meltdown of the criminal justice system — because it so severely shortchanges the system designed to ensure impoverished accused criminals get adequate legal representation , advocates told a Senate committee last week .
“ We are facing a real crossroads in indigent defense because of money , ” Jeff Blackburn , general counsel for the Texas Innocence Project , told members of the Senate Criminal Justice Committee .
“ The money in these counties is going to start running out . ”
Nine years ago , before Texas adopted the Fair Defense Act , the state was considered abysmal in legal circles when it came to providing representation for the poor .
Texas had more people in jail , more people on death row and executed more people than nearly any other state , but there was no mechanism to provide decent legal defense for the poor .
Proponents and critics of the current system agree that the situation has improved since 2001 , when lawmakers started requiring counties to implement minimum representation standards .
Thousands more poor defendants are getting attorneys now , and 91 counties are served in some capacity by a public defender system .
“ We have made such huge progress in that area that we ’re no longer the laughingstock of the nation , ” Tony Fabelo , director of research at the Council of State Governments Justice Center , told lawmakers .
It ’s better , but it ’s not good enough , advocates say .
“ It ’s just not as bad , ” Blackburn says .
While courts spent more than $ 186 million on indigent defense in 2009 , according to the Task Force on Indigent Defense , the state chipped in only $ 28 million — barely enough to meet the constitutional requirement to provide adequate legal representation , advocates say .
With state lawmakers looking at the possibility of an $ 18 billion budget hole next biennium , it 's highly unlikely that the Legislature will put any more money into indigent defense .
Advocates are clinging to the little money they already get , asking that leaders ensure the dollars are spent effectively .
And they ’re worried that as the economic troubles trickle down to local governments , some of the indigent programs could disappear altogether .
Before 2001 , there were a scant few public defender offices in Texas , and the ones that existed had no well - defined minimum operating standards and no state funding , Fabelo told the committee .
The Fair Defense
Act required counties to create systems to provide representation for the poor .
Counties can have judges assign attorneys from a list of lawyers , they can create public defender offices that employ attorneys to represent the poor , or they can create a system in which private attorneys contract with local courts to provide services .
Statewide , there are now 16 public defender offices that serve 91 counties .
Most counties , about 71 percent , allow judges to assign lawyers to indigent accused criminals , according to the Texas Fair Defense Project .
The Task Force on Indigent Defense gives counties money to help defray the increased cost of representing the poor .
Money for the program comes from a variety of court fees , which in 2009 generated about $ 31 million , according to the task force .
Most of the money is distributed based on population and on the amount of indigent representation the counties provide .
A smaller portion is meted out in grants for counties to start public defender programs .
Statewide , costs for representing the poor have nearly doubled since 2001 , when courts spent about $ 94.7 million .
By 2009 , the cost skyrocketed to $ 186.3 million , according to the task force .
Counties absorbed the biggest chunk of that cost .
The state paid just 15 percent of the total indigent representation costs last year .
That ’s a great improvement over the zero dollars Texas was putting in before , said Sharon Keller , chairwoman of the task force and presiding judge of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals , in testimony before the Senate committee .
Plus , she said , a structure that requires adequate representation for the poor now exists where none did previously .
“ We have raised the bar , ” she said .
But Keller and others at the task force agree the state ’s not doing enough .
“ What we ’re trying do is figure out how the state can share more of these responsibilities with local governments , ” Jim Bethke , executive director of the task force , told the committee .
But lawmakers said chances of that happening during the 2011 session , when estimates indicate the budget shortfall could be anywhere from $ 15 billion to $ 18 billion , are not good .
“ We ’re not going to get any more money from the state .
It ai n’t coming , ” says state Sen.
Rodney Ellis , D - Houston , author of the Fair Defense Act .
“ It ai n’t going to be easy to keep this $ 28 million . ”
What compounds the problem is that the state is n’t the only entity working on a shoestring budget .
County governments are feeling the pain of falling housing sales and property tax collections too .
David Slayton , director of court administration in Lubbock County , says costs for providing indigent representation there have doubled since 2001 , from $ 1.5 million to about $ 3 million .
The state picks up less than 5 percent of that cost .
But grant money from the task force is paying start - up costs for the county to develop a new regional public defender office to represent indigent defendants in capital cases in 70 West Texas counties .
Grant dollars are also helping the county launch a defender office for those with mental health problems .
“ One of the things that concerns me is just the true sustainability of these programs … from a funding perspective , ” Slayton says .
If the state funds give out , he says , the counties wo n’t be able to step in to keep the new courts on track .
“ It would jeopardize the ability of those programs to continue , ” Slayton says .
The question for the state and for criminal justice advocates , says Andrea Marsh , executive director of the Texas Fair Defense Project , is at what point the funding becomes so minimal that it is impossible to meet the constitutional obligation to provide adequate defense .
“ The counties are footing most of the bill , but … there are very real limitations to their ability to raise additional dollars , ” Marsh says .
The more the funding dwindles , the more the state is at risk of a lawsuit .
“ The situation in Texas is not that different from the situation in states that have seen litigation , ” she says .
In addition to funding questions , Marsh says , there are concerns about the fairness of the system .
The American Bar Association , in its best practices for public defense , recommends that lawyers for indigent defendants be chosen independently — not by the judge , as is the case in most Texas counties .
The association also calls for independent oversight of indigent defense lawyers and monitoring of their caseloads , neither of which regularly happen in Texas , Marsh says .
Another problem , she says , is that county courts appointed lawyers for defendants , on average , in just 13 percent to 22 percent of misdemeanor cases .
Montana was forced to overhaul its criminal defense system in 2005 after the American Civil Liberties Unions sued the state over a slew of representation shortcomings similar to the ones advocates identify in Texas .
Montana allowed poor defendants to spend months in jail before trial , according to the Chicago Tribune , and none of the accused in misdemeanor cases were appointed attorneys .
Lawyers for the indigent were unable to fully investigate cases because they did n’t have the funds .
Michigan is now in the middle of litigation over its criminal defender system , which the ACLU alleges is unconstitutional because it lacks state funding and oversight .
Texas lawmakers may not have the wherewithal this year to put any more funds into indigent defense , but Marsh says legislators might help ward off litigation by making changes to the program .
They should ensure the current funds are used effectively by requiring more oversight of the program , requiring independent selection of attorneys for the poor and giving counties incentives to implement public defender programs , she says .
Blackburn is less optimistic .
“ They ’re all trying to tinker with a system that is so fundamentally broken that no amount of tinkering is ever going to fix it , ” he says .
While he believes a complete overhaul of the indigent defense system is necessary , he says he ’s not hopeful litigation will prompt change in Texas .
What ’s needed , Blackburn says , is for lawmakers to take initiative to develop a new law that requires public defenders statewide have appropriate oversight , independence and funding .
In the current system , he says , counties have little incentive to ensure poor defendants get adequate legal representation .
If defendants in felony cases do n’t get good legal advice , they usually go to prison , where the state foots the bill .
If defendants in misdemeanor cases do n’t get lawyers , they usually plead guilty to charges that result in fines and fees that boost the county ’s bottom line .
As counties face more and more financial trouble , he worries local officials will begin relying on those fines and fees to generate revenue .
Without true reform , he says , the system is likely to eventually cause so much public backlash that lawmakers will either make changes or risk losing their jobs .
“ I do n’t see any real prospect for big reform until the true meaning of the current broken system seeps into the average person ’s consciousness , ” he says .
DAR ES SALAAM , Tanzania —
Say “ child trafficking , ” and you ’re likely to conjure up images of organized crime and international smuggling rings .
But sexual exploitation of children is often the result of more ordinary pressures : poverty , disease and social disintegration .
In Tanzania , where trafficking of poor girls from rural to urban areas is a serious problem , these are the complex social issues that anti-child trafficking workers are trying to disentangle .
Desperation and families broken by AIDS are often more dangerous enemies than gangsters , says one of the most prominent groups trying to end child exploitation in the country , the Kiota Women Health and Development Organization ( Kiwohede ) .
“ The rings of the pimps are not coordinated in this country , ” said Justa Mwaituka , Kiwohede ’s executive director .
That means individual trafficking rackets are relatively easy to break up .
The underlying causes , however , appear harder to root out .
Consider Fatuma ’s story .
A slight Tanzanian girl who looks much younger than her 16 years , Fatuma sat on a battered wooden chair wearing a T - shirt and skirt in a Kiwohede office in Dar es Salaam this January .
Through an interpreter , she told her tale .
Three years ago , Fatuma ( not her real name ) lost both her parents .
A poor orphan , she moved from the country to Dar es Salaam to live with an aunt , a small - time trader and single mother who made ends meet selling food on the streets .
The aunt already had two boys to feed — and to put through school .
So one day she came to Fatuma .
“ If a man wants you for sex , just agree , so we can get money for education , ” Fatuma recalls her aunt saying .
The girl , just 13 , accepted .
Before long , she had found a man willing to pay for sex .
But sometimes he only gave her $ 1 , so she needed more customers .
She started helping her aunt sell cassava on the street , and soon there were always men hanging around her stall .
That was what tipped off an outreach worker in the neighborhood — a girl who was already working with Kiwohede .
The girl tried to convince Fatuma to visit the center and find help .
It was n’t easy .
“ Kids are resilient , but they are protective of pimps , ” Mwaituka explained .
And superficially , some victims ’ circumstances improve , making an exit more difficult .
In Tanzania , a country with a mostly rural population , 96 percent of which lives on less than $ 2 a day , even a small sum can mean substantial differences in a poor person ’s life .
After being trafficked , a girl who had been barefoot in the village might have better clothes and a secondhand pair of shoes , disguising her suffering , Mwaituka said .
“ But mentally , they are tortured and traumatized . ”
Eventually , Fatuma relented and came into the center , where she received counseling , vocational training and remedial education .
She recently gained entrance to a top secondary school , which she ’ll attend with a scholarship .
“ When I heard about it , I cried because of joy , ” Fatuma said , cracking a smile .
Many exploited children in Tanzania are unluckier .
They end up in cities after traffickers trick their parents into handing them over , promising education or an improved life .
“ When they come to the city either they make the girl work or they give her to someone else , ” Mwaituka said .
Such girls can get disoriented and forget where they came from .
Often between 12 and 15 years old , if they are not pushed into sex work , they may be forced to work 16 hours a day without pay .
Mwaituka calls it “ completely traumatizing . ”
Kiwohede estimates it has rehabilitated some 40,000 exploited young people around Tanzania since it was founded in 1998 .
With its head office on a dusty , rutted road in the working - class Dar es Salaam neighborhood of Buguruni — some other centers throughout the country are also in slums or struggling neighborhoods — the group stays close to the communities it serves .
That ’s part of the strategy —
Kiwohede says that child exploitation is a problem of communities , not simply criminality .
So in addition to providing education , a safe haven , counseling and voluntary family reunification , Kiwohede has established “ community children ’s rights committees , ” composed of two children , authorities , religious leaders and businesspeople .
Other organizations that work with migrants praise Kiwohede ; in 2002 the International Labour Organization contracted the Tanzanian group to write a definitive report on child prostitution in Tanzania .
And Mwaituka says that activists have made headway .
But she also allows that there is much work to do .
For example , UNICEF says that stopping “ users ” — men — is crucial to ending exploitation .
In Tanzania , as elsewhere , Mwaituka said , many people do n’t see buying sex from a teenager as a serious crime .
“ Nobody sees the man as bad in sexuality , ” Mwaituka said .
“ This is the same all over the world . ”
Yes , according to Dugan , the lack of emphasis on science and engineering education in America has resulted in possible future manpower shortages for an agency that Dugan herself called " the nation 's elite army of futuristic technogeeks . "
Dugan said the coming shortage is pinching DARPA at both ends .
Over the 2000s , DARPA saw its funding cut by half , making it harder to recruit new scientists .
Simultaneously , US colleges graduated 43 percent fewer science and computing students , shrinking the pool of potential scientists for DARPA to choose from .
VOTERS , MOTIVATION , AND THE ‘ ENTHUSIASM GAP ’….
In the abstract , groups of voters are motivated by two forces , which are n’t mutually exclusive .
Voters can , for example , feel excited about supporting their preferred candidates because those candidates have performed well and delivered on key priorities / promises .
Voters can also feel motivated when they ’re disgusted by other party ’s candidates and agenda , and get engaged to prevent those rivals from succeeding .
This year , the Democratic Party really hopes that it can benefit from both .
On the one hand , they argue , Democratic policymakers have an impressive list of accomplishments , mirroring the platform they ran on — economic recovery , health care reform , Wall Street reform , student loan overhaul , withdrawing troops from Iraq , restoring the nation ’s global stature , advances on civil rights , Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , expanded stem - cell research , new regulation of the credit card industry , new regulation of the tobacco industry , a national service bill , the most sweeping land - protection act in 15 years , etc .
On the other hand , the Democratic argument goes , Republicans have moved sharply to the right , and generally act as if the GOP has gone stark raving mad .
It ’s a recipe for Democratic voter motivation , right ?
One might think so , but as Frank Rich notes in his column today , “ the enthusiasm gap remains real , ” and it benefits Republicans .
Tea Partiers will turn up at the polls , and not just in Kentucky .
Democrats are less energized in part because even now the president has not fully persuaded many liberal populists in his own party that he is on their side .
The suspicion lingers that a Wall Street recovery , not job creation , was his highest economic priority upon arriving at a White House staffed with Goldman alumni .
No matter how hard the administration tries to sell health care reform and financial reform as part of the nation ’s economic recovery , these signal achievements remain thin gruel for those out of work .
The unemployment numbers , unlikely to change drastically by November , will have more to say than any of Tuesday ’s results about what happens on Election Day this year .
Yes , the Tea Party is radical , its membership is not enormous , and its race problem is real and troubling .
But you ca n’t fight an impassioned opposition merely with legislative actions that may bear fruit in the semi- distant future .
If the Democrats ca n’t muster their own compelling response to the populist rage out there , “ Randslide ” may reside in our political vocabulary long after “ Arlen Specter ” is leaving “ Jeopardy ” contestants stumped .
That sounds about right .
Democrats have a reasonable pitch —
“ We ’ve delivered on a progressive agenda , and Republicans have become radical nutjobs ” — but the party is making it under difficult circumstances and repeating it to an angry electorate .
The midterms are less than six months away .
Whether Dems will use them wisely — sprinting to the finish line and generating excitment among Democratic voters — remains to be seen .

With just a few hours left in this apartment , and much yet to be packed , it ’s time to crack open the bottle of Dogfish Head ’s Theobroma beer that has been lingering in the fridge , futilely awaiting an occasion when my taste buds and typing fingers feel — simultaneously — ready to do it justice .
The beer is one of the Delaware brewery ‘s “ liquid time capsules ” : it was created in collaboration with biomolecular archaeologist Patrick McGovern who , according to his University of Pennsylvania webpage , is “ known as the ‘ Indiana Jones of Ancient Ales , Wines , and Extreme Beverages . ' ”
McGovern ’s enjoyable book , Uncorking the Past , begins with an amazing image : apparently , astronomers have used radio - waves to discover “ massive clouds ” of alcohol , “ measuring billions of kilometers across , ” scattered throughout interstellar space , “ surrounding new star systems . ”
While he hints at a thrilling future of human “ extraterrestrial ethanol ” exploitation , McGovern ’s primary interest is in the role alcohol played in ancient civilisation — and perhaps at the dawn of human life .
IMAGE : Colour - composite image of the Galactic Centre and Sagittarius B2 from the European Southern Observatory .
Sagittarius B2 is a vast cloud of interstellar particles including alcohol in the form of methanol , ethanol , and vinyl ethanol .
Thus , when McGovern read an article by anthropologist John Henderson in the Cornell alumni newsletter describing trace residues of an unidentified beverage on ancient Mesoamerican pottery fragments , his interest was piqued .
The jars and bowls in question dated back to 1400 B.C. , a time when Linear A was the popular alphabet of the Mediterranean , and Homer had yet to be born .
The vessels had been excavated from Puerto Escondido in modern - day Honduras , in an area called the Ulúa Valley , known ( according to records from the sixteenth century , when the Spanish invaded ) for its excellent cacao .
Henderson ’s theory was that the people of Puerto Escondido had been among the earliest to domesticate Theobroma cacao , and that the pottery fragments he had found might once have contained a “ frothy chocolate beverage . ”
A couple of email exchanges later , and Patrick McGovern was collaborating with John Henderson ( and chemist Jeffrey Hurst of chocolate giant Hershey Foods ) to analyse the drinking vessels .
As he reports in Uncorking the Past , “ Either John had an eye for picking out chocolate vessels or Puerto Escondido was awash in cacao .
Eleven of the thirteen pottery sherds tested positive for the fingerprint compound of cacao , theobromine . ”
In other words , McGovern ’s team had found the earliest known evidence for an “ unadulterated alcoholic beverage made from sweet cacao pulp ” — a ceremonial drink made from the fermented fruit that we now discard in favour of the chocolate - producing bean it surrounds .
IMAGE : A cacao pod , cut in half to show the beans and pulp , via .
Plain cacao alcohol is “ an abundant liquor of the smoothest taste , between sour and sweet , which is of the most refreshing coolness , ” according to early Spanish records quoted by McGovern .
Later , Mayans switched to using the bitter , chocolate beans as the base for an elite beverage whose flavour was usually “ improved ” with honey , maize , chilli , annatto , and vanilla .
It was apparently served with a thick head of foam , in vessels designed so that “ one had the option to inhale the foam or drink directly from the mouth of the vessel . ”
IMAGE : A chocolate - containing “ teapot ” from Puerto Escondido , photography by John S. Henderson .
According to McGovern , “ Conceivably , the awkward - looking teapots might have been used in an earlier period to create a foam by blowing air through the spout or stirring the beverage vigorously through the main opening .
As the foam rose through the spout , one had the option to inhale the foam or drink directly from the mouth of the vessel . ”
Not satisfied with simply gathering biomolecular evidence , McGovern then wondered what such a drink might have tasted like .
As he admits early on in his book , we can never be sure how close to reality any reconstruction is , since “ ancient fossils tell us nothing about the easily degradable sensory - organ tissues , ” and thus “ early hominids might have had much more acute senses than ours , like the macaque , which has exquisite sensitivity to alcohol and other smells . ”
Nonetheless , in a section of his book titled “ Theobroma for the Masses , ” McGovern describes his collaboration with Dogfish Head craft brewers Sam Calagione and Bryan Selders to create a beer based on the core ingredients of early New World alcohol : chocolate beans ( in nib form , as the cacao pods are too perishable to transport from Honduras to Delaware ) , honey , corn , ancho chillis , and annatto .
McGovern adds :
We might also have tossed in peppery “ ear flower ” or a hallucinogenic mushroom if they had been available .
The fermentation was carried out with a German ale yeast , which is not obtrusive and brings out the flavours of the other ingredients .
The result ?
Cloudy and quite strong ( 9 % A.B.V. ) , but more refreshing than you would think : the chocolate is savoury rather than sweet , and the chilli is just a very subtle , almost herbal , aftertaste .
There is almost no head , which is just as well , as I ’ve already packed my special froth - inhalation equipment , and so far , no ritual human sacrifice has been required ( that may change as the night wears on ) .
Seriously , though , I love the idea of speculative archaeo - brewing .
Of course , ancient flavours are undoubtedly completely lost to us today : the ingredients , our sensory receptors , and our palates have changed beyond recognition .
But trying to recreate long - lost beverages not only helps you form scenarios about how they might originally have been made , it also prompts you to think in interesting ways about ingredients , geography , and the evanescence of taste .
And it helps you avoid packing .

The mainstream press has just come out with a Chinese expose that has informed an undoubtedly surprised world that in 1969 the USSR wished to settle its historical score with China and launch a nuclear attack .
The USSR merely wanted an assurance of U.S. neutrality .
Far from the USA welcoming this de-clawing of the growing dragon , it instead threatened that there would be retaliation from the U.S. against Russia .
According to a report first carried in the Daily Telegraph , Chinese historian Liu Chenshan , writing in an officially sanctioned newspaper , stated that the threat “ came in 1969 at the height of a bitter border dispute between Moscow and Beijing that left more than one thousand people dead on both sides . ” [ 1 ]
Liu quotes Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin as stating to Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev on October 15 that “ Washington has drawn up ‘ detailed plans ’ for a nuclear war against the USSR if it attacked China . ”
The Telegraph writers also speculate that Liu is likely to have had access to official archives given the appearance of this as part of a series of six articles in an official news source .
The Telegraph article continues : “ The historian claims that Washington saw the USSR as a greater threat than China and wanted a strong China to counter - balance Soviet power … ”
They also conclude : “ Mr Liu , the author , admits his version of history is likely to be contested by rival scholars . ”
However , this Chinese revelation is not “ new ” to informed observers .
The Russian desire to settle with China , despite the cynically named Sino - Soviet Treaty of Friendship , Alliance and Mutual Assistance that had been signed between Mao Zedong and Joseph Stalin in 1950 – which relegated China to colonial status rather than pave the way to super - power status [ 2 ] – came amidst the culmination of border disputes that had been ongoing since 1960 .
[3 ]
The largest conflict had taken place on March 2 , 1969 , when Chinese troops ambushed Russian troops on the uninhabited Damansky Island in the Ussuri River , killing 32 Russians .
The Soviets responded on the night of March 14 by shelling 20 kilometers into China .
Approximately 60 Russians and 800 Chinese were killed in the conflict .
So extensive was the Russian attack that Mao feared a Soviet invasion .
It was then that the USSR intended to drive home their offensive with a nuclear attack .
Jung Chang and Jon Halliday , in their book Mao : The Unknown Story , allude to an article at the time published in a London newspaper “ by a KGB - linked Russian journalist Victor Louis ” , who had been Russian emissary to Taiwan , stating that the Kremlin was discussing bombing China ’s nuclear test site , and planning to set up an “ alterative leadership ” for the Chinese Communist party . [ 4 ]
Moreover it was U.S. President Richard Nixon ’s aide John Haldeman who seems to have first broken the nuclear attack story in his memoirs in 1978 .
[5 ]
He stated that for years the USSR had been trying to warn the USA not to allow China to become a nuclear power .
This claim by Haldeman seems to directly contradict the claim by Liu that Nixon , when responding to the 1969 Soviet request for neutrality , did so not only because he regarded China as a means of containing Russia , but also because he was still “ smarting from a Soviet refusal five years earlier to stage a joint attack on China ’s nascent nuclear programme . ” [ 6 ]
If we place this all into context , I believe that the 1978 Haldeman version is more likely than that of Liu ’s present contention .
If the USA had asked for support from the USSR to bomb China ’s nuclear programme in 1964 , this was a year following Sino - Russian border conflicts amounting to 4000 dead .
In 1960 , there had been 400 clashes ; in 1962 , 5000 .
[7 ]
The USSR would have no sentimental , comradely , ideological , diplomatic , or geo-political reasons to oppose such a US proposal and then change her mind five years later and make a similar suggestion to the USA .
The relationship between China , the USA , and the USSR is quite contrary to how it is generally perceived .
A more accurate scenario is that the USA backed Mao and the USSR backed Chiang Kai - shek .
Stalin , prior to Mao ’s assumption to power , regarded him as a Trotskyite .
While Stalin had previously backed Mao as a counter to a Trotskyite coterie in China headed by Prof .
Chen Tu-hsiu , Mao ’s onetime mentor , by 1938 , [8 ]
Mao was being denounced in the USSR as a Trotskyite . [ 9 ]
During World War II , while the USA was pushing Chiang to make an alliance with Mao against the Japanese , Stalin was counselling Chiang against this .
[ 10 ] Gen .
George Marshall warned Chiang in 1946 at a crucial time that if he persisted in pursuing the beleaguered Red Army into Northern Manchuria , U.S. aid would stop .
This provided Mao with a base from which to recuperate and finally defeat Chiang .
On the other hand , Stalin ’s aid to Mao was granted according to Russian interests as distinct from communist fraternity , one particularly dramatic example of which was the demand for repayment in food that resulted in 10,000 peasants dying of starvation in Yenan . [ 11 ]
This was a prelude to the debilitating Sino - Soviet Treaty that was to result in the “ Great Famine ” for the same reason . [ 12 ]
Mao thought that he could make China a great power on Stalin ’s coat tails .
This was a grave error .
While the USA attempted to court China , Mao went out of his way to act “ Bolshie ” towards the “ Paper Tiger , ” in a futile effort to court Stalin .
Chang and Halliday write : “ It was widely thought that it was the U.S. that refused to recognize Mao ’s China .
In fact , Mao went out of his way to make recognition impossible by engaging in overtly hostile acts . ” [ 13 ]
In 1979 , the year for the renewal of the 1950 “ friendship treaty ” between Russia and China , Mao gestured as to what he by then thought the fraternal relationship by invading Russia ’s ally Vietnam , which was particularly significant in that in 1978 the USSR had entered into a 25 year defence treaty with Vietnam . [ 14 ]
Given the historically strained ( at best ) relationship between China and Russia , even at a time when they were supposed to be ideologically aligned , what are likely future scenarios on the world stage ?
There seems to be a preponderant view that the USA and China will increasingly become rivals due to economical and raw material factors .
There is also a view that the USA and Russia will align against China .
Again turning to an article in the Daily Telegraph , there is an interesting item from 2009 .
This refers to the Russian ethnic population decline in the Russian Far East , in comparison to the burgeoning Chinese population across the border , coupled with the tremendous mineral resources of the area .
David Blair writes :
The endless silver birch forests of the Russian Far East might appear so desolate and windswept that no one could possibly be interested in them .
Yet the vast swath of territory between Lake Baikal and Vladivostok may become a new theatre of confrontation between Russia and China in the decades ahead .
For now , the two giant neighbours have been thrust together by their shared suspicion of America and they cooperate as tactical allies , working in the United Nations Security Council to contain Washington ’s power .
But this affinity is based on little more than having the same rival .
The empty lands of the Russian Far East , far closer to Beijing than Moscow , contain major sources of tension between the two powers .
Microsoft has filed a patent infringement actionagainst Salesforce.com .
The Register has posted more details .
The filing [ pdf ] lists nine counts of alleged infringement :
1. Method for mapping between logical data and physical data
2. System and method for providing and displaying a web page having an embedded menu
3. Method and system for stacking toolbars in a computer display
4. Automated web site creation using template driven generation of active server page applications
5. Aggregation of system settings into objects
6 . Timing and velocity control for displaying graphical information ( 2 counts )
7. Method and system for identifying and obtaining computer software from a remote computer
8. System and method for controlling access to data entities in a computer network
I make no comment on the legal validity of these claims .
On the broader issue though , Microsoft says this :
Microsoft has been a leader and innovator in the software industry for decades and continues to invest billions of dollars each year in bringing great software products and services to market .
We have a responsibility to our customers , partners , and shareholders to safeguard that investment , and therefore cannot stand idly by when others infringe our IP rights
My observation is that I have seen Salesforce.com shake up the industry by making its multi-tenant online application and platform work for its customers .
Although there are some parallels , the Salesforce.com platform is more radical than Microsoft Azure and has more potential to reduce costs , because it is based on a single shared application , rather than being a hosted platform for custom applications .
The differences are not absolute , because the Force.com platform also supports custom applications , and Microsoft also offers multi-tenanted applications , but if you look at the core propositions the distinction is valid .
Again , I have no idea what the legal outcome will be , but from a public relations perspective this does not look good for Microsoft .
It raises the question : is Microsoft litigating because it cannot succeed in the market ?
Small companies and patent trolls sue large companies because they have little to lose , and potentially a lot to gain .
Large companies show more restraint .
I have always assumed that there are thousands of plausible patent infringements among the largest technology companies , and that the industry would descend into a kind of litigation meltdown if all of them were pursued , to nobody ’s benefit other than lawyers .
The question then : why is Microsoft going after Salesforce.com now ?
Olumide Fadayomi , 27 - year old medical student , was cleared of rape by the jury in Sheffield UK within 45 minutes as “ evidence did not , and was never going to prove , rape “ .
Interestingly , 18 - months ago same woman had falsely accused another man of rape who committed suicide while facing the allegations .
“ I was in Static having a drink of champagne .
I was on my own by the side of the bar , and this particular girl came up to me , and bumped another girl out of the way .
“ She told me she liked me , and liked my perfume .
We were exchanging pleasantries , and exchanging numbers , and she said she would n’t mind having me that night . ”
Olumide says they left the club together and got into a taxi to return to her house , on the outskirts of Sheffield .
He recalled : “ I said I would call her tomorrow and she said , ‘ So you ’re going to leave me now ? ’. ”
Instead she agreed to return to Lister Road with him .
“ We got home , and I offered her chicken wings and a fizzy drink but she did n’t want them .
“ She asked for the toilet and I went into my bedroom .
She came into my bedroom and held me , and we started kissing .
It was a proper romance .
“ Afterwards we were lying on the bed and she received several phone calls .
“ During those phone calls I sensed maybe there was a plan between her and her friend . ”
Olumide said he left the bedroom , and returned a few minutes later to find the woman still talking on the phone .
“ She got dressed , and I gave her £ 8 for the taxi .
She pecked me and hugged me .
” Source : www.sheffieldtelegraph.co.uk
Olumide also claimed that he had thought of committing suicide .
He said : ‘ My life has been hell for the last seven months .
I thought about taking my own life .
‘ I ’ve not been able to sleep properly since all this happened .
Some of my friends shunned me and my parents in Nigeria were heartbroken and scared of what might happen to me .
‘ After the trial I slept properly for the first time .
Now I am starting my life all over again ‘ My life has just been on hold .
I found out that the woman had accused another man of rape and that he had killed himself 18 months before .
‘ This woman needs proper counselling .
This kind of allegation could drive other young men to suicide . ’
Source : www.dailymail.co.uk
Olumide had moved to the UK from Akure in Nigeria in 2007 .
For the last 35 years , alleged rape victims remain anonymous , whereas the men accused of rape are not .
This seems like a perfect law for real victims but is horrible for women falsely accusing someone of the heinous crime .
I can only imagine the pain and suffering that Olumide and his family during the allegation .
I think that the woman should first go through a psychiatric exam and if found sane – charged and convicted , so that she cannot falsely accuse anyone ever again !
Maps tell us so much more than how to get from A to B , or where C is in relation to D .
They can be tools of power and snapshots of history , and reveal the fears and prejudices of their age , says historian Jerry Brotton .
A remarkable thing about maps is people 's resistance to the most basic fact of mapmaking - they can never be completely objective , accurate images of our world .
Talk to any mapmaker and they will tell you that the mathematics of mapping the globe onto a flat piece of paper mean that some form of distortion , manipulation and selection will always occur because , to put it simply , you cannot square the circle .
But for most people who use maps in their everyday lives - on sat navs , phones , online map applications , even the good old - fashioned Ordnance Survey - the idea that maps are partial , selective images of the world is extremely unsettling .
Maps can be used to challenge history Almost unconsciously we expect maps to help us move around the world , whether getting to Tokyo or just finding the way to the nearest Italian restaurant .
They give us a feeling of security that the big , wide world is somehow manageable and navigable .
But throughout history , maps have usually been more interested in providing people with that basic sense of security , before trying to get them from A to B .
Each society tends to get the world map they deserve , one which manages to summarise and define a particular society 's hopes and fears , prejudices and beliefs .
Throughout time , different cultures produced radically different images of the world .
None of them could be labelled " right " or " wrong " , they all simply reflected a culture 's preoccupations .
FIND OUT MORE BBC Four 's Maps : Power , Plunder and Possession will be repeated on 4,6 and 7 May And is also on the iPlayer As is BBC Four 's The Beauty of Maps A map of China called the Yujitu was made in 1136 .
It was carved on stone and stood in a Chinese schoolyard to instruct bureaucrats to learn about Chinese geography and history .
To our modern eyes it looks remarkably modern and accurate - the outline of China is quite clear , and there seems to be a grid showing latitude , longitude and scale .
But you quickly discovered the map made some basic errors .
The course of the Yellow River was wrong , and another river , the Heishui , apparently did n't even exist .
But the river did exist in a book called the Yugong , the story of a mythical Chinese ruler called Yu , who saved China from Noah - like floods in the 21st Century BC .
The map 's title , Yujitu , translates as " Map of the tracks of Yu " .
In other words , it is a map designed to follow the mythical text , even when it knew the Yugong was inaccurate .
Geographical realism gave way to a mythical story of the foundation of China , which was more important to the scholars and teachers who used the map than the exact location of a particular river 's course - especially as most people who saw the map would never travel far enough to see the river .
South at top
West of China at about the same time , Christian and Muslim scholars were creating very different maps of the whole world .
They also conformed to their particular theological beliefs , rather than the pursuit of cartographic accuracy .
The world is round .
Maps are flat Just as the Yujitu was being made , the Muslim mapmaker Muhammad al - Idrisi was working on his own world map in Sicily .
The result showed the earth with south at the top , because for Idrisi , Mecca and the Arabian Peninsula was now the symbolic centre of the world .
Around his map 's edges is a Koranic inscription that suggests this is a world made in Allah 's image .
Just over a century later , Christian world maps like the Hereford mappamundi rotated the world 90 degrees , to put east at the top .
On the Hereford map , the sacred city of Jerusalem lies at the heart of the map , with the Garden of Eden in Asia sitting at the top of the map , with Christ looking down from the map 's frame .
Both these maps were telling believers to think of the life beyond the earthly one .
The results were very different , but they made sense according to the specific theology of the two religions .
In the West , maps continued to reflect particular cultural preoccupations , even when they ostensibly claimed to be about scientific accuracy and navigating from A to B .
The infamous Mercator Projection of 1569 distorts the world at the north and south poles , to ensure navigational accuracy when sailing east to west .
The Henricus Martellus World Map dates from 1489
This was the most important issue for merchants and statesmen following the establishment of the sea routes to India and the new world of America in the late 15th Century .
Even today , Google Earth manipulates the first image of the earth that you see when you log on .
But is it any surprise ?
How can you show a three - dimensional globe on a two - dimensional computer screen without choosing a projection that mimics how we imagine we see the earth from space ?
All of this might sound unsettling , but we should see this as an opportunity - not an anxiety .
As online mapping increasingly pervades our everyday lives , we need to be a bit sceptical about how maps are being used to shape our behaviour .
In the past they wanted us to accept a particular religion , or embrace a specific political ideology .
Today they are more likely to be encouraging us to buy things as we zoom virtually around the globe .
But that does n't mean they 're any less powerful , or selective , than they 've ever been .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I maintain a very large digital map for a telecoms company by using and referencing information from many " accurate " sources including original drawings , GPS maps , state produced online maps , and websites such as Google maps .
Almost every thing on this map is a compromise of differences between all the different sources of information .
For practical purposes everything is where it is suppose to be , but geographically no map will ever be precise .
Simon Davies , Jacksonville , FL , US ( ex - pat Brit )
We all rely on the accuracy of maps but you should remember that maps are drawn with deliberate errors to protect the authors copyright if someone copies them without permission .
The series ' Tales from the Map Room ' showed some examples including a village in Wiltshire that did not exist but could be traced through copied maps for several hundred years .
Other examples are the wriggles in the OS copy of the map of Basingstoke that caught the AA out and an error in the A - Z that was " discovered " & corrected on a TV series .
John Murrell , Carshalton
Surely it 's pushing it to say there 's no " right " and " wrong " where maps are concerned , if by right we mean , as rational people would , the most accurate representation we can manage of the objective truth of the world around us .
Deliberate misrepresentation takes you beyond mapmaking into mythmaking - and gives you a map that is objectively wrong .
Robert Bargery , London UK
Maps also have historical shown the effects of physical barriers on an age before the coming of steam power , flight etc .
I remember a particular map of Great Britian from around the 12th - 13th Century from an English chronicle , that showed Scotland as much smaller county .
Not only that the south of the vast " Sea of Scotland " was much bigger than the mountainous north .
Their was only one bridge across the " Sea " .
The " Sea of Scotland " was in fact only the River Forth and the Bridge was at Stirling , but with out modern travel it may as well have been a Sea .
The small size of the North was mainly because vast tracts had obviously not been visited regularly from our friends from the South ( unlike now !!!! ) .
Neil Wilkie , Perth
The thing I find most fascinating about ancient maps are the areas of the old maps drawn completely differently from how they would be today .
If you look at the Henricus Martellus map Africa and the peninsula where Thailand etc are are greatly over - exaggerated towards the south .
I wonder if this came from explorers going on expeditions to these areas and finding seemingly never - ending desert , forest or bush land .
Andrew , Glasgow I bet we 've all seen maps from the US that start on the International Date Line and go round the world eastwards to the Polish border , missing out the USSR completely .
Eric Hall , Pionsat , France
It is true that choices have to be made to display a globe on a flat surface , provided these are explicitly stated and adhered to this does not mean that the map is not objectively correct .
This is not the same as saying that the size of a landmass should be determined by the population living there ( or some other social criteria ) .
What you then have is a graphical representation of the social data , not a map .
Michael Barnes , Milton Keynes , UK
It 's funny that I 've also been thinking about maps recently .
This article summarised the reason for the existence of so many different maps throughout the world over time .
I realised that the intellectual knowledge , progress and mindset of a particular society in a given time could be seen by the maps they produce ( therefore also parts of its history ) .
The examples given above provide for excellent support .
Clara Wanatirta
With advances in 3D rendering , it will be interesting to see how this plays into our reading of maps - it may not be long before we do not have to flatten our maps , but rather observe them in their full beauty .
Ai You , Oxford , United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland " Just over a century later , Christian world maps like the Hereford mappamundi rotated the world 90 degrees , to put east at the top .
On the Hereford map , the sacred city of Jerusalem lies at the heart of the map , with the Garden of Eden in Asia sitting at the top of the map , with Christ looking down from the map 's frame . "
Are you sure that this was a " Christian " thing , rather than European ?
This type of map has been described by many as " sunwise " , marking the rising of the sun as the first key point of navigation .
The Scottish Gaelic for south is to this day the same as the word for right - " deas " - and the word for clockwise ( which is " sunwise " if your clock is a sundial ) is derived from this - " deiseil " , literal rightward , as the sun travels to the observer 's right to pass through the south of the sky .
" Deiseil " also happens to mean " ready " , which underscores the importance that the sun had in Celtic culture .
Furthermore , prehistoric monuments - the most ancient " maps " in Europe - are aligned to the sunrise and sunset at the solstices and the equinoxes .
Before the invention of the magnetic compass , north - south alignment would only have been easy to measure against a firmly established east - west reference line .
There is a great deal of sociological information in maps , but this article overextends that .
The sunwise map , based on the position of sunrise as the primary reference , is the oldest and most natural way of describing the world .
There is nothing more to it than that .
Níall , Edinburgh , Scotland Even Google Earth in the 21st Century includes non-existent bodies of water !
Do a search for " Bervie Water " , near where I live , and check the map ( which shows water ... ) and the satellite ( which does n't ... ) .
Alan Marson , Aberdeen , Scotland Years ago I can remember seeing an East German world map .
It looked very similar to the maps I was used to , it was only when I looked at it I noticed that it did n't have the East / West German border and there were other subtle differences , such as the Falklands being called the Malvinas .
Maps do n't just represent geography , they also represent political ideas .
Nick I have noticed that an increasing reliance on sat-nav is reducing people 's use of maps and their consequent spatial awareness .
Many are unaware of where they have been en route and how these places relate to one another .
This is bad news and will result in large numbers of people losing an important ability developed over thousands of years .
As an analogy look at how technology has reduced many people 's ability to handle numbers and their relationship to one another .
When an error is made on the calculator or PC they simply fail to spot it as their arithmetic perception is so poor .
John Stratford , Chester , UK
It 's only since World War II that people have become as mobile , as Mr Stratford imagines .
Throughout those " thousands of years " millions of people hardly travelled from the parish where they were born .
That 's how it will be again , once fossil fuels run out .

Another look at incremental and iterative development
Pascal Van Cauwenberghe
� T was brillig , and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
From Jabberwocky
" Through The Looking Glass " � Lewis Carrol
Introduction
Surprisingly many people still wonder what�s wrong with the safe and predictable sequential phased approach , also known as " waterfall " .
This despite the fact that since many years , a lot has been written about iterative and incremental development .
Still , most people involved in software could not give you a clear definition of what those two words mean to them .
When they are able to give a definition , they often contradict each other .
Into this confused world , the proponents of " Agile Development " and especially Extreme Programming proclaim that they go beyond " traditional " iterative and incremental development methods .
What are we to do ?
How do we approach software projects ?
How do we reach our targets reliably , quickly and efficiently ?
When do we gyre , when do we gimble ?
Defining our terms
" When I use a word " , Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone , " it means just what I choose it to mean � neither more nor less " .
" Through The Looking Glass " � Lewis Carrol
We must first choose what we want our terms to mean .
A phase = a period in which some clearly defined task is performed .
Just imagine we require the following phases : Analysis , Design , Coding , Testing and Integration & Deployment .
Each phase has some inputs and some outputs .
To iterate = to perform some task in multiple passes .
Each pass improves the result , until the result is " finished " .
Also called " rework " .
An iteration = a period in which a number of predefined tasks are performed .
The results are evaluated to feed back to the next iteration .
An increment = a period after which some part of functionality is completed to production quality level .
A release = some coherent set of completed functionalities that is useful and useable to the intended users of the system .
With these definitions we can have a look at different ways to organize a software project .
Different ways to plan a project
The waterfall � straight to the target
The sequential , phased approach , better known as " Waterfall " is the simplest and potentially fastest approach : we analyze the problem , design the solution , implement the code , test the code ( are we allowed to fix the coding bugs ? ) , integrate if necessary and deploy .
Done .
The attraction of this process model is its simplicity : you do each of the steps and then you �re done .
If you want to know how long it takes , just add up the time required for each phase .
These times are just estimates , so your total is also an estimate .
But it makes following up on the project�s schedule easier .
Once , for example , analysis and design are done , they are done .
The simplicity of this model attracts two kinds of people :
Remote stakeholders like upper level managers or end -users who have no need to know the exact process .
They really just want to know when the outputs will be delivered .
Teachers and educators who need to present a simplified model of a process as a first , simplified introduction to the subject .
Unfortunately , it is this first approximation that sticks in the minds .
Or do students skip all the following lectures ?
The spiral � iterate to incorporate feedback
Of course , it�s never as simple as the waterfall process suggests : we do make errors during analysis and design .
When Walker Royce originally described his process , there were feedback loops back to analysis and design .
They were quickly " simplified " away .
So , this was the original phased , iterative approach :
Perform analysis , until you think you are ready
Design , until you think you are ready .
Should you find any problems in the analysis , feed them back to the analysis .
Perform another iteration of the analysis , to improve it .
Code the design , until ready .
Should you find any problems in the design , feed them back .
Perform another iteration of the design , to improve it .
Test the code .
Should you find any problems , start another iteration of the coding .
Integrate and deploy .
Feed back up any problems you encounter .
In short : you go sequentially through the phases .
Some phases have more than one iteration , if we see that the output of that phase is not perfect .
In more than one sense , the waterfall is de optimist�s interpretation of the spiral model .
As Boehm noted , the later a defect is caught , the higher the cost to fix it .
We are therefore encouraged to only proceed cautiously to the next phase if the previous phase is relatively complete .
As software engineers have noted , the likelihood of finding defects becomes higher as we come to the later phases .
This is because each phase delivers a more precise , more " testable " output that the previous phases .
There is one management problem with the spiral model : how do you schedule the iterations ?
How many iterations will be needed ?
This makes estimating and tracking the project�s progress more difficult and unpredictable .
Iterative development � getting better all the time
Where the spiral process views feedback and iteration as exceptional events , iterative development assumes we will make mistakes , we will need feedback , we will need several iterations before we get it right .
In iterative , phased development we design our project plan around the idea of iterations and fit the phases in them .
For example , we can plan to have five iterations :
In the first iteration we will do 90 % analysis , 10 % design
In the second iteration we will do 30 % analysis , 50 % design , 20 % coding
In the third iteration we will do 10 % analysis , 30 % design , 70 % coding
In the fourth iteration we will do 10 % design , 50 % coding , 40 % testing and bug fixing
In the fifth iteration we will do 50 % testing and bug fixing , 30 % integration , 20 % deployment .
This process takes into account the reality that we almost never get anything completely right the first time .
At first , we will get a lot of feedback .
Gradually , with each iteration , the output from each phase stabilizes and we need to do less rework .
Iterative development with incremental delivery - growing software
One complaint we could have with the previous process , is that it takes so long to see the result of the work .
Indeed , the software is n�t ready until the absolute end of the project .
What if we need the results faster ?
We could use iterative development with incremental delivery , a variation on the previous process .
The basic idea is to release the software several times to its users , each time with more functionality .
Each release is complete , useable and useful to its users .
Each release adds more functionality , preferably the most important functionality first .
How do we schedule our project ?
First , we go through several iterations of analysis and design , until we are pretty sure these phases are mostly complete .
We can then select the content and schedule of the increments to be developed .
Let �s say we have identified three increments A , B and C , to be delivered in this order to the users .
For increment A , we iterate through all required phases , until the software can be released .
We expect to rework the analysis and design very little .
For increment B , we iterate through all required phases , until the software can be released .
We expect almost no analysis or design work .
For increment C , we iterate through all required phases , until the software can be released .
We expect almost no analysis or design work .
We can picture this process as four applications of the above process .
The amount of analysis and ( architectural ) design decreases in each step .
The process delivers functionality after the second , third and fourth steps .
How do we select the contents of the increments ?
Architecture - driven processes would select the elements that have the most impact on the architecture ( and thus the design ) .
Risk - driven processes would select the most risky elements .
Users would prefer the most useful or urgent functionalities .
Agile software development �
Extremely incremental
Agile software methods like " Extreme Programming " take another approach , based on the following assumptions :
You should welcome feedback and rework , in stead of trying to avoid it
You should deliver software to your users in small increments and deliver functionalities in the order that the users want .
The development process is then scheduled as follows :
Decide on the length of incremental releases .
All increments are the same length .
Decide , if necessary , which ones will be " internal releases " , only used internally for evaluation and feedback , and " external releases " , which are released to the end - users .
Gather an initial list of requirements .
New requirements can be added at any time .
Before the start of each increment : users ( or their representative ) prioritize the requirements and assign the requirements to releases .
As many releases as required can be planned , but typically the contents of all releases , except the one being implemented , are subject to change .
During the increment , the requirements are analyzed and broken down into small micro-increments .
These increments are small enough to be fully implemented in a day or less .
To implement a micro-increment , the developers analyze , design code , test , integrate and deploy iteratively .
They iterate very quickly , so as to get as much as possible concrete feedback to guide their work .
Each increment has a fixed length .
If needed , scope is reduced ( by the user ) to meet the target date .
What �s so extreme in " Extreme Programming " ?
What �s the difference between Extreme Programming style planning and iterative development with incremental delivery , such as is possible with the well - known and accepted " Unified Process " framework ?
The assumption that you can do architecture and design incrementally .
Indeed , XP spends very little time upfront to define an architecture and overall design .
Instead , we immediately start with the first increment to deliver functionality .
All architecture and design work is done to satisfy the requirements of the current increment .
XP does design in the following ways :
A System Metaphor describes an overall architecture and vocabulary that all participants understand and agree with .
The Metaphor is refined iteratively over the whole project .
describes an overall architecture and vocabulary that all participants understand and agree with .
The Metaphor is refined iteratively over the whole project .
Test - First
programming designs the code incrementally by defining executable tests that the program unit must comply with .
Refactoring
reworks the design to iteratively adapt the design to changing knowledge , environment or requirements .
Whiteboard design sessions , CRC card sessions � and other group design techniques .
The even more controversial assumption that you can do analysis incrementally .
At the start of each increment , we only examine the requirements that have been scheduled for this increment .
XP does analysis in the following ways :
Brief requirements , called Stories , are elaborated interactively between the development team and the story author .
, are elaborated interactively between the development team and the story author .
Requirements are formalized into executable " Acceptance " tests , which specify and verify the compliance of the software with the requirement .
" tests , which specify and verify the compliance of the software with the requirement .
Requirements are allocated to releases using the Planning Game , where developers and customers optimize delivered value versus development cost .
The assumption that you can deliver software features incrementally , in whatever order yields most benefit for the customer .
If the software can be delivered incrementally , the users will get the benefit of the functionality sooner and thus get a faster return on their investment .
As the customers can choose the delivery order , they receive the most important and valuable features first .
The use of these increments generates lots of valuable feedback to drive the following increments .
What �s the best way to plan a project ?
The short answer : it depends .
It depends on your project , your team , and your environment .
If the assumptions of XP hold , we can gain a lot of benefits from working incrementally :
Early delivery of useful software .
Delivery of functionality based on the value users give to that functionality ( business value driven instead of architecture or risk driven ) .
Clear , tangible feedback on progress : each increment delivers finished , production quality functionalities .
functionalities .
Clear and regular feedback on the quality and fit of the software from the users to the development team .
The ability to adapt the project plan .
Clear scheduling and predictable delivery
The development of the simplest possible system that satisfies the requirements , without any unnecessary adornments and complexity .
What are the dangers of this approach ?
By only looking at small pieces ( increments ) of the software , we may have to do massive rework , which might have been avoided if we analyzed or designed the whole system correctly .
have been avoided if we analyzed or designed the whole system correctly .
We might " paint ourselves in a corner " : get a system which is incapable of supporting some new requirement .
We may be unable to add " global " requirements , such as globalization , performance , and security �
A typical example is trying to retrofit " security " to an application that was not designed with this requirement in mind .
We might go slower because we have to restart analysis and design sessions for each increment , instead of doing it once at the start of the project .
So , it �s not so easy to define how we should organize our projects .
A few heuristics
If your requirements are volatile or incomplete , if the environment changes or if you wish to be able to anticipate to future events , work incrementally .
If the requirements and environment are stable , you can optimize your process by looking at all the requirements upfront .
When we use an investment analogy , we can compare agile scheduling with options , where we pay a small investment to be able to postpone our buying / selling decisions , versus shares , where we make the full investment upfront .
The potential gains from shares are higher ( because we don�t pay the price of the option ) , but the risk is also higher .
If you are not familiar with the domain , haven�t built any similar architecture , work incrementally .
Use the feedback to design your system and to avoid unnecessary complexity .
If you �ve done lots of similar systems , you can do more upfront .
Still , you can always use the feedback to keep your system simple .
If you can�t deliver incrementally , don�t deliver incrementally .
But , even if you can�t deliver incrementally to your final user , you might deliver incrementally to internal users , such as QA , product managers �
And even if you can�t do that , deliver incrementally within your team .
That way you can still get the benefit of early feedback .
If you know a requirement is going to be more difficult to work on if you only tackle it later , work on it now .
This can happen with " global " properties of software systems like localization , scalability , and security .
You can still get the benefit of business value driven scheduling for most requirements if you take those few exceptions into account : " Did you want security with that , Sir ?
With security , this feature will cost you X. Without , it will cost you Y .
If you wish to add security later , it will cost you Z. "
Iterative ( re ) design techniques like refactoring and the emphasis on simplicity does help to keep your software " soft " , more malleable , more accepting of changes .
If your team is big , do enough work upfront with a small team so that you can decompose the work on the system on the basis of a reasonable ( but not perfect or final ) architecture .
My approach
I prefer to err on the side of doing too little work upfront , rather than too much .
That �s because I�ve learned some things by applying Agile processes :
If you use simple designs and keep them simple by refactoring you can keep your software so changeable that you can accept most requirements without much trouble .
On a well - functioning XP team it feels as if you could go on forever adding features , if only the users could keep coming up with them .
If you are afraid to change something , because you fear the refactoring will be a lot of work and break things , do it often .
For example , in my team we�ve learned to do database refactorings often , updating our schema every few days , with a minimum of work and without our users noticing .
No matter how well you know the domain or the architecture , you will learn new insights from feedback .
The most important thing I�ve learned is to write code that is a lot simpler than it used to be .
Customers are uneasy with the apparently complex or chaotic scheduling of iterative and incremental processes .
They much prefer the safety and simplicity of a waterfall process .
If you can involve them and have intermediate incremental deliveries , within the overall " waterfall " , they quickly appreciate the feedback and steering power that you give them .
And they will never work any other way again .
Keep your team as small as possible .
A smaller the team requires less communication overhead , less upfront planning and decomposition and gives more agility to respond to changes .
The assumptions of XP might not hold completely , but often it�s close enough .
For example we can assume that most requirements can be analysed , planned and implemented relatively independently so that users are free to schedule them as they see fit .
We can handle those exceptions , where there are dependencies or risks , appropriately , so that we have the best possible schedule from both a functional and technical standpoint .
Conclusion
Incremental software development , with short increments , is a very useful technique to reduce project risk and to deliver value faster to users .
Each release provides opportunities for useful feedback and replanning , so that the final product meets the users� real requirements .
The project is at its most " agile " when we consider only one increment at a time .
We must balance this with some forward - looking actions , to avoid some pitfalls and to go faster .
We can plan and implement several increments or perform some upfront analysis and design before starting the increments .
When shouldn�t we work completely incrementally ?
When we have a lot of knowledge and experience in the domain , the architecture and the environment .
We can " invest " our knowledge to enable us to take the " best road " to our destination .
We think the cost of implementing the requirement will go up sharply as the project progresses .
There are a few heuristics and you should discover more .
You must choose the right combinations , based on your experience , your environment , and your task .
And you must always be ready to learn from feedback and to adapt your plan and your process accordingly .

In Too Big To Save Robert Pozen gives a clever example , based on an excellent paper by Coval , Jurek and Stafford , which explains both the lure of structured finance and why the model exploded so quickly .
Suppose we have 100 mortgages that pay $ 1 or $ 0 .
The probability of default is 0.05 ( assume independence ) .
We pool the mortgages and then prioritize them into tranches such that tranche 1 pays out $ 1 if no mortgage defaults and $ 0 otherwise , tranche 2 pays out $ 1 if 1 or fewer mortgages defaults , $ 0 otherwise .
Tranche 10 then pays out $ 1 if 9 or fewer mortgages default and $ 0 otherwise .
Tranche 10 has a probability of defaulting of 2.82 percent .
A fortiori tranches 11 and higher all have lower probabilities of defaulting .
Thus , we have transformed 100 securities each with a default of 5 % into 9 with probabilities of default greater than 5 % and 91 with probabilities of default less than 5 % .
Now let 's try this trick again .
Suppose we take 100 of these type - 10 tranches and suppose we now pool and prioritize these into tranches creating 100 new securities .
Now tranche 10 of what is in effect a CDO will have a probability of default of just 0.05 percent , i.e. p=.000543895 to be exact .
We have now created some " super safe , " securities which can be very profitable if there are a lot of investors demanding triple AAA .
To review we have assumed that the underlying mortgages each have a probability
of default of p=.05 and by pooling and prioritizing we have created a tranche with a probability of
default of just p=.0282 and a CDO with a probability of default of
p=.0005 .
In this way , structured finance was able to create many triple AAA securities from a pool of securities none of which were triple AAA .
This point is widely understood .
Now here is a much less well understood consequence .
Suppose that we misspecified the underlying probability of mortgage default and we later discover the true probability is not .05 but .06 .
In terms of our original mortgages the true default rate is 20 percent higher than we thought–not good but not deadly either .
However , with this small error , the probability of default in the 10 tranche jumps from p=.0282 to p=.0775 , a 175 % increase .
Moreover , the probability of default of the CDO jumps from p=.0005 to p=.247 , a 45,000 % increase !
The dark magic of structured finance conjured many low - risk securities
out of many risky securities .
Like all dark magic , however , the
conjuring came at a price because if you did n't get the spell exactly
correct it was easy to create something much more risky and dangerous
than you were likely to have ever imagined .
Here is an excel file , Structured FinanceMath , with the calculations .
Addendum : Adding in correlation among mortgage defaults makes the math more difficult but does n't change the bottom line that I wanted to illustrate which is that small changes in the underling default risk ( or correlation ) are highly amplified in the tranches and CDOs .

As the world 's population grows , competition for food , water and energy will increase .
Food prices will rise , more people will go hungry , and migrants will flee the worst - affected regions .
PERFECT STORM 2030 BBC correspondents explore the forecast by UK chief scientist John Beddington , of a " perfect storm " of food , water and energy shortages in 2030 .
They also consider what scientists and members of the public can do to help avert a crisis .
Send us your comments
That 's the simple idea at the heart of the warning from John Beddington , the UK government 's chief scientific adviser , of a possible crisis in 2030 .
Specifically , he points to research indicating that by 2030 " a whole series of events come together " :
The world 's population will rise from 6bn to 8bn ( 33 % )
Demand for food will increase by 50 %
Demand for water will increase by 30 %
Demand for energy will increase by 50 %
He foresees each problem combining to create a " perfect storm " in which the whole is bigger , and more serious , than the sum of its parts .

" Can we cope with the demands in the future on water ?
Can we provide enough energy ?
Can we do it , all that , while mitigating and adapting to climate change ?
And can we do all that in 21 years ' time ? " he asked the SDUK 09 conference in London , in March .
Some of the problems reinforce each other , in obvious ways .
For example , intensive agriculture swallows up large amounts of water and energy .
But Professor Beddington also points to other complicating factors and worrying possibilities .
CLIMATE CHANGE WATER SCARCITY
See where water will be scarce
There is a risk that climate change will have drastic effects on food production - for example by killing off the coral reefs ( which about 1bn people depend on as a source of protein ) or by either weakening or strengthening monsoon rains .
Also , some scientists are predicting that the Arctic will be ice - free by 2030 , he points out , which could accelerate global warming by reducing the amount of the sun 's energy that is reflected back out of the atmosphere .
URBANISATION
Not only is the world 's population predicted to grow ( until the middle of the century , at least ) but more people are moving to live in cities , Professor Beddington points out .
The growth of cities will accelerate the depletion of water resources , which in turn may drive more country dwellers to leave the land .
INCREASING PROSPERITY
As people become wealthier in some parts of the world , such as China and India , their diets are changing .
They are consuming more meat and dairy products , which take more energy to produce than traditional vegetable diets .
Like city dwellers , prosperous people also use more energy to maintain their lifestyle .
BIOFUELS
The more land is devoted to growing biofuels , in response to climate change , the less can be used for growing food .

Professor Beddington says he is optimistic that scientists can come up with solutions to the problems and that he is encouraged by signs that politicians are listening more to scientific advice .
But he adds : " We need investment in science and technology , and all the other ways of treating very seriously these major problems .
2030 is not very far away . "
Here three experts give their view of Professor Beddington 's warning .
PROFESSOR DAVID PINK , WARWICK UNIVERSITY
" It 's definitely one scenario , though it 's the worst possible scenario .
In general terms , he is right .
All these things are coming together .
There is some argument over population growth but the bottom line is that it 's going up and food supply is going to be more of a problem .
The developing world is growing , and its people are getting richer .
There will be more demand for foods we have automatically assumed we will have access to .
We are not going to be able to buy in everything we need and the price of food will go up .
John Beddington is making the argument that we need to do something now and the best way to make that argument is to give the worst - case scenario .
It is going to become a problem feeding the world , the question is how big a problem . "
PROFESSOR JULES PRETTY , ESSEX UNIVERSITY
" The general premise , that we have a number of critical drivers coming together , is correct .
The date 2030 is rhetorical .
We do n't know whether things will become critical in 2027 or 2047 , no - one has any idea , but within the next generation these things are going to come to pass unless we start doing things differently .
That is the urgency of this set of ideas .
When governments talk about reducing emissions by X % by 2050 , I despair .
We need to do it by next week .
Humankind has not faced this set of combined challenges ever before . "
ANTONY FROGGATT , SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW , CHATHAM HOUSE
" It 's true that all these things , and more , are interconnected .
I study the connection between climate change and security of energy supply .
For example , if you switch from coal to gas to slow the pace of climate change , the energy supply crunch comes more quickly .
John Beddington is right to underline the dependence of agriculture on energy - I 've heard it said that one in four people in the world is fed on fossil fuel , because gas is fundamental to the production of fertilisers .
Climate change also has implications for power stations - nuclear power stations that are cooled by rivers and hydroelectric dams .
And whereas changes in Europe could be incremental , in Asia it 's potentially more abrupt .
Whole regions are dependent on cycles of glacial melts and monsoons and if these start to shift there will be trouble . "

Facebook has gone rogue , drunk on founder Mark Zuckerberg 's dreams of world domination .
It 's time the rest of the web ecosystem recognizes this and works to replace it with something open and distributed .
Facebook used to be a place to share photos and thoughts with friends and family and maybe play a few stupid games that let you pretend you were a mafia don or a homesteader .
It became a very useful way to connect with your friends , long - lost friends and family members .
Even if you did n't really want to keep up with them .
Soon everybody – including your uncle Louie and that guy you hated from your last job – had a profile .
And Facebook realized it owned the network .
Then Facebook decided to turn " your " profile page into your identity online – figuring , rightly , that there 's money and power in being the place where people define themselves .
But to do that , the folks at Facebook had to make sure that the information you give it was public .
So in December , with the help of newly hired Beltway privacy experts , it reneged on its privacy promises and made much of your profile information public by default .
That includes the city that you live in , your name , your photo , the names of your friends and the causes you 've signed onto .
This spring Facebook took that even further .
All the items you list as things you like must become public and linked to public profile pages .
If you do n't want them linked and made public , then you do n't get them – though Facebook nicely hangs onto them in its database in order to let advertisers target you .
This includes your music preferences , employment information , reading preferences , schools , etc .
All the things that make up your profile .
They all must be public – and linked to public pages for each of those bits of info – or you do n't get them at all .
That 's hardly a choice , and the whole system is maddeningly complex .
Simultaneously , the company began shipping your profile information off pre-emptively to Yelp , Pandora and Microsoft – so that if you show up there while already logged into Facebook , the sites can " personalize " your experience when you show up .
You can try to opt out after the fact , but you 'll need a master 's in Facebook bureaucracy to stop it permanently .
Care to write a status update to your friends ?
Facebook sets the default for those messages to be published to the entire internet through direct funnels to the net 's top search engines .
You can use a dropdown field to restrict your publishing , but it 's seemingly too hard for Facebook to actually remember that 's what you do .
( Google Buzz , for all the criticism it has taken , remembers your setting from your last post and uses that as the new default . )
Now , say you you write a public update , saying , " My boss had a crazy great idea for a new product ! "
Now , you might not know it , but there is a Facebook page for " My Crazy Boss " and because your post had all the right words , your post now shows up on that page .
Include the words " FBI " or " CIA , " and you show up on the FBI or CIA page .
Then there 's the new Facebook " Like " button littering the internet .
It 's a great idea , in theory – but it 's completely tied to your Facebook account , and you have no control over how it is used .
( No , you can't like something and not have it be totally public . )
Then there 's Facebook 's campaign against outside services .
There was the Web 2.0 suicide machine that let you delete your profile by giving it your password .
Facebook shut it down .
Another company has an application that will collect all your updates from services around the web into a central portal – including from Facebook – after you give the site your password to log in to Facebook .
Facebook is suing the company and alleging it is breaking criminal law by not complying with its terms of service .
No wonder 14 privacy groups filed a unfair - trade complaint with the FTC against Facebook on Wednesday .
Mathew Ingram at GigaOm wrote a post entitled " The Relationship Between Facebook and Privacy : It 's Really Complicated . "
No , that 's just wrong .
The relationship is simple : Facebook thinks that your notions of privacy – meaning your ability to control information about yourself – are just plain old - fashioned .
Head honcho Zuckerberg told a live audience in January that Facebook is simply responding to changes in privacy mores , not changing them – a convenient , but frankly untrue , statement .
In Facebook 's view , everything ( save perhaps your e-mail address ) should be public .
Funny too about that e-mail address , for Facebook would prefer you to use its e-mail –like system that censors the messages sent between users .
Ingram goes onto say , " And perhaps Facebook does n’t make it as clear as it could what is involved , or how to fine - tune its privacy controls — but at the same time , some of the onus for doing these things has to fall to users . "
What ?
How can it fall to users when most of the choices do n't ' actually exist ?
I 'd like to make my friend list private .
Cannot .
I 'd like to have my profile visible only to my friends , not my boss .
Cannot .
I 'd like to support an anti-abortion group without my mother or the world knowing .
Cannot .
Setting up a decent system for controlling your privacy on a web service should n't be hard .
And if multiple blogs are writing posts explaining how to use your privacy system , you can take that as a sign you are n't treating your users with respect ,
It means you are coercing them into choices they do n't want using design principles .
That 's creepy .
Facebook could start with a very simple page of choices : I 'm a private person , I like sharing some things , I like living my life in public .
Each of those would have different settings for the myriad of choices , and all of those users could then later dive into the control panel to tweak their choices .
That would be respectful design - but Facebook is n't about respect – it's about re-configuring the world 's notion of what 's public and private .
So what that you might be a teenager and do n't get that college - admissions offices will use your e-mail address to find possibly embarrassing information about you .
Just because Facebook got to be the world 's platform for identity by promising you privacy and then later ripping it out from under you , that 's your problem .
At least , according to the bevy of privacy hired guns the company brought in at high salaries to provide cover for its shenanigans .
Clearly Facebook has taught us some lessons .
We want easier ways to share photos , links and short updates with friends , family , co-workers and even , sometimes , the world .
But that does n't mean the company has earned the right to own and define our identities .
It 's time for the best of the tech community to find a way to let people control what and how they 'd like to share .
Facebook 's basic functions can be turned into protocols , and a whole set of interoperating software and services can flourish .
Think of being able to buy your own domain name and use simple software such as Posterous to build a profile page in the style of your liking .
You 'd get to control what unknown people get to see , while the people you befriend see a different , more intimate page .
They could be using a free service that 's ad - supported , which could be offered by Yahoo , Google , Microsoft , a bevy of startups or web - hosting services like Dreamhost .
" Like " buttons around the web could be configured to do exactly what you want them to – add them to a protected profile or get added to a wish list on your site or broadcast by your micro-blogging service of choice .
You'd be able to control your presentation of self – and as in the real world , compartmentalize your life .
People who just do n't want to leave Facebook could play along as well – so long as Facebook does n't continue creepy data practices like turning your info over to third parties , just because one of your contacts takes the " Which Gilligan Island character are you ? " quiz ?
( Yes , that currently happens )
Now , it might not be likely that a loose confederation of software companies and engineers can turn Facebook 's core services into shared protocols , nor would it be easy for that loose coupling of various online services to compete with Facebook , given that it has 500 million users .
Many of them may be fine having Facebook redefine their cultural norms , or just be too busy or lazy to leave .
But in the internet I 'd like to live in , we'd have that option , instead of being left with the choice of letting Facebook use us , or being left out of the conversation altogether .

Astral Travel Techniques : Preparation Steps
All you need to successfully astral project is a few astral travel techniques .
With some practice , you will soon be able to astral travel and explore other astral planes .
Where ,
When , What , Who and How ?
While some people are able to astral project anywhere at any time , you will probably need all the peace and quiet that are available to you the first time you attempt to astral travel .
I suggest you follow these astral travel techniques in your bedroom , alone , either before falling asleep or just as you wake up .
You should wear loose comfortable clothing or no clothing at all and you should cover yourself with a sheet or light blanket because your body temperature will decrease slightly once your body falls asleep .
Some suggest that you align your body with the magnetic field of the earth , with your head pointing north and your feet pointing south .
This may be why many of the astral projection experts suggest avoiding travel during electrical storms .
While this may be helpful , I have astral travelled with my body in other directions .
Turn off the light , close the curtains , close the door , unplug the phone and if you have roommates ( or a family ) , let them know that you do n't want to be disturbed .
Ready , Set , Breathe
Sure , you know how to breathe ...
Now you simply have to focus on your breathing and relax .
The following is an example of a breathing technique you can use .
These astral travel techniques will work if you practice regularly .
It should take you about 5 minutes to complete this section , so do n't rush it .
Lie down on your bed in a comfortable position without crossing your arms or legs .
You will have to stay in this position for an extended period of time , so make sure it 's very comfortable .
I recommend lying on your back with legs slightly open , and your arms parallel to your body , but not touching .
Place your palms in a comfortable position .
Palms up works best for me .
Close your eyes and breathe in .
As you exhale , focus on the movement of your chest .
Enjoy it .
Take your time .
Feel what happens to your chest when you breathe in .
Feel the expansion .
Now focus on your stomach as you exhale , and feel the effects of your breath .
With every breath , try to see how each part of your body reacts .
When you reach your toes , take a few deep breaths before moving on to the muscle relaxation technique .
Flex and Relax
So you 've completed the breathing relaxation , now it 's time to relax your muscles but you still need to focus on your breathing as you relax your muscles .
This section is an important part of these astral travel techniques and it should take another 5 minutes .
Breathe in and contract all muscles in your feet .
Breathe out and relax .
Breathe in and out again , ensuring all your muscles are relaxed .
Now move up to your ankles .
Breathe in and flex your ankles .
Feel the tension , then breathe out and relax .
Take a couple of breaths and move up to the calves .
Continue with your legs , bum , stomach , arms , fingers , neck and last but not least : your face .
Everyone carries tension on their face without even knowing it .
Make sure that you let your eyebrows and jaw relax .
Time For Your Body To Sleep
It 's now time for the tricky part of these astral travel techniques .
This is normally when I fall asleep ...
You should try to remember that the goal is to trick your body into thinking that you are falling asleep while keeping your mind awake .
The best way to create this illusion is to maintain focus on your breathing while imagining your body getting heavier and heavier with every breath .
Your goal is to sink into a state of total emptiness .
My favorite trick is to imagine myself at the top of a very long ladder .
With every breath I take , I picture myself going down one rung , and my body getting a little heavier .
After a few rungs , I always feel the urge to move my body , but I have to resist .
Whether you feel itchy or uncomfortable , the feeling will go away if you keep focusing on your breathing .
You must master these prepration steps before exploring the astral plane and meeting your astral projection guide .
You can also learn astral projection techniques .
A former elementary school teacher charged with sexually assaulting two children is expected to appear in court this morning , accused of carjacking a woman in east Houston while trying to flee police .
Timothy Ryan Richert , 38 , originally was charged last August with aggravated sexual assault of a child and indecency with a child involving a 5 - year - old victim .
He later was released after posting a $ 40,000 bail .
On Tuesday , police said , he fled behind a garage apartment in the 4300 block of Polk as officers arrived at his home to take him into custody on four new child sex assault charges .
Minutes later , according to court records , a young man who lived in a house behind Richert told police his neighbor tried to kick in his front door .
Investigators said Richert then jumped in to a car with a woman who was returning home .
He demanded that she drive him away , she said .
Prosecutors filed a charge of kidnapping after the woman told police she was in fear for her life because of Richert 's demeanor .
He did not brandish a weapon .
She said Richert jumped out of the car about a mile away and later was apprehended at a Houston motel , officials said .
He is being held in the Harris County jail without bail .
Police recovered a pistol from Richert 's vehicle .
He has a license to carry a concealed weapon .
New sex allegations
The most recent sexual assault charges stem from allegations from a second victim , an 8 - year - old girl , who came forward in February while authorities investigated Richert .
Assistant District Attorney Justin Keiter said Richert was charged Tuesday on three counts of continuous sexual assault of a child and one of super - aggravated sexual assault of a child .
Typically , a super - aggravated offense is a combination of a first - degree sexual assault committed on a child under the age of six .
The enhanced charges are products of new laws that carry a minimum of 25 years in prison without chance of parole or diminution of the sentence .
“ Even if you 've never gotten a traffic ticket before , there 's no probation , no deferred adjudication .
There 's just prison time — 25 years , day for day , ” Keiter said .
Richert 's attorney did not return calls for comment .
The former Brookline Elementary third - grade teacher resigned from Houston Independent School District in January 2001 , days after allegations surfaced that he digitally penetrated a 10 - year - old student several times under a blanket during different “ movie times . ”
He was charged with sexual assault of a child .
The charges later were dismissed at the request of the girl .
Richert began working for HISD on Jan. 6 , 1997 .
He was a bilingual teacher for two years , then became a third - grade teacher .
State officials revoked Richert 's teaching certificate in 2007 .
It was unclear Wednesday how Richert now makes a living .

NPR is standing by their initial report that Massey Energy is being investigated for possible bribery and criminal negligence .
A federal source is denying the story :
A federal law - enforcement source is denying that the Mine Safety and Health Administration is being investigated as part of a larger probe into the circumstances surrounding the Upper Big Branch mine disaster in West Virginia .
NPR has reported that Massey Energy and MSHA were the subjects of investigations .
The federal law enforcement source said : " I can say that there 's an investigation but it 's not about them ( MSHA ) . "
NPR stands by its earlier report .

On the other hand I ’m really not too sure about her attempted seduction of the Doctor , which did seem out of keeping with the usual tone of the series ( although I suppose it was inevitable after the Rose / Martha subplots ) .
Given the number of young children who watch , it may not have been the most appropriate of scenes to screen .
Still , Matt Smith 's performance was a humorous gem , and quite a few viewers might have been rather jealous of him being in that situation !
Volker Beck ist alter Hase bei den Grünen , Wikipedia schreibt über ihn : „ Mitglied des Deutschen Bundestags aus Köln , Erster Parlamentarischer Geschäftsführer und menschenrechtspolitischer Sprecher der Bundestagsfraktion und Mitglied im Parteirat von Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen . “ und ich bin geneigt zu überlegen ob das Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz sich diesen Mann nicht mal ansehen sollte .
Harte Worte ?
Stimmt !
Aber diese harten Worte sind meine gedankliche Reaktion auf ein Blogpost von Volker Beck , in dem er wieder die gewagte Behauptung aufstellt , dass diejenigen
Wähler die nicht die Grünen oder die SPD gewählt haben , schuld an der Misere in NRW sind .
Mit der gleichen Argumentation kann man den Grünen auch um die Ohren hauen , dass sie Schuld daran sind , dass unser Land Helmut Kohl viel zu lange ertragen musste .
Aber DAS zählte ja nicht .
Für Volker Beck sind ( laut Überschrift und Twitterpost )
Wähler der Links - und der Piratenpartei schlicht Verräter :
Wer hat uns verraten ?
Die Piraten !
Wer war mit dabei ?
Die Linkspartei !
Müssen sich Wähler , die ihr Bürgerrecht auf FREIE Wahlen in Anspruch nehmen von einem gewählten Volksvertreter als Verräter beschimpfen lassen ?
Muss ich als Steuerzahler einem solchen Gegner der freien Wahlen das Gehalt bezahlen ?
Es ist mir persönlich sicherlich nicht egal welche Parteien gewählt werden – auch ich habe Befindlichkeiten .
Aber den politischen Kontrahenten als Verräter zu bezeichnen passt wunderbar zu meiner Aussage , dass die Grünen nur diejenigen FDPler sind , die im Bioladen einkaufen .
Denn FDP und CDU zeichnen sich durch die stete Beschimpfung der Linken aus .
Und Volker Beck sollte sich mal an die eigene Nase fassen .
Waren es nicht die Wähler der Grünen , denen wir auch die Ära Kohl zu verdanken haben ?
Wäre die SPD ohne die Grabenkämpfe des linken Flügels nicht deutlich stärker gewesen ?
Oder will Beck wieder in Richtung Einheitspartei ?
Gewählt werde darf nur , was ihm und den Grünen den Machterhalt sichert ?
Wer solche demokratisch gewählten Politiker hat , braucht keine zugereisten Demokratiefeinde mehr .
Zur Kenntnisnahme :
Es geht mir NICHT darum , dass ausgerechnet die Piratenpartei und die Linke von Beck „ beleidigt wurden .
Es geht mir um das anscheinend generell mangelnde Demokratieverständnis dieses Mannes mit ansehnlichen Ämtern innerhalb einer deutschen Partei – die ich früher einmal gern gewählt habe .
Aber das war bevor auch die Grünen sich als Profitlinge in Aufsichtsräten und Wahllügner enttarnten .
Mittlerweiler sind die Grünen für mich einer der Haufen Dreck bei denen man den Haufen auswählt der am wenigsten unangenehm riecht – und die Aussage Becks hat den Geruch nicht besser gemacht .
Every parent of teenagers knows that curious paradox by which we live today : that , instead of our children having to mind their manners in front of grown - ups , it 's the grown - ups who have to mind their Ps & Qs in front of the children .
There are few more dismaying sights than the curled lip and the moue of disgust on the face of your delightful offspring when you try to use hip slang , or make a clever pun , or mention " my gay friend Jeremy " instead of " my friend Jeremy " , or say " pot " instead of " weed " , or go to a fancy - dress bash in a Tin Man costume that you bought in a party shop in Wandsworth , or wear your " Live Fast , Die Young " T - shirt , or admit that you 're having trouble finding GoogleEarth on your iPhone .
Of course , intergenerational embarrassment affects every generation , does n't it ?
I remember writhing with mortification when my coolest friend from school and I were watching Bob Dylan on TV in my family living - room , some time in 1967 .
" My God , " said my father with feeling , " that Dylan feller really makes that harmonica talk . "
" Please Dad . .. "
I said , blushing violently .
" It really , you know , blows your mind , does n't it ? " he continued .
" Dad , I 'm begging you ... "
" He really – what 's the phrase – puts it in the groove , do n't you think ? "
" Aaarrgghh ! " I remember covering my face with both hands and rocking wordlessly back and forth , wishing to God my friend was n't around to witness such middle - aged folly .
But scroll forward 40 years , and my own children make similar gestures of kill - me - now horror these days because I have turned into a Tragic Senior .
Help for the perplexed is , however , at hand .
A new book , by the American novelist and journalist Pamela Redmond Satran , tries to confront , head - on , the battleground of style , clothing , vocabulary and attitude that registers today 's over - forties as being tragically over - the - hill , washed - up , redundant and moribund in the eyes of their children and their children 's friends .
It 's titled How Not To Act Old : 185 Ways to Pass for Cool , Sound , Wicked , or At Least Not Totally Lame , and contains a good deal of droll wisdom and pin-sharp jokes .
Ms Satran 's book is a spin - off from her website , Hownottoactold.com , whose raison d'être she explains with admirable economy : " The point here is n't to act like a 26 - year - old .
God forbid .
It 's just to learn how not to act like somebody a 26 - year - old might snicker at . "
So – stop going on about how wonderful the Sixties were ( that was 40 bleeding years ago ) .
Never say to another human being , of any age , " Are you sure you 're going to be warm enough in that ? "
Never volunteer the information that a policeman , doctor , politician or rock star " looks about 12 " , because it 'll make you sound at least a hundred and twelve .
Do n't send any more greetings cards .
Never leave dried flowers around your living quarters .
( " They are the antimacassars , the china figurines of today ... the decorating accent of the middle - aged . " )
If you must use email ( young persons would far sooner use texts or Facebook or LinkedIn or Plaxo or Twitter ) , do n't use punctuation , formal greetings or full sentences , unless you want to sound like Rip Van Winkle wheezily addressing his great - grandchildren .
Conversely , do n't try too hard to sound street - smart by saying " sick " to mean good , or " safe " to mean physically well , or " I 'm all about linen jackets right now " because you heard your 14 - year - old daughter say something like it the other day .
Horrible young persons will know you 're eavesdropping , to hear useable fashionable slang , and they will take the piss .
I once let my son convince me that the phrase " It was well weapon " ( meaning truly excellent ) was all the rage in Teen - land , until I used it aloud one day in teenage company .
The memory of their hysterical laughter haunts me still .
Amid the more predictable counsels for the incipiently middle - aged ( stop wearing Speedos when you 've a Fat Upper Public Area , stop turning up the volume on your TV , stop watching Midsomer Murders ) , there are some real gems of insight about modern yoof .
Such as : many kids never wear watches now because they check the time ( with one hand ) on their mobile phones .
Many kids , possibly the same lot , never ask for directions because they can check their journey details on GPS or Mapquest or Google .
And they never leave voicemails ; they just assume that the person they phoned will see their number in the Missed Calls slot and ring them back if they feel like it .
What else ?
If somebody says " Thank - you " to them , they 'll respond not with " You 're welcome " or " My pleasure " , but with the Australian " No problem " .
( I 've just tested this theory by thanking a 25 - year - old in my office – and it's 100 per cent accurate . )
Ms Satran is also spot - on when she suggests that today 's 16 - to - 24 - year - olds live in a state of weird positivism , articulated by their mantra , " It 's all good . "
If you carp or complain , rant or rave , or have big , tearful confrontations with them , as your parents once did with you , they 'll think you 've gone over to the dark side .
You 'll seem tyrannical and shouty , rather than impressive and mighty .
Ms Satran comes across as an immensely likeable dame in her fifties , who has done a lot of close - up research of teen and early - 20 - something behaviour ; but she has also inspected her own behaviour to see what works .
As a result , she 's able to recommend that the only expression of middle - aged enthusiasm that goes down well with the young is the word " Yay ! " accompanied by a little dance .
She knows that if you 're subjected to a chilly silence by a teen , you must not panic or send a flood of worried texts or emails .
You just chill out , wait for a text to arrive , then wait a few hours before replying , using fewer words than their message .
It 's all about brinkmanship .
She 's also grasped the crucial fact that wearing clothes that match , or living in décor that blends together , is a sign of insecurity and fatal elderly - ness .
I did n't buy her pronouncement that it 's disastrous to display to young persons a fondness for Bruce Springsteen ( who held a god - like status among young concert - goers in Hyde Park last summer ) , but otherwise it 's hard to fault her conclusions .
I admired her droll , Dorothy Parker - ish view of inter-generational relationships , and her caustic advice .
She missed only one thing really – that there 's nothing more truly ageing than sitting around worrying about just how ancient you seem these days ...
A group of 255 of the world 's top scientists today wrote an open letter aimed at restoring public faith in the integrity of climate science .
In a strongly worded condemnation of the recent escalation of political assaults on climatologists , the letter , published in the US Journal Science and signed by 11 Nobel laureates , attacks critics driven by " special interests or dogma " and " McCarthy - like " threats against researchers .
It also attempts to set the record straight on the process of rigorous scientific research .
The letter is a response to negative publicity following the release of thousands of hacked emails from climate scientists at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) and two mistakes makes by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the UN climate body .
The letter sets out some basic features of the scientific method .
" Like all human beings , scientists make mistakes , but the scientific process is designed to find and correct them .
But when some conclusions have been thoroughly and deeply tested , questioned , and examined , they gain the status of ' well - established theories ' and are often spoken of as ' facts ' , " it says .
The document , citing theories including the age and origin of the Earth , the Big Bang and Darwin 's evolution by natural selection , says that anthropogenic climate change is now so well - supported by evidence that it has achieved the same status .
It adds that owing to science 's adversarial nature , " fame " awaits any scientists who can prove the theory wrong .
" There is nothing remotely identified in the recent events that changes the fundamental conclusions about climate change , " the letter says .
The authors – who are all members of the US National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) , the country 's premier scientific institution – include some of the academic community 's most distinguished climate researchers .
But the list also includes top anthropologists , biochemists and physicists who have felt the need to defend climate science in the wake of what they regard as politically motivated attacks .
Three senior scientists from the Universities of Cambridge , Oxford and Manchester have also added their endorsement .
All of the scientists signed up in a personal capacity , not on behalf of the National Academy or on behalf of their institution .
" Many recent assaults on climate science and , more disturbingly , on climate scientists by climate change deniers , are typically driven by special interests or dogma , not by an honest effort to provide an alternative theory that credibly satisfies the evidence , " the letter says .
Its call for an end to " McCarthy - like threats of criminal prosecution against our colleagues based on innuendo and guilt by association " appears to be jibe at Republican senator , James Inhofe , who has called for a criminal investigation into US and British climatologists whose email exchanges were stolen from UEA .
The letter also condemns the " harassment of scientists by politicians seeking distractions to avoid taking action , and the outright lies being spread about them . "
The letter 's co-ordinator , Peter Gleick , of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development , Environment and Security in Oakland , California , said : " [ It ] originated with a number of NAS members who were frustrated at the misinformation being spread by climate deniers and the assaults on scientists by some policy - makers who hope to delay or avoid making policy decisions and are hiding behind the recent controversy around emails and minor errors in the IPCC .

According to one of the signees , Professor Anthony Bebbington at the Institute for Development Policy and Management at Manchester University , the individual signatories have come together to collectively endorse the quality of work being conducted within the scientific community , particularly on climate science .
Despite two highly - publicised errors found within the scientific assessment of climate change produced by the IPCC over the timing of glacier melt in the Himalayas and sea level in the Netherlands , Professor Beddington warned against ' throwing the baby out with the bathwater ' .

That event changed the history of all English - speaking countries .
Compared with amber waves of grain or the blond tresses of a field of ripe corn , cassava is an inglorious workhorse of a crop , a few spindly red stems sprouting from a clutch of brown tubers .
It is filling but not very nutritious ; it even contains trace amounts of cyanide , which must be removed by grinding and fermenting .

Even pigs wo n’t eat cassava riddled with necrotic brown lumps that was dug up by Lynet Nalugo , top , from a field in Mukono , Uganda .

But subsistence farmers depend on it because it ’s “ very drought - tolerant and very bad - management - tolerant , ” said Edward Charles , a team leader for the Great Lakes Cassava Initiative , a six - country consortium based in Kenya and supported by the Gates Foundation .
For example , he said , even when farmers are too weak from malaria to weed , their crops survive .
Also , the tubers can be left underground for up to three years , so if drought kills a corn or bean crop , the farmer ’s family can still fend off starvation .
But the plant falls prey to more than 20 pests and diseases .
Dr. Fauquet fears brown streak will cross the Congo Basin to Nigeria , the world ’s biggest grower , because farmers sell cuttings to one another and border controls are nonexistent or can be evaded with bribes .
He is optimistic it will not cross the ocean into Thailand , Brazil , Indonesia or China because there is no world trade in the cuttings and few direct flights to Asia or South America .
( Whiteflies , which are thought to spread the virus , have been known to stow aboard planes . )
However , he noted , mosaic virus did spread to India from Africa somehow .
And Dai Peters , the Cassava Initiative ’s director , noted that a mealybug that damages Brazilian cassavas has leapfrogged the globe to infect Thai fields , too .
Even if the brown streak virus is contained in Africa , Dr. Fauquet said , donors may eventually be forced to spend billions of dollars on food aid to prevent starving populations from going on the move , which could set off ethnic fighting .

Rights are not " granted " to us by the government  they are ours by our very nature , by our birthright .
ALL just political authority is derived from the people  and government exists solely with our consent !
We the people of the several states created the federal government  not the other way around !
The Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that which has been delegated by the people to the federal government in the Constitution  and nothing more .
The People of each State have the sole and exclusive right and power to govern themselves in all areas not delegated to their government .
A Government without limits is a tyranny !
!
When Congress enacts laws and regulations that are not made in Pursuance of the powers enumerated in the Constitution , the People are not bound to obey them .
Do we call and email our representatives in Congress and ask them to limit their own power ?
Do we march on D.C. and demand that the government limit its own power ?
Do we sue them in their own courts and ask their judges to limit their power ?
Do we vote the bums out in 2010 , or 2012  and ask new politicians to limit their own power ?
the several States composing the United States of America , are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their General Government
whensoever the General Government assumes undelegated powers , its acts are unauthoritative , void , and of no force .
where powers are assumed [ by the federal government ] which have not been delegated [ by the Constitution ] , a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy
The Legislature of the State of _______________ declares that the federal law known as the " Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , " signed by President Barack Obama on March 23 , 2010 , is not authorized by the Constitution of the United States and violates its true meaning and intent as given by the Founders and Ratifiers , and is hereby declared to be invalid in this state , shall not be recognized by this state , is specifically rejected by this state , and shall be considered null and void and of no effect in this state .
Any official , agent , or employee of the United States government or any employee of a corporation providing services to the United States government that enforces or attempts to enforce an act , order , law , statute , rule or regulation of the government of the United States in violation of this act shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction must be punished by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ( $ 5,000.00 ) , or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five ( 5 ) years , or both .

There are a few core beliefs that guide me in everything I do as the founder of the Tenth Amendment Center These seven items are about sovereignty , which is something we hear about quite a bit lately  but few really understand .
Sovereignty is defined as " final authority . "
All through history , this final authority was in the hands of just one or two people  a king , a queen , or even just a small cabal of elites at the top of the food chain .
But the founders and ratifiers gave us something unique in history  a first , really .
They created a system where the average people  you and I  held final authority .
We the people are sovereign .
We the people hold final authority .
We the people are in charge .
And , they the government work for us !
The Tenth Amendment codifies in law this principle of popular sovereignty  that " We the People " of the several states created the federal government to be our agent for certain , enumerated purposes  and nothing more .
But unfortunately , that 's not how things have been working , and very little that the government does is actually authorized by the constitution .
And , this is a problem that did n't just start in January 2009  it 's been going on a long , long time .
Thomas Jefferson and James Madison both warned us that if the federal government ever became the sole and exclusive arbiter of the extent of its own powers  that power would endlessly grow ... regardless of elections , separation of powers , courts , or other vaunted parts of our system .
Guess what  they were right .
For a hundred years , we the people have been suing , and marching , and lobbying , and voting the bums out  but yet ... year in and year out , government continues to grow and your liberty continues to diminish  and it does n't matter who is the president , or what political party controls congress  the growth of power in the federal government never stops .
The problem we face today is not about personalities or political parties  it 's about power .
Until we address the absolute fact that the federal government has too much power , things will never change .
Jefferson and Madison gave us the answer .
In response to the unconstitutional attacks on liberty that were the Alien and Sedition Acts , they secretly authored the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 .
Here are a few excerpts that really define exactly how things are supposed to work when two or more branches of the federal government conspire against the constitution and your liberty .
So while it might be important to call , petition , demand , march , sue and vote bums out , because they 're all bums , there 's much more we 're supposed to do .
When the federal government violates your rights , you 're not supposed to wait four years for new politicians in the hope that they 'll fix it .
You 're not supposed to wait two , or four , or more years for some black - robed judge to pronounce that they 've violated your rights .
You are supposed to resist those violations of your liberty as they happen  and it is your state 's solemn duty to do the same .
While such a task might seem daunting , it 's something that 's already happening today , and has been growing in recent years too .
In 2007 , one state rep in Maine introduced a non-binding resolution opposing the REAL ID Act .
In 2008 , one state rep in Oklahoma introduced a simple non-binding resolution reaffirming the Constitution as defined by the 10th amendment , .
In 2009 , one state rep in Montana introduced a bill to nullify some federal gun laws and regulations .
In 2009 , one state rep in Arizona introduced a state constitutional amendment to effectively ban a national health care plan in that state .
These simple , single acts by courageous people have grown into a state - level resistance to unconstitutional federal acts the likes this country has possibly never seen .
Here at the Tenth Amendment Center we have released model legislation for you to give to your state reps to demand that they stand with you and refuse to comply with unconstitutional acts from Washington D.C.
Our latest ?
The Federal Health Care Nullification Act This
Act is not over 1000 pages .
It 's not 500 pages .
It 's not a dozen , or even two .
It 's one single page to nullify now .
Here 's a majority of what it says :
And it adds some much - needed ' teeth ' too :
They want to fine us or put us in jail for not buying insurance from some corporation .
What 's next  fining us for not buying a Chevy ?
Well , it 's time that we turn this thing around  and in the federal health care nullification act  we fine THEM for violating our rights !
While this may seem difficult to accomplish  or even insurmountable  if we do nothing , or if we even do the same things we 've been doing , we 're doomed to failure .
But if we do what 's right , we will succeed !
Samuel Adams put it best : Step one is to sign on in support the Federal Health Care Nullification Act.
WeRefuse.com is a new website ( and the only one that I 'm aware of ) dedicated solely to nullifying national health care on a state level .
Join us in our first goal of 100,000 to stop national health care " laws " today !
Let 's make this work and then we can use it as a model for every other constitutional violation coming out of D.C. ©

Update
It seems like this post got some attention on Reddit , YCombinator news and other sites on monday .
I had n’t noticed until today , so here are some answers to many of the FAQs about the post .
Yes it was done using cloc .
Do n’t shoot me I ’m just the messenger .
It was run at the base folder of the entire Android OS source checkout , so yes it will include sample and tests I suppose .
C# , Ada , Objective - C? I also thought the same …
It ’s probably worth the try doing a few finds and greps to see if this is true , again I just posted the output of cloc , I did n’t intend to make this a scientific paper , just a fun and curious post to get a rough number on the lines of code , that breakdown was just icing on the cake for me ( as inaccurate as it maybe )
Update
This post is now being referenced in Wikipedia ! on the “ Android ( operating system ) ” article .
About Gubatron & Android
Ever since the iPhone OS handicapped millions of smartphone devices with its draconian laws , I started looking more and more seriously at Android as THE platform for every non-iPhone device coming to the mobile and TV space .
Now I ’m part of the developer team of FrostWire for Android , an application that exploits all the power of the device and the freedoms of the platform to allow people to connect and share .
Mark your calendars .
The Senate will vote June 10 on a resolution that would undo U.S. EPA 's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act , Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) said yesterday .
Murkowski , the measure 's lead sponsor , said she has reached a unanimous consent agreement with Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) to call for a floor vote on her resolution after the weeklong Memorial Day recess .
" Reid and I have agreed on the time , " Murkowski said yesterday .
" Until it 's typed down in language , nothing is locked in solid , but the agreement that we have that was reached this afternoon was to go for the 10th . "
Reid spokesman Jim Manley declined to comment .
Murkowski's disapproval resolution seeks to veto EPA 's " endangerment finding , " a formal determination that allows the agency to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act .
Murkowski's office said previously that the senator had until June 7 to call for a guaranteed floor vote under the Congressional Review Act , which allows Congress to veto agency rules .
But Murkowski said the agreement with Reid would push the vote back .
" We 're going to be working through the supplemental all week , and I think we just recognize that we 're going to have a pretty full schedule , " Murkowski said .
" So to find 10 hours , the other side agreed that let 's just agree to a unanimous consent . "
The Senate would debate the measure for 10 hours ; no filibusters or amendments would be possible .
Murkowski's resolution would need 51 votes to clear the chamber .
She already has 41 co-sponsors , including three Democrats : Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana , Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Ben Nelson of Nebraska .
Even if the resolution passes the Senate , it faces an uphill climb in the House , which does not have the same expedited procedures , and it faces a likely veto from President Obama .
EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has warned that nullifying the endangerment finding would upend the administration 's joint EPA and Transportation Department fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas emission limits for cars and light - duty trucks .
Asked yesterday whether she had the votes to clear the chamber , Murkowski said her vote count was " top secret . "
" It is always a challenge when you have other variables that are at play , " she said .
Murkowski pointed to separate efforts in the Senate to block or limit EPA climate rules , including a bill from Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - W.Va . ) that would block EPA from regulating stationary sources for two years and a climate and energy bill from Sens.
John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) that would also limit EPA .
" So there 's a lot of variables , " she said .
" My job is just to work hard , make sure people understand the implications of this measure and what it will mean for our nation 's economy , and we 'll go forward with the vote after the recess . "
Rockefeller yesterday said he has not yet made up his mind about whether to support Murkowski's resolution .
Several of Rockefeller 's co-sponsors -- Sens. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) , Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) and Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) -- have said that they favor the two - year timeout to Murkowski's resolution .
But Murkowski said she plans to call for the vote whether or not she has the votes .
" We would n't move forward with a unanimous consent if we were n't intending to move forward , " she said .
Former EPA chief warns against resolution
Former EPA Administrator Russell Train yesterday urged Senate leaders to oppose Murkowski's bid to handcuff the agency .
" S.J. Res. 26 would rollback Clean Air Act protections and prevent the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions , notwithstanding the agency 's scientific determination that these pollutants endanger human health and welfare , " Train wrote in a letter ( pdf ) to Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) .
Train served as EPA chief under former Presidents Nixon and Ford .
" If passed , this resolution would fundamentally undermine the Clean Air Act , overturning science in favor of political considerations , " he wrote .
Supporters of the resolution argue that Congress did not mean to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act , but Train called that argument " inconsistent with the history of the law as it has been applied for the past 40 years . "
Train also defended the Obama EPA 's efforts to gradually phase in climate rules for industrial emitters .
" In executing her responsibilities , the current Administrator appears to have taken a measured approach and demonstrated a sensitivity to economic concerns , " he said .
EPA has said that permitting rules for stationary sources will not kick in until January 2011 and that the agency will begin by tackling the biggest polluters .

Greece has its immediate financing .
Now the question is can they follow the prescription ?
In all likelihood the answer is no .
the bond markets are reflecting that via a lack of confidence .
In fact , some bond markets are falling apart and there is no end in sight .
We have bond rating firms lowering ratings , as the rating services themselves are under serious fire and we do not believe they will be around long .
The big question is why did it take two years and 10 months to react ?
There are 19 nations with serious sovereign debt problems and there is really no way back for them .
They may as well all default , because the austerity programs they ’d have to follow and at the same time to satisfy creditors , not only is impossible but it signals years of stunted growth and perhaps in many cases the possibility of revolution .
Greece certainly fills that bill .
We see the eurozone rules may soon be changed , so that eurozone participants can assist one another .
That means in time they will all collapse together .
As many as five members could need assistance of the 16 in the zone .
Our guess is permanent bailouts will go forward and the ECB rules will be changed to allow the ECB to function like the Fed .
Greece and many others are trapped and they will burden the healthy nations and neutralize them .
This approach is the ECB nuclear option .
It will destroy the zone eventually .
This will destroy the euro and end the option of the euro becoming the world reserve currency .
The zone would have adopted the same approach as the US and UK in destroying their currencies .
How can you have a union with one interest rate , where the ECB controls the monetary policy , but cannot control the budget deficits , borrowing and spending activities of its members ?
The Keynesian dictum of borrowing and spending has led the eurozone into a black hole .
What will emerge from that black hole will be something similar to the Federal Reserve .
The psychology behind all this is a move to make the US dollar again preeminent as a world reserve currency .
In the meantime the day of reckoning is shoved forward , a diversion from these economic policies are failed terrorist bomb plantings in NYC and the destruction of offshore oil platforms .
As we said in an earlier issue Greece is the poster child – the goat .
Greece has done no more or less than the other 18 insolvent countries and many more .
One asked , how can the dollar be a strong currency , when they themselves are broke .
They talk of fiscal stability and reform , such as higher taxes and the reduction of entitlement programs , but you will see little of that and lots of bait and switch tactics .
We are also seeing in US Treasury auctions not only massive offerings , but also a new crop of direct bidders accounting for 13 % of sales vs. 1 % .
The indirects , or foreign central banks , have fallen from 37 % to 23 % .
In our mind there is no question that the directs are really the Fed .
That means to us that the US was behind the forced downgrading of Greek and other debt .
That was to bolster the position of the dollar and lower the value of the euro and other currencies , making their exports far more competitive and profitable .
Thus here we have a calculated lowering of the euro and other currencies , a stronger dollar to attract more funds to US bond auctions .
We also have rating agencies assisting in the operation .
Incidentally , Moody ’s received a Wells notice in March and never announced it .
We are sure we will find out soon that Warren Buffett has sold his Moody ’s position .
While this transpired the Greeks experienced another rating fall and at the US auction the indirects took 28 % of the offering .
The directs were there but as usual and as usual it was a secret as to who they were .
Again , the direct bidders are the Fed .
That is called quantitative easing and that is very inflationary .
As of this past weekend we find we have another all - inclusive ECB bailout package for those who have n’t asked for it yet , but will need it .
This is the European version of quantitative easing .
This method of saving the international banking system is to essentially nationalize it .
The bottom line is this stopgap measure will eventually cause the dollar more harm than good .
Once investors realize what the US and European nations have done to gain time they will be horrified and the ensuing fallout will be devastating for the dollar .
Europe ’s response has been atypical .
Take from the industrious and give to those who cannot or wo n’t run their economies effectively .
This is what socialism is all about including public guarantees against loss for mega transnational conglomerates .
Europe ’s elitists and America ’s as well are morally and financially bankrupt .
Goldman and others are being called onto the carpet with the rating firms .
All of the players knew $ 1 trillion is n’t going to do the job .
They are again buying time and creating more inflation .
Debt may have been backstopped by economic growth by bailouts , but can not be present in a mode of austerity .
The magicians are again creating illusions .
The alchemists will be wrong again as they have always been throughout history .
You say who is going to be buying Greek bonds and other bonds ?
European central banks of course .
More quantitative easing .
This is significant .
It surely is because it reveals that both the European and US financial systems are irretrievably bankrupt .
Do n’t forget that the dreams of socialism and fascism are being shown to be giant losers .
This past week ushers in another phase of the ongoing collapse – another interlude – that stretches out the time horizon , but it wo n’t affect the ultimate outcome .
These are pretensions that will go unfulfilled .
You saw the Greeks in the streets ; do they look like people who are about to submit to austerity indefinitely ?
We hardly think so .
We see the same reaction from the rest of the basket cases .
Of this $ 1 trillion European bailout , EU countries will pay $ 700 billion that they do not have .
The British have refused to participate and the US will via the IMF will be about $ 65 billion .
There is no guarantee that these funds wo n’t be used up within a year .
Then it ’s another TARP type of bailout , or the whole EU goes under .
Even though Europe and the US will have hyperinflation as a result the end result is going to be massive insolvency .
This situation is far more serious than the credit crisis of the past 20 months .
As a result the euro is headed for $ 1.20 and perhaps lower .
German President Mrs. Merkle was not re-elected in a majority and pays for what Germans regard as a sellout .
As a result of these forced payments to bail out erstwhile fellow EU members we could well see rioting in countries forced to pay for the losers .
Europe could experience chaos from two different points of view .
European elitists are willing to throw money at Europe ’s problems , but not one idea about how to fix the problems of these nations , no necessary restructuring .
Just doing the same old socialist thing .
Something for nothing , and it has now been discovered someone actually has to pay for .
If you stop for a minute and look at this picture it is ludicrous that EU nations that are near bankruptcy are bailing out other EU countries like themselves .
The question is what will the euro eventually be worth ?
The euro , the eurozone and the EU are history .
It is now just a question of when it is over .
Sovereign debt is unserviceable and is to be serviced by more unserviceable debt .
That dear reader is truly desperation .
The top 7 nations that are owed money by Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece and Spain aggregate almost $ 300 billion .
There are a total of 22 nations owed money by just these five nations .
The major debtors are France $ 911 billion ; Germany $ 703 billion ; England $ 416 billion ; Holland $ 244 billion ; the USA $ 186 billion ; Spain $ 150 billion and Japan $ 122 billion .
This is what interconnectivity brings you in a socialist - fascist international .
Greece is the poster child of Europe ’s failed system called socialism .
Greece is just the beginning of the financial and economic collapse of Europe .
Perhaps with minor exceptions we have 27 morally and fiscally bankrupt governments , aided and abetted by central banks and financial institutions .
Prosperity cannot be created out of government debt .
The only people who gain are the bankers and the financial centers from such shortsighted debt accumulation .
Again , there is little or no planning for sound investing to offset such debt .
It is called living for today and the heck with tomorrow .
Thus , the debt is being misallocated in frivolous ways .
It is called malinvestment .
History shows it manifests itself in failure and insolvency .
No country has ever spent itself out of debt in a fiat money system .
As a result of this degenerative system the only safe money is gold , as has been the case for centuries .
It is the only true totally liquid investment that protects one from the vicissitudes of fiat money .
The stage has already been set for the second phase of gold domination .
Gold is the antithesis of the fraud known as fiat money and debt .
There is no logic or morality that allows central banks to create money at will .
How can people tolerate such a system
Is it any wonder that gold has gained against every currency for the past seven years .
In the end only one currency will survive and that is gold .
The flight from currency has begun in ernst .
This in part is what Europe ’s problem is all about .
We are the victims of a vast fraud in which government promised a social welfare system they simply could n’t deliver .
This will happen in America and has already happened in Europe .
Those in power behind the scenes know the system is imploding and they are helpless to stop it .
Very shortly Greece ’s problems will fade into the background as major countries bite the dust .
If you own bonds of any kind or stocks , with the exception of gold and silver shares , sell them now and move to gold and silver related assets .
All these debt obligations are unpayable and are a fraud .
If you have assets we implore you to switch them to gold and silver related assets , because soon the window of opportunity will be closed .
Please do not allow yourself to be financially destroyed .

On Friday we were told that 290,000 jobs were created in April .
66,000 jobs were new census workers , making $ 25.00 an hour and 188,000 created by the birth / death ratio , or out of thin air .
In reality the economy only added 36,000 jobs .
U3 rose from 9.7 % to 9.9 % . U6 was 17.1 % .
If you take out the birth / death ratio real unemployment is 22.4 % .
" Friday 's release of April 's Jobs numbers were falsely optimistic .
The data was deceitful , okay even a lie .
Non -farm payroll jobs were reported to have increased by 299,000 , which is nonsense .
Of that , 188,000 were made up , fictitious make believe , guesstimate phantom jobs called the CES Birth / Death adjustment .
Another 66,000 were temporary government census jobs .
Then another 26,000 jobs were temporary jobs with Temp Services .
So the number was bogus .
Pure hogwash .
The admitted Unemployment rate rose to 9.9 percent from 9.7 percent .
Unemployment remains a serious problem in the U.S.
The net zero real jobs growth
In April comes in 150,000 short of what is needed to keep pace with population growth . "
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , the bank facing a fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , is expecting further litigation related to sales of collateralized debt obligations .
“ We anticipate that additional putative shareholder derivative actions and other litigation may be filed , and regulatory and other investigations and actions commenced against us with respect to offering of CDOs , ” the New York - based firm said in a quarterly filing with the SEC today .
Goldman Sachs , which makes more money from trading than any other Wall Street firm , also disclosed that its traders generated $ 100 million or more on 35 days during the first quarter and lost money on no days .
The firm set a record when it made $ 100 million or more on 46 days in the second quarter .
Governments will only bring about an end to the credit crisis through the blood , sweat and tears of cutting the amount of public debt , “ Black Swan ” author Nassim Taleb said .
The crisis came from debt and you do n’t escape it with more debt , Taleb said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio ’s “ Bloomberg Surveillance ” today .
We ’re in a situation where we had a patient who we discovered had cancer a year and a half ago and all we ’ve been giving the patient is painkillers .
The tumor is getting worse because we are transforming private debt into public debt and public debt is not manageable .
Taleb , a professor at New York University who also advises Universa Investments LP , a $ 6 billion fund that bets on extreme market moves , said the financial system faces risk from increased complexity , and President Barack Obama should work with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke to cut debt .
My fear is if we do n’t stop them now they ’re going to create hyperinflation , Taleb said .
Nobody has confidence in a guy like Bernanke .
Taleb is a professor of risk engineering at NYU and an advisor to Santa Monica , California - based Universa , which was opened in 2007 by Mark Spitznagel , Taleb ’s former trading partner .
Rare and unforeseen events are known in finance as ‘ black swans , after Taleb ’s 2007 book , ‘‘ The Black Swan : The Impact of the Highly Improbable .
If I were a politician I ’d say you need blood , sweat and tears , Taleb said .
The first thing you need to do , Obama , is to transform debt to equity .
I do n’t understand why your great , great grandchildren should have to pay for it .
That ’s immoral .
The cost of protecting U.S. municipal bonds rose by the most this year as investors bought insurance on U.S. state obligations after global stocks tumbled and Europe ’s debt crisis worsened .
Five - year contracts on the Markit MCDX index , tied to 50 municipal issuers , increased by 31 percent last week to 1.64 percentage points , the biggest jump since early December .
California five - year credit default swaps gained 40 percent , the most since December 2008 .
The price of the swaps reached $ 273,000 to protect $ 10 million of bonds , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
“ The ultimate cause is a deepening of investor risk aversion , but that deep risk aversion was really brought on originally by concerns over European sovereign credit quality , ” said Guy Lebas , chief fixed - income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia .
Ten - year U.S. Treasury yields had the biggest two - week drop since December 2008 as concern that European leaders will be unable to contain Greece ’s debt crisis drove investors to the safety of federal government debt .
Global stocks slid for a fourth day yesterday , erasing 2010 gains for U.S. benchmark indexes , and the bonds of debt - laden nations tumbled .
Investors are shedding risk in favor of Treasuries , Peter Hayes , head of municipal bonds at New York - based BlackRock Inc. , the world ’s largest asset manager , said in an e-mail .
In municipal debt , investors got ahead of themselves as there was some evidence that tax receipts were turning higher .
We are seeing this abate and as a result some are realizing that fiscal problems will not be solved just yet .
April Revenue
Revenue in California , the biggest issuer of municipal debt , trailed Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s forecast by $ 3.6 billion in April , the state controller said last week .
In New Jersey , April income - tax payments were 25 percent below budget projections , preliminary reports showed last week .
California Treasurer Bill Lockyer has said he is concerned that speculative trading of credit default swaps , the buying and selling of the insurance contracts by investors who do n’t own the securities , may boost borrowing costs .
He said that may occur if the transactions create an unjustifiably negative perception of California ’s risk of default .
“ It ’s hard to escape the conclusion that this whole market is really a way for a bunch of rich people who have no stake in California trying to get richer by gambling with taxpayers ’ interest , ” said Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for Lockyer .
“ The prices of California credit default swaps have nothing to do with the credit quality of our bonds . ”
Lockyer has asked Bank of America Merrill Lynch , Barclays Plc , Citigroup Inc. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley , all underwriters of California bonds , whether they help investors bet against the state with credit default swaps .
He has urged Congress to include in pending financial - overhaul legislation a requirement that an investor buying a credit default swap hold a position on that security .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s traders made money every single day of the first quarter , a feat the firm has never accomplished before .
Daily trading net revenue was $ 25 million or higher in all of the first quarter ’s 63 trading days , New York - based Goldman Sachs reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today .
The firm reaped more than $ 100 million on 35 of the days , or more than half the time .
Goldman Sachs , which is facing a fraud lawsuit from the SEC related to the sale of a mortgage - linked security in 2007 , generated $ 9.74 billion in trading revenue in the first quarter , exceeding all of its Wall Street competitors .
Trading accounted for 76 percent of first - quarter revenue .
The lack of trading losses could add to the perception that Goldman Sachs has an unfair advantage in the markets , said one shareholder .
“ It will reinforce the heads we win , tails you lose mentality that people think actually exists and promotes the concept of an unfair advantage , ” said Douglas Ciocca , a managing director at Renaissance Financial Corp. in Leawood , Kansas , which oversees about $ 2 billion in assets including Goldman Sachs shares .
“ It ’s too politically charged not to , how is that possible that they only make money ? ”
Record Earnings
The bank , which reported record earnings last year , is contesting the SEC ’s lawsuit and the firm ’s executives were interrogated at a Senate subcommittee hearing last month .
Goldman Sachs , which maintains that it did nothing wrong , is also being investigated by federal prosecutors , said people familiar with the matter .
“ This is the first time we have reported zero trading loss days in a quarter , ” Samuel Robinson , a Goldman Sachs spokesman , said in an e-mail .
“ We believe it shows the strength of our customer franchise and risk management . ”
Ciocca echoed that view , saying he thinks the performance proves the strength of the firm ’s risk - management models and its ability to make money even in markets with low volatility .
“ The statistical probability of going through what we did would never favor them making money every day , ” Ciocca said .
“ It actually speaks very well of their capability to manage through different types of markets . ”
Reaching Out Ciocca said he ’s had first - hand experience of Goldman Sachs ’s efforts to reach out to clients in the wake of the SEC lawsuit to answer questions about the matter .
He said representatives from Goldman Sachs ’s asset - management division contacted his firm during the last week of April even though they had n’t been in touch for a year before that .
“ It was tactical , it was appropriate , it was n’t patronizing , it was very sincere , ” Ciocca said .
In its SEC filing today , Goldman Sachs said it is expecting further litigation related to sales of collateralized debt obligations .
“ We anticipate that additional putative shareholder derivative actions and other litigation may be filed , and regulatory and other investigations and actions commenced against us with respect to offering of CDOs , ” the bank said .
The company also laid out in the filing a worst - case scenario of what could happen if the firm does n’t resolve the SEC case and ca n’t obtain appropriate waivers from relevant regulators .
Confessions of an Urban Cyclist
I hate to admit it out loud … but as an Urban Cyclist here in Toronto , I actually enjoy city traffic !
Now most people can derive vicarious thrills from the safety of sofa ’s or when securely held in by seatbelts , but I ’ve come to only appreciate a true challenge if I know I ’m risking something real .
Of course I would never endanger others , and only ever gamble with my own hide , bike , and pelt because the constant challenge of NEVER impacting the smooth flow of people and traffic around me is what keeps me honest .
But that ’s not the main reason that I can enjoy traffic …
It ’s mainly because , like almost all bicycle riders in the city , I actually bend the rules just enough to make MUCH better time through the downtown core by slipping past those who need to queue up at signal lights , and crawl along in traffic .
I also get enormous satisfaction from the challenges of slaloming through obstacles and dangers , and putting my ass on the line with every calculated gamble I make .
Since the consequences for a misstep by a Cyclist will always be far worse , the hard pavement keeps me dead honest .
But I digress …
Let ’s get back to finding our way past our collective hatred of Traffic …
Like most people who live within 50 miles of an off - ramp , I ’ve got some issues to deal with when it comes our prevailing “ Car Culture ” and all the traffic , dirt , and destruction that comes from it .
I do n’t hate traffic because I get to breathe in more than my fair share of exhaust and dust just so that my lungs can feed my legs .
Nor because my brain balks at the concept off wasting hours each day stuck in the traffic that takes the pleasure out of driving …
Rather my disdain stems from what our prevailing “ Car Culture ” does to otherwise rationale citizens , and what it says about us as people .
What can we learn from Traffic ?
Like most Commuters might already suspect , people ’s poor behavior in traffic might actually a reflection of what ’s wrong with our self - absorbed Society in general !
Luckily for a cynic like me , this same analogy ( Traffic reflecting Society ) also offers us some hope for Humanity as well .
Because in searching for real solutions to traffic , we might figure out how to make Society work better in the process !
Effectively , the traffic conditions , congestion , and ecological damages that affect all our lives could force us to collectively figure out how to live more peacefully and productively with each other .
Since by all estimates , we ’re looking at 65 % increases in urban traffic over the next decade , ( and double that increase in smaller communities ! ) , this dilemma could also serve as a kick - start in developing not only new automotive and communications technologies ( CB radio revival ? ) , but also new educational programs for drivers , and even encourage new socio-political views .
Mass Transit might not be the final solution in it ’s current forms , but if people see enough trains moving past them while stuck in traffic , their basic logic should kick in eventually and prompt some progress around the frustrations and failures of our current Transportation methods , and ultimately improve Modern Life in general .
This future outlook would be the end of my positive spin on ‘ traffic ’ if it was n’t for all the sobering facts and destructive side - effects that continue to pile up .
Since traffic “ accidents ” have killed almost half a million people in United States in the past decade , and we clearly ca n’t just sit back and let this experiment in social engineering play itself out over more time …
Especially with stats to show that road rage incidents are rising at an alarming rate .
Basically , there are just too damned many dangerous and pervasive acts of selfish stupidity that grossly outweigh the much more rare acts of decency and Humanity between drivers .
Perhaps this is all due to the fact that shared public roads are essentially open laboratories for these ongoing social experiments that use live Humans as test subjects – Humans who are all legally allowed to drive dangerous vehicles that can wreak havoc , and destroy lives , by doing nothing more than proving that they ’re capable of parallel parking , and finding the turn signal at least once during a driving test .
A test that grants lifetime privileges , and requires no refresher courses , or followups to check against sloppy habits .
So where do we go from here ?
Despite that ridiculously low barrier to entry for Drivers , I still have faith that some greater good can come from this big sloppy social experiment .
I firmly believe that by figuring out how to work better together behind the wheel , and somehow rid ourselves of the road hazards ( and self - absorbed or sociopathic menaces ) that exist on our shared roadways , we can actually , and collectively , pave the way to a better Society !
Yet , before you dismiss me as a Dreamer , let ’s establish a baseline for Reality first …
Which will also explain how to start “ Loving Traffic ” !
Let ’s start with the differences between “ Us ” and “ Them ” by CLICKING HERE
Yesterday , we reported on a great movement by the non-profit organization One Laptop Per Child to focus on providing affordable tablet devices to under - privileged children .
After seeing that these tablet devices would initially be offering Android as their operating systems , we immediately took notice .
One thing we could n’t find , however , was a picture of how these devices might look .
Thankfully , OLPC has provided some prototype renderings of what they expect the tablet devices would look like when they show them off in January 2011 at CES .
The tablets share the same funky designs as the laptops they also manufacture .
We also learned that they are going to be aiming for $ 75 – a great price that puts it considerably lower than the $ 99.99 they were aiming at before .
The tablet will have a 9 - inch screen ( bigger than some of the high - end offerings out there ! )
What do you think of it ?
These will be aimed at children , of course , but with Android being used to power these devices , is it going to be one you keep your eye on ?

The Loop current that flows through the Gulf of Mexico is not likely to move toward the Macondo oil spill , Platts Oilgram News reported Tuesday quoting a top scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
Charlie Henry , an oil spill expert and NOAA 's support site coordinator with the U.S. Coast Guard , indicated that he does not expect the approximately 5,000 b/d of oil leaking from Macondo well to enter the current .
The Loop current , which flows clockwise and is part of the Gulf Stream , largely governs the movement of water in the Gulf of Mexico .
Platts stated that the current travels south of Macondo , which is in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 , and that NOAA does not expect the current to move closer to the well site .
Henry explained that " strong " northern cold fronts appear with extended winds this time of year , reducing the potential for the oil slick to connect with the Loop current .
So my cousin [ Joe , 27 ] has a situation .
He was dating a female [ Denise , 24 ] and had a child out of wedlock in 2005 .
They continued their relationship up until Spring of 2006 .
Although they were broken up , they remain active and shared custody of the child .
In 2007 Denise , decided to move to Georgia because she was getting kicked out of her apartment , since her Grandmother had property in GA she moved there TEMPORALLY .
Six months after the moved she ran away from GA ( without the grandmother 's knowledge ) back to FL .
In December of 2007 , Denise called Joe and told him that she no longer would be able to care for the child and she needed him to take physical custody while she tries to get her life together .
He with no hesitation agreed .
Joe and the child lived in the same home for a year or so with no help from Denise .
It became clear that she would come by and visit with the child only when she makes appointments to get welfare , once her actions became clear , she would go to DRASTIC measures to get the child ( Ex ; calling the police , filing emergency pickup order with the courts and then 2 days later return the child back to Joe ) .
But in late 2009 , Denise showed up the Joe 's fathers house ( it was spring break and all the grand kids were there ) , she made up some story that she was going to take the child to the doctor 's ( all without Joe 's knowledge ) and would return him later on that day .
She then went on a local news channel and cried out to the world that her and child were living out of their car and that she needed help .
YES , REALLY !!
How upset were we .
When we finally got in touch with her , she said the only reason why she did that was because she was told that once they place them in a shelter she was be able to get a housing voucher in 3 months all this via text message .
Not being able to get what she wants from the government .
She ran away from the people trying to stabilize a home for the child .
Joe filed an Emergency Custody order with the courts .
He was denied because she wasnt able to prove paternity ( his name was on the birth certificate ) .
Once he got that straighten out .
Denise again , return the child to Joe because she had no where else to go .
On the notation that she was homeless Joe convince his grandmother to take her in .
She did , for about 3 months .
After leaving Joe 's grandmothers home ( while they were sleeping ) .
Denise came and asked for the child .
Once again , she then disappeared .
Early April
Joe received a letter saying that he is being ordered to pay child support and today they are ordering him to pay almost $ 300.00 a month .
He is unemployed at this time ( doing a training without pay ) and the bills him and his wife along with a newborn , he can not afford $ 300.00 a month .
By the way the courts have no idea where she is and she did not show up to court .
They are basically living on his wife salary which really isnt that much .
What should I suggest to him to do ?
Maybe file a modification ?
Legally , what should he do ?
What should he file ?
:: SIDE NOTE : :
Personally , I think it is VERY sad that the law is on the mother 's side no matter the situation ..
Denise is an embrassment to me as a woman , has ONE child is clueless on what to do .
Trying to get on every free ride possible , instead of getting up off your a** , and look for a job .
Or do one better go to school .
Show your child something postive .
It breaks my heart , when I spoke the child ( 4 years old ) , he crys and says that he is missing out on his new baby brother , and on all the fun .
He says as clear as day " I ask my mommy , everyday to go to my daddy 's house " .
He is hurting in all this .
But society views the mother as the angel .
Something got to give .
SMH !!
A 40 - year - old criminology student with a special interest in Jack the Ripper was charged Thursday by British police in the deaths of three prostitutes , including one victim whose death from a crossbow bolt to the head was captured on security camera .
Local media reported the security footage shows Suzanne Blamires , 36 , being chased in a corridor outside her flat in Bradford , England and knocked to the floor .
Her pursuer leaves briefly and re-enters the shot with a crossbow in his hands .
He then shoots her in the head .
Moments later , Blamires 's corpse is dragged out of the frame .
The assailant returns to her apartment and removes several garbage bags full of material .
Police believe that Blamires 's body was dismembered and thrown into a nearby river .
Human remains were discovered in the water Tuesday about 5 km from Blamires 's home .
The Telegraph reported that they included a human head in a rucksack .
The killing took place early Saturday morning .
The footage was discovered Monday morning by a building superintendent reviewing tape from the weekend .
Stephen Griffiths was arrested that afternoon .
Police charged Griffiths with the murders of Blamires and two other prostitutes in the last year .
He will appear in court Friday .
Griffiths has told the police that he ate at least some of his victims , the Times of London reported .
Thus far , authorities and neighbours have painted a portrait of Griffiths that verges on clichéd .
He was studying criminology , with an emphasis on homicide , and told acquaintances that he was doing “ a PhD in Jack the Ripper . ”
He had a fascination with Nazi symbology and famous serial killers that he expressed online under the handle “ Ven Pariah . ”
“ Humanity is not merely a biological condition .
It is also a state of mind , ” Griffiths / Pariah wrote in one post .
“ On that basis I am a pseudo - human at best .
A demon at worst . ”
Locals told reporters that Griffiths was a familiar presence in the neighbourhood because of his habitual outfit of round glasses and black leather overcoat .
He was known as a loner who kept up to 100 rats at a time in a large trunk to feed his pet lizards .
According to witnesses , 40 heavily armed police stormed Griffiths ' apartment with a battering ram Monday afternoon .
He was dragged out and handcuffed at gunpoint .
“ As he was taken away he had his usual cold expression on his face .
There was no shock , surprise or emotion .
The only thing he was bothered about was the police locking his door properly , ” an unnamed neighbour told the Times .
He used the Internet to try to find a girlfriend , and joined The Guardian 's dating site in December 2008 , exchanging emails with a woman .
At the time of Griffiths 's arrest , detectives had found no physical trace of three prostitutes reported missing over the previous year .
But after the discovery of Blamires remains Tuesday , her death was quickly linked to the disappearance of two other prostitutes , Shelley Armitage and Susan Rushworth .
Police may also probe the deaths of three other women in the area .
The Daily Telegraph reported Griffiths had been treated in hospital for psychiatric problems .
The same streets that Griffiths is now suspected of stalking were the hunting grounds of the Yorkshire Ripper in the 1970s .
Peter Sutcliffe , a 34 - year - old truck driver when arrested in 1981 , was convicted of 13 murders and seven attempted murders .
Capitalism is bad for working - class people .
Unregulated capitalism is even worse , particularly for black and brown citizens and immigrants who suffer the additional burden of systemic racial , ethnic and gender discrimination .
So says a new study by Brandeis University ’s Institute on Assets and Social Policy .
The study shows a dramatic quadrupling of the wealth gap between African American and their white counterparts in the two decades since 1984 .
The study tracked median wealth between whites and blacks .
” The greatest wealth produced in this period accrues primarily to highest income whites , ” says the study .
This group was the chief beneficiariy of Republican tax cuts .
Several causes are seen as contributing to the unequal outcomes : tax cuts on investment income , tax deductions for home mortgages and patterns of discrimination in housing , credit and labor markets .
Growing debt as a result of predatory high cost home loans is also seen as one the chief causes .
The size of the wealth gap is startling .
“ Measured in 2007 dollars , the disparity in assets increased $ 75,000 on average , from $ 20,000 to $ 95,000 over the 23 - year period .
At least one in four black households had no assets , ” writes the LA Times .
Significantly this economic racism affects African Americans across class lines , which saw almost no wealth increase even among higher income brackets .
“ The study found that even as white families saw their financial assets grow from a median value of $ 22,000 in 1984 to $ 100,000 in 2007 , black families experienced only the slightest growth in wealth during this same period , ” continues the LA Times .
Median wealth does account for class differences among a given population and may overstate wealth accumulation among working - class whites , given the stupendous capital accumulation of wealthy white elites .
The study however does point out that “ economic stagnation and decline was experienced by both low wealth whites and low wealth African Americans . ”
Still , one if four African Americans had no assets at all .
On the other hand African Americans at the higher end of the income bracket lost ground during this same period leading the study to conclude that “ African Americans who have worked hard at well paying jobs to achieve the American Dream are still not able to achieve the wealth of their peers in the workforce , which translates into very different life chances . ”
The new consumer protection agency contained in the recently passed financial reform legislation is seen as an important potential safeguard .
It does not however target wealth building measures .
Thomas Shapiro one of the study thinks more is necessary , including special targeting measures , say the Times :
“ Shapiro said while he is in favor of the ‘ general ideas that frame ’ the provisions for such an agency in the proposed financial reform bill , he hopes the agency would take on more of an advocacy role and have more autonomy than contained in the current proposal .
Wealth building policies , he recommends , should carry provisions to ‘ target … families of color . ' ”
The Brandeis study only indirectly refers to the double digit unemployment among African Americans that has been a consistent presence throughout the 23 years it tracked economic data .
It does not address the racial wage differential .
The Great Recession which has seen severe worsening of unemployment , foreclosure and wealth loss is sure to make these matters worse .
The subprime crisis has precipitated the biggest wealth loss in Black and Latino history in the United States .

The frog 's habitat is less than three square kilometres in size
A new species of " brightly coloured frog " has been discovered in a remote peak in the southern part of India , scientists have told BBC News .
This reddish orange amphibian , spotted in the Eravaikulam National Park of the Western Ghats mountain range , has been named Raorchestes resplendens .
The scientists found the frog at an altitude of 2,698 m above sea level on the Anaimudi peak .
It inhabits a very small area of less than three square kilometres .
The discovery was made by a team of scientists including Dr S D Biju , from the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Delhi .
His collaborators were Yogesh Shouche of the National Centre for Cell Sciences in Pune ; S Dutta from North Orissa University , Franky Bossuyt of the Free University of Brussels , Belgium and Alain Dubois of the France - based organisation Reptiles et Amphibians .
The frogs have swellings , " almost like a toad "
The frog was initially identified back in 2001 .
Dr Biju , who led the authentication study , explained that it took almost a decade to show , via careful study of its anatomy and genome , that this brilliantly coloured specimen was in fact a new species .
" This new species of frog has got extremely short limbs and multiple glands and swellings almost like a toad , " Dr Biju told BBC News .
The species is a unique new member of the tree frog group , he explained .
It is the only tree frog to have what the researchers call " macro glands " .
Mysterious glands
The purpose of these glands is uncertain , and the scientists are now carrying out further studies of their role and function .
The team 's first step in confirming the frog as a news species was to study its breeding behaviour , comparing it to more than 200 species of frogs living in South East Asia .
" This took almost seven years , " said Dr Biju .
Molecular labelling techniques were also used to distinguish this species from the other varieties .
The team also made the genome map of the new specimen available via the International Gene Bank , so it could be verified and studied further by other researchers .
Tribute to a pioneer
In naming the newly discovered species Raorchestes resplendens , the scientists have paid tribute to a pioneer in the field of herpetology - the study of amphibians .
Franky Bossuyt , a member of the team chose the first part of the name in honour of late Professor C R Narayan Rao , a herpetologist who was internationally renowned for his contribution to the study of amphibians in India .
The second part , resplendens , comes from the Latin word meaning brilliantly coloured or glittering and is based on the bright reddish - orange colouration of the frog 's body .
According to the observations made by the scientists , females of the new species may mate with multiple males and possibly breed more than once in a single season .
The tree frog also has extremely short limbs .
" [ These ] have resulted in a much more pronounced crawling behaviour , " said the researchers .
The scientists also observed that the frog buried its eggs under the moss - covered forest floor , deep inside the base of bamboo clumps .
Tiny habitat
These frogs may be represent a classic example of " point endemism " in amphibians , says Dr Biju .
This means that the species lives in a very limited range of environmental conditions , making it very vulnerable to extinction .
The team say that fewer than one thousand of these frogs survive in a unique ecosystem that is less than three square kilometres in size .
The scientists discovered the frog on the Anaimudi peak in Eravikulam National Park
Its habitat will require " special attention " in order to conserve the species , says the team .
About one third the world 's amphibians are under threat from extinction .
Habitat destruction due to human activity identified as a primary cause of their numbers being so drastically reduced .

April 1st Post Mortem
This year I decided to finally do what I planned for quite some time : an April 's fool joke .
( I did contribute a bit to PEP 3117 , but that does not count ) .
This year I decided to make a little joke about Python microframeworks ( micro- web - frameworks ? ) and wrote a little thing , and created a website and screencast for it : denied.immersedcode.org .
I did expect some responses to that , but I was a little bit surprised by some of them though .
So here my full disclosure of the april 's fool prank , what people thought of it and what my conclusion is .
The Motivation
It seems like everybody likes microframeworks .
Not sure what caused that , but there are plenty of them .
web.py ( Python ) and camping ( Ruby ) where the first of their kind I think .
Later others followed and it seemed that people love the idea of software that does not have dependencies and comes in a single file .
So I thought , I can do the same and make fun of it , so let 's just create a framework based on existing technology and throw everything together in a large single file : denied was born .
I just bundled a Werkzeug , simplejson and Jinja2 into a single file and added a bit of code that glues them together .
The Implementation Denied consists of 160 lines of code that implements a very basic WSGI application based on Werkzeug and Jinja2 that incorporates really stupid ideas into the code : it stores state in the module and uses implicitly defined data structures
there is a function that accepts both a template filename or a template source string as the same parameter and guesses based on the contents of the string .
it introspects the interpreter frame to figure out the name of the function that called a template render function to automagically guess the name of the template .
it uses automatic function registration and decorators to register URL rules .
I do n't want to go into details why I hate everything there , that would be a blog post of its own , but I want to point out that nearly all of these " features " were inspired by existing microframeworks .
I did not expect anyone to detect from these things that the framework was an April 's fool joke , but I thought that the obfuscated sourcecode and the fact that it was basically just a zipfile would be obvious .
However I got more than one mail asking me to release the sourcecode of it because people want to hack on it .
Right now it has more than 50 followers and 6 forks on github which is insane if you keep in mind that Jinja2 and Werkzeug have less than 30 on bitbucket .
Thinking about it a bit more made me realize that camping back in the days was in fact delivered as obfuscated 2 K file of Ruby code .
Not sure why _why did that , but he was a man of mysteries so probably just because he thought it was fun .
The Screencast
To make the joke more obvious I created a screencast that would showcase the framework and do pretty much everything wrong .
For that I created a persona called " Eirik Lahavre " that implemented the framework and did the screencast .
Originally I wanted that person to be a Norwegian web developer but unfortunately the designated speaker disappeared so I had to ask a friend of mine ( Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven ) to record it for me but he told me he can't do a norwegian accent so he went with French and Eirik Lundbergh became Eirik Lahavre .
I lay flat on the floor when I listened to the recording for the first time because he 's actually Dutch :)
The Website For the website I collected tongue - in - cheek fake endorsements from popular Python programmers and added one for myself that was just bashing the quality of the code .
I 'm afraid I sort of made myself popular by bashing other people 's web frameworks , at least reading reddit , hacker news and various mailinglists leaves that impression so I thought it would be fun to emphasize that a bit more on that website .
This also comes very close to the website of web.py which shows a few obviously bad comments from popular Python hackers .
Furthermore the website shows a useless and short hello world example which shows nothing about how the framework works .
This was inspired by every other microframework website out there .
It claims RESTfulnes and super scaling capabilities , kick - ass performance and describes the developer of the project ( the fictional Eirik Lahavre ) as god of Python code and coming from a professional company .
The Details For everything in the joke I did what I would never do .
I even went so far to create the HTML of the website against my own code style , to use deprecated HTML tags in the presentation , claim to use XHTML even though the doctype and mimetype was wrong .
The screencast also claims that flat files were a scalable NoSQL database and that missing form helpers were something positive because it means full flexibility .
The Impact The screencast was downloaded over 10,000 times and the website got more than 50.000 hits .
The link is still tweeted and I never got that many retweets for anything related to my projects so far .
The fake project on github has more than 50 followers and 6 forks .
Quite a few people took the project serious from the few comments on reddit and the emails I got .
What I learned
It does not matter how good intended or well written a project is , the bold marketing is king .
Being present on github is huge .
As much as I love bitbucket and mercurial , but there is an immense difference between having your project on github or bitbucket , and I 'm afraid that no matter what bitbucket does or what the mercurial people do , they will never even come close to github in terms of user base people following your code and contributing .
Small snippets of code on the website are killer .
Werkzeug tries to be honest by not showcasing a small " Hello World " application but something more complex to show the API , but that does not attract users .
Jinj a2 does not even try to show anything at all , you have to look at the documentation to see how it looks like .
That drives potential users away .
Do n't be honest : be bold .
Nobody will check your claims anyway and if they do n't live up to the promise , you can still say that your test setup was or your understanding of the problem is different .
There is no such thing as a " bad endorsement " .
People took it as a good sign that I did not give the project my blessing .
The Small Library I 'm currently trying to learn everything about game development and 3D graphics I possibly can .
I found out that the best way to learn that is to write a minimal engine from scratch .
Right now I 'm doing that by looking at other source code and reading books and writing the most minimal code I can .
I always try to prove to myself : existing code is way to complex , that has to be easier .
After the third refactoring and improvements I usually end up with something as complex as the original code or the explanation from the book .
There is a reason why things are as complex as they are and not easier .
I think the same is true for microframeworks .
The reason why everybody is that crazy about having a single file implementing whatever is necessary to implement a web application is because you can claim it 's easy and you can understand it .
However things are not that easy in reality .
I am pretty sure that other framework developers will agree .
web.py is the perfect example for that .
It started as a library in 1000 lines of code in a single file , and look at what it became .
It 's not that simple any more .
Many of the initial design decisions that were plain wrong were reverted .
Such as abusing the print statement for outputting values to the browser .
There were good reasons why nobody before web.py used print to output strings , yet web .py did it that way .
And a few versions later it disappeared again for good .
Joan Rivers : A Piece of Work ( June 11 )
Early in this documentary about the life of Joan Rivers , the comedian herself pulls out a stack of date books .
She opens up one from the ' 80s and it's full of scribble : bookings , appearances , meetings , lunches , breakfasts .
This is how a book should look , she says .
She pulls out her current one :
It 's mostly white .
She looks into the camera with a look of depression and disgust and you realize that everything she 's done over the last 60 years —
The Tonight Show , the QVC hawking , the red - carpet riffing , an appearance at a comedy club in Manhattan — has been done with the book in mind .
If it 's not full , she is n't .
The rest of the documentary shows her preparing for Celebrity Apprentice , doing stand - up at a resort in Wisconsin ( at which she destroys a heckler , then feels horrible about it ) , and writing and rehearsing a show about her life that opens in London .
This movie is about a woman who works hard at 76 for the same reason someone works hard at 22 : fear .
A surprisingly excellent film about an admirable and underrated woman .
Graphene could someday replace silicon as a semiconductor material and make our chips smaller and faster , except for one tiny detail : it ’s been rather hard to mess with its electronic properties .
Until now .
" We have experimentally realized and theoretically investigated , for the first time , perfect atomic wires in graphene , " Ivan Oleynik , one of the two University of South Florida professors behind the discovery , told Wired.com .
Atomic wires are short chains of atoms that conduct electricity and so far , they have been hard to achieve in graphene .
The researchers have found a way to introduce one - dimensional defects that are stable and in the center of a graphene sheet .
The breakthroughs could lead to more widespread applications for graphene including the ability to ultimately create faster chips and smaller gadgets .
Oleynik and his fellow researcher Matthias Batzill published a paper in Nanotechnology Journal last week , announcing their solution for controlling graphene ’s electronic properties .
To keep up with Moore 's law–which says that the number of transistors that can be affordably built into a processor doubles roughly every two years–chip makers have to keep shrinking silicon - based chips .
Intel 's latest processors , for example , use a 32 - nanometer technology to create chips .
But many researchers believe it will get increasingly difficult to manufacture smaller transistors , especially in the 10 - nanometers range .
In the last few years , graphene , a form of carbon derived from graphite oxide , has emerged as a promising alternative to silicon .
It ’s one atom thick and has phenomenal electron mobility - roughly 100 times greater than silicon .
Few months ago , IBM said its graphene - based transistors could reach speeds of 100 Ghz .
Two years ago , British scientists unveiled the world ’s smallest transistor - three times smaller than the silicon - based ones –that was made of graphene .
“ From the point of view of physics , graphene is a goldmine , ” Kostya Novoselov , a researcher at the University of Manchester who worked on that project , told Wired.com in 2008 .
But for graphene to be useful in electronic applications like integrated circuits , small defects , also known as atomic - scale imperfections , have to be introduced in the material .
" All previous attempts used so - called graphene nanoribbons , " says Oleynik , " and that could lead to chemical instabilities , since there are dangling bonds on the edges . "
Defects on nanoribbons - tiny strips of graphene - have often been inconsistent and hard to create since the edges are rough and chemically unstable .
Instead , their solution , say the researchers , is a one - dimensional defect that creates octagonal and pentagonal rings .
It acts like a metallic wire and can conduct electric current .
" Our defect is embedded into the graphene , as opposed to being on the edges , which allows for more flexibility , " says Batzill .
Graphene has become a real alternative for building atomic - scale , all - carbon based electronics , say the researchers .

I have recently written about the value of fundamentals in software development .
I am still firmly of the opinion that you need to have your fundamentals down solid , if you want to be a decent developer .
However , several people made a valid point in response to that post , in that it is often difficult to know what the fundamentals actually are ( be they macro or micro level ) .
So , I thought it would be a good idea to do an ongoing series of posts on some of the things that I consider to be fundamental – this post is the first instalment .
Being a developer this day and age , it would be almost impossible for you to avoid doing some kind of web - related work at some point in your career .
That means you will inevitably have to deal with URLs at one time or another .
We all know what URLs are about , but there is a difference between knowing URLs like a user and knowing them like a developer should know them .
As a web developer you really have no excuse for not knowing everything there is to know about URLs , there is just not that much to them .
But , I have found that even experienced developers often have some glaring holes in their knowledge of URLs .
So , I thought I would do a quick tour of everything that every developer should know about URLs .
Strap yourself in – this wo n’t take long :) .
The Structure Of A URL
This is easy , starts with HTTP and ends with .com right :) ?
Most URLs have the same general syntax , made up of the following nine parts :
< scheme>://<username >:< password>@<host >:< port>/< path >;< parameters >?< query >#< fragment >
Most URLs wo n’t contain all of the parts .
The most common components , as you undoubtedly know , are the scheme , host and path .
Let ’s have a look at each of these in turn :
scheme – this basically specifies the protocol to use to access the resource addressed by the URL ( e.g. http , ftp ) .
There are a multitude of different schemes .
A scheme is official if it has been registered with the IANA ( like http and ftp ) , but there are many unofficial ( not registered ) schemes which are also in common use ( such as sftp , or svn ) .
The scheme must start with a letter and is separated from the rest of the URL by the first : ( colon ) character .
That ’s right , the // is not part of the separator but is infact the beginning of the next part of the URL .

That ’s right , the is not part of the separator but is infact the beginning of the next part of the URL .
username – this along with the password , the host and the port form what ’s known as the authority part of the URL .
Some schemes require authentication information to access a resource this is the username part of that authentication information .
The username and password are very common in ftp URLs , they are less common in http URLs , but you do come across them fairly regularly .
– this along with the password , the host and the port form what ’s known as the authority part of the URL .
Some schemes require authentication information to access a resource this is the username part of that authentication information .
The username and password are very common in ftp URLs , they are less common in http URLs , but you do come across them fairly regularly .
password – the other part of the authentication information for a URL , it is separated from the username by another : ( colon ) character .
The username and password will be separated from the host by an @ ( at ) character .
You may supply just the username or both the username and password e.g. : ftp:// [ email protected ] / ftp://some_user : [ email protected ] /
If you do n’t supply the username and password and the URL you ’re trying to access requires one , the application you ’re using ( e.g. browser ) will supply some defaults .
host – as I mentioned , it is one of the components that makes up the authority part of the URL .
The host can be either a domain name or an IP address , as we all should know the domain name will resolve to an IP address ( via a DNS lookup ) to identify the machine we ’re trying to access .
port – the last part of the authority .
It basically tells us what network port a particular application on the machine we ’re connecting to is listening on .
As we all know , for HTTP the default port is 80 , if the port is omitted from an http URL , this is assumed .
path – is separated from the URL components preceding it by a / ( slash ) character .
A path is a sequence of segments separated by / characters .
The path basically tells us where on the server machine a resource lives .
Each of the path segments can contain parameters which are separated from the segment by a ; ( semi- colon ) character e.g. : http://www.blah.com/some;param1=foo/crazy;param2=bar/path.html
The URL above is perfectly valid , although this ability of path segments to hold parameters is almost never used ( I ’ve never seen it personally ) .
parameters – talking about parameters , these can also appear after the path but before the query string , also separated from the rest of the URL and from each other by ; characters e.g. : http://www.blah.com/some/crazy/path.html;param1=foo;param2=bar
As I said , they are not very common
query – these on the other hand are very common as every web developer would know .
This is the preferred way to send some parameters to a resource on the server .
These are key=value pairs and are separated from the rest of the URL by a ? ( question mark ) character and are normally separated from each other by & ( ampersand ) characters .
What you may not know is the fact that it is legal to separate them from each other by the ; ( semi- colon ) character as well .
The following URLs are equivalent : http://www.blah.com/some/crazy/path.html?param1=foo¶m2=bar
http://www.blah.com/some/crazy/path.html?param1=foo;param2=bar
fragment – this is an optional part of the URL and is used to address a particular part of a resource .
We usually see these used to link to a particular section of an html document .
A fragment is separated from the rest of the URL with a # ( hash ) character .
When requesting a resource addressed by a URL from a server , the client ( i.e. browser ) will usually not send the fragment to the server ( at least not where HTTP is concerned ) .
Once the client has fetched the resource , it will then use the fragment to address the relevant part .
That ’s it , all you need to know about the structure of a URL .
From now on you no longer have any excuse for calling the fragment – “ that hash link thingy to go to a particular part of the html file ” .
Special Characters
In URLs
There is a lot of confusion regarding which characters are safe to use in a URL and which are not , as well as how a URL should be properly encoded .
Developers often try to infer this stuff from general knowledge ( i.e. the / and : characters should obviously be encoded since they have special meaning in a URL ) .
This is not necessary , you should know this stuff solid – it ’s simple .
Here is the low down .
There are several sets of characters you need to be aware of when it comes to URLs .
Firstly , the characters that have special meaning within a URL are known as reserved characters , these are :
" ; " | " / " | " ? " | " : " | " @ " | " & " | " = " | " + " | " $ " | " , "
What this means is that these characters are normally used in a URL as - is and are meaningful within a URL context ( i.e. separate components from each other etc . ) .
If a part of a URL ( such as a query parameter ) , is likely to contain one of these characters , it should be escaped before being included in the URL .
I have spoken about URL encoding before , check it out , we will revisit it shortly .
The second set of characters to be aware of is the unreserved set .
It is made up of the following characters
" - " | " _ " | " . " | " ! " | " ~ " | " * " | " ' " | " ( " | " ) "
The characters can be included as - is in any part of the URL ( note that they may not be allowed as part of a particular component of a URL ) .
This basically means you do n’t need to encode / escape these characters when including them as part of a URL .
You CAN escape them without changing the semantics of a URL , but it is not recommended .
The third set to be aware of is the_ ‘ unwise ’ set_ , i.e. it is unwise to use these characters as part of a URL .
It is made up of the following characters
" { " | " } " | " | " | " \ " | " ^ " | " [ " | " ] " | " ` "
These characters are considered unwise to use in a URL because gateways are known to sometimes modify such characters , or they are used as delimiters .
That does n’t mean that these characters will always be modified by a gateway , but it can happen .
So , if you include these as part of a URL without escaping them , you do this at your own risk .
What it really means is you should always escape these characters if a part of your URL ( i.e. like a query param ) is likely to contain them .
The last set of characters is the excluded set .
It is made up of all ASCII control characters , the space character as well the following characters ( known as delimiters )
" < " | " > " | " # " | " % " | ' " '
The control characters are non-printable US - ASCII characters ( i.e. hexadecimal 00 - 1 F as well as 7 F ) .
These characters must always be escaped if they are included in a component of a URL .
Some , such as # ( hash ) and % ( percent ) have special meaning within the context of a URL ( they can really be considered equivalent to the reserved characters ) .
Other characters in this set have no printable representation and therefore escaping them is the only way to represent them .
The < , > and “ characters should be escaped since these characters are often used to delimit URLs in text .
To URL encode / escape a character we simply append its 2 character ASCII hexadecimal value to the % character .
So , the URL encoding of a space character is % 20 – we have all seen that one .
The % character itself is encoded as % 25 .
That ’s all you need to know about various special characters in URLs .
Of course aside from those characters , alpha - numerics are allowed and do n’t need to be encoded :) .
A few things you have to remember .
A URL should always be in its encoded form .
The only time you should decode parts of the URL is when you ’re pulling the URL apart ( for whatever reason ) .
Each part of the URL must be encoded separately , this should be pretty obvious , you do n’t want to try encoding an already constructed URL , since there is no way to distinguish when reserved characters are used for their reserved purpose ( they should n’t be encoded ) and when they are part of a URL component ( which means they should be encoded ) .
Lastly you should never try to double encode / decode a URL .
Consider that if you encode a URL once but try to decode it twice and one of the URL components contains the % character you can destroy your URL e.g. :
http://blah.com/yadda.html?param1=abc%613
When encoded it will look like this :
http://blah.com/yadda.html?param1=abc%25613
If you try to decode it twice you will get :
http://blah.com/yadda.html?param1=abc%613
Correct
http://blah.com/yadda.html?param1=abca3
Stuffed
By the way I am not just pulling this stuff out of thin air .
It is all defined in RFC 2396 , you can go and check it out if you like , although it is by no means the most entertaining thing you can read , I ’d like to hope my post is somewhat less dry :) .
Absolute vs Relative URLs
The last thing that every developer should know is the difference between an absolute and relative URL as well as how to turn a relative URL into its absolute form .
The first part of that is pretty easy , if a URL contains a scheme ( such as http ) , then it can be considered an absolute URL .
Relative URLs are a little bit more complicated .
A relative URL is always interpreted relative to another URL ( hence the name : ) ) , this other URL is known as the base URL .
To convert a relative URL into its absolute form we firstly need to figure out the base URL , and then , depending on the syntax of our relative URL we combine it with the base to form its absolute form .
We normally see a relative URL inside an html document .
In this case there are two ways to find out what the base is .
The base URL may have been explicitly specified in the document using the HTML tag .
If no base tag is specified , then the URL of the html document in which the relative URL is found should be treated as the base .
Once we have a base URL , we can try and turn our relative URL into an absolute one .
First , we need to try and break our relative URL into components ( i.e. scheme , authority ( host , port ) , path , query string , fragment ) .
Once this is done , there are several special cases to be aware of , all of which mean that our relative URL was n’t really relative .
if there is no scheme , authority or path , then the relative URL is a reference to the base URL
if there is a scheme then the relative URL is actually an absolute URL and should be treated as such
if there is no scheme , but there is an authority ( host , port ) , then our relative URL is likely a network path , we take the scheme from our base URL and append our “ relative ” URL to it separating the two by ://
If none of those special cases occurred then we have a real relative URL on our hands .
Now we need to proceed as follows .
we inherit the scheme , and authority ( host , port ) from the base URL
if our relative URL begins with / , then it is an absolute path , we append it to the scheme and authority we inherited from the base using appropriate separators to get our absolute URL
if relative URL does not begin with / then we take the path of from base URL , discarding everything after the last / character
we then take our relative URL and append it to the resulting path , we now need to do a little further processing which depends on the first several characters of our relative URL
if there is a ./ ( dot slash ) anywhere in a resulting path we remove it ( this means our relative URL started with ./ i.e. ./blah.html )
if there is a ../ ( dot dot slash ) anywhere in the path then we remove it as well as the preceding segment of the path i.e. all occurrences of “ /../ ” are removed , keep doing this step until no more ../ can be found anywhere in the path ( this means our relative path started with one or more ../ i.e. ../blah.html or ../../blah.html etc. )
are removed , keep doing this step until no more ../ can be found anywhere in the path ( this means our relative path started with one or more ../ i.e. ../blah.html or ../../blah.html etc. ) if the path ends with .. then we remove it and the preceding segment of the path , i.e. “ /.. ” is removed ( this means our relative path was .. ( dot dot ) )
is removed ( this means our relative path was .. ( dot dot ) ) if the path ends with a .
( dot ) then we remove it ( this most likely means our relative path was . ( dot ) )
At this point we simply append any query string or fragment that our relative URL may have contained to our URL using appropriate separators and we have finished turning our relative URL into an absolute one .
Here are some examples of applying the above algorithm :
By Jeremy Lott - April 20 , 2010
When it was announced last Sunday that Rep. Ron Paul had lost the presidential straw poll at the Southern Republican Leadership Conference , many of his supporters were either livid or kicking themselves .
On the Campaign for Liberty blog , Matt Collins wrote that Wilson - Research Strategies , the firm that conducted the poll , should be made to answer certain questions if it is " interested in retaining an aura of integrity , transparency , and credibility " in the future .
Other Paulistas noted that several dozen supporters got to New Orleans just a little too late to have their ballots counted .
Such are the agonies when you lose to Mitt Romney by only one vote .
Paul supporters showed up in force to CPAC in Washington , D.C. , this year and routed Romney 's recruits .
This was instantly dismissed by most experts as a fluke .
Even though the CPAC straw poll is all about gauging conservative activist enthusiasm , and even though Romney 's wins in the past stemmed from his campaign 's willingness to fly or bus in supporters , Paul 's victory was seen as suspect .
After all , when the poll results were announced , there was some booing .
So Paulistas decided to prove that they could win in a more mainstream Republican gathering .
At the SLRC , they very nearly pulled it off , so some recriminations are understandable .
Before they could regroup for the next contest , the polling firm Rasmussen Reports did them a great favor .
The firm surveyed 1,000 voters and found Paul losing not by one vote but one percent , but this time to President Barack Obama .
One percent is more or less within the margin of error , so USA Today 's On Politics blog reported , " Ron Paul even with Obama in hypothetical 2012 race , " and opined , " Change is definitely in the air . "
Paul supporters got more good news this week .
Ron 's son Rand Paul had been considered a long shot when he announced that he was running for the Republican nomination for Senate in Kentucky .
Now he looks like the best bet to win the nomination and the general election .
Retiring Kentucky Senator Jim Bunning endorsed Rand Paul to succeed him , calling him " the only true conservative " in the race .
There are definitely problems ahead if the elder Paul decided to throw his hat in again for the GOP presidential nomination .
In its explanation of the results , Rasmussen warned that " Obama earns 79 % support from Democrats , but Paul gets just 66 % of GOP votes . "
In fact , " 26 % of GOP voters think Paul shares the values of most Republican voters throughout the nation , but 25 % disagree . "
( And 49 % ca n't make up their minds . )
It is those voters " not affiliated with either major party give Paul a 47 % to 28 % edge over the president . "
When it comes down to crunch time , Paul may not even decide to run for president , and he 's said as much in interviews .
He is not a young man and seems more interested in building up his organizations as a way of shaping the future of the conservative movement and the Republican Party .
But right now , he can savor the moment , his moment .
When Paul ran for president in 2008 , experts scoffed at his constant criticism of the Federal Reserve .
Now , every member of the House Republican Caucus is behind his push to audit the Fed .
He warned that rampant budgetary and monetary mismanagement would plunge the country into a very deep recession , and it has .
While most Republicans still do n't agree with him about Iraq and isolationism , there is a growing sense that Iraq made possible the current Democratic majority , and Obamacare , and all sorts of other things that they do n't like .
Paul 's stubbornness on these matters has earned him either admiration or grudging respect from a lot of people .
What 's more , Americans are becoming more , not less , sympathetic to his point of view , at least on domestic issues .
Rasmussen Reports also found " 24 % of voters now consider themselves a part of the tea party movement , an eight - point increase from a month ago " and " 48 % of voters now say the average tea party member is closer to their views than Obama is . "
In many respects , it was Ron Paul 's last presidential run that got this party started .
Joining the giant aluminum alloy plates used on large ships and spacecraft usually requires teams of workers with handheld arc welders .
But having to rely on human labor can cause costly delays , and manufacturing companies are eager to develop new methods .
One of the most promising is friction - stir welding , which uses a spinning rod to generate enough heat to soften the aluminum and to push the alloy 's molecules together with 15,000 pounds of pressure .
A friction - stir welding machine moving at 8 inches a minute can join inch - thick alloy plates in a single pass , while traditional arc - welding would require over a dozen welds to complete the same seam .
But the technology does have a downside :
The machines need extra hardware to absorb the intense pressure , known as Z - force .
Bulky and expensive , the hardware limits the length of the welds and often relegates friction - stir welding to big - dollar government programs in need of precise joins , such as the Navy 's Littoral Combat Ship and NASA 's Ares I - X test rocket , which lifted off in late 2009 .
A new tool called a bobbin may help make the method mainstream by simultaneously joining the plates and absorbing pressure .
Next - generation friction - stir welding devices could weld steel , combine heterogeneous metals and make welds of indefinite length by perching bobbins on dollies that move along lengthy seams .
HOW IT WORKS :
Friction - stir welding joins metal with heat and high pressure .
A new tool called a bobbin could make the technique quicker and more practical .
1 . The bobbin's shoulders , working like a vise , stabilize 1 - inch - thick aluminum alloy plates .
2 . The rotating head , spinning at 275 rpm , generates friction heat that softens the metal along the path of the weld .
3 . The pressure that merges the metal is absorbed by the bobbin instead of by separate machinery .
4 . The rotation of the tool leaves concentric circles on both sides of the joint .

BP 'may stem oil with golf balls and tyres '
Hundreds of miles of booms are being laid along the coastline BP officials desperate to stem a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico are considering stuffing the well with golf balls and tyres , it was revealed .
BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said the so - called " junk shot " of debris was one option after previous attempts to stem the flow failed .
A growing slick from the BP - leased rig is threatening an environmental disaster along US coasts .
Some 5,000 barrels ( 210,000 gallons ) of oil a day are flowing into the sea .
Mr Suttles said it may be possible to stem the flow by blocking the well 's failed blowout preventer .
" We have some pipe work on the blowout preventer , and if we can open certain valves on that we could inject basically just rubber and other type of material into [ it ] to plug it up , not much different to the way you might plug up a toilet , " he said .
Admiral Thad Allen of the US Coast Guard said it could plug the main leak .
" They 're going to take a bunch of debris , shredded up tyres , golf balls and things like that , and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak , " he told CBS television .
ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL SLICK
Booms have been partly successful although rough seas have washed oil over them Some controlled burning of oil has taken place , but it causes serious air pollution About 325,000 gallons of dispersant have been used , although scientists warn it may kill marine life A relief well is being drilled but could take many weeks A huge steel funnel suffered a build - up of ice - like crystals and had to be put aside However , experts have warned that any further damage to the blowout preventer - a huge valve system meant to turn the oil off - could see it shooting out at 12 times the current rate .
In other developments , a BP official told the Associated Press news agency on Monday that the company had received US government approval to continuously pump dispersant chemicals underwater .
BP spokesman Mark Proegler said engineers began pumping dispersant on the site on Monday morning .
Thousands of gallons of dispersant have been dropped over oil on the surface , but have not been tried at such depths before .
Scientists and fishermen have expressed concern that the chemicals could kill marine life .
BP revealed on Monday that the oil spill had cost the company $ 350 m ( £ 233 m ) so far .
It did not speculate on the final bill , which many analysts expect to run into tens of billions of dollars .
Efforts thwarted The Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire and sank following an explosion last month .
The resulting slick has so far thwarted all efforts by BP and US officials to bring it under control .
A 98 - tonne concrete - and - steel funnel lowered 5,000ft ( 1,500 m ) to the seabed had been BP 's best hope to contain the main leak while it tried to stop it altogether by drilling relief wells nearby .
But a build - up of gas hydrates - crystalline water - based solids resembling ice - inside the funnel blocked the exit at the top , and it had to be put aside on Saturday .
Mr Suttles said other options being discussed were to make a smaller containment dome or to tap into the broken riser pipe and take the oil directly to the surface .
Presidential review
The broken pipe is almost a mile ( 1.6 km ) down on the ocean floor with little visibility for engineers using remotely controlled vehicles .
Although the Deepwater Horizon was operated by Transocean , BP is responsible for the clean - up .
Wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico is already suffering
The slick has so far covered about 2,000 sq miles ( 5,200 sq km ) .
US President Barack Obama is due to meet senior officials at the White House on Monday to review BP 's efforts .
A sheen from the edge of the slick is surrounding island nature reserves off Louisiana and tar balls have reached as far as the Alabama coast .
The low - lying region contains vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs and is an important migratory stop for many species of rare birds .
Louisiana 's fishing industry has ground to a halt in certain areas due to health concerns about polluted fish .
Booms and bundles of absorbent material have been laid along shorelines to try to protect them .
Teams are also filling sandbags which the Louisiana National Guard will airlift on Monday to five spots along a threatened stretch of coastline .
The first two oiled birds rescued from the spill have been cleaned and were due to be released back into the wild later in the day .
The birds - a gannet and a pelican - were to be freed at Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge in Florida .

Three years ago , it seemed as if the American withdrawal from Iraq might resemble the chaotic scenes that accompanied the fall of Saigon .
That ’s one reason why I spent months looking into the possible fate of Iraqis working for the U.S. there — because there was n’t any plan for them in the event of an American evacuation .
By the end of August , all U.S. combat brigades will be out of Iraq .
The good news is that there wo n’t be any frantic helo - lifts from a Green Zone landing pad .
Tens of thousands of troops will make an orderly exit , along with untold thousands of vehicles and tons of other equipment .
The Pentagon , with its supreme organizational skills , will be able to track every coffee pot as it makes its way out of Iraq and across the ocean back to these shores .
And yet — here ’s the bad news — for all the lead time and careful preparation , no one has made any plans for what to do with the Iraqis who work for the U.S. once the majority of American troops have gone home .
According to Kirk Johnson , the young former government official who founded the List Project , at least ten or twenty thousand Iraqis are still employed by the U.S. government or American contractors .
There are six thousand interpreters on the payroll of a company called GLS , and the majority of them live on American bases because commuting to work is too dangerous for them .
The U.S. is shutting down three hundred bases across Iraq , most of them small combat outposts .
Once they ’re closed , the Iraqis who lived and worked on them will have nowhere to go .
Over the past couple of years , Congress and the State Department have accelerated the process of giving America ’s Iraqi allies visas to the U.S.
But the process remains slow — it can take at least a year — and only a small fraction of eligible Iraqis have actually resettled here .
Evidence suggests that Iraqi Christians get to the front of the line , along with family members of refugees who are already here .
Once the troops are gone , there is going to be a spike — perhaps a sharp one — in applicants .
A lot of these Iraqis will be in danger , and some of them will probably be targeted , during the long period of waiting for their applications to be reviewed .
Iraqis who work with Americans are at the top of the death list of jihadi groups , whose umbrella organization , the Islamic State of Iraq , recently declared its intent to settle scores as the Americans leave .
As Johnson says , “ Two clocks are running : the clock on the application for resettlement , and the clock on withdrawal . ”
The Obama Administration needs to come up with a fast - track plan for resettling the Iraqis who sacrificed the most for the U.S. and will be in greatest danger once we ’re gone .
The visa - application process will be inadequate to the need and the threat that will accompany American withdrawal .
The U.S. government has no idea of the identities and whereabouts of all the Iraqis who work for Americans there , or of which ones feel so insecure that they will want to be resettled here .
The List Project has just issued a report that calls attention to this brewing crisis .
The report looks at previous cases of occupation armies leaving behind local allies in the wake of their exit ( including the British in Basra a couple of years ago ) , and it ’s not an encouraging picture .
The Project ’s recommendation is for some version of the Guam option , based on the 1996 U.S. evacuation of six thousand endangered Iraqis from Kurdistan to Guam , where they were processed for refugee status before being resettled in America .
( Eric Schwartz , who now runs the refugee bureau at the State Department , was on Clinton ’s National Security Council staff in 1996 and was the point man for the Guam airlift — so the institutional knowledge is readily available . )
With the List Project report drawing attention in Washington , there ’s a possibility of congressional hearings over the summer .
They ca n’t come too soon .
“ Countries tend to lose interest in their wars in the final years — it happens all the time , ” Johnson told me earlier this week .
“ You stop paying attention to the details , and what happens is you abandon the ones who helped you .
I ’d like to think we ’re not going to do that this time . ”
“ We are scrapping three years of Flash development and betting the company on HTML5 , ” Scribd CTO Jared Friedman told TechCrunch , “ because we believe HTML5 is a dramatically better reading experience than Flash .
Now any document can become a Web page . ”
HTML5 is the emerging browser - based standard for highly interactive Web content .
Google , Apple , and many other companies have pushed to make HTML5 a replacement for Adobe ’s Flash technology , which has a large , impossible - to - avoid presence among interactive Web sites , especially those that play music or video .
But for Scribd ’s function of hosting large text and multimedia documents in the middle of Webpages , Friedman said , Flash is disappointing because “ the document is in a box , ” just as the video in a YouTube clip is contained within its player .
Scribd ’s pending HTML5 replacement for its
Flash - based document containers will allow users to interact with the content of documents as easily and broadly as if the documents themselves were Web pages .
Scribd ’s project pre-dates Apple CEO Steve Jobs ’ high - profile dismissal of Flash from the company ’s new iPad tablet .
Friedman told TechCrunch he had been “ secretly on this project for the last six months . ”
He said that Scribd estimates 97 percent of the Web browsers currently on computers and mobile gadgets now will support the new HTML5 - based format .
That ’s because the parts of the HTML5 specifications used to lay out text and still images are years older than the still - emerging standards for video .

Australian attorneys - general are considering changes to the national computer game classification scheme but have not yet made a decision on whether an R - 18 + rating will be introduced .
Game developers and enthusiasts have been lobbying for changes to the current scheme , which has seen some violent titles banned from Australian shelves and others censored to meet MA - 15 + standards before release .
The Department of Home Affairs received more than 55,000 submissions during its public consultation on the issue and handed a report to the Standing Committee of Attorneys - General on Friday .
Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor says about 98 per cent of submissions supported an R - 18 + classification for games .
But he said the ministers needed to consider more than just the weight of numbers .
" It is also the strength of the arguments on each side , " he said .
" That is why ministers today agreed that further work needs to be done before a decision can be made .
" Censorship ministers have not yet made a decision on whether or not an R - 18 + classification for computer games should be introduced and have requested further analysis of community and expert views . "
Heated debate
Video game publishing giant Electronic Arts ( EA ) weighed into the debate before the meeting , throwing its support behind calls for an R - 18 + classification .
EA president Frank Gibeau distributed an open letter that argued the current system is a form of censorship .
" Government policies that do n't allow for the rating of mature content in video games effectively censor entertainment choices for adults , " he said .
" Adult gamers want their governments to treat them with the same respect they get as movie goers and book readers .
" Adult Australians should be allowed to choose the games they play , including those with mature themes . "
The Commonwealth , states and territories all need to agree to an R - 18 + classification for it to become a reality .
South Australian MP
Michael Atkinson was understood to have vetoed the change at earlier meetings .
He has since been replaced as the state 's attorney - general by John Rau .
Mr Rau has been reported as saying he had no preconceptions about the issue and would listen to arguments from both sides of the debate .
Twitter users insisted the R - 18 + rating had widespread support despite opposition from groups such as the Australian Christian Lobby ( ACL ) .
" Government and media need to remember that the ACL do not represent more than a handful of Australians , " @grumpymojo tweeted .
" Support of the classification is overwhelming .
Exactly how afraid should govt be of fringe group ACL ? " wrote @ Monkeytypist .
@hyarare wrote : " Surely the Att - Gens wo n't oppose it now , what kind of logical argument do they have against it ?
Not that Atkinson ever had one . "
Melbourne 's @dkeeghan said an R - 18 + rating would prevent the miscategorisation of adult games into the MA - 15 + rating .
" I think parents would think more carefully about getting R18 + games for their kids ( or at least I hope they would ) , " he wrote .
In its submission the ACL argued that the discussion paper was geared " strongly in favour of gaming interests " and that there is no widespread community support for an R - 18 + rating .
It said there was little doubt that a new classification would allow more violent games to be sold and despite the best attempts of parents , children would be able to access them .
" The solution to incorrect classification is stronger application of existing standards , not to introduce a softer standard altogether , " it said .
Editor 's note ( July 1 , 2010 ) :
The original version of this story did not include the views of the Australian Christian Lobby , although they had been included in earlier stories .
They have been added following an upheld complaint in relation to a lack of balance .

Clostridium difficile bacteria , a normal inhabitant of the human gut The human gut holds microbes containing millions of genes , say scientists .
In fact , there are more genes in the flora in the intestinal system than the rest of our bodies .
So many that they are being dubbed our " second genome " .
A study published in the journal Nature details the analysis of the genes , carried out to better understand how the gut flora is affected by disease .
" Basically , we are a walking bacterial colony , " said Professor Jeroen Raes , one of the researchers involved .
" There is a huge diversity .
We have about 100 times more microbial genes than human genes in the body .
We also have 10 times more bacterial cells in our body than human cells , " he told BBC News .
Most of the microbes present in our bodies live in the gut .
We 're basically living in symbiosis with these microbes
Professor Jeroen Raes
The study was led by Professor Jun Wang from the Beijing Genomics Institute - Shenzhen .
Scientists from Germany , Belgium , Denmark , Spain , France and the UK also took part in the international effort , named the European MetaHIT consortium , which has been co-ordinated by Dr Stanislav Dusko Ehrlich .
" Everyone was so motivated , " said Dr Dusko Ehrlich .
" To have such an exciting project to run - it 's a piece of cake .
The work went much faster than we expected . "
Professor Raes , who works at Vrike Universiteit Brussel , explained why the microbes warranted such an intensive study : " Gut flora is crucial for our health .
We 're basically living in symbiosis with these microbes .
" The bacteria help digest food , provide vitamins , protect us from invading pathogens .
If there 's a disturbance , people get all sorts of diseases such as Crohn 's disease , Ulcerative colitis , and a link has also been made to obesity . "
Untangling a mess
The researchers have developed what is called a metagenome , a combined genome of all the bacteria sequenced at once .
" This creates a huge dataset that has to be disentangled , " explained Professor Raes .
" The untangling of this mess is what I do ; it 's my role in the study . "
The team analysed faecal matter from 124 Europeans and found each person had about 160 bacterial species .
The samples were more alike than they had expected and a significant fraction of the bacteria was shared between all the people who took part .
We already have very exciting results in terms of differences between healthy and sick people
Dr Stanislav Dusko Ehrlich
By mapping the genes , the scientists have found a way around the problem of having to culture bacteria in order to study them .
Many bacteria are very difficult to grow in cultures in the lab .
From looking at the genes , the researchers hope to be able to investigate how the flora changes when a person has a disease .
" It will allow us to understand diseases better , " said Professor Raes .
" We know there is a microbial component but we do n't know exactly how [ it works ] .
We will use it for prognostic and diagnostic markers so we can predict disease severity or sensitivity to these diseases . "
Dr Dusko Ehrlich said the work was showing promising results : " We have extremely interesting findings based on the results of this gene catalogue .
We already have very exciting results in terms of differences between healthy and sick people . "
Professor Elaine Holmes from Imperial College , London , who was not involved in the research , said it was a welcome advance on previous studies .
" The article is extremely timely given the escalating interest in the influence of the gut microbiota in many aspects of health ranging from Irritable Bowel Disease , sepsis and obesity to autism , " she told BBC News .
" It uses a large number of participants and therefore one assumes it is more representative of the ' real ' microbial composition than previous studies .
Also , it is an amazing feat of data processing . "

Mokoko , the Venice of Lagos , Built on a Pile of Rubbish
What would you get if you combined chaotic , bottom - up urban development in Nigeria with seasteading ?
Perhaps something like Mokoko , a region of Lagos built on the water .
Residents pay to have trash delivered to their doorsteps to build landfill .
In a city of 10 million , about 100,000 live on water .
Watch this excerpt below from the BBC special .
It ’s astounding –I ’m mean just heroic , to see these entrepreneurs who specialize in squeezing everything they can out of such difficult circumstances .
Layers and layers of ingenuity and relentlessly resourceful people .
Think about their process to create land , discovered when they realized how quickly wooden plank bridges rotted : they pay about 30 pence per pile to have rubbish diverted their way from a local dump .
They collect it and pile it and wait six months for it to settle .
Six months !
They then cover it with sawdust ( collected from nearby saw mills ) to mitigate any repugnant smells .
Finally , once it ’s stable , they cover it yet again with sand and stomp on it .
Voila–land !
Trial and error at its best .
The Man in Black was a long - time inhabitant of the Island .
He was once a normal man with dark hair and steely eyes , but an encounter with the Heart of the Island , brought on by his brother and enemy , changed him into the Smoke Monster , a living cloud of black smoke .
As the smoke , he could manifest himself as deceased individuals , most frequently as his former self .
Eventually , and permanently after the death of Jacob , he took the form of John Locke .
Born on the Island in the Classical Roman era , the Man in Black lived with the survivors from his mother 's shipwreck after he was convinced that the Island was n't his home .
He tried to harness the power of the Light to leave , but his adoptive mother thwarted his plans and killed all the survivors in his village .
He , in turn , killed her in a rage .
Jacob took revenge by casting him into the Heart of the Island , which transformed him into the Smoke Monster .
The brothers spent the following centuries in conflict , drawing people to the island to test their nature .
Though their mother had prevented them from hurting one another , the Man in Black eventually killed Jacob indirectly by assuming the form of John Locke and convincing Benjamin Linus to stab him .
He then tried to kill Jacob 's replacements and he used Desmond Hume to deactivate the Heart , planning to free himself and destroy the Island .
This rendered him mortal , and before he could leave , he died at the hands of Jack Shephard and Kate Austen .

History
Early life and transformation
The Man in Black was born on the Island after his pregnant mother Claudia 's ship wrecked off - shore .
A woman on the Island delivered him and his twin brother Jacob but killed their mother and raised them herself .
The boys initially led a carefree life , but some thirteen years later discovered the shipwreck 's other survivors on the island .
When their adopted mother heard , she blindfolded the boys and led them to a cave where a stream flowed into a glowing light .
The Boy in Black remarked how beautiful the light was but was warned never to enter the cave .
Later , Claudia 's ghost convinced the young Man in Black to join her people , against his adoptive mother 's wishes .
He invited Jacob to join him , but Jacob chose to remain with Mother .
Years passed , but he remained in touch with Jacob , meeting with him often to play their childhood game .
The Man in Black disapproved of his people , but when they discovered the Island 's electromagnetism , he used them to dig a well to its source , seeking access to the light his adoptive mother had once shown him .
He planned to build a wheel to harness the energy and leave the island .
Jacob told their mother though , and she knocked him out , filled his well and killed all his people .
Furious , the Man in Black sneaked up on her in her camp and stabbed her to death .
Jacob avenged her death by throwing his brother into the Heart which either transformed him or combined with a part of him .
He became a cloud of black smoke , leaving behind his human body in the process .
Jacob laid his mother and brother 's bodies in a cave , where Locke would centuries later dub them " Adam and Eve . " ( " Across the Sea " ) ( " House of the Rising Sun " )
Continued feud with Jacob
The Man in Black retained the ability to assume his human form , but Jacob denied him access to the Heart , confining him to the Island .
Their Mother had prevented the Man in Black from hurting Jacob , so he sought a " loophole " to kill him and his replacements .
The two also began a conflict regarding the nature of humanity .
Echoing his mother 's beliefs , the Man in Black thought people always " fight , destroy and corrupt , " but Jacob , believing in their potential for good , began drawing them to the island to test their nature .
( " Across the Sea " ) ( " Ab Aeterno " ) ( " The Incident , Part 1 " )
In ancient times , some of these early inhabitants built the Smoke Monster a chamber beneath the Temple and devised an apparent method of summoning him , though Benjamin Linus later deduced the Man in Black only made it appear as if he were summoned .
Hieroglyphs outside the chamber read " to summon protection , " suggesting they considered him a guardian .
An engraving portraying the Man in Black with Anubis suggests they even considered him a deity .
( " Dead Is Dead " ) ( " The Shape of Things to Come " ) ( " What They Died For " )
Soon after the Black Rock crashed on the Island , the Man in Black as black smoke killed its passengers and scanned Richard 's memories .
He returned in the form of Isabella , telling Richard they were in hell , and left , letting her screams convince Richard the smoke was killing her .
Later , back in his human form , he freed Richard and gave him a knife to kill " the devil , " who had taken Isabella .
Jacob convinced Richard otherwise though , and Richard returned with a white rock from Jacob to give to the Man in Black .
( " Ab Aeterno " )
According to Charles Widmore , the Man in Black became a much - feared figure in myth , ghost stories , and " jungle noises in the night " to the inhabitants who would reside on the Island during subsequent years .
( " The Package " )
They would also come to regard him as " evil incarnate " .
( " Sundown " )
DHARMA Initiative
The DHARMA Initiative constructed a sonar fence around the Barracks to prevent the monster 's entry ; a video for new recruits said they built it " to protect us from the Island 's abundant and diverse wildlife . "
( " The Man Behind the Curtain " ) ( " Namaste " )
Though their leader 's house stood over the Man in Black 's summoning chamber , it is unclear whether they knew its significance .
( " The Shape of Things to Come " )
The blast door map , begun by Radzinsky and Inman in the Swan , referenced " Cerberus activity " and " Cerberus vents " , likely referring to the Man in Black and his subterranean pathway of tunnels .
( " Lockdown " )
1988
The Man in Black , in his smoke form , attacked Danielle Rousseau 's science expedition on their way to the radio tower .
He silently killed Nadine , uprooted a tree ; and dragged Montand beneath the Temple 's outer wall .
He severed Montand 's arm during the struggle ; and pulled his body into the depths .
Moments later , the team heard Montand 's voice saying the Monster had disappeared .
Robert , Lacombe , and Brennan then entered through the opening .
( " This Place Is Death " ) ( In 2007 , Montand 's skeleton was found not far from the opening by Jack , Kate and Hurley while on their way to the Temple ) .
( " LA X , Part 2 " )
Two months after the initial encounter , a time - traveling Jin found Lacombe and Brennan 's bodies near Rousseau 's camp .
Jin watched as a distraught Rousseau confronted Robert at gunpoint , claiming he and the team were sick and had been " changed " by the " Monster . "
Robert claimed there was no monster , and that what they had seen was a security system charged with guarding the Temple .
Robert then tried to kill Rousseau , but was quickly shot dead by her .
( " This Place Is Death " )
After the crash of Oceanic Flight 815
Days 1 – 44 ( Season 1 )
Just after the crash , Vincent encountered the Man in Black in the form of Christian Shephard in the jungle .
He asked the dog to wake up his " son , " saying he had " work to do . "
( " So It Begins " )
On their first night , the Monster awoke the survivors by knocking over trees .
Rose , from New York , found its loud machine - like sounds familiar .
The next day , he pulled the pilot out of the cockpit and left him dead in a tree .
He pursued Jack , Kate , and Charlie through the jungle , but disappeared when the rain stopped .
During the chase , they hid in the roots of a banyan tree , which appeared to repel him .
( " Pilot , Part 1 " )
Three days later , Locke saw the Man in Black 's Monster form .
He stood his ground and escaped unharmed .
He initially told Michael he had not seen it , but later told Jack , " I 've looked into the eye of this Island ... and what I saw was beautiful . " ( " Walkabout " ) ( " White Rabbit " ) Locke later told Eko he had seen a beautiful bright light .
( " The Cost of Living " )
Jack later saw his dead father in the jungle but thought him a hallucination ; the Man in Black later claimed to have appeared to Jack to lead him to water .
( " White Rabbit " ) ( " The Last Recruit " )
He followed the apparition at Locke 's suggestion and discovered the Man in Black 's old home , the caves , which contained water and some debris from the plane .
He found Christian 's coffin intact among the wreckage , but the body was not inside .
( " White Rabbit " ) Jack also found the black and white pieces from the Man in Black 's Senet game and the corpses of him and his mother .
Locke dubbed the bodies Adam and Eve. Following Jack 's discovery , Arzt heard the Man in Black 's roar and decided against moving to the caves .
( " Arzt & Crafts " )
Boone hallucinated the Man in Black chasing him .
In the hallucination , the monster killed Shannon .
Three weeks later , the Man in Black as the Smoke Monster form chased Rousseau , Jack , Locke , Hurley , Kate , and Arzt in the Dark Territory .
Rousseau called it a " security system " that protected the Island and said they were safe behind some large trees .
( " Exodus , Part 1 " )
He chased them again later the same day , first appearing as a small wisp of smoke , then producing his usual noises and explosions .
Locke approached him , but he knocked Locke down and dragged him to a hole in the ground .
Kate tossed dynamite at the black smoke , and he let go of Locke , the smoke dissipating .
( " Hearts and Minds " ) ( " Exodus , Part 2 " )
Day 50 –64 ( Season 2 )
Six days after the Dark Territory attack , Charlie and Mr. Eko encountered the Man in Black .
Eko first saw him briefly as a wisp of smoke ; when the monster returned , uprooting trees , Eko stood his ground .
As the monster hovered just inches before Eko 's face , several images from Eko 's past flashed within the cloud , almost like lightning , coinciding with clicking noises the monster made .
( " The 23rd Psalm " )
Eko later dreamed of his brother Yemi , a form the Man in Black would later assume to appear to him .
This dream figure told him to get Locke to lead him to the question mark .
The figure appeared to Locke in a dream shortly after , again to lead them toward the Pearl , though Locke had never met Yemi in life . ( " ? " )
Days 71 –82 ( Season 3 )
Three weeks passed without an encounter , until the Man in Black manifested himself as Yemi , Eko 's dead brother .
While Eko made his way to Yemi's final resting place , the Man in Black appeared as distant wisps of smoke .
To test Eko , he appeared as figures from Eko 's past .
As smoke , he approached Eko , then retreated .
Later Eko again encountered the Man in Black as Yemi , asking Eko to confess his sins .
Eko denied any guilt , and the Man in Black left and returned as smoke , now over 40 feet in height .
It seized Eko with a fist - like appendage and proceeded to repeatedly slam him into trees and the ground , fatally wounding him .
Eko died in Locke 's arms after whispering his last words .
When asked what he said , Locke replied , " He said we 're next . "
( " The Cost of Living " )
Nine days later , the Man in Black appeared as spiders , biting and paralyzing Nikki . ( Official Lost Podcast / March 21 , 2008 ) ( " Exposé " )
The next day , the Man in Black chased Kate and Juliet through the jungle .
He emitted a series of bright flashes of light at the women , then retreated and left them alone .
( " Left Behind " )
He returned to chase them again the next day .
Juliet activated the sonar fence 's keypad , and it repelled the Monster like an invisible wall and it flew away .
Juliet remarked , " We do n't know what it is , but we know that it does n't like our fences . " ( " Left Behind " )
A week after that , the Man in Black appeared to Locke in Jacob 's cabin , as a mysterious figure , which both Locke and Ben at the time believed to be Jacob .
( " The Man Behind the Curtain " )
Days 97–100 ( Season 4 )
When Hurley stumbled upon Jacob 's cabin , he saw the figure of Christian Shephard in Jacob 's rocking chair , wearing his usual outfit .
He was also startled by a second figure peering through the window at him .
( " The Beginning of the End " )
While the Barracks were under siege by the mercenary team , Ben summoned the Man in Black through a secret room in his house .
He appeared as a single black cloud , larger than ever before , that ran parallel to the ground .
He only injured one of the mercenaries seriously , but he caused a great deal of confusion and panic amongst his victims , who fired upon him in vain .
Keamy grimly described the Monster as " a black pillar of smoke . "
( " The Shape of Things to Come " )
The Man in Black later held Aaron outside of Sawyer , Miles and Claire 's camp .
Miles saw Claire walk away with him in the night , calling him " dad " .
( " Something Nice Back Home " )
When Locke entered Jacob 's cabin , he met " Christian , " whose form the Man in Black had previously taken , and who now claimed to be speaking on Jacob 's behalf .
He dodged questions about Claire , prompting Locke to ask , " How do I save the Island ? "
In response , the the sitting figure told him to " move the Island . "
Soon afterward , " Christian " appeared to Michael on the Kahana , heralded by whispers .
He told Michael that he could " go now " and the bomb Michael was trying to control detonated .
( " Cabin Fever " ) ( " There 's No Place Like Home , Parts 2 & 3 " ) .
If this figure was the Man in Black , he had managed to travel over the water to the freighter and managed to escape the ship 's destruction .
At some point after residing with Christian Shephard in the cabin , Claire came to know the Man in Black enough to consider him her " friend " .
She later credited him with helping her survive in the jungle from attacks by the Others for the next three years .
He falsely told her the Others had Aaron , allegedly to motivate her with hate .
( " Lighthouse " ) ( " Recon " )
However , it was clear that she was not aware that " Her father " and " Her friend " were the same person , the Man in Black .
This was proved when Claire told Jin-Soo Kwon that both her father and her friend informed her of Aaron 's apparent whereabouts .
Time flashes ( Season 5 )
While Locke was trapped beneath the Orchid station in a frozen underground cave , the figure of Christian again approached him .
He claimed that when he told Locke they must move the Island , he referred to Locke specifically .
He told Locke to turn the frozen wheel , and confirmed Richard 's statement that Locke would die trying to unite the Oceanic Six , calling it a " sacrifice . "
Moments before Locke turned the wheel , " Christian " asked Locke to say hello to his son .
( " This Place Is Death " )
After the arrival of Ajira Flight 316
2007 ( Season 5 )
During the day light hours on a day in late December 2007 Sun Kwon , Ben Linus and the body of the late John Locke returned to the Island on Ajira Flight 316 , landing on Hydra Island in a controlled crash .
( " Dead Is Dead " )
Shortly afterwards
Ben slipped away from the other survivors to head for the main Island .
Sun and Lapidus spotted him and followed .
After Sun knocked Ben out , she and Lapidus traveled to the main Island , arriving at night .
As they left the docks , they witnessed some trees at the end of the dock moving , and heard the familiar sounds of the Smoke Monster .
Frank asked Sun if she had seen that , to which she replied it was probably " Just an animal . "
Once they arrived at the DHARMA Barracks , they saw the figure of Christian in the Processing Center .
Sun asked him about the whereabouts of her husband Jin .
He showed them an old photograph of then new DHARMA Initiative personel of 1977 .
It showed Kate , Jack and Hugo , all three in addition to Sayid had disappeared in mid flight .
He intimated that Jin was with them .
" Christian " told them they had a long journey ahead .
As he said this , the door opened slightly , and a small amount of Smoke drifted into the room .
( " Namaste " )
Off screen " Christian " would then tell a confused Sun and Lapidus to wait for " John Locke " at the Barracks which confused Sun even more since she believed that Locke was dead .
( " Dead Is Dead " )
That same night back at the Ajira survivors ' Hydra Island camp , the Man in Black had assumed Locke 's form and was found by Roxanne scouting the southern part of the Island and was brought to the camp .
He talked to Ilana the next day , revealing the real Locke 's memories , including remembering that he died and was wearing the suit that he was going to be buried in , which disconcerted Ilana .
That night he found Ben in their makeshift hospital ( that happened to be Ben's office ) and informed Caesar Ben had killed him .
( " The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham " )
After a confrontation that lead to Ben killing Caesar , Ben and the Man in Black traveled to the main Island in one of the outriggers where they met Sun and Frank at the Barracks after they had patiently waited for Locke as instructed by Christian two nights before .
( " Dead Is Dead " )
The Man in Black convinced Ben to summon the Monster then briefly disappeared , saying on his return that he knew where the Monster resided .
He led Ben and Sun to the Temple ( Lapidus returned to Hydra Island reluctant to follow a " liar and a dead man " ) , where Ben accidentally fell through a weak section of floor .
The Man in Black left and transformed into the Monster , surrounded Ben and flashed him with memories of Alex .
He then retreated and returned as Alex , telling Ben to obey Locke or it would " destroy " him .
The Man in Black vanished and returned to Locke 's form .
( " The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham " ) ( " Dead Is Dead " )
He left the Temple and led Ben and Sun to the Others ' camp where they met with Richard Alpert .
Richard assumed he was Locke but noted a change , and the Man in Black attributed this to his new - found purpose .
He led Ben and Richard to the Beechcraft , giving Richard instructions to relay to wounded , time - traveling Locke :
That he must get everyone back to the Island and that he had to die as a sacrifice .
( " Dead Is Dead " ) ( as originally seen in ( " Because You Left " ) )
After this , he demanded they see Jacob , surprising Richard and Ben by inviting all the Others to accompany him .
He announced that something had to be done about the Ajira survivors then secretly told Ben he intended to kill Jacob .
( " Follow the Leader " ) Richard asked how Locke had resurrected , and the Man in Black attributed this to Jacob .
Ben described his encounter with Alex , pleasing the Man in Black .
He then told Ben he wanted him to kill Jacob , reminding him of all he'd suffered at Jacob 's hands .
( " The Incident , Part 1 " )
The party reached the statue , and the Man in Black and Ben entered .
Jacob immediately recognized his old enemy , calmly realizing the Man in Black had found his " loophole . "
Ben stabbed Jacob to death , and as he fell to the floor spitting blood , Jacob told the Man in Black , " they 're coming . "
Looking startled , the Man in Black kicked Jacob into the fire pit at the center of the room .
( " The Incident , Part 2 " )
2007 ( Season 6 )
The Man in Black sent Ben to fetch Richard , but Bram 's crew entered instead .
The Man in Black revealed Jacob was dead and gave the bodyguards permission to leave , but they instead opened fire , striking him several times to no effect .
The Man in Black then disappeared behind a pillar , returning as the Smoke Monster and killing them all , though Bram temporarily repelled him with an ash circle .
He returned to Locke 's form and admitted to Ben that he was the Monster but said he resented the term .
He then revealed his goal , the opposite of the man whose form he'd taken - to " go home . "
He then exited the statue , knocked Richard unconscious , announced disappointment in the crowd and carried Richard into the jungle .
( " LA X , Part 1 " ) ( " LA X , Part 2 " )
After Richard declined to join him , the Man in Black recruited a drunk Sawyer from the Barracks .
On the way to the cliffside cave , they encountered Jacob 's ghost , who warned privately that killing " him " would break the " rules . "
After a dangerous climb to the cave , the Man in Black threw a balanced scale 's white stone into the ocean , tipping it in the black stone 's favor .
He then escorted Sawyer to Jacob 's list of candidates , explained its meaning and gave him three choices : do nothing and risk dying , become the Island 's new protector or leave .
Sawyer picked the third choice , and the Man in Black smiled .
The Man in Black and his new recruits after the Temple Massacre . ( " Sundown " )
Later that day , he met a shocked Jin at Claire 's camp and sent Claire to the Temple to fetch Dogen .
Dogen instead sent Sayid to kill him , warning to stab him before he spoke .
The Man in Black snuck up on Sayid , and he stabbed in vain .
The Man then cryptically offered him anything he wanted in exchange for his help .
Sayid delivered the Temple a message from the Man in Black - join him by sundown or die - and then killed Dogen and Lennon , likely at his new boss 's instruction .
The Man in Black appeared just after sundown despite the Temple 's ash circle and as the Smoke Monster killed everyone who remained .
As Locke , he then walked off into the jungle with his new followers .
( " Lighthouse " ) ( " Sundown " )
The next day , he came to Ben while he was digging his own grave .
After releasing Ben from his shackles with a single gesture , the Man in Black offered Ben control of the island when he and his followers left .
He also informed Ben of a rifle about 200 yards into the jungle that he could use to confront ( and kill ) Illana .
( " Dr. Linus " )
He then led to his followers to Claire 's shelter , where he blamed the Black Smoke for killing the Temple Dwellers .
Privately , he told Sawyer he killed them to save himself and sent him on a reconnaissance mission to Hydra Island .
Returning to the camp , he broke up a fight between Claire and Kate .
He took Kate aside and explained why he'd told Claire the Others had Aaron . ( " Recon " )
He advised Jin about his wounds and told him about the candidates , then he left for the beach camp , leaving his own in Sayid 's care .
( " The Package " ) Richard was shouting for him , and though he did n't reach him in time , he watched from afar then turned away angrily .
( " Ab Aeterno " )
He then reached the beach camp and offered to lead Sun to Jin .
He then chased her till she fell unconscious .
He returned to his camp and found Widmore had attacked it and kidnapped Jin .
He rowed with Sayid to Hydra Island and exchanged words with Charles Widmore .
( " The Package " )
The Man in Black explains to Jack that the real John Locke had to be dead before assuming his form . ( " The Last Recruit " )
He returned to camp , and the next day led Desmond , whom Sayid had taken from Widmore 's camp , to one of the wells he 'd dug years ago .
They passed Jacob 's ghost , now a laughing older boy .
The Man in Black talked of the Island 's mysterious properties then , angry at Desmond 's confidence , pushed him into the well .
( " Everybody Loves Hugo " )
Hurley 's group joined his camp , and the Man in Black privately told Jack he 'd assumed Christian 's form to lead them to water .
Zoe arrived demanding Desmond 's return , fired a missile nearby and gave him a radio to contact her .
The Man threw it on the ground and crushed it with his stick .
He sent Sayid to kill Desmond , and the two shared a tense moment when he doubted whether he'd obeyed .
He talked to Sun and denied guilt for new aphasia .
And he sent Sawyer to retrieve a sailboat to ferry his followers to Hydra Island , but when he reached the beach , he found Jack crawling out of the ocean , Sawyer having taken the boat .
Widmore then fired at the area , and the Man in Black carried Jack inland as another missile hit .
( " The Last Recruit " )
They rowed to Hydra Island where he freed the candidates from cages by attacking Widmore 's followers as the smoke monster .
As Locke , he then disarmed an explosive from the Ajira plane after killing Widmore 's guards easily , but he secretly slipped it into Jack 's pack , hoping the candidates would activate it and kill each other .
He then led the group to Widmore 's submarine , where Jack pushed him into the water .
He climbed back out and shot several of Widmore 's men , who were attacking the group .
The sub left , according to his plan , but three candidates and Kate escaped before it sank .
The Man in Black walked off , rifle in hand to " finish what he 'd started . "
( " The Candidate " )
The next day , the Man rowed back to the main Island and attacked the Barracks as the monster , tossing Richard against a tree .
As Locke , he talked to Ben who led him to Widmore and Zoe .
Widmore told Zoe not to speak , so he killed her immediately .
He then threatened Penny unless Widmore explained why he had brought Desmond back to the Island .
Ben shot Widmore , but not before the Man in Black heard all he needed that Desmond was a fail - safe in case the candidates died , one that could let the Man destroy the Island .
The two trekked to the well and found someone had freed Desmond .
They spotted Sawyer watching them , and Ben snuck up behind him and held and him at gunpoint , but he took Ben 's gun and ran .
The Man in Black followed dogprints to Rose and Bernard 's camp and threatened to kill them unless Desmond came with him .
His group soon crossed paths with Jack's , and Kate vainly shot at him ; he scornfully told her to " save her bullets . "
He joked that Jack , the new protector , had been the obvious choice , and Jack said they'd go to the Heart of the Island together , where he would somehow kill the Man in Black .
( " What They Died For " ) ( " The End " )
The Man in Black falls to his death . ( " The End " )
The Man in Black lowered Desmond into the Heart with Jack , joking about Jack and Locke 's old times together .
Desmond uncorked the Heart , and the Island began to shake .
Satisfied , the Man in Black left the cave , but Jack attacked him , drawing blood , making the Man in Black realize that he'd just made himself mortal .
In a last attempt to leave for good , he knocked Jack out and ran for the cliffs where the Elizabeth was waiting .
Jack regained consciousness and now had a chance to kill him , so he caught up to the Man in Black and the two fought .
The Man in Black stabbed Jack in the abdomen and tried to stab him in the neck , thinking Jack would " die for nothing , " but Kate shot him in the back , " saving him a bullet . "
The Island continued to rumble , convincing the Man in Black that it would indeed sink .
Jack then kicked him off the cliff , and the Man in Black , the Smoke Monster was dead .
( " The End " )
Non-canon appearances
Lost : Via Domus
In the video game Lost : Via Domus , Elliott encountered the Monster several times .
Most of the encounters are in the jungle and all occur almost exactly like Jack , Kate , and Charlie 's encounter after visiting the cockpit .
( " Pilot , Part 1 " )
The standard encounters happen in the jungle , where the small wisps are first seen , followed by the Monster 's signature loud noises .
Elliott then runs until he finds banyan tree roots , where he hides until the Monster retreats .
On one of these occasions , the Monster attacks Beady Eyes on a tree - fort - like scouting post where he was shooting at Elliott as he ran past in the jungle .
( " A New Day " ) The Monster also attacks Elliott within the caves , but he is saved by Locke before the Monster can get to him .
( " Via Domus " )
Later in the game , the Monster chases Elliott the distance between the Swan station and the sonar fence .
The Monster finally catches up to Elliott , but does n't harm him .
Instead , it hovers in front of Elliott for some time , and then leaves .
( " Whatever It Takes " )
This encounter is almost identical to Eko 's encounter with the Monster .
( " The 23rd Psalm " ) The Monster then leaves and is not seen again in the game .
( " Whatever It Takes " )
Signs of Life
In the semi-canon Lost novel Signs of Life , Locke , Charlie , Hurley , Jeff , and Michael encountered the Monster while on a boar hunt several weeks after the crash .
The group heard the Monster traveling towards them after several hours of unsuccessful hunting and were forced to flee further inland from the beach camp .
Locke led the group to a small cliff , which they scaled in the hope of avoiding its oncoming path .
Hurley , the last to climb , nearly fell into the Monster 's path after sliding several feet down the side of the cliff , moderately scraping the front of his chest and stomach in the process .
He managed to regain his grip only moments before the Monster reached the cliff base .
The group discovered a large underground tunnel shortly after reaching the clifftop , where they hid until the Monster moved on .
They did not see the Monster during the encounter , although they did speculate briefly as to its nature .
( Signs of Life )
Lost : The Mobile Game
In Lost : The Mobile Game for iPods and mobile phones , there is a level where Kate tells you to stop the Monster by taking some dynamite and blowing up the vent where it is coming out of , in order to save Sawyer .
Nature
Abilities
The Monster
The Man in Black 's most notorious ability is that of manifesting himself as a giant dark cloud , often described as looking like smoke .
Referred to as " the Monster " by most characters , it appears immune to conventional weaponry , but was repelled on one occasion by dynamite .
( " Exodus , Part 3 " )
While seemingly intangible , the Monster can grasp and manipulate objects with a tremendous application of force - capable of uprooting enormous fully - grown trees , knocking down walls and slamming victims into the ground .
The Monster makes a variety of biological and mechanical sounds -- two of the most distinctive being a mechanical clicking and a loud high - pitched warning or alarm call .
It appears the Man in Black is somewhat limited in movement in this form -- and cannot ascend high enough above the ground so as to pass over the sonar fence .
The Man in Black also implies his smoke form cannot pass over large bodies of water ( " The Package " ) , although it is unknown if this is actually the case .
Some Island inhabitants believed the Monster could be summoned from a secret room in the Barracks .
( " The Shape of Things to Come " ) Ben eventually concluded that the Monster himself controlled this process .
( " What They Died For " )
Morphing ability
Throughout the series , the Man in Black has displayed an ability to take on a number of different forms and perfectly mimic individuals , their appearance , voice and memories so as to manipulate others .
All of the confirmed impersonated individuals are dead .
He does not require that the dead person died on the island , only to scan the mind of a person who knew them , selecting the forms of those that were most meaningful to people to better manipulate the targeted individual .
In smoke form , it displays images from an individual 's past within itself .
The scanning process appears as a rapid series of bright flashes of light .
( " The 23rd Psalm " ) ( " Left Behind " ) ( " Dead Is Dead " )
He also appears to gain access to the memories of the mimicked person , even if they have been dead for sometime .
( " LA X , Part 2 " ) Some island apparitions , possibly the Man in Black 's work , feature living characters .
He can also transform into lower animals , including spiders .
The Man in Black can change from human to monster form at will .
The list below denotes apparitions seen in the series that have been definitely confirmed to be the Man in Black .
He may have taken on other forms throughout the series as well ( some possibilities include Kate 's horse , Emeka , Daniel , and Harper Stanhope ) - although these are unconfirmed .
The producers have confirmed that the apparitions of Emily Linus and Dave were not The Man In Black .
( Official Lost Podcast / March 21 , 2008 )
Immunities
The Man in Black is immune to bullets in both his Monster and human forms .
Bram and Charles Widmore 's team shot at him with no effect .
Sayid stabbed him in the chest with the special dagger , but he did not appear to be wounded or suffer pain .
He also appears to be invulnerable to explosions in his human form per Widmore 's mortar attack .
Regardless , the Man in Black claims he can be killed and used this as a justification for destroying the Others at the Temple .
He lost his immunities and became mortal when the light at the Heart of the Island was extinguished .
( " The End " )
Other abilities
Sayid stated that the Man in Black brought him back from death - ( " The Last Recruit " ) a power his brother Jacob stated he did not have , although Jacob had the power to confer immortality .
( " Ab Aeterno " )
The Man in Black somehow released Ben from his shackles without physically touching them .
( " Dr. Linus " )
On occasion the Man in Black has displayed some unusual precognitive abilities .
In the guise of John Locke , he knew exactly where and when to be to meet the passengers of Flight 316 when it made an emergency landing on Hydra Island .
( " The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham " ) ( although he could had simply seen Flight 316 land on Hydra Island from the main one )
Much later , the Man in Black brought Richard Alpert to exactly the right time and place to meet an injured Locke caught in the time flashes .
( " Follow the Leader " )
Although the lagoon at the Hydra dock was quiet , he told Claire he knew the sub had sunk , and was also certain that not all candidates had died .
( " The Candidate " )
The Man in Black is able to manipulate people 's dreams and manifest within them .
He does this to both Eko and Locke in order to lead them to the Pearl station .
It is unknown how he is able to do this .
Aside from the confirmed dream manifestations as Yemi in " ? " , it is possible that several other occasions in which people have been led through dreams could be the Man in Black as well .
These include when Locke saw Boone in a dream shortly after the Swan implosion ( " Further Instructions " ) and when he saw Horace in a dream , who instructed him to find the Cabin . ( " Cabin Fever " )
In addition to all his supernatural abilities , the Man in Black is incredibly persuasive .
He can easily bring people to trust him , or at least follow his lead ( often under threat of death , overt or subtle ) .
He is an expert liar ( even outsmarting Ben ) and can fake emotions and sympathy , so it is difficult to tell when he is sincere .
So far , few characters were n’t convinced by his lies .
He is also very strategic , being able to find the “ loophole ” necessary to kill Jacob , patiently biding his time perhaps over the course of hundreds of years .
Despite his long imprisonment on the Island , the Man in Black proved adept at fashioning a timing detonator from a digital watch and blocks of C - 4 found aboard the Ajira aircraft , probably after learning from John Locke .
( " The Candidate " )
In an act similar to what the Man in Black would do over three years later sinking Widmore 's submarine with the Candidates on board , John Locke at one time did destroy the Galaga with C - 4 plastic explosives to prevent his fellow Castaways from leaving the island , displaying a knowledge of demolition to complement his hunting and tracking skills .
( " The Man from Tallahassee " ) The Man In Black had scanned Locke 's mind as far back as the fourth day the Castaways were on the Island during his first encounter with him , obtaining this knowledge through that method .
( " Walkabout " )
Also , while The Man In Black cannot leave the island , many people have come to the Island , through Jacob bringing them there , they finding the island on their own , or were recruited from the outside by on island institutions like The DHARMA Initiative and The Others gaining insights on the outside world including technological advances .
According to the apparition of his birth mother , Claudia , The Man in Black is able to see the dead while his brother Jacob cannot .
( " Across the Sea " )
The Man in Black shows Ben an image of his past .
( " Dead Is Dead " )
Due to his " special " nature , the Man in Black appears to be extremely intelligent .
He was able to construct or reconstruct a mechanism to harness the island 's electromagnetism in ancient times .
( " Across the Sea " )
Weaknesses
Sonar fence
The DHARMA Initiative 's sonar fence repels the Man in Black in his Monster form .
When Juliet activated the fence , the Monster slammed into the invisible barrier , screeched , and took off into the jungle .
( " Left Behind " )
When Charles Widmore arrived on Hydra Island , his men began setting up a portable series of sonar pylons to keep the Man in Black at bay .
( " Recon " ) ( " The Package " )
Ash circles
Ash circles repelled the Man in Black .
Ash at the Temple and around the cabin prevented his entry , and on a smaller scale , Bram tried to use one to save himself .
( " LA X , Part 2 " ) ( " The Man Behind the Curtain " ) ( " LA X , Part 1 " )
The ash evidently relied on an external force , the Man In Black could enter the Temple as smoke after Dogen was killed .
( " Sundown " )
Banyan trees
On several occasions , characters have hidden in thickets of banyan trees , which seem to repel the Monster .
Kate hid in a thicket after the Monster killed the pilot .
( " Pilot , Part 1 " )
In his hallucination , Boone and Shannon hid inside one while the Monster chased them .
However , this was only in Boone 's vision ( " Hearts and Minds " ) .
Later , Rousseau claimed hiding in banyan thickets could protect someone from the Monster .
( " Exodus , Part 1 " ) When Kate and Juliet were chased by the Monster , they hid in a banyan thicket .
A Monster - perspective crane shot looms in front of Juliet behind the branches .
Juliet reacts to several bright flashes of light just before the Monster leaves .
( " Left Behind " ) The Monster , in the form of John Locke , is able to approach Kate as she sits in a banyan grove .
( " Recon " )
Explosives
The Man in Black appears sensitive to explosives , at least in his smoke form .
On his second encounter with John Locke , he attempted to drag John away as he had with Montand in 1988 .
( " This Place Is Death " ) Kate lit and threw sticks of dynamite from the Black Rock at the monster , and it released Locke .
( " Exodus , Part 2 " )
In December 2007 when Charles Widmore returned to the Island , Zoe and her party attempted to intimidate the Man in Black by firing mortar rounds close to his camp .
Zoe later fired on him when he was on the beach with Jack .
These explosives has no effect on him .
( " The Last Recruit " ) Widmore also wired Ajira 316 with explosives , though likely to destroy the Man in Black 's escape plan rather than to hurt him .
The figure of Christian , whose form the Man in Black had previously taken , was also aboard the Kahana when it exploded , and he clearly was unharmed .
( " There 's No Place Like Home , Part 2 " )
Candidacy
One of the primary obstacles to the Man In Black 's destructive capabilities was that he could not directly kill or harm anyone Jacob branded a candidate .
While he could kill others with ease ( such as Seth Norris ) , the rule surrounding candidates deterred him from attacking , for instance , all of the Oceanic survivors immediately upon their arrival .
The limitation did not , however protect candidates from indirect attacks or plots .
The Man in Black exploited this loophole by tricking candidates into killing either each other or themselves .
There are many examples of this throughout the series , including the death of Nikki Fernandez .
The most prominent was his attempt to make the final candidates kill one another inside a submarine by triggering an explosive device .
Such attempts encourage candidates to accidentally rather than deliberately kill themselves or each other , as rules appeared to protect the candidates from suicide .
The Man in Black also killed Eko , whose name appeared on the lighthouse candidate list , after the man refused to atone for past actions .
This suggests a further loophole .
The Light
In " The End " , the Man in Black was revealed to have a crippling weakness that even he had been unaware of ; his dependence on the Light at the Heart of the Island to maintain his supernatural abilities .
After the extinguishing of the Light there , at Desmond 's hands , the Man in Black returned to being a mortal man , albeit one that still resembled John Locke .
He lost his ability to transform into smoke , his immunity to physical injury and his other abilities .
This allowed for the Man in Black 's final defeat and death ( when shot by Kate and kicked off the cliff by Jack ) .
Just as he became mortal but still in the form of John Locke , he left a corpse behind despite the former already being buried elsewhere on the Island .
Victims
The Man in Black has killed many people and has indirectly led to the deaths of several others .
Names
The entity has been known by several names to both fans and characters of the show , both as the smoke monster and as the Man in Black .
Whether or not any character ever knew the Man in Black 's true name , as well as whether or not he ever had one , is still unknown .
Referred to simply as the " Monster " or the " Smoke Monster " by the survivors as well as Ben , and , at one point , Jacob .
The Man in Black disliked being called " the Monster " the one time he was referred to as such to his face .

On few occasions , Jacob called him " brother " .
.
For lack of any other name , most people have simply called the Man in Black " Locke " , due , obviously , to his appearance as John Locke .
Notably , both times he has been called " John , " the person who says it has been corrected with the phase " That 's not / This is n't John " .

In William Golding 's novel Lord of the Flies , one of Lost 's major influences , survivors on a deserted island live in constant fear of an entity they dub " the beast . "
Unlike on Lost , the monster in Golding 's work is a figment of the survivors ' imaginations , and fear of it is a major driver of the story .
Also , interestingly enough , the survivors mistake a corpse hung up on a tree by a parachute for this monster , much in the same way Naomi was caught in a tree upon landing on the Island .

Explanations
“ Carlton Cuse :
Well then , he might be a manifestation that the Island has generated .
Perhaps an incarnation of the Monster ?
Damon Lindelof :
That 's interesting .
I would assume that that 's sort of a theory that people are tossing around .
Um … there 's several manifestations in that episode .
All of them seem to have come from Eko 's memory .
So , could one assume that when they last faced off , that all those flashes that happened in the Monster cloud , that it was sort of " downloading information " that it might want to use at a future date ? ”
David Fury had this to say about the Monster in an interview with Lostpedia :
“ Metaphorically , the Monster was just the great unknown threat , the imminent danger around the corner that potentially haunts us all …
Some thought of it as a monster of the id , much like in Forbidden Planet -- that maybe it appeared differently to everyone who saw it .
The most tangible thought , as explained later by Rousseau , was that it functioned as a security system set up by the Island ’s creators / early residents ...
For Locke , clearly , the Monster was the " soul " of the Island that was responsible for his " miracle . " ( LP Interview : David Fury ) ”
Sound effects
In the form of the black smoke monster , the entity releases several distinct noises .
Production notes
Some viewers believed that the The Twins ( Others ) could be amongst the entity 's manifestations , but this was officially debunked in an interview with Damon Lindelof .
He said they hired the twin stunt men to be guys on the Others ' boat , but they were never meant to become important to the storyline .
Damon Lindelof said , " We can tell you , sitting here now that twins have nothing to do whatsoever with the mythology of the show . " ( " Exodus , Part 2 " )
In the production building on the Disney lot where the Lost production has been housed , Cerberus is the name of the safety and fire protection system .
The three - headed dog logo can be found all over the grounds .

According to Kristin Dos Santos of E! Online ( but unconfirmed by official sources ) , the name " Samuel " was used in scripts to refer to the Man in Black , but the writers ultimately decided not to use the name in dialogue , feeling that leaving the character unnamed was more interesting . [ 3 ]
In a parody video shown at Comic - Con 2011 and at abc.com , it is " confirmed " that his name is Barry .
Additional casting
Ryan Bradford played the role of the young Man in Black ( age 13 ) in " Across the Sea " The casting call described him as " [ MATT ] , Caucasian , dark hair , 12 - 14 , defiant and rebellious .
Wise and smart but fights with other boys .
He ’s given a big responsibility that makes him feel important ... NICE CO - STAR . " [ 6 ]
Producer 's favorite fan theory
In February 2007 , Damon Lindelof opened a question on Yahoo !
Answers about the nature of the Monster .
The answer he and Carlton Cuse liked the best was given by user ar233 .
Out of over 8000 submitted answers , the winner was :
“ I think the Monster was originally a highly advanced security system designed to separate participants in the experimental DHARMA hatches .
I think it was an effect that was designed to frighten people ( smoke , noise ) if they strayed too far from their experiment location .
( A bit Wizard of Oz- like . )
However , the electromagnetic force has mutated it — in the same sense as Desmond experienced time travel and can now see the future after exposure — and made it malevolent and able to physically grab things in its force ( Eko , the pilot , Locke ) .
So in theory it may be able to be deactivated , if they can find the control room for it ( which would be another hatch somewhere yet undetected ) . ”
The producers ' explanation as to why they picked that answer was :
“ We were amazed at the imagination and prodigious creativity applied to answering the question , what is the Monster ?
We have chosen our favorite answer .
Not that 's it 's the right answer .
Sorry but we can't really give away the ultimate secrets of the Monster quite yet .
The answer we selected might be somewhat right , totally right , or completely off - base .
But we liked it and found it very cool and intriguing .
Thanks to everyone who took the time to write in .
We loved reading your thoughts , and thanks for watching !

They later stated they were impressed by how close some of the responses came .

A Canadian dealership allegedly conned a mentally disabled woman into paying $ 63,000 for an ex-demo Mazda6 .
Worse , she ’d only gone to the dealership to get overcharged for a new set of tires .
Madeline Leonard , who suffers from an unnamed mental disability , visited Mazda of Orangeville to have new tires put on her 2004 Mazda3 .
By the time she left , she ’d purchased a 3,700 - mile , ex-demo Mazda6 for about 6,000 Canadian Loonies more than the sticker price of a new one .
The ever - helpful salesman also threw in every package in the book , charging up to three times their book value for things like window etching and undercoating .
All that meant Madeline paid roughly 25,000 Loonies ( $ 24,000 ) more than she should have .
Madeline lives on a $ 1,900 - a- month government subsidy .

Despite falling for the con , it was Madeline that noticed lower sticker prices at other dealers in town and notified authorities .
The dealership now faces a maximum fine of $ 240,000 and the two salesmen involved could face fines of $ 95,000 a piece .
“ We did n’t do anything wrong in the case of this transaction , ” said the dealer ’s business manager .
“ We made a little bit of money on the deal .
I guess she was not happy with it . ” [ via The Star ]
Molesting Little Boys - Catholic Church Culture for 2000 Years ( Video )
Those “ servants of the Lord ” have been molesting young boys for thousands of years according to the church ’s own records .
See this startling video from The Hungry Beast :
ANAHEIM – The City Council wants to set a new rule :
No red - light cameras in Anaheim – ever .
The council on Tuesday expressed unanimous support for an amendment to the city ’s Charter that would prohibit automated traffic - enforcement systems from being installed on city streets .
The prohibition would require a public vote .
The council plans to adopt a formal resolution in coming weeks and put the amendment to a public vote in November .
Anaheim has resisted red - light cameras in the past , while nearby cities such as Santa Ana and Garden Grove have embraced the technology .
( To read this Register story click here : Did you blow a red light , then blow off the ticket ?
Watch out ! )
Mayor Curt Pringle , who is in the last year of his eight years as mayor , requested the ballot measure , saying he fears that future city leaders may be tempted to install them as a way to raise money for Anaheim .
“ It ’s very discouraging when government thinks its sole purpose is … to use public safety as a revenue - raising tool , ” Pringle said .
Officials in cities that have favored the use of such cameras say they are an effective tool for getting motorists to drive more safely and can reduce side - collision wrecks at intersections .
The automated technology also draws many passionate critics who argue that they can increase rear - end collisions and that they have less to do with traffic safety and more to do with bolstering city coffers .
Such enforcement should be done by police on the streets , they say .
( To read an extensive Register story on the two sides of red - light violations , click here . )
Pringle also said he worries that cameras could also be used to cite motorists committing other violations such as speeding or talking on cell phones .
Councilman Harry Sidhu said he got hit with a $ 465 fine in Los Angeles County recently for failing to “ come to a complete stop ” at a red light .
He said he questioned the infraction but paid the fine .
“ This is a good move ( to vote on the ban ) , ” Sidhu said .
Councilwoman Lucille Kring said she hopes
Anaheim ’s action will inspire other cities to consider permanent bans on red - light cameras .
( To read this story , click here : H.B. police chief drops red light camera program . )
Anaheim officials plan to put the issue on the ballot for the November general election so that it would cost little money to put to a vote .
It would require a simple 51 - percent majority to pass , according to the city attorney .

The excuses the Vatican and its supporters have now come up with to justify its systematic cover up of the rape of children have now officially exceeded the numbers required for a 5x5 bingo card .
Consequently , I give you Vatican Excuse Bingo .
Play it when Bill Donohue is on ( if you can bear watching that disgusting slime bag ) and you will be finished in no time .
Explanations :
In the unlikely event that you ’re not familiar with any of the excuses summarized on the card , I give a slightly more detailed explanation for each , below .
Long Time Ago
It all happened a long time ago and the church has changed .
No fair to keep bringing it up .
Secular Society
It ’s the fault of The secularization of society .
If only everyone was a good catholic and kept his mouth shut , things would be just fine .
Women ’s Ordination / Abortion / Gay Marriage
The only agenda of the church ’s critics is women 's ordination , abortion and gay marriage .
Pornography
With so much invasion of eroticism , sometimes it 's not easy to stay celibate or to respect children .
Not easy !
Jews / Liberal Media / The Internet / Satan
The Jews are always behind everything as is The liberal media ( ie The New York Times ) .
Oh and Satan .
Yes he exists .
Like the Persecution of Jews
Criticizing the Catholic Church is just like persecution of the Jews because pointing out that the church systematically covered up the rape of children for decades is exactly like murdering six million Jews .
( Yes we know this conflicts with the previous point .
We hope you wo n’t notice . )
Hatred of Christianity
What motivates the church ’s critics most of all is a pathological hatred of Christianity .
Homosexuals
Of course , the real problem is homosexuality not pedophilia .
You see , there is a relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia .
That is true .
That is the problem .
Masons
It ’s both the fault of freemasonic organizations that portray pedophilia as normal , and also a conspiracy by masonic lodges and big business to undermine the church .
Simultaneously .
Post Pubescent
It was n’t pedophilia because the kids ( most of them anyway ) were post - pubescent .
And they wore sexy short shorts .
( OK I made the last bit up . )
Boy Scouts / Schoolteachers
Employers from every walk of life – schoolteachers , boy scouts – all molest kids .
For example , just this month , Rabbi Baruch Lebovits was found guilty on eight counts of sexually abusing a Brooklyn boy .
( Hey , it ’s fault of the Jews again . )
Petty Gossip
It really is .
Petty gossip about raping children and systematically covering it up for years .
So annoying .
Therapy
The priests were not reported to the police because they were being put in therapy instead .
It was the zeitgeist of the day you see .
Everyone did it .
Catholic Standards
At least the Catholic Church has the standard that rape is wrong ( even if it falls short of that standard ) , unlike atheists .
You Did n’t Object
Victims did n’t object - most 15 - year - old teenage boys would n’t allow themselves to be molested .
So why did you ? ”
Gold Diggers
These so - called victims are just gold diggers – just out to make a buck off the poor honest church .
Radical Lawyers
The liberal media has teamed up with Radical Lawyers to persecute the church .
Parents
Parents and psychologists are to blame for not reporting the sex abuse in a timely fashion .
Because if they had reported the abuse promptly the church would have acted immediately .
No Smoking Gun
Cardinal Joey Ratzinger knew nooothing about it .
Nooothing , I tell you .
Move along now .
Did I miss any ?

Teaching babies to swim might assuage their fear of water and provide good exercise , but it could have other benefits as well .
Researchers from Norway and Britain found that children who had taken baby swimming classes did better on tests involving gripping and reaching as well as balance , compared to children who had no experience swimming as babies .
The study participants included 19 4 - year - olds from Iceland who had taken part in baby swimming lessons for two hours a week for at least four months when the children were infants .
They were matched with 19 Icelandic 4 - year - olds who had not done any baby swimming .
The 4 - year - olds were tested for manual dexterity , ball skills and balance .
While there were no overall differences in performance between the groups , researchers found that the swimming group did better on prehension ( seizing or grasping objects ) and static balance .

Although this was a small study , the authors considered the results encouraging enough to warrant further study to see what other benefits baby swimming and aquatic therapy could offer .
The study appears in the May issue of the journal Child : Care , Health and Development .

" The presence of the remains of crushed glass capsules in the mouth and the sharp odour of bitter almonds from the corpses , and the results of an internal post - mortem led the ( Soviet ) commission to conclude that it was death by cyanide poisoning , " he said .
Eugene S. Robinson 's resume is as interesting and varied as he is .
From writing for several major magazines ( GQ , The Wire , Harp , Hustler..etc ) to writing multiple books to fronting the band Oxbow there is no confusing Eugene with a man lacking in life experience .
As such , there may be no one more interesting to hear speak about the post - fight " festivities " from this past Saturday .
Eugene penned the following for Bloody Elbow :
-------------
In 1984 amateur wrestling great Dave Schultz [ or perhaps it was his brother Mark , the memory blurs ] on his way to an Olympic gold medal , " happened " to break his Turkish opponents arm .
This was not MMA , this was amateur WRESTLING [ so in all likelihood the arm was broken not with any sort of hyperextension but just through the sheer force of CRUSH ] .
He was largely reprimanded for it and his briefest of responses ran along the lines of " I guess they 're turning wrestling into a sissy sport . "
Flash forward to NOW , where a few days after one of the greatest MMA cards ever – JAKE SHIELDS v. DAN HENDERSON – a nation full of MMA fans , pundits and prognosticators are drinking the kool aid and wringing their hands like a coffee klatch all concerned about how MMA " looks " to the rest of America .
Websites , this one included , like grandmothers , are talking about " the black eye " the sports been given and about how execrable [ look it up ] the post - fight fight wherein Team Cesar Gracie taught Jason MAYHEM Miller a lesson in deportment was .
Well , I am here to call bullshit on that .
The past 365 days have seen one of football 's premier quarterbacks arrested for raping drunk chicks in bathrooms .
Er , allegedly .
High school football players paralyzed , some brain damaged .
Numerous drug busts .
And within hours of penning this article a world champion boxer has just committed suicide after murdering his wife .
And not a whimper about " black eyes " or these sports " looking bad . "
There are also basebrawls , basketbrawls and hockey fights a'plenty .
Yeah : crickets , in terms of public outcry .
I submit that MMA nowadays is so tender that the sensitive susans who are worried about CBS [ admittedly the most conservative of networks out there … and coincidentally smarting over it ] and the sport suffering because , imagine this , fighters got into a fight at a fight … a fight brought about by a man named MAYHEM … well , the ladies protesteth too much .
There is a tragedy here : Shields gutsy underdog win over a much - hyped [ deservedly ] , Dan Henderson put to bed the stinky and lingering knock against Shields that he fights boring fights .
It was a rollercoaster model of intensity with buckets of intestinal fortitude , toughness and more never - say - die - tude than many have witnessed for awhile .
And an even greater tragedy here would be the seeming low viewer numbers CBS managed to swing this fight 's way [ which incidentally had little or nothing to do with the brawl ] .
Or the ways the community has been stumbling over itself to partake in this weirdly American ritual of the apology .
THESE are tragedies .
But Nick and Nate Diaz , Gil Melendez and Jake Shields reacting like we ALL would have reacted to Miller 's possibly misplaced show of " what about me " - ism , is not one of them .
Sure , CBS might drop MMA .
But it 's got nothing to do with a little bit of chaos in the cage .
The reality is America 's lingering uncomfortability with MMA has everything to do with the honesty with which MMA addresses the most human of all human endeavors : the management of conflict .
MMA is the most honest sport in America today .
Nick and Nate Diaz , like them or hate them , are some of the most honest among the honest .
And Jake Shields comported himself like a gentleman and a scholar .
In a sport that 's not a sissy sport .
So my advice to all involved : fine no one .
Ban no one .
Get them all in the cage on an upcoming card [ Miller 's objective after all ] , and stop the trembling and tearful knee - knocking concerns about America 's take on MMA .
Or…start following tennis .
I hear they 're looking to expand their fan base .

The Sights Of Gears Of War 3
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Tuesday , 25th of May 2010 - 08:38 PM ]
Below you will see some renders of the characters of Gears Of War 3 .
This also includes one of the new female marine that has been all the rage since the original Gears Of War information spill of 2010 .
Not to mention some good views at how the lighting has progressed for the franchise and engine .
Take a good look between the shots that look the same in the block below .
They are the same angle and action , but the lighting is much different .
Hopefully you 'll see the difference .
April 2011 is going to be a long hard wait .
But at least I am sure we will see more of these shots in the not too distant future .
During the first months of this year , the embers of a long running legal controversy have reignited in the United States .
‘ Of all the issues , ’ Rahm Emanuel was told by the senior Republican senator for South Carolina , Lindsey Graham , ‘ this is the one that could bring the presidency down . ’
The ‘ issue ’ is whether and where to try several dozen Guantánamo prisoners , in particular Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others accused of the 9/11 conspiracy .
Should they be tried in a military commission or in a federal court ?
Bush administration lawyers say the obvious solution is not bothering to try them at all , while Senator Graham ’s view is that it is inappropriate to hold civilian criminal trials for persons suspected of involvement in terrorism .
Late last year , Obama ’s administration decided that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the others would be tried in the New York federal district court in Manhattan ; six would face military commissions in a place yet to be decided ; and 48 others ( the number is undoubtedly higher ) would be held indefinitely without charge .
Obama had asked the US attorney general , Eric Holder , to make the decision ‘ in an effort to maintain an independent Justice Department ’ , but is now reported to be centrally involved himself , recognising that his administration had miscalculated the political fallout .
Graham has been trying to reach a deal with the White House over the attorney general ’s head , trading Republican support for the closing of Guantánamo in exchange for a military trial for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
At stake is not just whether the man known as KSM and his co-conspirators receive a civilian court trial , but the legal fate of all terrorism suspects , the future of the Guantánamo Bay detention facility and the credibility of the US attorney general .
This is dangerous ground for politicians and for lawyers .
The debate , portrayed as a battle between constitutionalists , who argue for jury trials , and hardliners , who want no such thing for men accused of terrorism , exposes serious shortcomings in the protections that constitutionalists contend would be in force if ‘ civilian justice ’ were achieved for these suspects .
For a start , the determined political involvement in court proceedings undermines any claim to a clear separation between the judicial and executive branches of state in the US .
This battle has broken out just as decisions are about to be made in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg on the extradition of a number of men whose cases led a court in London six years ago to state that no suspect should ever be extradited to the US if there were any risk that he might face trials of the sort that are now being argued for .
Military commissions are not the only issue : many of America ’s basic criminal justice practices – how and where it tries those accused of crimes , how it obtains evidence , how it prosecutes and treats its prisoners – have , since 2004 , been exposed to investigation , first by courts in London and then in Strasbourg .
The scrutiny has been made necessary because the US wants to try a number of men , almost all of them British , but their extraditions from the UK have been frozen while the courts determine whether there is a serious risk that sending them to the US would be to deliver them up to flagrantly unfair trials , severe and prohibited ill - treatment , or the death penalty .
In the white heat of 9/11 , Cheney , Rumsfeld and Bush considered the concept of due process irrelevant as they ransacked the world in search of suspects .
Seeking justification they conjured up new definitions .
An ‘ enemy combatant ’ was any individual judged to be actively aligning himself against America ; ‘ military commissions ’ were constructed to deal with combatants thus defined .
In parallel , America ’s ambition to extend its jurisdiction grew .
A number of individuals , arrested in the UK , were astonished to learn that activities they had undertaken years before offended against US law .
Two of those individuals , Babar Ahmad and Syed Talha Ahsan , had before 9/11 contributed in the UK to a website which , several years later , came to be construed by US prosecutors as having supported the Taliban ; their misfortune was that the service provider for the website was located in Connecticut .
A third , Haroon Aswat , had in 1999 spent two weeks on a farm in Oregon , where it had been suggested that military training for Muslims would be held ( it never materialised ) .
Two more , Adel Abdel Bary and Khalid al - Fawwaz , one of whom had in 1998 received faxes in an Islamic information office in London reporting that two US embassies in East Africa had been bombed that day , were charged with conspiring to cause those explosions .
These individuals discovered , with equal astonishment , that the basic propositions put forward by the US prosecutor in their cases had a further dire consequence : they fell into a category created by Bush to deal with the ‘ worst of the worst ’ .
In each case , the extradition court , at Bow Street in London , swiftly found that the extraditee , by virtue of the breadth of the US definition , ‘ would meet the criteria which would permit the president of the United States to make an order designating the defendant as an enemy combatant ’ , and thereby liable to be tried by a military commission .
A military court , even if all its proceedings are identical with those in a conventional trial , cannot meet the mandatory European Convention requirement of judicial independence .
Its judges are military employees within a hierarchical structure headed by their commander - in - chief , the president : there is no separation between the executive and the judiciary .
As a result , the judge at Bow Street decided that any individual who ran a serious risk of being designated as an enemy combatant would lose his due process rights to a fair and public trial before an independent tribunal .
If a man could be detained indefinitely ‘ subject to Military Order No. 1 ’ , it meant he would be ‘ deprived of his European Convention rights and extradition would be barred ’ .
The extradition requests would then have been dropped but for a flurry of diplomatic notes in which the US Embassy in London assured the UK government that the defendants would not be prosecuted before a military commission , or treated as enemy combatants : they would instead be tried before a federal court ‘ in accordance with the full panoply of rights and protections that would otherwise be provided to a defendant facing similar charges ’ .
Each of these extradition cases has subsequently been considered on these issues , on the value of such assurances and their limitations , first by Bow Street , then on appeal to the High Court in London .
Ultimately , the UK ’s decisions fall to be externally judged in Strasbourg and by the sometimes exacting standards of the European Convention on Human Rights , where these cases and others have now been stalled for nearly three years .
Could an unenforceable diplomatic promise hold good , in law or in practice , after the men have been extradited ?
And what action , if the men were tried before a jury and acquitted , might the US take if it nonetheless believed the defendants constituted a threat ?
The concept of its own conformity with international legal principles being exposed to outside judgment is entirely alien to the US .
When , for instance , Jordan refused to endorse the exemption of Americans from trial in the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity , the US immediately threatened to withdraw its contribution of one - fifth of Jordan ’s annual budget .
The Jordanian parliament promptly revoked its decision .
More than half a century after the nation - states of the world committed themselves to a significant chain of treaty obligations intended to permit external scrutiny of their internal compliance with those treaties , America continues to maintain a remarkable isolationism .
It opts out , not of the treaties , but of the provisions that allow inspection and sanction – the teeth of enforcement .
While it is a party to the UN Convention against Torture , it has never ratified the treaty ’s optional protocol , and it does n’t accept the right of individual petition to the Committee for the Prevention of Torture .
In those countries which have signed up , UN special rapporteurs on torture carry out unannounced inspections , intended to get behind the façade of impressive constitutions .
They dig out grim truths and their reports are often biting and always public .
America does n’t even accept the application of its own regional American Convention on Human Rights , which it signed but has never ratified .
Thus no individual in the US can have recourse to the Convention ’s enforcement body , the Inter - American Court on Human Rights .
Petitions can be sent to the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights , but its reports are not binding and findings are consistently ignored .
Although some US commentators give Obama credit for trying to demonstrate that the executive branch can wage war while also respecting the limits imposed on presidential power by the rule of law , that is not how it appears to the outside eye .
When , in February 2009 , a federal judge overseeing the cases of Guantánamo detainees asked whether the new administration wanted to modify the Bush position that the president could imprison people indefinitely without trial , Obama ’s Justice Department maintained the position that it could do so , if those persons were part of al - Qaida or its affiliates or their substantial supporters .
This reinforced what the extraditees and their lawyers had argued , first before the UK courts and then in Strasbourg : there was strong jurisprudential doubt whether any diplomatic note could bind any future US commander - in - chief if national security were perceived to be at stake .
Acknowledging , in an interview with the Washington Post , the possibility that trials may be switched to military commissions , the attorney general attempted to rationalise the position :
‘ At the end of the day , wherever this case is tried , in whatever forum , what we have to ensure is that it ’s done as transparently as possible and with adherence to all the rules .
If we do that , I ’m not sure the location or even the forum is as important as what the world sees in that proceeding . ’
In fact , ‘ what the world sees ’ is of little consequence .
The US is accustomed to filtering out external opinion , and will judge for itself whether or not it has adhered ‘ to all the rules ’ , since it exempts itself from sanction when its actions fail to comply with international standards .
External observers , including men arrested on warrants for extradition to the US ( as well as defence lawyers and no doubt many prosecutors ) , had watched with alarm in the years after 9/11 as José Padilla , a US citizen , and Ali Saleh al - Marri , a Qatari student in the US , were moved back and forth between conventional criminal trials before juries and military detention ( they were held in a naval brig in Charleston , South Carolina , where they found themselves subjected to the same ill - treatment as others in secret sites around the world ) .
Although at least one senior State Department lawyer , Harold Koh , maintains that the new administration ’s changes mean that the United States can now claim that its national security policies are fully compliant with domestic and international law under ‘ common and universal standards , not double standards ’ , the administration , unnerved by the political backlash , is swiftly beating a retreat from its early insistence on civilian trials and considering the retention of indefinite detention without trial .
Perhaps most chillingly , it seems not to appreciate that almost every basic safeguard necessary to achieve a conventional fair trial for the accused has , in practice , long since been destroyed in the US .
Neither nation - states nor their courts are accustomed to stand in one another ’s way when a request for extradition is made concerning a person described , however inappropriately , as a ‘ fugitive ’ .
Extradition arrangements originated in the ancient world as a practical way of demonstrating courtesy and goodwill between sovereigns .
The language of governments and of the courts continues to be deferential , speaking of effective relations between sovereign states .
‘ It goes without saying that [ the United States ] will be true to its constitution , ’ the High Court asserted in Babar Ahmad ’s case .
But the assurances given by the US since 2001 should have been greeted with more scepticism .
Twice the foreign secretary has had to come before Parliament to apologise for the fact that US promises concerning rendition had not been kept ; and in 2008 the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs recommended that US assurances should no longer be accepted , given the country ’s continuing denials that its interrogative practices met the universal definition of torture .
No assurances at all , fragile or not , are on offer to protect against the threat that extraditees , even if acquitted , might be subjected to rendition or indefinite detention , or the grim reality of solitary confinement in a small sealed prison cell before and after trial , or against sentences that could amount to a hundred years .
No assurances against the threat that any or all of these possibilities might induce guilty pleas from the innocent as well as a promise to ‘ co - operate ’ in providing evidence with which to prosecute others .
More than one extraditee still in the UK has been visited by a US prosecutor armed with a copy of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines .
These sentences , of more than any man ’s natural life expectancy are , the prisoners are told , ‘ the facts of life ’ .
The lawyers of Gary McKinnon ( alleged to have hacked into the Pentagon computers ) , offered the opportunity of a guilty plea , were told that should he refuse , once in America he would ‘ fry ’ .
More than 90 per cent of trials in the US are resolved by guilty pleas , an extraordinary statistic that is undoubtedly a result of the defendants ’ apprehension of what lies ahead – not just for the ‘ worst of the worst ’ – and their desire to avoid , at any cost , the risk of US law ’s most extreme application .
Each extraditee can picture himself , once in the US , in the position of those witnesses for the prosecution he now sees ranged against him .
Improper pressure to achieve the co-operation of witnesses for the prosecution is loudly denied , but why then does the plea agreement for the co-operating ( and only ) witness against one extraditee , Haroon Aswad , contain the provision that , if he were to fail to continue to co-operate , ‘ the United States would be free to exercise all rights it may have to detain the defendant as an enemy combatant ’ and to return him to total isolation under the much feared Special Administrative Measures ?
And why did the co-operating witness ’s attorney , in communications with other lawyers which form part of the extradition court ’s record , write ( before his client had agreed to give evidence against others ) :
‘ As it turns out , one of the key witnesses against my client is a British citizen who ’s being held at Guantánamo Bay as an enemy combatant ’?
Thus the dominoes fall one by one .
Later , after the London court ’s decision in 2005 , he wrote again :
It ’s pretty apparent the good guys were winning until the diplomatic note showed up .
What a pity .
I did find … aspects of the ruling especially entertaining … that the magistrate somehow thinks a diplomatic note stating that the US wo n’t try this guy in military court will bind the president .
Since when has our president – the greatest international scofflaw of our time – ever felt bound by any diplomatic accord ?
For two of those awaiting extradition , Adel Abdel Bary and Khalid al - Fawwaz , there is an additional irony .
They have watched with astonishment what has happened to their co-accused , Ahmed Ghailani , who , it is now proposed , will be tried with them in Manhattan and whose pending trial is intended by the authorities to have ‘ a two - pronged effect ; justice will be done and the credibility of the courts will be re-established ’.
A warrant for Ghailani ’s arrest was issued by the New York Federal District Court in 1998 : he ’d been indicted for involvement in the East Africa bombings of US embassies in that year .
In January 2005 his captors reported from Pakistan that he had been handed over to the United States ‘ several months ago ’ .
He was then held as a ghost prisoner in a secret prison run by the CIA .
Reported by Human Rights
Watch to be one of the significant ‘ disappeared ’ , he finally emerged in 2006 , but not in the Manhattan court ; instead , on the precise basis of the indictment issued by the New York court in 1998 , he was placed on trial before a different kind of court , a military commission in Guantánamo Bay , where charges were filed by military prosecutors for the bombing of the US Embassy in Tanzania .
‘ Officials were aware of the 1998 civilian indictment , ’ their spokesman , General Hartmann , explained , but were proceeding with a military case at Guantánamo .
‘ That is the avenue the president , the Congress and the Department of Defense established to deal with alleged war crimes in connection with the global war on terror . ’
Each development served to confirm the worst fears of Ghailani ’s co-accused in the UK .
Their co-defendant was to be tried within a system specifically constructed to remove from him that ‘ full panoply of rights ’ assured to them , as well as to remove access to him by others .
The United States had chosen to split the trial : half – Ghailani ’s trial – was to be conducted in Guantánamo in secret session , outside the conventional rule of law , and half in Manhattan .
Ghailani ’s position was to change yet again , however .
In spring 2009 he was moved from Guantánamo into the civilian court system and transferred to New York to stand trial before the Federal District Court in Manhattan .
Meanwhile , deep into its consideration of the extradition cases in Strasbourg , the European Court asked the UK government to provide some evidence : ‘ If extradited , approximately how long would the Applicants spend in pre-trial detention ? ’
A simple response was given : the US constitution guarantees the right to a speedy trial .
But what of Ghailani , who disappeared into a secret prison in 2004 and did not surface for trial until five years later , and then only after the abandonment of plans to try him before serving soldiers at Guantánamo Bay ?
His lawyers in New York assert that in those years he was submitted more than a hundred times to techniques ‘ amounting to torture ’ and ‘ appears to be so damaged ’ by his treatment that his ability to assist them in preparing his defence has been harmed .
From the perspective of the European Convention the future of the extraditees begins to appear as not just political but legal pandemonium .
The guarantee that they will have a fair trial is in grave doubt .
There is no reticence in America in commenting on an arrest , a trial , or the evidence the prosecution claims loudly , from the outset , to possess .
In the UK , the inhibiting Contempt of Court Act demands that any reporting that might influence a jury be prohibited ; the flurry occasioned by arrest and charge , even in the most dramatically newsworthy cases , is immediately silenced until the trial begins .
In the US the reverse is the case ; the concept of freedom of speech as it has evolved permits free - ranging commentary and unlimited coverage .
The decision to move Ghailani to the Manhattan court acted as the precursor of the current political storm .
The New York Times of 10 February quotes Ghailani ’s prosecutors commenting without inhibition : ‘ Prosecutors have said that the delays in bringing him into the criminal justice system were justified on national security grounds and did not violate his speedy - trial rights .
They said Mr Ghailani was a “ long - standing al - Qaida terrorist ” and was initially treated as an intelligence asset after his capture .
“ The United States was , and still is , at war with al - Qaida , ” prosecutors said . ’
Where in all of the sorry history of this one case does the presumption of innocence rest , as guaranteed by the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights ?
Where is there any regard for the US constitutional right to a fair and speedy trial ?
Where is there respect for the concept of trial by a jury free from prior knowledge or opinion ?
Each nation creates its own system of justice .
For the European Court of Human Rights , required to address cases from 40 member states , each with a different system ( some are inquisitorial , with an investigative juge d’instruction , others adversarial ; some have lay juries , others professional judges ) , achieving a case law of precedent and setting minimum standards through its jurisprudence for Article 6 of the Convention ( the right to a fair trial ) is more problematic than meeting other minimum norms .
Even in a system in which a professional judge makes the ultimate determination , there are taboos concerning public commentary .
When a French government minister and the prosecutor publicly asserted the guilt of one defendant , Patrick Allenet de Ribemont , France was held by Strasbourg to have breached his right to a fair trial .
How then to achieve a fair trial in the US , where it is open season on every accused , and where the very fact of entitlement to a trial in these cases is the most bitterly fought of current political battles – for the members of any potential jury pool just as much as for politicians ?
European courts have themselves often had to consider equally challenging cases .
Abdullah Ocalan , the Kurdish leader of the PKK , kidnapped in Kenya by Turkish intelligence agents , was prized as a ‘ high - value detainee ’ by Turkey , just as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is by the US .
Once captured , Ocalan was held in complete isolation , and his first hearing was before a panel of three judges , one of them a Turkish military officer .
At the full trial he was convicted and sentenced to death .
The Strasbourg court found against Turkey : Ocalan ’s right to a fair trial , guaranteed by Article 6 of the European Convention , had been irretrievably violated by his being held in isolation before the trial and by the military presence at his first hearing , and that in turn vitiated all claims to legitimacy for the sentence of death .
His conviction could not stand .
Forced to investigate conditions in the US , and to enlist the help of defence lawyers there in establishing otherwise unreported data , extraditees have come to understand that practice after practice is accepted as standard in America which , in Europe , could risk the prohibition of a trial , or subsequently cause its nullification , or bring an end to the conditions of imprisonment it stipulated .
Within a system of criminal justice that for all of us , from a lifetime of watching procedural dramas , seems more familiar than our own , there are profoundly disturbing features which do not accord with the assumptions we continue to maintain , despite the actions of the previous administration , about the constitution of the United States .
Not every shortcoming can be explained as a product of the Bush / Cheney assault on due process rights or a reflection of their enthusiastic embrace of coercive ill - treatment as an investigative tool – an issue that US lawyers , both civilian and military , have in the last decade combined in force with campaigners to resist .
Many ugly practices have long been embedded in the day to day operation of the US criminal justice system and their opponents have found it difficult to mount collective sustained resistance to them , and have had no endorsement from court rulings , national or international , to help them .
American defence lawyers tell us , with resignation , that principles we believed prevailed there as here do not have a sound footing in US case law ; evidence obtained from a prosecution witness by coercion , for example , cannot be excluded before a jury hears it .
A senior counsel representing the United States in the High Court in London explained that US law permits the otherwise unlawful kidnapping of suspects elsewhere in the world , to bring them ‘ to justice ’ in the US .
And every defence lawyer representing those held in isolation before trial has spoken to the Strasbourg court of the bleak hopelessness of the defendant , the deterioration of his mental state and the impotence of lawyers over many years in achieving redress .
Those who represent Muslim defendants convicted of involvement in terrorist activity predict with certainty that none of their clients will ever escape from the most extreme forms of isolation American prisons can impose .
We read , year after year , obscene details of executions in the US : most are successful , but there are also descriptions of frustrated attempts , hour after hour , to find a vein to inject .
For a long time , the UK had no cause for complacency .
Capital punishment was abolished here in 1965 , but Britain continued to extradite to countries that retained the death penalty , and would have continued to do so had not the European Court determined in 1989 in the case of Soering v. UK that the ‘ death row ’ phenomenon , in which a person might spend years awaiting execution while the legal process was exhausted , constituted inhuman and degrading treatment according to Article 3 of the Convention .
Since then no European state has been permitted to extradite in the absence of an assurance that conviction would not bring the death penalty .
But what of extradition to a future of total isolation ?
Can we comfortably , and within the law , contemplate sending men to that fate ?
Some of the men who currently await extradition are imprisoned in a small unit , where they are at least in the company of other human beings , and within the unit ’s limits can talk , argue , study , cook , write , paint or exercise outdoors in whatever sunlight imprisonment in Worcestershire may afford them .
This is not luxury .
It is deprivation , of family life , of freedom and of hope .
But once on American soil these men have been told by US prosecutors to expect total isolation .
Each extraditee will be held under Special Administrative Measures until trial and then , on his anticipated conviction , in solitary confinement in a Supermax prison , ADX Florence in Colorado , potentially for life and without any prospect of parole .
He will be confined in a cell 7 feet by 12 feet , with a moulded concrete bunk ; his food will be delivered through a slot in the door ; external communication , even with a doctor , will come via a closed - circuit television in his cell .
For one hour in each day , he will be able to visit a small dark pit where he can exercise alone .
His fellow prisoners ( although he will not see them ) will be ‘ the most severely psychotic people ’ the most experienced analyst of the effects of Supermax confinement , Terry Kupers , has seen in 25 years of psychiatric practice , and he will be likely , since the primary cause is isolation , to become one such himself .
His solitary confinement can and perhaps will continue for life .
After his tour of America in 1842 Dickens wrote of the use of isolation in the American prisons he had seen : ‘ I hold this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body . ’
By the late 19th century , evidence of the devastating effects of solitary confinement on prisoners ’ health had surfaced , and in 1890 , the Supreme Court , considering the case of a death - row prisoner , echoed the language of today ’s doctors : ‘ A considerable number of the prisoners fell , even after a short confinement , into a semi- fatuous condition , from which it was next to impossible to arouse them and others became violently insane ; others , still , committed suicide . ’
In the 19th century , isolation was intended to provide an opportunity for the redemption of the prisoner ’s Christian soul , but Supermax prisons emerged , penologists argue , from a powerful ‘ rage to punish ’ felt by many politicians and members of the public in the late 20th century .
Craig Haney , one of those penologists , believes that the US now celebrates and often demands , rather than lamenting or merely tolerating , official cruelty and the infliction of pain in its criminal justice system .
What once passed for ‘ penal philosophy ’ now amounts to little more than devising ‘ creative strategies ’ to make prisoners suffer .
Supermax confinement , built on the twin pillars of prolonged solitary confinement and extreme severity of conditions , is one of those strategies .
The cells are carefully designed by architects to limit access to natural light , to eliminate stimulation or distraction , and reflect a total disregard for the principle that all prisoners are members of the human community .
Although one US district court judge , in the case of Madrid v. Gomez in 1995 , described conditions in a Supermax unit as pushing at ‘ the outer bounds of what most humans can psychologically tolerate ’ and in the case of mentally - ill prisoners has ‘ the equivalent of placing an asthmatic in a place with little air to breathe ’ , no constitutional bar to their continuing use has been imposed by any court .
Even Denmark , a country considered by the UN special rapporteur on torture to be entirely compliant with every other human rights obligation , was warned following an inspection that to detain a suspect in solitary confinement , if it were done in the expectation that it might induce an admission of guilt , could constitute torture contrary to Article 3 of the Convention .
The same special rapporteurs have expressed particular concern about conditions in maximum security prisons in the US which violate internationally protected rights , but they can do no more than register concern since they have no right to conduct internal inspections .
Despite continual recommendations by the UN Human Rights Committee that the US government should scrutinise conditions in Supermax prisons and implement minimum UN standards , there have been no changes in practice , and the federal government is building more such facilities .
Human Rights
Watch found in 2000 that there were nearly 20,000 prisoners held in complete isolation in the US , nearly 2 per cent of the prison population ( by now unofficial figures range between 25,000 and 70,000 ) .
Such few judicial honours as can so far be awarded go to the extradition judge in Bow Street who so straightforwardly rejected the idea that a military commission conformed with the fair trial guarantees of the European Convention .
On the isolation imposed by pre-trial SAMs he expressed extreme anxiety – ‘ It is in relation to these that I find the greatest grounds for concern ’ – and in the case of Abu Hamza , so disabled that he was likely if convicted to be imprisoned in ADX Florence only briefly before transfer to a prison hospital , he found that ‘ but for that fact ’ the brutal isolation would violate Article 3 .
When the same issue has been considered in the high courts , the judges have sidestepped the facts :
‘ For a mature and sophisticated democracy that respects the rule of law , it would be unusual , to say the least , if one of its lawful and carefully prescribed methods of incarceration were to be condemned for giving rise to an automatic violation of Article 3 . ’
The inclusion of the word ‘ automatic ’ is intended to describe the protection that litigation provides for a prisoner once in solitary confinement , but the prospects for an effective challenge are non-existent ; there is no funding for prisoner litigation in the US and administrative obstacles prevent even the most determined litigant having his case heard within ten years .
In any event , even prisoners who have gone for years without speaking to anyone other than Federal Bureau of Prisons officials have not been able to establish a claim under the 8th Amendment to the constitution , which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment , since human contact is not classified as a ‘ single identifiable human need such as warmth , food or exercise ’ .
Extreme isolation , even for life , is not considered under the US constitution to be a denial of the ‘ minimal civilised measure of life ’s necessities ’ .
Strasbourg , the European court of last resort , has been criticised in the past for a lack of imagination , or at least of judicial understanding , of the impact of solitary confinement on prisoners , and of having ‘ too ready an acceptance of state interests ’ .
On the one hand , it has been reluctant to judge actual solitary confinement regimes as being in violation of the Convention , but , on the other , it has reminded itself of the irreducible nature of Article 3 : ‘ States face very real difficulties in protecting their populations from terrorist violence … the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , irrespective of the conduct of the person concerned .
The nature of the offence allegedly committed by the applicant is therefore irrelevant for the purposes of Article 3 . ’
But it is precisely the ‘ nature of the offence ’ that will condemn the extraditees to conditions of imprisonment and lengths of sentence that are an inevitable consequence of the civilian trials constitutionalists argue for , established as these practices have become within an entirely constitutional structure .
Is indefinite military detention really any worse a prospect ?
Observations are easily made on the defects of one jurisdiction from the safety of another .
The beam in our own national eye concerns the UK ’s use of indefinite detention without trial and its complicity in torture perpetrated by others .
We have not had to fight to end capital punishment in our own country or to participate in direct action to bring an end to the offshore illegality of Guantánamo .
It is entirely by accident that we have come to see what probably remains unknown to most Americans .
One young American citizen , Syed Fahad Hashmi , was due to stand trial this month in Manhattan .
He has been subjected to every coercive and unconstitutional practice at issue in the still outstanding extraditions in the three years since he was flown from the UK to the US .
Before his transfer to the US , Hashmi was held in Belmarsh Prison in the same conditions as all other prisoners , accused of an offence that if tried in the UK would have merited at most a sentence of two or three years ; since his extradition , he has been kept in total isolation in a tiny cell .
He has not seen daylight since arriving in this New York prison .
The Anglo - American adversarial process is intended to rest on a guarantee of fairness , an equality of arms between prosecution and defence .
Hashmi , under the disabilities that years of solitary confinement inevitably create , even for the strongest and fittest , faced a prosecution based on the evidence of a co-operating witness who pleaded guilty in the US to engagement in terrorist activity in Pakistan , including the use of explosives and the attempted murder of the country ’s then president .
The witness , having served the shortest of prison terms in the US , and having given evidence against others in a cluster of trials in a range of jurisdictions , claimed that Hashmi , a student in England , let him leave a suitcase in his London flat in which there were combat clothes and lent him his phone , on which he , the witness , rang a suspected terrorist in the UK .
This was enough to secure his extradition .
For this , the co-operating witness goes free and his victim stands trial on charges of providing material support for terrorism .
On the eve of that trial , having maintained his innocence for three years , but faced with the prospect of a 70 - year sentence , Hashmi changed his plea to guilty .
It is possible for Strasbourg to deliver a judgment to which the US , uniquely , must pay heed if it wishes extraditions to continue .
Its granting of an interim freezing order on all extradition cases is exceptional and the length of time , now nearly three years , it has taken to wrestle with the acute legal problems thrown up by the practices of the United States in these cases is unprecedented .
But , whatever Strasbourg ’s judgment , the failures of due process and the utter disregard for the rights of prisoners in the US has long cried out for attention .
29 April
Italian design collective Acquacalda have designed a range of kitchen gadgets based on the laws of physics , including this device for pouring exactly equal amounts of wine into four glasses .
Called Applied Physics , the collection also includes a self - hydrating plant pot , a glass with a measuring reservoir , a bowl for weighing dry food in water and a vase that indicates the water level inside through its handle .
Top : One For All , All For One -
Wine dispenser for table : a uniform flow of liquid out of the four holes allows to fill simultaneously and uniformly the glasses of all the diners .
The Pascal principle :
The pressure exerted on a fluid enclosed in a container is transmitted unchanged at any point of the fluid and at the walls of the container that contains it .
Above : Archimede 's Scale - Graduated food bowl used as scale if immersed in water : the depth of immersion indicates the weight of the content .
The Buoyancy : A body immersed ( totally or partially ) in a fluid receives a vertical boost called buoyancy ( bottom - up ) of intensity equal to the weight of a mass of fluid of shape and volume equal to the submerged part of the body .
The point of application of buoyancy , called center of thrust , is on the same line as the pressure gradient which would be the center of mass of the portion of fluid that would occupy the space actually occupied by the immersed part of the body .
Above : Vasco - Container with water reserve : the passage of water between two vessels in communication allows the plant to hydrate itself if necessary , taking advantage of stock in the bottle .
Also the lowering of liquid level in the bottle indicates water consumption and the need for refueling .
Principle of communicating vessels :
The principle of communicating vessels is the physical principle according to which a liquid inside two containers communicating with each other reaches the same level .
The liquid does n’t have a proper shape but takes the shape of the container that contains it .
For this reason , if you pour a liquid in communicating containers , though different in shape , it gets at the same level in each containers .
Above : Mix In Glass - Glass with dispenser for the preparation of cocktails : the graduated cap has a double drilling , a hole for the drinking straw and one for the passage of air / fluid ; by closing with a finger the drinking straw inserted through the hole in the glass it is possible to dose the preparation necessary ingredients one by one .
After the measurement of each ingredient , it is enough to free the drinking straw hole to make it fall into the glass .
After repeating this operation for each ingredient it is possible , if necessary , to mix a cocktail by keeping the drinking straw hole re-sealed .
After removing the cap from the glass , the cocktail is ready to be served .
The atmospheric pressure :
The atmospheric pressure is the pressure present at any point in the Earth 's atmosphere .
In most cases the atmospheric pressure value is equivalent to the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the weight of air present above the measuring point .
Here 's some text from the designers :
APPLIED PHYSICS :
To experience daily actions
Applied Physics in general is based on physical sciences fundamental truths and most important concepts , but is especially interested in the application of these scientific principles in practical systems .
Applied Physics for design has led to direct design solutions particularly tangible and useful , allowing to transform everyday objects in scientific instrumentation .
Above : Communicating Vase - Vase for cut flowers : the addition to the side of a ceramic vase of a transparent tube allows it to " communicate " constantly the level of water remaining inside it .
Principle of communicating vessels :
The principle of communicating vessels is the physical principle according to which a liquid inside two containers communicating with each other reaches the same level .
The liquid does n’t have a proper shape but takes the shape of the container that contains it .
For this reason , if you pour a liquid in communicating containers , though different in shape , it gets at the same level in each containers .
Vases , bowls , shakers become instruments of direct knowledge without losing their original function ; form , closely connected to function , stimulates the user ’s curiosity and interactivity .
As the object becomes intellectually stimulating , it triggers the concept of an enjoyable object ; a collection of objects for different uses share a common language .
Acquacalda is a group of designers working in experimental and vanguardist design .
The commitment is to make use of design as applied art with the intent to communicate and develop themes , to gather and show connections .

A few days ago , I mentioned that the Atheists , Agnostics & Freethinkers at the University of Illinois chalked their campus up with stick figure images of Muhammad .
Chris Calvey , the president of the Atheists , Humanists , & Agnostics group at the University of Wisconsin – Madison , is planning to do the same thing on his campus .
Like the group at U of I , Chris knows this is not an attack on Muslim students .
This is a response to the ridiculous rules that radical Muslims think the rest of us have to follow .
Just to be civil , he wrote a letter to the Muslim Student Association , letting them know exactly what AHA would be doing and why :
We are aware that depicting images of Muhammad is a controversial issue that is highly offensive to many Muslims around the world .
We acknowledge that you may view this as an unproductive , misguided , or hurtful event .
We are very sensitive to these facts , and want to ensure that this event is done in a way that does not lead to Muslims feeling uncomfortable on campus .
That is why I want to explain our position and our intentions as clearly as possible before the event takes place .
These drawings are not intended to mock , intimidate , or harass anyone -– rather , we aim to make the following statements :
1 ) We have the right to criticize religion and to perform actions considered blasphemous , even if many individuals find this offensive .
2 ) A free society cannot tolerate violence or threats of violence which seek to limit our freedom of expression .
Further , we fully understand that Revolution Islam is a radical , fringe organization that does not represent mainstream Islam in any way .
It goes without saying that the overwhelming majority of Muslims , in the U.S. and across the world , do not view their tactics as acceptable .
You can argue whether or not he should ’ve sent this email .
The other option was to just chalk the campus as planned and let them discover the drawings with no warning .
I can respect why he felt sending the email would be a more honorable thing to do .
Anyway , in response , the Muslim students wrote back and said they understood why Chris and the AHA were responding that way , and while they do n’t approve of the tactic , they acknowledge that students have a right to voice their opinions in this way .
… I ’m just kidding .
Ahmed Fikri , the MSA Vice President , wrote back to Chris to say that his group is pissed off that anyone would dare offend their prophet and they ’re preparing to defend the radical mindset .
Dear Chris Calvey , I am the Vice President of the MSA and I will cut straight to the chase .
Your apology is not accepted since your act is actually offensive … …
I would like to inform you that , as far as we understand , the event you are planning is illegal by the constitution of the University of Wisconsin ( 88 - 12 RACIST AND OTHER DISCRIMINATORY CONDUCT POLICY ) .
Deviating from this law will offend not only the UW Muslim Students Association but the entire Muslim community on this campus and other organization of similar culture and faith .
The Dean of Students shall be contacted immediately .
I politely suggest that you cancel this event and prefer instead that we meet and discuss the issue respectfully before resorting to what we feel to be rather drastic measures .
No offense , but giving less than 24 hours notice seems to betray ill intentions .
I respect the fact you let us know about your plans beforehand but I also want to reiterate that we do not approve or agree with your highly offensive acts .
I assure you that we believe in freedom of expression just as much as you purport to do .
Wow .
Drawing a stick figure with the word Muhammad is racist , discriminatory , and illegal ?
Talk about overreaction …
It ’s a stick figure drawing .
Chill .
Out .
I suppose Chris could also draw images of Jesus , Buddha , Joseph Smith , and Krishna alongside Muhammad .
Hell , draw all the Super Best Friends .
But there ’s no need to .
The Muslim students are the ones overreacting about someone else disobeying the laws of their faith .
You do n’t see Jews getting this upset when other people eat pork .
And I doubt atheists would get angry if MSA students went around drawing images of nothing .
This is precisely why I support drawing images of Muhammad .
It teaches the lesson that , in America , beliefs are allowed to be criticized .
More importantly , you do n’t have a special right not to get offended .
You do n’t have to draw obscene , offensive drawings to make your point , either .
A simple drawing will accomplish the same goal — Chris knows that .
If the MSA wanted to have a debate about this act after the fact , I ’m sure the AHA group would love to have one .
Let there be a free exchange of ideas .
Let there be a further discussion about this .
I hope Chris gets a positive response from all this .
…
*** Update ***: Chris met with the Associate Dean of Students earlier today and reported this :
We had a very productive and civil discussion .
He stopped short of making a definitive statement about whether or not this event is in violation of any code of conduct – as the issues involved are complex and the outcome of the MSA ’s complain is unpredictable .
The event is still on .
They ’ll get together tonight to do the chalking .

Two passengers aboard an Emirates Air flight taxiing to a JFK Airport runway were briefly detained Thursday while security officials checked their names against the no-fly list .
The passengers returned to the plane after they were cleared , and the incident was deemed a false alarm .
But the no-fly alarm comes just days after security officials arrested Times Square bombing suspect Faisal Shahzad on the same Dubai - bound Emriates Air route and points to the heightened precautions at the airport .
The fact that Shahzad managed to board an Emirates flight on Saturday night hours after his name was added to the U.S. government 's no-fly list -- and was just moments away from takeoff -- has prompted high - level criticism of the airline .
Mayor Bloomberg and Obama administration officials charged Emirates with failing to do comprehensive screening before allowing Shahzad on board .
Sen .
Charles Schumer called for legislation to close a loophole that allows passengers who , like Shahzad , pay for an airline ticket in cash without triggering extra scrutiny .
But Emirates
Air has bristled at charges that it somehow mishandled the Shahzad situation .
On Thursday , Emirates Air President Tim Clark lashed out at the Obama administration for faulting the airline over Shahzad 's flight .
He said Emirates complied with all security procedures in the incident .
" We 're not a security agency , " he told our colleagues from Zawya Dow Jones in a telephone interview .
" For the Obama administration to say that we dropped the ball on this , it 's a bit much . "
Clark also said the updated no - fly list " was n't circulated the way it should have been . "
The new tax law passed late in 2017 included an odd provision : raising taxes on people who bike to work .
Here 's how that works :
Since 2009 , employers have been allowed to reimburse employees who commute by bike up to $ 20 a month , tax - free , for the cost of a bicycle and accessories , plus some other related expense .
Advertisement - Article continues below
But now , that $ 240 is taxable income to the employee .
So the value of the benefit is reduced by as much as 37 % , depending on your tax bracket .
Roughly 60,000 bike commuters will be affected , according to figures by the League of American Cyclists .
Bicycling advocates are unsure why the tax treatment of the employee benefit was altered .
The net benefit to the U.S. Treasury from will add up to only about $ 5 million , the League estimates .
While the tax hike on cyclists may cast a bit of a shadow over this year 's Bike Month , keep in mind that bicycling remains a dirt - cheap way to get to work .
Not to mention the health benefits .

Cheers , -- Andy
Ahmed Ahmed has done much of the talking on the happenings of the past weekend and that ’s just fine with me .
I was too busy soaking in a Chelsea victory at Liverpool under very surreal circumstances .
Liverpool was coming off a heart - breaking defeat at the hands of Atletico Madrid in the Europa League while Chelsea was riding high on a string of emphatic victories .
The surreal nature largely centered around the fact that a seemingly large amount of Liverpool faithful were actually hoping for a Chelsea victory .
The hatred and rivalry between Liverpool and United has reached a point where Red fans would rather lose a shot at European qualification than see United win another Premiership title .
Think about that for a minute .
How many rivalries in American sports are so strong that fans would actively cheer for their team to lose a shot at the playoffs if it would guarantee their chief rival would n’t win the title ?
Apparently this is nothing new in English football and that sort of blind devotion is actually quite refreshing .
To add to the madness of the day , it was Liverpool talisman Steven Gerrard that set up Chelsea ’s first goal of the match .
Gerrard attempted an atrocious back - pass to Reina that was intercepted by Didier Drogba who dribbled around the keeper and slotted the gift home .
Frank Lampard added a second by finishing a beautiful play set up by a hard - working Nicolas Anelka .
Next week , Chelsea look to lock up the title at Stamford Bridge against a Wigan Athletic side that is assured top - flight football next year but is still in the bottom third .
United plays a poor Stoke City side with kickoff at the same time but hopefully Chelsea can put the match away early and the celebration can start at the half .
Look for a match preview at the end of the week !!

STOCKHOLM ( AP ) -- A Swedish artist whose drawing of the Prophet Muhammad offended Muslims said Wednesday he hopes to get another chance to deliver a lecture on free - speech that was interrupted by violent protests .
But officials at Uppsala University said they doubted they would invite Lars Vilks again after police used pepper spray and batons to help him escape a furious crowd Tuesday .

" It 's nothing that we 're discussing right now , but it 's not very likely given how it turned out here , " university spokeswoman Anneli Vaara said .
While Vilks escaped the incident with broken glasses and a degree of shock , he said it raised concerns about the freedom of expression at Sweden 's oldest and most prestigious institute of higher learning .
" What you get is a mob deciding what can be discussed at the university , " Vilks told The Associated Press , adding he was ready to repeat the lecture if re-invited .
" I 'm ready to go up again , " he said .
" This must be carried through .
You can not allow it to be stopped . "
» See Lars Vilks ' blog .
As of 9:50 a.m. it was hacked and presenting an Islamic message protesting Vilks .
( Warning : Obscene language at link . )
The 53 - year - old artist has faced numerous threats over his 2007 sketch of Muhammad with a dog 's body .
Earlier this year U.S. investigators said he was the target of an alleged murder plot involving Colleen LaRose , an American woman who dubbed herself " Jihad Jane , " and who now faces life in prison .
She has pleaded not guilty .
Witnesses said the violence broke out a few minutes into Vilks ' lecture about the limits of artistic freedom , when he showed a film by an Iranian artist about Islam and homosexuality .
A young man leaped from his front - row seat and tried to attack Vilks , police and the artist said .
Vilks initially believed he was head - butted by the man , but said he later understood he had collided with plainclothes police officers who intercepted the attacker and then briskly evacuated Vilks from the room .
" This was the first time I 've experienced a physical assault , " Vilks said .
" It was a bit of a shock . "
A video of the incident showed agitated police officers clashing with protesters at the front of the lecture hall .
A female police officer used pepper spray to subdue a young man , and another youngster was wrestled to the ground .
Some protesters were shouting " God is great " in Arabic .
Uppsala police spokesman Jonas Eronen said two officers sustained minor injuries .
The attacker was detained on suspicion of attempted assault but was later released , he said .
Two others - a man and a woman - were also released after questioning and could face charges of using violence against police .
All suspects were in their late teens , Eronen said .
Vaara , the university spokeswoman , said the lecture had been open to the public and the suspects were not believed to be students , though she added she was n't sure about that .
The incident was condemned by Swedish newspaper editorials calling it an attack on the freedom of speech , and in more moderate terms by the Scandinavian country 's leading politician .
" It shows that there are tensions in this discussion , which I 've had to follow for years , " Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt told reporters in Stockholm .
" I take it very seriously .
There is a risk that tensions form between individuals and the Swedish society , which is something we do n't want . "
Helena Benauouda , the head of Sweden 's Muslim Council , an umbrella group for Muslim organizations , declined comment , saying she did n't have enough information about the incident .
Vilks depicted Muhammad more than a year after 12 Danish newspaper cartoons of the prophet sparked furious protests in Muslim countries in 2006 .
Images of Muhammad , even favorable ones , are considered blasphemous by many Muslims .
A Swedish newspaper printed Vilks ' drawing , leading to further protests , and revived a heated debate in the West and the Muslim world about religious sensitivities and the limits of free speech .

The time is 7.30 pm on a Wednesday , and the place is Shepherd 's Bush , west London .
All along the Uxbridge Road , small , overlit counters - in - a - cupboard offer you takeaway evening meals .
If you 're on the lookout for gristle on a stick , or deep - fried nearly - meat and soggy chips , it 's your lucky night .
If not , keep walking west until you see the friendly red logo , the neon Portuguese rooster of Nando's .
Inside , you 'll see that the restaurant is busy , but the waitress finds you a spot .
Who else is eating ?
On a large table at the back is a sprawling collection of friends : some baseball - hatted teenagers , some mums and dads .
Thirtysomethings Duran and Yvonne are among them .
Duran likes Nando's hot chicken because " it reminds me of Caribbean food " .
Yvonne approves of the low prices , loves the corn on the cob and likes her chicken medium , not too spicy .
" And you get your food quick ! "
Nearby sits Sandro , 22 , the cashier , who has just clocked off .
He 's from Portugal , is studying in England and has been working here for a year and a half .
Now he trains new staff .
" The standards are very important – customer service , the cooking and serving .
I like working with the customers , even when it 's very busy , like when there is football . "
Right by the window sit students Asha and Faisa , in their early 20s , their beautifully made - up eyes set off by their hijabs .
This is their first time in Nando's and they 're impressed : " I had the chicken burger , " says Asha , " it was very flavoured , not like the usual plain chicken burger .
I 'm going to bring my daughter here . "
Faisa likes the background music and how " they make it warm and friendly , it 's not X - rated for kids and it 's affordable for families .
I do n't want to leave ! "
I go right around the restaurant , but no one has any complaints .
And the food is making me hungry .
The photographer and I go to the counter to order .
There are two community police officers there , who tell me they often pick up a Nando 's takeaway when they work .
" The chicken is healthier than all that fried stuff .
You do n't get grease on your uniform . "
Do you go to Nando's ?
Of course you do .
Only those who never let a non-organic French fry pass their lips or who live a long way from a town or are hardcore multinational refuseniks do n't go to Nando's .
Without fanfare or advertising , Nando's has woven itself into the fabric of UK society over the past few years , popping up on high streets across the country to serve everyone from happy families to lunching workers , from gaggling teens to dating couples .
Even the locally minded who campaign against Nando 's arrival ( London 's Stoke Newingtonians comes to mind ) seem to go quiet once it 's established : it's a safe place for teenagers to go , and they want to hang out there .
The under - 21s are not often welcomed into restaurants and invited to stay .
Nando's , however , is relaxed about its teen - appeal and even encourages it , by offering free refills of fizzy drinks .
And it 's this , as well as its food , that has led to young celebrities , such as pop stars Chipmunk , Tinchy Stryder , JLS , N - Dubz and Pixie Lott , being spotted in Nando's .
They do n't mind : they all love Nando's and are happy to say so – as are other , more stately celebs , including David Beckham , Mary J Blige , Oprah Winfrey , Ricky Gervais and Jay - Z ( who asked for Nando 's chicken on his rider at the Brit awards ) .
So many of the UK's young and famous are pro-Nando's that the pap snap of a celeb clutching its red-lettered take - out bag has become a tabloid staple .
The brand is now inextricably linked with a certain type of youthful , racially mixed , urban British pop star and , so , with modern , inner-city , multicultural Britain .
It even tastes new .
Far from the tasteless stodge of traditional UK food , American bland - burgers or no-offence Italian pasta and pizza , Nando 's food is spicy , with roots in Africa and , therefore , the West Indies .
" How would I persuade your mum to go Nando's ? " says 19 - year - old rapper Chipmunk , real name Jahmaal Fyffe .
" I 'd just tell her : good chicken .
It 's hot .
It 's got flavour . "

Chicken is what Nando 's does .
Decent chicken – not organic , but not frozen , nor reconstituted , battery - farmed or pumped full of chemicals either – cooked in front of you , as quick as you like .
Chicken that comes extra hot , hot , medium or lemon and herb ( also mango and lime , or plain , but everyone forgets about those ) .
Each piece , even the plain , is marinated in spicy peri-peri sauce for 24 hours before it 's grilled , the sauce made from a recipe based on the Portuguese Galinha à Africana method of barbecuing chicken .
You can have your chicken as a quarter , half , whole or wings , with one or two regular sides , such as corn on the cob and coleslaw , or a fino side ( ratatouille – ugh ! ) .
If you want chips , you can choose between regular and the very popular hot chips , sizzled with peri-peri .
Add spicy or garlic sauce as you wish .
And that 's it .
There are other ways to eat your bird – in a pitta , as a burger , in a wrap , as a salad – but most people plump for the straightforward barbecue - plus - sides offer .
Enough chicken for you ?
Well , no , actually .
It seems that , as a nation , we want more and more .
In the past few months , Nando's has taken advantage of the cheaper property market and expanded aggressively in London , opening in Westfield shopping centre , on the South Bank , in King 's Cross .
Outside London , it has opened in Belfast , Thurrock and Glasgow .
There are now 220 Nando's in the UK , in every large town from Edinburgh to Exeter , serving 800,000 customers every week .
Even if some of those customers visit every day , and some just opt for a salad , that is a lot of Nandinos – and a lot of chicken .
Nando's is one of a few modern restaurant brands to have changed the face of British fast food .
In recent years the Gourmet Burger Kitchen , promoting its Aberdeen Angus beef and use of Peter Gordon , the father of fusion cuisine , as a consultant , and Wagamama , with its fresh , fast pan-Asian food , are others .
All promote just one part of that " fast " deal , in that they serve you fast , but they do n't push you out the door at the same speed .
No one is saying they 're a foodie 's paradise but they all offer healthier options than the usual take - out joints .
As Jamie Oliver pointed out recently , these days the UK is far less tolerant of rubbishy food than the US .
Even McDonald 's in the UK has busily revamped its offer – its eggs are free - range , it uses organic milk and its adverts constantly remind you that carrot sticks are on offer ( one of your five - a - day , kids ! ) .
So is that Nando 's secret ?
That it is n't your usual takeaway joint ?
Does that explain its popularity ?
Ask the PR team – which consists of just two people , one of whom is on maternity leave – and you 'll be guided to the chain 's " family feel " .
This is Nando 's professed USP .
Yes , it prides itself on its spicy chicken , but it 's the friendly atmosphere , both for workers and clientele , that keeps its fans loyal .
Customers know what they 're getting , which is : quick , smiley service , clean surfaces , big tables you can spread out over , South African art on the wall ( Nando 's commissions original works ) .
There is always lively African or Latino music playing , which helps cover your embarrassment if you have noisy kids .
Yet , each Nando's is very different architecturally , adding to that non-standardised , proper restaurant feel .
The South Bank branch has high , arched ceilings ; King 's Cross has an outdoor space ; Brixton is wide and low .
The way customers are encouraged to act is different , too .
There 's an element of responsibility , in that you have to go to the counter to order ( although the waiting staff bring your food over and everyone on your table is served at the same time ) , and you help yourself to your own cutlery , fizzy drinks and sauces .
All this moving about helps create a fluid , busy atmosphere – but you can stay as long as you like .
As for the staff , the PR assures me that Nando's is keen to offer its workers opportunities to advance themselves , many grillers and waiters moving up the ranks to managerial status .
There are away days and other social events , and the company won the Sunday Times Best Place to Work ( Big Companies ) category this year , with 75 % of the human resources budget invested in learning and development .
Staff are young ( 65 % under 25 in 2005 ) , but staff turnover is low .
All too good to be true ?
Maybe .
Though it opened in the UK way back in 1992 , Nando 's still feels like the new kid on the block .
It has taken its time to make an impression and we 're still excited by it , not bored yet .
Still it 's no stranger to bad press : the most serious being when one customer was shot by another , in this very Shepherd 's Bush branch , in 2002 .
The victim subsequently died .
In Shepherd 's Bush , at the counter , I ask the community officers about the shooting .
One shrugs .
" It 's a terrible thing , " he says , " but it 's not Nando 's fault .
It could have been anywhere .
It 's not like the guy was shot for his chicken , was he ? "
Nando 's origins lie much further afield than west London : not in Portugal , but in South Africa .
In 1987 , Robert Brozin and his friend Fernando Duarte popped into a Johannesburg restaurant called Chickenland .
The chicken was the best they 'd ever tasted , they thought , and promptly bought the joint .
They renamed it Nando's , after Fernando , a Portuguese national .
Despite its hoo - ha about happy staff and customer service , it 's Nando 's peri-peri sauce that is its basic selling point .
It 's a version of the piri-piri marinade used on chicken in Portuguese restaurants the world over , which was created by Portuguese settlers in Africa : they used local chillis ( Nando 's favours chillis from Mozambique ) , known as pili-pili in Swahili .
Now you can buy Nando's hot sauces and marinades in supermarkets for around £ 1.60 , as well as Nando 's crisps .
One happy online user described the marinades thus : " Turns ordinary , boring , everyday chicken into a Festival of Chicken , complete with chicken - skin streamers and party giblets " .
Mmm .
In Nando's in Soho , at lunchtime , I meet Matt , 39 , and Bryan , 24 .
They work in documentary photography and have been to Nando's in Africa .
What 's the difference ?
Bryan thinks that the London Nando's are " a little louder , bigger and more open .
And a little more uppity [ upmarket ] . "
But , really , says Matt , " it 's pretty much the same .
You can count on it being consistently good . "
Differences do exist .
In South Africa , Nando's is seen as more of a takeaway ; it was n't until Nando's in the UK began to emphasise its restaurants over its take - outs that the brand really took off here .
Now around 80 % of its food is eaten in .
Also , in South Africa , as in Australia , another huge Nando 's market , Nando's is marketed as a jokey brand .
It does a lot of TV advertising , and its ads are often reprimanded as being in poor taste : a 2009 campaign featuring a Spitting Image - style puppet of Julius Malema , president of the ANC youth league , was removed at the behest of Malema 's lawyers .
Actually , to my eyes , the ads are dodgy , with black Africans often represented as being stupid or naive .
In contrast , in the UK , Nando's has almost no advertising presence at all .
I ask Malcolm Pinkerton , a retail analyst at Datamonitor Group , why it has n't bothered .
" Prime locations appeal to people without having to advertise , " he says .
" Then , if you have a good product , you can rely on word of mouth and social media . "
Nando's has a strong Facebook presence : there are campaigns for Nando's to open in their particular area ( Wigan , Peterborough , Northwich , Burton - on - Trent ) and former workers have groups , too .
What 's unique about Nando's in the UK , however , is its status with the city youth .
Over the past few years , the UK charts have been transformed by British - born urban pop artists , such as Chipmunk , Tinchy Stryder , Dizzee Rascal , N - Dubz , JLS , Taio Cruz … and every one of these No 1 artists is a Nando 's lover .
They would be , even if they were n't successful .
They are typical Nando 's customers , with parents or grandparents born outside the UK who have brought up their offspring to have a spicier palate .
Social and confident , happy to hang out with mates , these kids are easy with eating out and expect to be treated well when they do .
Nando 's ticks all their boxes .
Now , its chicken is the urban youth food of choice and , as if to prove it , I have two quite intense phone conversations about Nando's , with Chipmunk and then Tulisa from N - Dubz .
Chipmunk , born in Edmonton , north London and named best hip - hop artist at last year 's Mobo awards , tells me he often eats at his local branch of Nando's in Finsbury Park .
He favours the wings , medium spicy : " It 's the closest thing you can get to jerk chicken , and if chicken is n't Caribbean or Nando's , I can't mess with it . "
He likes the atmosphere , how the staff are always smiling , and that " you can eat your chicken with your hands .
It 's not too booji [ bourgeois ] .
Even though you do get posh people in Nando's , it does n't outlaw any social class . "
While researching this piece , I 'd heard stories about a Nando's " gold card " , awarded to a very small number of extra-special customers and entitling them to free meals .
This mythical piece of plastic is so valued , so sought after that , initially , Nando's PR would not confirm its actual existence .
It turned out they 've been having problems with people faking the cards , or passing the cards between each other .
Chipmunk , though , along with Tinchy Stryder , is one of the privileged few .
" Yeah , I got one ! " he says with glee .
" It 's not gold , it 's black with gold writing , and it means I can get food for free for me and four friends .
I do n't pay ' cos I love Nando 's and I promote Nando 's and I 'm happy to do it . "
Tulisa Contostavlos , 21 , Camden Town - born actress and singer with double - platinum hip - hop influenced pop group N - Dubz , however , does not have a card .
Which seems ridiculous , given just how often she eats there .
I interview her in the middle of the N - Dubz national tour and she appears to spend most of her off - stage time in Nando's .
" When I wake up , say around 1 o'clock , the first thing I eat is Nando 's lemon and herb chicken in pitta , " she tells me .
" I do n't like cold food in the morning : I 'd rather warm up last night 's curry and have it for breakfast .
I like the texture of the chicken , it 's not too crispy , not too soggy .
Anyway , I put some peri-peri sauce in there and I might pop in a few chips .
And then , when dinner time comes , I have a quarter lemon and herb chicken with spicy rice .
And chips – normal , not spicy .
You have to get ketchup – one teaspoon per chip .
I drink Sprite with it .
Even when we 're not on tour I eat there at least once a week .
I should have my picture on the wall . "
She is very jealous of Chipmunk 's Nando 's card and , in fact , this causes some problems : after the interview , we ask if we can set up a photograph and N - Dubz 's people say : " Only if the band can get Nando 's cards . "
But Nando's PR denies such cards even exist .
I point out that Chipmunk has described his to me and Tulisa has seen it , and she then counters that there 's a waiting list .
Hmm .
No card , no photograph .
Such is the value of this particular piece of plastic .
And we are asked not to photograph Chipmunk 's card – to stop the fakes out there .
It 's interesting that so many black and mixed - race kids are into Nando's : that combination of spicy , almost jerk , chicken and the space and respect each customer is given is a winning formula for the kind of people that most restaurants choose to ignore .
When I talk to customers in Shepherd 's Bush , Soho and Brixton , the only other plus that comes up a lot is health .
The chicken in Nando's is deemed by its fans to be better for you than anything from your standard fast food restaurant .
But is it ?
It 's not battery - farmed , but it 's not free - range either .
The suppliers that Nando 's use – Faccenda and Sun Valley for everyday chicken , halal from Freemans of Newent and Highbury Poultry – comply with the voluntary , industry - led assured chicken protection standards .
Nando's also gets some extra chicken breasts from suppliers that meet similar standards in Holland and Germany .
Essentially , the chickens are reared in well - littered and ventilated houses and have constant access to water and food that is n't spiked with growth promoters .
Nando's say that their chicken is in constant review and they are actively looking at alternative methods of production , including RSPCA Freedom Foods .
The problem is price : the amount of chicken Nando 's needs and the price it charges ( £ 9.10 for half a chicken with two regular sides ) means that , for the moment , organic just is n't an option .
I think of Nando's with more affection than I do of , say , Starbucks : if I 'm in an unfamiliar city with my son and I see Nando's , I 'm pleased – we can both eat food we like , relatively cheaply and definitely cheerfully .
But if I have a choice between Nando's and my local Portuguese restaurant , there 's no contest : Brazas will always win out .
Nando's is a nice experience , but it's a standardised one , and my tolerance for same - same is lower than Tulisa's .
What of the future ?
Capricorn Ventures , which owns Nando's in the UK , is promising to expand even further , declaring that Britain can support up to 400 branches .
Two Nando's have opened in Washington DC , to great excitement .
Robert Pattinson is rumoured to be beefing himself up for his next Twilight film by eating Nando's .
It 's a chicken - fuelled world out there , people .
In Nando's in Brixton , Robert and Jameela are having an early evening meal .
Robert is a regular .
" I like my chicken twice a week .
Always medium , with peri-peri chips and coleslaw on the side . "
Jameela : " I do n't come as much as Robert , but I look forward to it when I do .
I love Nando's !
Why ?
No special reason .
Just that the chicken tastes so good . "

When pressing Congress to ratchet up the legal screws on infringers , copyright holders are fond of touting apocalyptic reports about how piracy is destroying their industries — and the US economy .
But strengthening the nation 's intellectual property laws is n't just a matter of cracking down ever harder , of limiting the limitations and giving increasing power to rightsholders .
Fair use and other limitations on copyright themselves generate significant economic activity — $ 4.7 trillion in 2007 .
The Computer and Communications Industry Association ( CCIA ) , which counts Google and Microsoft among its members , today rolled out a report ( PDF ) on the value of fair use , one that tries to answer the question : " What contribution is made to our economy by industries that depend on the limitations to copyright protection when engaged in commerce ? "
The method is similar to that used in several prominent piracy studies ; in this case , the " fair use " industries are divided into " core " and " non-core " companies , depending on how important fair use is to their very existence .
Economic activity and payroll numbers can then be crunched from this data , offering a rebuttal to any view of fair use that sees it as a mere afterthought in copyright law , one good for protecting YouTube parodies but not much more .
The CCIA report 's numbers are staggering .
The " fair use economy " accounted for 23 percent of all US real economic growth between 2002 and 2007 .
Fair use industries ( core and non-core combined ) generated $ 4.7 trillion in 2007 .
And " about one out of every eight workers in the United States is employed in an industry that benefits from the protection afforded by fair use . "
Doing these kinds of analyses is notoriously imprecise , in some cases amounting to little more than guesswork .
Still , the basic idea presented in the study serves as a useful corrective to simplistic views on " strengthening " IP law ( " Strengthening IP law for whom ? " is the question worth asking ) , and we agree with CCIA boss Ed Black , who noted in the report :
" We must be careful that any attempt to alter our intellectual property laws not overlook any crucial sectors of the economy ...
We must therefore safeguard the fair use economy from the unintended consequences of overbroad copyright regulation in order to ensure that technology innovators can maximize their contribution to our nation ’s economic health . "
Last summer Manchester City shook the transfer market with 6 signings that cost the club around £ 100 m .
After finishing the season off in 5th place after losing the crucial battle with Tottenham at the end of the season it ’s wealthy investors , The Abu Dhabi Group , are looking to strengthen the squad and hand Mancini a blank check book .
With Mancini ’s experience as a manager he should be able to lure more quality players to the club and with the financial backing of the Arab investors we can see numerous players entering and leaving the club .
As an early announcement for their intentions this summer the club has already announced that they will spend £ 1.5 m this summer on upgrades to the stadium .
This includes seat warmers , TV ’s for big spending fans to replay any moment of the game and bet on games all from their seats .
Scarves similar to that worn by Mancini on match games will also become a part of the match - day package .
The stadium upgrades also include a new pitch which will should enhance overall performance of the match .
All these upgrades to the stadium is an early signal as to what ’s to come from the deep pockets of Manchester City this summer .
The number of rumors that have been floating around about the potential signings for Manchester City are endless .
We can probably name every single player in Europe and it still would n’t match the list of potential signings for Manchester City .
Here are a few names that are circulating the rumor mill .
Rafael van der Vaart , Gonzalo Higuain , Fernando Gago , David Silva , Gregory van der Wiel , Edin Dzeko .
Mikel Arteta , Ronaldinho , and of course James Milner , who the club has already offered £ 20 m but have been denied .
This long list of players is quite unusual even for clubs like Chelsea and Real Madrid .
With all the speculation as to who will make the first arrival to the Eastlands there is one player that will certainly be heading towards the exit door this summer , Robinho .
The on loan striker finished his season off back home at Brazil with his old club Santos .
The Brazilian playmaker is unsettled at the Eastlands and has made himself clear in the fact that he would like to leave the club permanently and stay in Brazil after a good year at Santos .
It would make little sense for the Citizens to keep the flashy Brazilian as the club has bigger plans this summer .

There are any number of geek guys running around out there without the love and companionship that many people and all golden retrievers deserve .
Sometimes these guys sit down and try to figure out why they 're living a life devoid of love , romance , sex and discussions about whose hair it is in the shower drain .
They undertake a deep self - assessment , questioning all their long - cherished beliefs about themselves , and this is what they conclude :
They 're too nice .
And that 's hilarious !
Guys , you 're not " too nice . "
That 's like saying you can't get seated at an L.A. restaurant because you 're too famous .
I know lots of nice guys , fellows who are much nicer than me , and nearly all of them have what ' 70s - era singer - songwriters call " special ladies . "
Seriously , even guys that in college struck me as the sort that would have trouble sweet - talking a hand towel and a bottle of lotion into bed are married with offspring that are , presumably , theirs .
I also know tremendous jerks with girlfriends , but that just proves there 's someone for everyone .
I mean , let 's concede right here that there are people of all available genders who are messed up in the brainpan and because of this are only into people who treat them poorly .
These folks are , thankfully , in the minority .
They 're also not the sort of people you want to be dating .
Self - loathing people are actually kind of a pain to be around .
Which brings us back to you !
Given that nice guys get bedded and / or wedded all the time , you must have a more specific problem than that .
Here are some specific behaviors I have witnessed in guys who think they 're " too nice " when actually they 're " unpleasant . "
Is this you ?
For some reason , you think " nice " means " completely devoid of sexual energy . "
When you 're attracted to someone , you treat her like you 're her brother .
Her brother the priest .
Her brother the elderly Victorian priest who is actually a large stuffed animal .
Then when some guy comes along and does a little thoughtful flirting and actually gets her attention , you think " Man , that guy 's a jerkface . "
When you say you 're trying to figure out " what women want , " you actually mean you 're trying to figure out what this one specific woman you 're friends with and have had a crush on for three years wants .
( That one 's easy , by the way .
The answer is " not you . "
Now move on . )
You do n't know many women .
Having been passed on by the six or seven ladyfolks you see on a regular basis , you are now ready to assume that all women are deeply broken individuals who do n't know what 's good for them .
Somehow you think that treating all women as freely interchangable mentally damaged goods is compatible with being " nice . "
You 're one of those guys who wishes he lived in the Arthurian era – which is to say an era that never actually existed – and who actually uses the word prithee .
You practice some sort of demented Hollywood version of chivalry .
When women are creeped out by this , you assume they do n't like nice guys , rather than assuming more accurately that they have no desire to get involved with your little love - LARP .
You 're not actually nice .
Ask yourself this question :
All these nice , thoughtful things you do for women you have crushes on , do you do them for your friends whose panties you do n't want to chew off ?
Do you remember everyone 's favorite pizza topping ?
Listen to them bitch about work ?
Tell them when you see something neat on ThinkGeek that you think they 'd like ?
Getting extra attention from someone who 's generally nice is flattering .
Sitting under the laserlike niceness focus of someone who 's usually oblivious is actually pretty unnerving .
Finally , the most common affliction : searing , blinding desperation .
There 's a big , inviting grassy area between being a schmuck and being an Alpha Jerk , and it 's called " self - confidence . "
It 's nice for picnics !
Seriously , if there 's any one thing that 's universally attractive to men , women and intersexed individuals of any and all types , it 's confidence .
People like people who like being the people they are .

Bomb squad officers also discovered a two - by - two - by - four - foot metal box — described as a “ gun locker ” — in the S.U.V. that was taken to the Police Department ’s firing range at Rodman ’s Neck in the Bronx to be destroyed , Mr. Kelly said .
It was not immediately known what , if anything , was inside it .
Officials said they had no reports of anyone seen running from the vehicle .
Mr. Kelly said police were scouring the area for any additional videotapes but noted that the S.U.V.’s windows were tinted , which could further hamper any efforts to identify those inside .
Some of the surveillance cameras nearby were located in closed businesses , and the mayor made clear it would take time to review all available tapes .

Still , the junkyard was considered a primary target of the initial investigation .

The White House said President Obama had been briefed on the episode and had pledged federal assistance in the investigation .
The human body does many things well , but swimming is n't one of them .
We 're embarrassingly inefficient in the water , able to convert just 3 or 4 percent of our energy into forward motion .
( Even with swim fins , we 're only 10 to 15 percent more efficient . )
But a new , dolphin - inspired fin promises to fuel the biggest change in human - powered swimming in decades , putting beyond - Olympian speeds within reach of just about anyone .
Culminating decades of research , engineer and inventor Ted Ciamillo , an inventor and engineer in Athens , Ga. , who made his name ( and fortune ) building high - performance bicycle brakes , created what he has dubbed the Lunocet , a 2.5 - pound ( 1.1 - kilogram ) monofin made of carbon fiber and fiberglass that attaches to an aluminum foot plate at a precise 30 - degree angle .
With almost three times the surface area of conventional swim fins , the semiflexible Lunocet provides plenty of propulsion .
The key to the 42 - inch - ( one - meter - ) wide fin 's speed : its shape and angle , both of which are modeled with scientific precision on a dolphin 's tail .
These sprinters of the sea can swim up to 33 miles ( 53 kilometers ) per hour and turn up to 80 percent of their energy into thrust .
" The mechanism functions like a wing to generate a lift force , " which is directed forward and turned into thrust , says Frank Fish , a marine biologist at West Chester University of Pennsylvania .
" This propulsive mechanism is extremely efficient compared to conventional rigid marine propellers . "
Fish , a specialist in the swimming morphology of marine mammals , provided Ciamillo with data from CAT scans of dolphins ' tails that he used to design his fins , which went on the market last year for $ 1,800 each .
Lunocet users have already hit about eight miles ( 13 kilometers ) per hour , nearly twice as fast as Olympic Gold Medal swimmer Michael Phelps at his speediest .
Using the Lunocet , some swimmers are close to being able to breach completely out of the water , like whales .
Ciamillo envisions a new high - speed , free - diving community of swimmers united around " hydrotouring " : long - distance swimming expeditions using Lunocets to cover dozens of miles a day , with participants carrying streamlined , waterproof packs containing only a global positioning system ( GPS ) , satellite phone , and enough food and water for a few nights on shore .
The fin could also have a " profound effect " on the sport of free diving ( where divers compete to see who can go the deepest while holding their breath ) , says Grant Graves , president of the U.S. Apnea Association , the country 's leading competitive free diving organization .
Its efficiency could let those who dive by holding their breath set depth records by going deeper more quickly .
Still , speed is n't everything underwater .
" The faster you go , the harder you have to work , " since drag increases as the square of velocity , he says .
" There 's a sweet spot between friction , speed , oxygen consumption and distance . "
Another attempt to balance that equation is taking shape in the labs of inventor and entrepreneur Dean Kamen 's company , DEKA Research and Development Corp. in Manchester , N.H .
The creators of the Segway two - wheel , one - person electric vehicle are working with the Defense Sciences Office of the U.S. military 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the research arm of the U.S. Defense Department , to develop the PowerSwim , a high - efficiency , human - powered propulsion system for combat and reconnaissance swimmers .
A fiberglass spar ( pole ) clamped between the calves holds two oscillating foils of carbon fiber , a wide one at the hips and a narrower one at the feet .
A shallow squatting motion makes the foils undulate , creating vortices that push forward against the trailing edge and provide thrust .
This design uses the largest leg muscles instead of just the calves and ankles , says DARPA Defense Sciences PowerSwim Program Manager Lt. Col.
John Lowell .
Top speed is about 2.5 miles ( four kilometers ) per hour , which still works with scuba gear , but more important , the PowerSwim is 70 to 75 percent efficient at translating effort into propulsion .
" We 're getting to the point where its getting harder to imagine getting much better than that , " Lowell says .
DARPA hopes to have working prototypes ready for military divers to test by the end of the year .
Ciamillo is also planning a demo the Lunocet for the Marine Corps 's amphibious unit , and is continually refining the fin 's pitch control mechanism , which dictates the angle between fin and feet , in an attempt to improve efficiency and speed .
He notes that he wo n't be patenting the Lunocet 's design .
" If you 're taking ideas from nature , " he says , " how can you then go to the patent office and say these are mine ? "

Friday Q&A 2010 - 04 - 16 : Implementing Fast Enumeration
Last week I discussed the various options available in Objective - C for enumerating over a collection
This week I 'm going to finish up the discussion of enumeration with a guide on how to implement Fast Enumeration in your own program .
Basics
There are two benefits to implementing Fast Enumeration .
One is that you can then use your object as the target in a for / in loop .
The other is that , with a good implementation , such enumeration will be fast .
Implementing Fast Enumeration is accomplished by implementing the NSFastEnumeration protocol .
This protocol contains only a single method :
- ( NSUInteger ) countByEnumeratingWithState :( NSFastEnumerationState * ) state objects :( id * ) stackbuf count :( NSUInteger ) len ;
NSFastEnumerationState
typedef struct { unsigned long state ; id * itemsPtr ; unsigned long * mutations
Ptr ; unsigned long extra [ 5 ] ; } NSFastEnumerationState ;
Easy enough , right ?
But what 's thatthing ?
This starts to get a little bit complex ....
Deciphering Fields and Parameters
To understand how to implement this method , you need to understand what all of the fields and parameters mean , as well as the return value .
I 'll take these out of order .
The objective of this method is to return a series of arrays of objects .
Each call returns one array , which allows objects to be returned in bulk .
For speed , this uses a C array , which means that it needs a pointer and a length .
The length is provided by the return value of the method .
That 's what the count refers to in the name of the method .
The array is actually the itemsPtr field of the NSFastEnumerationState struct .
These two values together define the array returned by the method .
NSFastEnumeration is designed to allow returning a pointer to internal storage .
However , not all data structures fit well with that , so it 's also designed to allow copying objects into an array provided by the caller .
That caller - provided array is stackbuf , and its size is given by len .
NSFastEnumeration is also designed to detect when a collection is mutated while being enumerated , and throw an exception if this occurs .
mutations
Ptr is indended to be pointed to a value which changes if the collection is mutated .
That 's just about everything .
The only fields I have n't covered yet are the state and extra fields of NSFastEnumerationState .
These are just freeform fields which the callee can use to store whatever values it finds useful .
Generated Loop Code
Now we know what all these things are for , but to really understand how this stuff works , it 's best to understand what kind of code the compiler generates .
You write this :
for ( id obj in collection ) { // body }
What really goes on behind the scenes ?
The compiler creates an NSFastEnumerationState on the stack , as well as a stack buffer .
It creates two nested loops , one which repeatedly calls countByEnumeratingWithState :... and one which loops over the array it returns .
It ends up being something like this :
// declare all the local state needed NSFastEnumerationState state = { 0 } ; id stackbuf [ 16 ] ; BOOL firstLoop = YES ; long mutations PtrValue ; // outer loop NSUInteger count ; while ( ( count = [ collection countByEnumeratingWithState : & state objects : stackbuf count : 16 ] ) ) { // check for mutation , but only after the first loop // ( note that I 'm not sure whether the real compiler puts this // in the inner loop or outer loop , and it could conceivably // change from one compiler version to the next ) if ( ! firstLoop && mutations PtrValue != * state .
mutationsPtr ) @throw .. mutation exception ... firstLoop = NO ; mutations PtrValue = * state .
mutationsPtr ; // inner loop over the array returned by the NSFastEnumeration call id obj ; for ( NSUInteger index = 0 ; index < count ; index ++ ) { obj = state .
itemsPtr [ index ] ; // body } }
state
extra
Notice how this code never touches or examines theandfields .
As I mentioned before , these are provided purely for the use of the collection , and to facilitate that , their value is preserved between calls while within the same loop .
Returning One Object At a Time
A major point of NSFastEnumeration is to achieve speed through bulk enumeration .
Returning one object at a time defeats that point .
However , it 's easy to implement , and still gets you the benefit of being able to use for / in syntax .
In the spirit of avoiding premature optimization , if returning one object at a time is easy , then go for it .
As an example , imagine you have a linked list class :
@implementation LinkedList : NSObject { struct Node * listHead ; }
NSFastEnumeration
- ( NSUInteger ) countByEnumeratingWithState :( NSFastEnumerationState * ) state objects :( id * ) stackbuf count :( NSUInteger ) len { // plan of action : extra [ 0 ] will contain pointer to node // that contains next object to iterate // because extra[ 0 ] is a long , this involves ugly casting if ( state -> state == 0 ) { // state 0 means it 's the first call , so get things set up // we wo n't try to detect mutations , so make mutations
Ptr // point somewhere that 's guaranteed not to change state -> mutations
Ptr = ( unsigned long * ) self ; // set up extra [ 0 ] to point to the head to start in the right place state -> extra [ 0 ] = ( long ) listHead ; // and update state to indicate that enumeration has started state -> state = 1 ; } // pull the node out of extra [ 0 ] struct Node * currentNode = ( struct Node * ) state -> extra [ 0 ] ; // if it 's NULL then we 're done enumerating , return 0 to end if ( ! currentNode ) return NULL // otherwise , point itemsPtr at the node 's value state -> items
Ptr = & currentNode -> value // update extra[ 0 ] if ( currentNode ) state -> extra [ 0 ] = ( long ) currentNode -> next ; // we 're returning exactly one item return 1 ; }
Now let 's implementfor this class , in the simplest possible way , by returning one object at a time :
This is really not bad at all .
It gets a little ugly with the pointer / integer casting , but that 's C for you ....
Returning Copied Objects in Bulk
Let 's say that it turns out the above method really is too slow and you want to make it faster .
You can do this by returning objects in bulk .
Because the objects in the linked list are n't stored contiguously , you have to do this by copying objects into the stackbuf .
While no guarantee is given as to the size of stackbuf , we can assume that it 's made large enough to justify this sort of thing .
Here 's how the code would look :
- ( NSUInteger ) countByEnumeratingWithState :( NSFastEnumerationState * ) state objects :( id * ) stackbuf count :( NSUInteger ) len { // plan of action : pretty much the same as before , // with extra [ 0 ] pointing to the next node to use // we just iterate over multiple nodes at once if ( state -> state == 0 ) { state -> mutations
Ptr = ( unsigned long * ) self ; state -> extra [ 0 ] = ( long ) listHead ; state -> state = 1 ; } // pull the node out of extra [ 0 ] struct Node * currentNode = ( struct Node * ) state -> extra [ 0 ] ; // keep track of how many objects we iterated over so we can return // that value NSUInteger objCount = 0 ; // we 'll be putting objects in stackbuf , so point itemsPtr to it state -> items
Ptr = stackbuf ; // loop through until either we fill up stackbuf or run out of nodes while ( currentNode && objCount < len ) { // fill current stackbuf location and move to the next * stackbuf ++ = currentNode -> value // move to next node currentNode = currentNode -> next ; // and keep our count objCount ++ ; } // update extra[ 0 ] if ( currentNode ) state -> extra [ 0 ] = ( long ) currentNode -> next ; return objCount ; }
for
in
This is not too much harder , and will significantly reduce the number of message sends that occur in theloop .
Returning a Bulk Interior Pointer
For best efficiency , you can return a pointer to contiguously stored objects .
For example , say you have a simple array class like this :
@interface Array : NSObject { id * pointer ; NSUInteger count ; }
NSFastEnumeration
- ( NSUInteger ) countByEnumeratingWithState :( NSFastEnumerationState * ) state objects :( id * ) stackbuf count :( NSUInteger ) len { if ( state -> state == 0 ) { state -> mutations
Ptr = ( unsigned long * ) self ; state -> itemsPtr = pointer ; state -> state = 1 ; return count ; } else return 0 ; }
for
Implementingfor this class is really easy .
It can return a single interior pointer to all of the objects , and that 's it That was easy !
It 'll also be really fast , because the enumeration loop will basically devolve into a straight Cloop .
This technique can also be used , with some care , for more complex data structures .
If you have a series of contiguous object pointers , you can return pointers to each one in turn , which will result in efficient enumeration over all of the objects in sequence .
You can make good use of the extra values to keep track of where you are in your internal data structure .
A Note on Temporary Objects
You may find it useful to store Objective - C objects in the extra values :
state -> extra [ 1 ] = ( long ) [ NSArray arrayWith ... ] ;
NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [ NSAutoreleasePool new ] ; for ( id obj in collection ) { // do stuff with obj [ pool release ] ; pool = [ NSAutoreleasePool new ] ; } [ pool release ] ;
break
But beware !
This will break with this completely legal enumeration code :
When the autorelease pool goes away , it 'll take your array with it , and the next time you try to access it , you 'll explode .
And you can't retain the array , either , because there 's no guarantee the caller will loop all the way to the end to let you release it ; they mightout of the loop early , and then you 've leaked the object .
There 's really no general way to solve this .
( I 've concocted a completely insane scheme which involves tracking the position of the stack pointer to know when it 's safe to destroy temporary objects , but it's , well , completely insane . )
If you can , try to avoid storing temporary Objective - C objects in extra like this .
And if you must do it , just keep in mind that you have to be careful with autorelease pools in the for / in loops that you use with this object .
Since you 're likely to be the only client of your NSFastEnumeration implementation , this is a reasonable constraint to make , but it 's something that you have to be aware of .
Conclusion
Implementing NSFastEnumeration allows you to use nice , simple syntax for enumerating over your custom objects which are conceptually collections of other objects .
As a bonus , it will usually speed up that enumeration as well .
And while NSFastEnumeration can look daunting at first glance , it 's actually pretty easy to write an implementation of it , depending on just how hard - core you want to get and how complex your internal data structures are .

How to Delete A Repository in GitHub
GitHub is a development platform that is used by developers to store projects .
It is founded on Git , and is used mainly for code development but helps to manage the software development cycle while providing access to a variety of features , such as bug tracking , task management , and wikis .
A repository is where all of your projects ’ files are stored , including any revisions you have made .
Within the repository , you can manage the work and discuss the project in detail with any or all collaborators .
Each repository can be owned by one person or can be shared with others .
If you are the owner of a specific repository you can choose to give other collaborators access , or if the repository is owned by an organization , you may choose to give members within the organization access permission which will allow them to also collaborate on the work within the repository .
They can be private or public .
There is no limit to the number of public repositories a person or an organization can own , nor is there a limit to the number of collaborators that may have access .
If , however , you are choosing to use GitHub Free , while you can have unlimited access to private repositories you will have a limit on the number of collaborators , three .
To add more , you will need to upgrade to GitHub Pro , Team , or Enterprise Cloud .
So , what happens when you have a repository within GitHub that you no longer need or want ?
You will want to delete it , along with all of its stored files from your GitHub account .
Although it does require a few steps , they are relatively easy and as follows .
First , you will need to log into your GitHub account , this will require your login name and password .
Depending on how many repositories you have , it will affect the ease of you deleting the repository you want .
For example , the landing page will contain a box that displays your repositories .
If you know the name , as you have a limited number , you could just do a quick search and delete it that way .
But , let ’s assume that you have a lot of repositories in GitHub and take you another way .
On the landing page , you will also notice your avatar , this may be an actual picture , possibly of your organization or it could be a generic avatar .
By clicking on this page , it will bring up a dropdown menu where you will select your profile page .
Once you are within your profile you will then click on the tab within the offered menu that is labeled Repositories .
After you click on this you will have a couple of options , the first is to scroll all the repositories listed , but this could be tedious depending on the number you have .
The other choice is to enter the name in the search bar and select the one that you want .
Keep in mind that there are different types of repositories , or you may have some with similar names , so you may also need to select the type from the offered list .
The options include All , Public , Private , Sources , Forks , Archived , and Mirrors .
When you have located the name of the repository you wish to delete you can click on it and you will then be taken to the page for that specific repository .
Below the name of the repository , you will see a settings button .
At the bottom of the page , you will need to enter the Danger Zone ( cue the theme song to the movie Top Gun ) .
Within this zone , there are a variety of options , from transferring ownership , archiving , and what you ultimately want , Delete This Repository .
Of course , there is a safety precaution the moment you select this choice ; it will ask you if you are sure , to which , if you are , you must type in the name of the repository name to double ensure that this is your ultimate desire .
Once you have typed in the name you will then click on the button that says , I Understand the Consequences , Delete This Repository .
Once complete , you will be taken back to the home page with a confirming message that the repository you have selected has indeed , been deleted .
That ’s it , you ’re golden .

Or by your Family Members ?

The news last week was that Megan Fox is off the third Transformers movie .
Her side told The Wrap that she walked away because director Michael Bay was " verbally abusive " and had just had enough of his crap .
Advertisement
She 's also talked about how he made her tan so much for the film that 's she 's nervous about getting skin cancer .
Bay is known to be an ass to his female actors , and the article goes on to say that another of the female actors in Transformers 2 Isabel Lucas would n't do publicity for the film because of Bay .
( This being Hollywood both camps have differing responses to her departure . )
But he gets away with this shit over and over because no one has the power - or the guts - to hold this man accountable .
He could never get away acting like this in an office environment .
It 's also probably true that the if the executives who hire Bay and tolerate his behavior acted like he did , they would be in court up on charges .
Advertisement
So why does being a director make you exempt these laws ?
The studio side said that Fox 's option was n't picked up , but the rest of the cast will be returning and in franchise films it 's pretty common to not bring back familiar cast members .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Bay is already said to be auditioning several models to replace Fox in the role as Shia LaBeouf 's girlfriend .
And speaking of LaBeouf , he spoke out last week at the Cannes Film Festival when promoting the Wall Street sequel and talked about how disappointed he was with the last Indiana Jones film .
He took some of the blame himself saying : " I feel like I dropped the ball on the legacy that people loved and cherished . "
When asked whether he was going to get in trouble for speaking out here was his response :
I 'll probably get a call .
But he [ Steven Spielberg ] needs to hear this .
I love him .
I love Steven .
I have a relationship with Steven that supersedes our business work .
And believe me , I talk to him often enough to know that I 'm not out of line .
And I would never disrespect the man .
I think he 's a genius , and he 's given me my whole life .
He 's done so much great work that there 's no need for him to feel vulnerable about one film .
But when you drop the ball you drop the ball .
Advertisement
So the question is will LaBeouf suffer any fallout for speaking out ?
Who knows ?
He 's already on board for Transformers 3 and he is one of the most sought after young actors .
But he was not speaking out about how he was treated .
It 's different when a woman stands up against sexism vs when a man stand up about the film content .
It just is .
Megan
Fox will have a reputation for being difficult ( about something people already know about ) because she spoke up , and Shia LaBeouf will have a reputation as an honest kid for what he said .
Advertisement
No matter what you think of Megan Fox , she will most probably suffer for this and Michael Bay will still get away with treating women like shit .

Dear Straight Dope :
As a honey buff , I would like to know if bees poop in the honey they make .
Ruth
SDSTAFF
Doug replies :
A perfectly reasonable question , though I doubt many people worry about it .
Short answer : nope .
Longer answer :
When your home is in an enclosed space , like a European honeybee nest is , sanitation and hygiene are crucial .
The combs are where the bees store the honey they make and eat , and also where the colony ’s eggs are laid .
If bees deposited their waste anywhere on or near the combs , they ’d risk contaminating their food supply and infecting their developing offspring .
Unsurprisingly , they do n’t take that risk .
Instead they defecate outside the nest ( assuming they ’re mature enough to fly ) , or they do it on some hive surface that ’s well away from the combs .
Such surfaces are often covered in propolis ( plant resin , which can contain antimicrobial chemicals ) and in small mites that make their living feeding on the hive ’s residue , including fecal material and mold .
If you eliminate these mites from a bee colony , the nest often succumbs to mold overgrowth and the bees have to abandon ship .
This makes it a difficult trick for beekeepers to combat harmful mites that carry bee diseases : it ’s hard to kill just the bad mites and leave the good mites alone .
That ’s one reason managed beehives are so high - maintenance — the beekeeper has to compensate for deviations from the functioning of a natural colony .
It really would n’t matter too much if bees did poop in the honey , though — at least not to us .
Why ?
Most organisms carry microbes ( including parasites and diseases ) in their systems which are specific to their own selves , so consuming feces produced by members of one ’s own species is generally unwise .
But eating the feces of some other , very distantly related animal is not nearly so risky ; Pathogens rarely cross large taxonomic boundaries .
There is nothing in bee poop that a human takes a risk consuming , and vice versa .
Bees do in fact sometimes gather human feces for use as a building material , with no ill effects .
All bees eat is honey and pollen , and ( for our purposes ) that ’s all their poop contains .
It ’s probably the least noxious poop in existence and quite safe to consume , at least when it ’s fresh .

Could this be the world ’s most excruciatingly ironic conference ?
The Second International Symposium on Peer Reviewing ( ISPR 2010 ) is soliciting papers .
Their call for papers emphasizes the sorry state of peer - review , calling for “ more research and reflections [ that ] are urgently needed on research quality assurance and , specifically , on Peer Review . ”
What could be more reasonable than a conference to improve the quality of peer review and the standards of research dissemination ?
The conference itself is part of the 14th World Multi-Conference on Systemics , Cybernetics and Informatics : WMSCI 2010 , and organized by the same institution , the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics ( IIIS ) .
Here ’s the irony : IIIS and the WMSCI conferences are notorious for their lax standards for paper acceptance , as a cursory web search testifies .
For example , Justin Zobel has described his experience in submitting three papers to the 2002 WMSCI conference , all three completely unsuitable for publication in any venue whatsoever .
( One , for instance , consisted of alternating sentences from two other papers on different topics .
Zobel ’s excerpts of the papers form very entertaining reading . )
All three were accepted for publication with no reviews or comments provided , even after repeated prompting .
The WMSCI 2005 conference even accepted a computer - generated paper without review .
More suspicious signs :
The conference charges a registration fee per accepted paper , not per participant .
And presentation of the paper , even attendance at the conference , seems to be optional ( but you still have to pay the registration fee ) .
WMSCI ’s hounding of researchers for papers is also legendary .
It led to David Mazières , a computer science professor at Stanford , submitting a paper to WMSCI 2005 entitled “ Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List “ , complete with topic - appropriate charts and graphs .
Clearly , the organizers of the WMSCI conference and its many satellite conferences are not too concerned with optimizing peer review and solving problems with “ research quality assurance ” .
Yet these are the very organizers of the 2010 International Symposium on Peer Reviewing .
The cynicism undergirding this “ symposium ” is truly jaw - dropping .
With Tobey Maguire out of the picture , Sony has been left to find a new star for their Spider - Man reboot .
The reboot is being directed by Marc Webb and is going to be in 3 - D. Today sources are saying Webb and Sony have almost found their new Spider - Man , and the choice has come down to two actors .
The first is Jamie Bell , who you ’d probably know from Billy Elliot and Jumper , while the second is Josh Hutcherson who you would know if you saw Journey To The Center Of The Earth , the terrible Brendan Fraser flick .
There are still a few other candidates being considered , including Andrew Garfield ( Boy A ) , Frank Dillane ( Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince ) and Alden Ehrenreich ( Tetro ) .
However , Hutcherson and Bell are the front runners in the competition , and with the studio planning a July 2012 release , you can be sure we ’ll be hearing about the decision soon .
Who would you like to see play Spider - Man ?
As always let us know in the comments .
People are up in arms about Facebook ’s new privacy policies , partly because some information was forced into public view and partly because there are so many settings that figuring out what ’s public and what ’s private is confusing .
Guilbert Gates of the New York Times clears things up with the above graphic .
To put it simply : there ’s a lot of stuff .
Additionally , is a look at the growth of Facebook ’s privacy policy by number of words :
To be fair though , the privacy policy has grown with the amount of data feeding into Facebook , as opposed to a growing policy with a fixed amount of data .

Is That Really An Investment ?
The word “ investment ” gets tossed around a lot .
Just about anything can be called an investment these days .
The definition of an investment is the purchase of something with the expectation of favorable future returns .
We tend to think about financial returns when we talk about investments .
But , even if there is n’t a reasonable expectation of a financial return , we often still describe a purchase as an “ investment . ”
Here are three things that may not actually be investments — even though we talk about them as such :
1. Primary Residence
By the time you pay the costs associated with interest , utilities , maintenance , repairs , property taxes , insurance and other related expenses , it is rare to see someone break even on a home , even if it has appreciated in value .
Unless you keep your home for decades , and unless the market grew a great deal over those decades , chances are that you will lose money on a primary residence , even after your tax deductions .
Homes are expensive .
You put a lot of time and money into them , and rarely do you get everything back when it comes time to sell .
Yes , you may walk away with a large chunk of cash due to the equity you have in the home , but it does n’t mean you have a net gain .
2. Home Improvements
This goes with # 1 .
You almost never recoup the cost of a home improvement project when it comes time to sell .
The increase in the value of your home rarely equals what you paid .
If you are lucky , you might recoup about 80 % of the cost .
If you financed the project , your return will be even less , since you will be paying interest charges ( although you might get a tax deduction to offset that ) .
You might talk about a big home improvement project as an “ investment ” , but you probably wo n’t get a financial return that justifies that as a description .
3. Car
This one is a little more obvious , but many people still refer to a car as an investment , in spite of the fact that it depreciates in value each year .
If it is a brand new car , it depreciates rather dramatically once you drive it off the dealer ’s lot .
Plus , you have all the costs associated with interest on the loan , license , registration , upkeep , repairs and gas .
And , unlike the costs associated with a home , the expenses associated with your car are rarely tax deductible .
The main exception is the purchase of a junky vintage car that you can fix up and then sell for more than you paid in order to realize a net gain .
Losing Investments
Of course , there is another way of looking at the above as investments .
The argument is that , as when you buy stocks , homes and cars are investments that carry the risk of losing value .
Many point out that a stock or a commodity is still an investment , even though you might end up with negative returns .
From that standpoint , then , perhaps a home ( or even a car ) is a financial investment — one that is likely to result in a financial loss .
Emotional Investment
Many people take issue with the idea that a home is not an investment .
This is because there are more investments than the merely financial .
We can make emotional investments that offer an emotional return rather than a financial return .
I accept that my home is really more of a large purchase than an investment I will see a financial gain from .
But I enjoy my home ( and can make changes to it in order to increase that enjoyment ) .
The return on the emotional investment , in terms of memories , sentiment and providing a stable and secure environment for my son , is quite high .
The same can be said of a car .
While , in financial terms , you lose out when you purchase a car , it can enhance the quality of life , helping you get to work or go on family vacations .
The emotional value of having a car , and the way it can help you enjoy life more , might make it worth spending that extra money .
In the end , it ’s about priorities , and what you are willing to pay for .
Whether you view a home , improvements to that home , and a car as an investment or not , it is important to look at the real costs associated with making these purchases , and determine whether or not they are worth the sacrifice , and whether there are enough positive emotional gains to outweigh your financial losses .

In a small , wood - panelled courtroom in the back streets of Belle Chase on the banks of the Mississippi , a trial of sorts is taking place .
Chief witness for the prosecution is a large rotund man with a breeze - reddened face who is addressing the legal benches and the packed public area with growing passion .
" Where is the plan ? " he says , speaking into a microphone .
" We have been waiting and waiting for a plan , and still there is n't one .
There is no plan . "
In the dock the absentee defendants are BP , the US coastguard and the federal government , who all stand accused in the court of local public opinion of failing to protect Louisiana 's rich coastline from the oil disaster unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico .
Billy Nungesser , the elected parish chief for this stretch of the Mississippi , has come to address the full council , assembled for convenience 's sake in this unused courtroom .
" We are going to throw everything and the kitchen sink at this , and we do n't care if we do n't have permission .
Come Saturday , we are going to go out there and begin the clean - up , with or without BP . "
The public bursts into applause .
This being a council meeting and not a proper trial there is no judge to call the room to order .
If it had been a criminal setting , and not a civil assembly of council officials , you might call it vigilantism .
It began last Sunday in a spontaneous expression of frustration at the apparent lack of action to protect Louisiana 's wetlands , one of America 's largest and richest ecosystems , from the menacing swirl of oil gathering off the coast from the stricken Deep Horizon well .
As the first big flows of oil began to reach land last weekend , local people were astonished to find 30 private shrimp boats sitting idle at Grand Isle , a pristine stretch of beach that was now directly threatened .
BP had commissioned the boats for use in fighting the slick , but had left them doing nothing .
Nungesser , backed by the governor of the state of Louisiana , Bobby Jindal , went it alone .
They " commandeered " the boats and mobilised fishermen , sending them out to lay a boom in front of Grand Isle to hold back the oil .
Such was the success of that action – both in terms of ameliorating the oil impact and in boosting the morale of those involved – that Nungesser then wanted to roll it out across the marshlands .
" We can't wait anymore for BP to give us permission , we 're going ahead anyway , " he told the courtroom .
Outlining his alternative plan , he said that on Saturday two teams of about 50 people would be sent out to barrier islands off the coast to begin dredging up small berms ( barriers ) to keep the oil from getting into the marshes .
Where oil had already encroached into the sensitive grasses of the wetlands , special equipment would be used to drive it out then collect it .
A helicopter supplied by the sheriff 's office would act as their eyes overhead and they would be advised by Philippe Cousteau , grandson of the underwater explorer Jacques .
It was into this cauldron of brewing anger that Barack Obama jumped on yesterday , touring Louisiana for the second time since the crisis had begun on 20 April with the explosion of the Deep Horizon rig .
With every day that passes , comparisons between the oil spill and George Bush 's disastrous handling of the Katrina hurricane in 2005 become more prevalent , and with them the political perils for the Obama administration .
As it happens , one of the US president 's supporters over his handling of the crisis is Nungesser .
The two met the last time Obama visited the region , and Nungesser was impressed by his willingness to listen to ideas about what to do .
When a coastguard official expressed doubt about the efficacy of Nungesser 's suggestions , Obama turned to that official and said : " You got a better plan ? "
According to the US coastguard , more than 100 miles of shoreline in Louisiana has now been affected by the oil , only a quarter of which will easily be cleaned .
More than a million feet of protective booms have been laid around the most endangered islands and bayous , an emergency response that the coastguard claims has been " historic " , " epic " and largely successful .
But the contrast between the rhetoric and what they see has baffled residents .
If the response has been so successful , why was oil coming ashore this week with no attempt to stop it ?
Why have booms been laid in stretches that appear to be ad - hoc and patchy ?
Why , when you approach the authorities for permission to protect a marshland , is there so much red tape and no clear accountability between BP , the coast guard and the federal government ?
Above all , they ask , why , with the disaster declared bigger than Exxon Valdez , the worst in US history , does there seem to be such a lack of urgency ?
" It 's sad to see the oil just sitting there , " said Darren Crowe , a Louisiana state senator , after Nungesser finished speaking .
" It 's like your house is burning down when you have a fire engine sitting there right over the road . "
We take a boat out to look at some of the affected areas , speeding along bayous through a bed of grasses that extends to the horizon .
As the waterways open into the bay we come to Cat island where thousands of pelicans are nesting .
The island has been encircled with orange booms that are meant to contain the oil , but the equipment seems in need of maintenance as in parts it has been deposited on shore .
The island was awash with oil two days ago , collected between the rings of the boom .
The neighbouring island , Queen Bess , has oil in patches on the grasses , rendering them dark brown and greasy , .
A group of pelicans and their young are perched three metres away .
For now the oil has gone again , swept back out to sea by changing winds .
But everybody expects that , in days , weeks , months , maybe even years , it will be back again , and they want to know what is going to be done to stop it next time .

The device could help treatment as patients head to hospital
Technology aimed at reducing deaths on rural roads is being investigated by scientists .
A University of Aberdeen team is developing a device to provide medical advice and support for the first person to arrive at the scene of a crash .
It would monitor and record the casualty 's condition before the arrival of emergency services .
The hand - held device could be used by a doctor , nurse , paramedic , or eventually a trained community first responder .
The plan is for the first person on the scene to gather and analyse information from a sensor placed on the casualty 's body to measure their vital signs .
' Critical role '
This would be to help build a picture of the condition , to pass on to the ambulance crew , and to hospital staff , in a bid to ensure all crucial information is known .
Prof David Godden , from the University of Aberdeen 's Centre for Rural Health , is one of the scientists leading the project .
He said : " Statistics confirm that road traffic accidents are a major health issue in rural areas and this is combined with the additional challenges faced by emergency services working in remote areas , in terms of how long it can take to get to the scene of an accident .
" Actions taken in the time immediately after an accident has occurred play a critical role in the casualty 's survival .
" We are investigating the creation of a device which would provide crucial support for the first person to arrive on the scene . "
He added : " The technology could also have the potential to be transferred for use in situations in the home - for example heart attacks or asthma attacks . "
Latisse is the same formula as Lumigan , Allergan ’s eyedrops for glaucoma , which reduces eye pressure but also happens to grow lashes .
Both are also known as bimatoprost ophthalmic solution .
In early 2009 , Allergan introduced the drug as a lash enhancer .
According to Ms. Katt , Allergan sold $ 73.7 million worth of Latisse last year , expects to sell $ 140 million of it this year and estimates that net sales could ultimately exceed $ 500 million a year .
Some doctors said it was common knowledge that Latisse was easily available without a prescription .
“ They say in the patient packet insert that it is doctor - prescribed , and that ’s not true , ” said Dr. Seth L. Matarasso , a dermatologist in San Francisco .
“ Patients in my area say they found it in their health club .
It is dispensed by a variety of people .
Controls are not that strict . ”
Dr. Matarasso injects his fair share of Botox but said his sales of Latisse were “ not astronomical , ” largely because it is so easy to obtain .
He does not sell Latisse online and does require an in - person consultation .
The risks for consumers vary .
The Latisse they buy online could be adulterated or fake .
But even when the Latisse is the bona fide Allergan product , bypassing a doctor means a patient is not necessarily taught proper application or made aware of the potential problems .
Image Latisse is promoted by Brooke Shields .
“ When the F.D.A. approved this product for marketing , they made a determination that the side effects or misuse or inappropriate use could cause harm , and that ’s why they restricted it to a prescription drug , ” said Carmen A. Catizone , the executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy , which represents state agencies that regulate pharmacies and pharmacists .
“ If it was completely safe to use without doctor supervision , they would have deemed it over - the - counter . ”
Excluding ophthalmologists , most doctors do not do eye exams before dispensing Latisse , but they do explain how to apply it .
Latisse must be dabbed on the upper lash line only , since it can grow unintended hair — on the cheek , for example .
People are not supposed to place it on the lower lash line or eyebrows ( though some do ) , and they are meant to use the one - use applicators that come with Latisse to avoid infection and to give the right dose .
Call it a tragic irony .
BP , now under federal scrutiny because of its role in the deadly Gulf of Mexico explosion and oil spill , is one of three finalists for a federal award honoring offshore oil companies for " outstanding safety and pollution prevention . "
The winner of the award - chosen before the April 20 oil rig incident - was to be announced this coming Monday at a luncheon in Houston .
But the U.S. Department of Interior this week postponed the awards ceremony , saying it needs to devote its resources to the ongoing situation resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and fire .
Eleven workers are presumed dead and an estimated 5,000 barrels of oil are leaking every day from the well .
The cause of the explosion is still unknown .
A spokeswoman for the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service said she did not know which of the three finalists for the non-monetary award had been selected , nor did she say whether the current circumstances could influence the decision if BP was the winner .
Winners of the award are kept secret until the ceremony , she said .
The floating Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded and eventually sank 130 miles southeast of New Orleans is owned by Transocean Ltd. , a Swiss company , but was under contract with BP .
The U.S. Coast Guard has termed BP the " responsible party . "
In U.S. Coast Guard parlance , " responsible party " typically means the entity that owns the vessel that caused the spill and is responsible for responding to an incident .
It does not imply criminal negligence .
According to a Department of Interior 's website , BP Exploration & Production Inc. is one of three finalists for a Safety Award for Excellence , which honors companies for " outstanding safety and pollution prevention performance by the offshore oil and gas industry . "
The other nominees are ExxonMobil Corp. and Eni US Operating Co. BP specifically was nominated in the High OCS Activity Operator category , for companies engaged in operations on the outer continental shelf .
The Minerals Management Service was to name the winner of the award at the 2010 Offshore Technology Conference in Houston next week .
The annual award is an engraved plaque and a letter of citation , both signed by a Department of Interior official .
The awards program is intended to elevate awareness of safety and pollution and prevention , encourage voluntary compliance , educate the public and encourage excellence in safety and pollution prevention , the department says .
The program began in 1999 , and is for a company 's performance the previous year .
British Petroleum has won the award once before , in 1992 .
May all beings have happiness
and the causes of happiness !
May all beings be free from suffering
and the causes of suffering !
May all beings never be separated
from the supreme joy that is beyond all sorrow !
May all beings abide in equanimity ,
free from attachment and aversion !
Going through the Buddhadharma teachings I ’ve collected over the years , I came across a “ golden oldie ” from Buddhanet that I had archived in 2002 .
Reading it eight years later , I was struck by how helpful the teaching is and how skillful .
I offer it here , at Metta Refuge , as further aid to your metta , loving - kindness , practice .
May the hearts of all beings be filled with happiness and peace !
Loving - kindness Meditation
Loving - kindness meditation can be brought in to support the practice of awareness to keep the mind open and sweet .
It provides a good balance which compliments insight meditation .
Loving - kindness was the taught by the Buddha to develop selfless or altruistic love .
Hatred cannot coexist with loving - kindness .
It dissipates if we supplant it with thoughts based on loving - kindness .
It is a fact of life that many people are troubled by negative mind states yet do little about developing skills to deal with it .
Yet even when the mind goes sour it is within most people ’s capacity to arouse feelings of loving - kindness to sweeten it .
Loving - kindness , as a meditation practice , specifically retrains the mind to overcome all forms of negativity .
It brings about positive attitudinal changes by systematically developing the quality of ‘ loving - acceptance ’ .
In this way , it acts as a form of self - psychotherapy , a way of healing the troubled mind to free it from its pain and confusion .
Loving - kindness is practised as the first of a series of meditations that produce four qualities of love : Friendliness ( metta ) , Compassion ( karuna ) , Appreciative Joy ( mudita ) and Equanimity ( upekkha ) .
The quality of ‘ friendliness ’ is expressed as warmth that reaches out and embraces others .
When loving - kindness matures it naturally overflows into compassion , because it empathizes with people ’s difficulties ; one needs to be wary of its the near enemy , pity , which merely mimics the quality of concern without empathy .
The positive expression of empathy is an appreciation of other people ’s good qualities or good fortune rather than feelings of jealousy towards them , which is the enemy of appreciative joy .
This series of meditations comes to maturity in the state of on - looking equanimity .
This equanimity has to be cultivated within the context of this series of meditations or else it tends to manifest as its near enemy , indifference or aloofness .
It remains caring and on - looking with an equal spread of feeling and acceptance toward all people , relationships and situations without discrimination .
Systematic Loving - kindness Practice
To receive its full benefits , loving - kindness meditation needs to be developed systematically to the level of meditative absorption or one - pointedness .
The aim of the practice is to develop the five absorption factors of concentration : the first two are causal factors — applied thought and sustained thought , followed by three effects — rapture , ease - of - mind and one - pointedness or unification of mind .
The five absorption factors counteract the five mental hindrances or obstacles for the meditator : applied thought , by arousing energy and effort , overcomes the hindrance of sloth and torpor ; sustained thought , by steadying the mind , overcomes skeptical doubt which has the characteristic of wavering ; rapture , with its uplifting effervescence , prevails over feelings of ill - will ; ease - of - mind , by relieving accumulated stress , counteracts restlessness or agitation of mind ; while one - pointedness holds the mind ’s wanderings in the sense - fields to inhibit sensuality .
Achieving deep concentration with this positive mind set will tend to imprint the new positive conditioning while overriding the old negative patterns .
In this way , old negative habits are changed , freeing one to form new positive ways of relating .
How to do loving - kindness meditation
The practice begins with developing loving acceptance of yourself .
If resistance is experienced then it indicates feelings of unworthiness are present .
No matter , this means there is work to be done , and the practice itself is designed to overcome any feelings of self - doubt or negativity .
Then you are ready to develop loving - kindness to others .
Four types of people are chosen to send your loving - kindness to :
A respected , beloved person — such as a spiritual teacher ;
A dearly beloved — which could be a close family member or friend ;
A neutral person — somebody you know but have no special feeling towards , eg. a person who serves you over a counter ;
A hostile person — someone you are currently having difficulty with .
Starting with yourself , then moving systematically from person to person in the above order will break down the barriers between the four types people and yourself .
It will break down the divisions within your own mind , the source of much of the conflict we experience .
Just a word of caution , it is best to choose a member of the same sex or if you have a sexual bias to your own sex then a person of the opposite sex .
This avoids the risk of arousing the near enemy of loving - kindness , lust .
Try different people to practise on as some people do not easily fit into the above categories , but do keep to the prescribed order .
Ways of arousing feelings of loving - kindness
Visualization — Bring up a mental picture .
See yourself or the person the feeling is directed at smiling back at you or just being joyous .
By reflection — Reflect on the positive qualities of a person and the acts of kindness they have done .
And to yourself , make an affirmation , a positive statement about yourself , using your own words .
Auditory —
This is the simplest way but probably the most effective .
Repeat an internalized mantra or a word or phrase such as ‘ loving - kindness ’ .
The visualizations , reflections and the repetition of loving - kindness are devices to help you arouse a positive feeling of loving - kindness .
You can use all of them or one that works best for you .
When the positive feeling arises switch from the devices to the feeling , as it is the feeling that is the primary focus .
Keep the mind fixed on the feeling , if it strays bring it back to the device or if the feeling weakens or is lost then return to the device , i.e. use the visualization to bring back or strengthen the feeling .
The second stage is Directional Pervasion where you systematically project the aroused feeling of loving - kindness to all points of the compass : north , south , east and west , up and down , and all around .
This directional pervasion can be enhanced by bringing to mind friends and communities in the cities , towns and countries around the world .
Non-specific Pervasion tends to spontaneously happen as the practice matures .
It is not discriminating .
It has no specific object and involves just naturally radiating feelings of universal love .
When it arises the practice has come to maturity in that it has changed preferential love , which is an attached love , to an all - embracing , unconditional love !
Loving - kindness is a heart meditation and should not be seen as just a formal sitting practice removed from everyday life .
So take your good vibes outside into the streets , at home , at work , into your relationships .
Applying the practice to daily life is a matter of purposefully directing a friendly attitude and having openness toward everybody you relate to without discrimination .
May All Beings Everywhere Be Safe and Secure !

" Israel is at the top , " she states .
" It has tentacles reaching out worldwide .
( It has ) a pyramid system at work that 's awesome .... they have brokers everywhere , bank accounts everywhere ; they 've got recruiters , they 've got translators , they 've got travel agents who set up the visas . " -- Nancy Scheper -Hughes .
UC Berkeley Professor of Medical Anthropology On January 15 , Haaretz reported that : " The Israel Defense Forces ' aid mission to Haiti left Israel overnight ( January 14 ) with equipment for setting up an emergency field hospital .
Around 220 soldiers and officers ( were ) in the delegation , including 120 medical staff ( to ) operate the hospital in the Haitian capital , Port - au - Prince . "
According to Israel 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , it includes " 40 doctors , 25 nurses , paramedics , a pharmacy , a children 's ward , a radiology department , an intensive care unit , an internal department and a maternity ward ( able to ) treat approximately 500 patients each day , " including in two surgery rooms .
On January 20 , Lebanon 's Al - Manar TV reported on the mission , citing a damning You Tube video posted by an American named T. West from a group called AfriSynergy Productions .
" The video presents something to think about while exploiting the horrible tragedy that has befallen Haiti where Israeli occupation soldiers are engaged in organ trafficking . "
Israel faced these charges before .
In November 2009 , Alison Weir 's article in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs headlined , " Israeli Organ Trafficking and Theft : From Moldova to Palestine . "
She cited an August Donald Bostrom article in Sweden 's Aftonbladet suggesting that Israel illicitly removes body parts , including from Palestinians .
She stated : " .... Israeli organ harvesting - sometimes with Israeli governmental funding and the participation of high Israeli officials , prominent Israeli physicians , and Israeli ministries - have been documented for many years .
Among the victims have been Palestinians . "
Nancy Scheper - Hughes is a UC Berkeley Professor of Medical Anthropology , founder of Organ Watch , author of scholarly books and articles on the subject , and " unflinchingly honest in ( citing ) the Israeli connection . "
" Israel is at the top , " she states .
" It has tentacles reaching out worldwide .
( It has ) a pyramid system at work that 's awesome .... they have brokers everywhere , bank accounts everywhere ; they 've got recruiters , they 've got translators , they 've got travel agents who set up the visas . "
They pay " the poor and the hungry to slowly dismantle their bodies " or simply take what they want from fresh corpses .
Body parts are commodities , to be harvested and sold to the rich , even though organ sales are prohibited in most countries , but not in international law .
Relevant International Law The UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime calls organ extraction for profit human exploitation .
In 2008 , Israel banned the practice , but it persists .
On October 13 , 2009 at a UN press conference on the subject , Marja Ruotanen , Director of Cooperation of the Council of Europe , stated : " We have legislation and definitions covering the trafficking in human beings for the purpose of organ removal , but the study points out that there is a legal vacuum for the traffic in organs , tissues and cells ( OTC ) . "
Human trafficking for any purpose is a crime .
Global instruments cover OTC trafficking , but missing are " internationally agreed - upon definitions within an international convention . "
One is needed that clearly defines the practice , protects donors , but prosecutes brokers , medical staff , and others engaging in it .
Chair of the Department of Medical Ethics of the University of Pennsylvania , Arthur Caplan , and Austria 's Public Prosecutor , Carmen Prior , say many nations are taking steps to address the issue , emphasizing that OTC material should only be gotten by " voluntary altruism . "
In other words , donated , not sold for profit .
Caplan explained that " money for parts " violates " basic human dignity and medical ethics . "
It also exploits the poor , and they stay poor after the sale .
Also , their organ quality is usually low , and procedures used to extract them often harm buyers and sellers .
UN Secretary - General Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women , Rachael Mayanja , did n't predict when the world body will begin work on a convention , but she hoped it would be soon .
Discussions to this point are " just the beginning , " she said , " and it gives us an impetus to go forward . "
Kawther Salam - " The Body Snatchers of Israel " Salam is a West Bank - based Palestinian journalist , active in reporting on human rights abuses by the Israeli military ( IDF ) .
In 2003 , she was one of 28 writers in 13 countries to receive a Hellman / Hammett Grant from Human Rights Watch " in recognition of ( her ) courage in the face of political persecution . "
On August 24 , 2009 , her above titled article presented what she " witnessed , saw , observed and heard during ( her ) 22 years of journalistic work under the Israeli military occupation in the West Bank and Gaza . "
She states that from the early 1970s , the IDF kept bodies of Palestinians they killed , then later buried them in secret , numbered graves .
In other cases , Israel 's civil administration and military commanders returned corpses to families on condition they be buried immediately , late at night , for " security reasons . "
They followed funeral processions in " armored grey cars , " monitoring them through burial .
Why so , asked Salam ?
" If the burial is normal , and the organs of the victims were not stolen , then why should they be buried in the dark of the night ?
The families of the victims all knew that they were receiving empty bodies , filled with cotton , to be buried in the middle of the night . "
Salam said she " personally ....witness (ed )
Israeli soldiers and military vehicles kidnapping the bodies of dead Palestinians from ( hospital ) emergency rooms .
In other cases , ( she ) saw the soldiers following the Palestinians to the cemetery , to steal the body from the family before burial .
This practice became so widespread that many people started carrying the bodies of the murdered to be buried at home , in the garden , under the house or under trees , instead of waiting for the ambulance to take them to the hospital . "
She said " everybody in Palestine " knows that Israel steals bodies for their organs .
It was common IDF practice to " kidnap " Palestinians from emergency rooms in Hebron , Nablus , Ramallah , Jenin , and most everywhere throughout Occupied Palestine , then transfer them to an Israeli hospital .
Her article lists names of IDF commanders and civil administration officials involved in the practice .
" Everybody knew " they were doing it , yet their families were told sincere efforts were made " to release the bodies of their relatives from the military headquarters , " calling it a favor , when , in fact , their organs were stolen .
Perhaps " thousands of bodies and even people known to have been alive were transferred to the Abu Kabir " Forensic Institute near Tel Aviv , Israel 's only autopsy facility involved in organ trafficking , a matter that became a scandal inside the country .
Its director , Dr. Yehuda Hiss , admitted doing it , never was held accountable , and until recently remained the institute 's chief pathologist .
In 2002 and 2005 , he was investigated over the large scale theft of body parts , the practice Yediot Aharonot journalists broke , saying he had " price listings " for organs sold to universities and medical schools .
On January 4 , 2002 , Israel National News.com headlined , " Abu Kabir Operating Organ Warehouse , " saying Hiss was : " accused of a long list of charges from inappropriate behavior as a medical professional to criminal acts such as the illegal sale of and dealings in organs and body parts , removing organs from deceased persons without consent , and misrepresenting organs in returned bodies . "
Other allegations were that : " in some cases ( organs he took without consent were stuffed with ) toilet paper rolls and metallic rods in their place to fill the voids and hide the theft of the organs .
A court - ordered search of the institute revealed large supplies of stored organs illegally taken from bodies , " thousands taken without permission .
During the first Intifada and other times , Salam said she " personally witnessed how the Israeli military were kidnapping Palestinian bodies and gravely injured people from the emergency room of Princess Alia hospital in Hebron ( and dead bodies from ) Al - Ahli hospital . "
The area was declared a military zone , the hospitals surrounded and invaded , and no one was allowed to move inside them .
Israeli organ harvesting is a longstanding practice , well known by " most if not all the Israeli medical establishment ( who ) keep silent because they either get money , or they are rewarded in other ways .... "
Jerusalem Center for Democracy and Human Rights Director , Salim Khalleh , said JDCHR documented 270 cases of " reserved " Palestinian bodies , buried in numbered graves in secret cemeteries , or in numbered compartments of cooling facilities .
According to the Palestinian National Authority ( PA ) Director of the Department of Statistics , Abed Al - Naser Ferwana , many Palestinians were murdered in detention during the second Intifada , their bodies kept in secret Israeli cemeteries , some released weeks later .
He calls this more proof that their organs were harvested illegally .
Israeli " Transplant Tourism " Rich Israelis take advantage , availing themselves of what 's called " transplant tourism , " traveling wherever a needed organ can be found , sometimes from fresh corpses , usually from the desperately poor .
The Israeli government acts as facilitator , providing subsidies of up to $ 80,000 for " transplant holidays . "
According to Scheper - Hughes , Israeli officials exhibit " amazing tolerance .... toward outlawed ' transplant tourism . ' "
She said the Israeli Ministry of Defense is involved in a practice by which " bodies are broken , dismembered , fragmented , transported , processed , and sold in the interests of a more socially advantaged population .... , " Israel engaging in more of this globally than any other nation .
Its medical teams apparently are doing it in Haiti , exploiting fresh corpses and the living .
The Manar TV cited You Tube said " there are people operating in Haiti who do not have a conscience and are members of the search and rescue teams , including the Israeli occupation forces , " far from home harvesting Haitian organs , and the pickings are plentiful .
Apparently , the publicity about providing humanitarian aid is cover for this illicit operation , another crime against humanity among Israel 's growing list , matched and exceeded by its Washington benefactor with generations more practice .

" Israel is at the top , " she states .
" It has tentacles reaching out worldwide .
( It has ) a pyramid system at work that 's awesome .... they have brokers everywhere , bank accounts everywhere ; they 've got recruiters , they 've got translators , they 've got travel agents who set up the visas . " -- Nancy Scheper -Hughes .
UC Berkeley Professor of Medical Anthropology By Stephen Lendman 1-26-10
On January 15 , Haaretz reported that : " The Israel Defense Forces ' aid mission to Haiti left Israel overnight ( January 14 ) with equipment for setting up an emergency field hospital .
Around 220 soldiers and officers ( were ) in the delegation , including 120 medical staff ( to ) operate the hospital in the Haitian capital , Port - au - Prince . "
According to Israel 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , it includes " 40 doctors , 25 nurses , paramedics , a pharmacy , a children 's ward , a radiology department , an intensive care unit , an internal department and a maternity ward ( able to ) treat approximately 500 patients each day , " including in two surgery rooms .
On January 20 , Lebanon 's Al - Manar TV reported on the mission , citing a damning You Tube video posted by an American named T. West from a group called AfriSynergy Productions .
" The video presents something to think about while exploiting the horrible tragedy that has befallen Haiti where Israeli occupation soldiers are engaged in organ trafficking . "
Israel faced these charges before .
In November 2009 , Alison Weir 's article in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs headlined , " Israeli Organ Trafficking and Theft : From Moldova to Palestine . "
She cited an August Donald Bostrom article in Sweden 's Aftonbladet suggesting that Israel illicitly removes body parts , including from Palestinians .
She stated : " .... Israeli organ harvesting - sometimes with Israeli governmental funding and the participation of high Israeli officials , prominent Israeli physicians , and Israeli ministries - have been documented for many years .
Among the victims have been Palestinians . "
Nancy Scheper - Hughes is a UC Berkeley Professor of Medical Anthropology , founder of Organ Watch , author of scholarly books and articles on the subject , and " unflinchingly honest in ( citing ) the Israeli connection . "
" Israel is at the top , " she states .
" It has tentacles reaching out worldwide .
( It has ) a pyramid system at work that 's awesome .... they have brokers everywhere , bank accounts everywhere ; they 've got recruiters , they 've got translators , they 've got travel agents who set up the visas . "
They pay " the poor and the hungry to slowly dismantle their bodies " or simply take what they want from fresh corpses .
Body parts are commodities , to be harvested and sold to the rich , even though organ sales are prohibited in most countries , but not in international law .
Relevant International Law The UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime calls organ extraction for profit human exploitation .
In 2008 , Israel banned the practice , but it persists .
On October 13 , 2009 at a UN press conference on the subject , Marja Ruotanen , Director of Cooperation of the Council of Europe , stated : " We have legislation and definitions covering the trafficking in human beings for the purpose of organ removal , but the study points out that there is a legal vacuum for the traffic in organs , tissues and cells ( OTC ) . "
Human trafficking for any purpose is a crime .
Global instruments cover OTC trafficking , but missing are " internationally agreed - upon definitions within an international convention . "
One is needed that clearly defines the practice , protects donors , but prosecutes brokers , medical staff , and others engaging in it .
Chair of the Department of Medical Ethics of the University of Pennsylvania , Arthur Caplan , and Austria 's Public Prosecutor , Carmen Prior , say many nations are taking steps to address the issue , emphasizing that OTC material should only be gotten by " voluntary altruism . "
In other words , donated , not sold for profit .
Caplan explained that " money for parts " violates " basic human dignity and medical ethics . "
It also exploits the poor , and they stay poor after the sale .
Also , their organ quality is usually low , and procedures used to extract them often harm buyers and sellers .
UN Secretary - General Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women , Rachael Mayanja , did n't predict when the world body will begin work on a convention , but she hoped it would be soon .
Discussions to this point are " just the beginning , " she said , " and it gives us an impetus to go forward . "
Kawther Salam - " The Body Snatchers of Israel " Salam is a West Bank - based Palestinian journalist , active in reporting on human rights abuses by the Israeli military ( IDF ) .
In 2003 , she was one of 28 writers in 13 countries to receive a Hellman / Hammett Grant from Human Rights Watch " in recognition of ( her ) courage in the face of political persecution . "
On August 24 , 2009 , her above titled article presented what she " witnessed , saw , observed and heard during ( her ) 22 years of journalistic work under the Israeli military occupation in the West Bank and Gaza . "
She states that from the early 1970s , the IDF kept bodies of Palestinians they killed , then later buried them in secret , numbered graves .
In other cases , Israel 's civil administration and military commanders returned corpses to families on condition they be buried immediately , late at night , for " security reasons . "
They followed funeral processions in " armored grey cars , " monitoring them through burial .
Why so , asked Salam ?
" If the burial is normal , and the organs of the victims were not stolen , then why should they be buried in the dark of the night ?
The families of the victims all knew that they were receiving empty bodies , filled with cotton , to be buried in the middle of the night . "
Salam said she " personally ....witness (ed )
Israeli soldiers and military vehicles kidnapping the bodies of dead Palestinians from ( hospital ) emergency rooms .
In other cases , ( she ) saw the soldiers following the Palestinians to the cemetery , to steal the body from the family before burial .
This practice became so widespread that many people started carrying the bodies of the murdered to be buried at home , in the garden , under the house or under trees , instead of waiting for the ambulance to take them to the hospital . "
She said " everybody in Palestine " knows that Israel steals bodies for their organs .
It was common IDF practice to " kidnap " Palestinians from emergency rooms in Hebron , Nablus , Ramallah , Jenin , and most everywhere throughout Occupied Palestine , then transfer them to an Israeli hospital .
Her article lists names of IDF commanders and civil administration officials involved in the practice .
" Everybody knew " they were doing it , yet their families were told sincere efforts were made " to release the bodies of their relatives from the military headquarters , " calling it a favor , when , in fact , their organs were stolen .
Perhaps " thousands of bodies and even people known to have been alive were transferred to the Abu Kabir " Forensic Institute near Tel Aviv , Israel 's only autopsy facility involved in organ trafficking , a matter that became a scandal inside the country .
Its director , Dr. Yehuda Hiss , admitted doing it , never was held accountable , and until recently remained the institute 's chief pathologist .
In 2002 and 2005 , he was investigated over the large scale theft of body parts , the practice Yediot Aharonot journalists broke , saying he had " price listings " for organs sold to universities and medical schools .
On January 4 , 2002 , Israel National News.com headlined , " Abu Kabir Operating Organ Warehouse , " saying Hiss was : " accused of a long list of charges from inappropriate behavior as a medical professional to criminal acts such as the illegal sale of and dealings in organs and body parts , removing organs from deceased persons without consent , and misrepresenting organs in returned bodies . "
Other allegations were that : " in some cases ( organs he took without consent were stuffed with ) toilet paper rolls and metallic rods in their place to fill the voids and hide the theft of the organs .
A court - ordered search of the institute revealed large supplies of stored organs illegally taken from bodies , " thousands taken without permission .
During the first Intifada and other times , Salam said she " personally witnessed how the Israeli military were kidnapping Palestinian bodies and gravely injured people from the emergency room of Princess Alia hospital in Hebron ( and dead bodies from ) Al - Ahli hospital . "
The area was declared a military zone , the hospitals surrounded and invaded , and no one was allowed to move inside them .
Israeli organ harvesting is a longstanding practice , well known by " most if not all the Israeli medical establishment ( who ) keep silent because they either get money , or they are rewarded in other ways .... "
Jerusalem Center for Democracy and Human Rights Director , Salim Khalleh , said JDCHR documented 270 cases of " reserved " Palestinian bodies , buried in numbered graves in secret cemeteries , or in numbered compartments of cooling facilities .
According to the Palestinian National Authority ( PA ) Director of the Department of Statistics , Abed Al - Naser Ferwana , many Palestinians were murdered in detention during the second Intifada , their bodies kept in secret Israeli cemeteries , some released weeks later .
He calls this more proof that their organs were harvested illegally .
Israeli " Transplant Tourism " Rich Israelis take advantage , availing themselves of what 's called " transplant tourism , " traveling wherever a needed organ can be found , sometimes from fresh corpses , usually from the desperately poor .
The Israeli government acts as facilitator , providing subsidies of up to $ 80,000 for " transplant holidays . "
According to Scheper - Hughes , Israeli officials exhibit " amazing tolerance .... toward outlawed ' transplant tourism . ' "
She said the Israeli Ministry of Defense is involved in a practice by which " bodies are broken , dismembered , fragmented , transported , processed , and sold in the interests of a more socially advantaged population .... , " Israel engaging in more of this globally than any other nation .
Its medical teams apparently are doing it in Haiti , exploiting fresh corpses and the living .
The Manar TV cited You Tube said " there are people operating in Haiti who do not have a conscience and are members of the search and rescue teams , including the Israeli occupation forces , " far from home harvesting Haitian organs , and the pickings are plentiful .
Apparently , the publicity about providing humanitarian aid is cover for this illicit operation , another crime against humanity among Israel 's growing list , matched and exceeded by its Washington benefactor with generations more practice .

Youropenbook ( formerly Facebooksearch ) allows interested parties to search for status updates containing potentially embarrassing information such as " playing hooky " , " stupid boss " or " control urges " simply by clicking on a link .
The site also offers customised searches of freely viewable status updates .
Search results return the name and profile picture of those making potentially embarrassing comments .
The site neatly illustrates the privacy perils of making status updates and wall posts viewable in much the same way PleaseRobMe previously illustrated how location updates through services such as FourSquare might potentially help out burglars .
Youropenbook automates a type of security shortcoming first noticed by a commentard on Slashdot .
The Facebook Graph site allows users to search for posts containing the word sex , or any other search term the curious might choose to select .
A spokeswoman for Facebook explained : " This is the search feature of the Graph API , documented here ( http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api#search.) "
The same search is possible directly on Facebook .
" Only posts ( status updates , notes ) which are Everyone and Page names are available unless you authenticate with an app ( e.g. the Tweet Deck app is a desktop client you can use to search over your own status updates ) , " she added .
Facebook has become synonymous over recent months with attempts to erode privacy settings so that users ' information is shared by default .
As illustrated here there are 150 + privacy options on Facebook making the process of locking down a profile the 21st century equivalent of programming a VCR .
With all the privacy furore around Facebook , including EU complaints over a recent privacy rollback and more recent moves to share user information automatically with " pre-approved " websites , it 's little wonder that some users have decided the simplest option is to quit the site .

Obesity Capsule From Gelesis , Made to Swell Up in the Stomach , Passes First Human Trial
Xconomy Boston —
There must be a million ideas to help the many millions of obese Americans lose weight .
Today , doctors will get a glimpse at a first - of - its - kind treatment from Boston - based Gelesis , where scientists have created a capsule that expands in the stomach to make people feel full and eat less .
Gelesis has said little about this idea since the company was founded with seed financing from Puretech Ventures , plus another $ 16 million from OrbiMed Advisors , Queensland BioCapital Funds , Puretech , and others in January 2008 .
Now Gelesis has results from a clinical trial of 95 people who were randomly assigned to take the company ’s superabsorbent hydrogel capsules ( Attiva ) or a placebo .
The capsules helped people feel full after meals and less hungry in between , researchers said .
And , importantly , the treatment was well - tolerated .
The findings were presented at the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists annual meeting in Boston .
Anyone following the news knows that the obesity epidemic in the U.S. has gotten so big that it poses a threat to the healthcare system , and , simultaneously , represents a monster business opportunity .
Health officials now say two - thirds of U.S. adults have become overweight or obese , which raises the risk for a whole raft of other conditions like diabetes , heart attacks , and depression to name a few .
Doctors often advise people to eat healthier and exercise more , without much luck .
A few biotech companies are racing to win FDA approval of new drugs , but Big Pharma companies have tread cautiously in this field since the fen - phen debacle of the ’90s .
Gastric bypass surgery to shrink the stomach can help people , although the procedure carries significant risks .
The idea at Gelesis is to come at this problem with a completely new method .
It ’s essentially a way to reduce stomach volume without subjecting people to the invasiveness and potential complications of surgery .
“ For the first time a group was able to overcome the enormous technical hurdles in creating a super - absorbent polymer , ” said Robert Langer , the prominent bioengineering professor at MIT , in a company statement .
Langer is n’t a founder of the company , although he advised Puretech Ventures on the technology before the firm seeded Gelesis in 2006 .
Based on today ’s results , Langer added : “ This opens the door for entirely new uses of polymers in medicine . ”
I took a closer look at this yesterday during a conference call with three key players of Gelesis .
Daphne Zohar and Eric Elenko of Puretech Ventures , and the co-inventor of the technology , Alessandro Sannino , a professor of engineering at the University of Sallento in Italy , who has been working on this idea for 15 years .
The company also has recruited a lot of prominent advisers with different layers of expertise .
James Hill , a University of Colorado professor and past president of The Obesity Society brings obesity knowledge ; Allan Geliebter , a phychologist at St. Luke ’s - Roosevelt Hospital is a pioneer of the gastric balloon ; Lee Kaplan of Massachusetts General Hospital Weight Center is a leading researcher in gastric bypass surgery .
John LaMattina , a former president of Pfizer ’s global R&D operation , has joined the Gelesis board .
You can take a look at how this technique is supposed to work by watching this animation on the Gelesis site , which lasts a little less than four minutes .
But ’s here the concept in a nutshell : Gelesis has developed a superabsorbent polymer from some unspecified food source .
This material , about the size of a grain of sugar , is designed to swell up more than 100 - fold … Next Page »
Let ’s face it , times are tough right now .
Budgets are getting cut everywhere , the economy is still in shambles , natural disasters are going down everywhere .
So with all this wild stuff going down , you need to make sure you are going to have a little bit of bud to get you through the hard times .
Prices in my area are about $ 25 for a gram of something dank .
The recession seems to have pushed the prices up a little and the quantities down a little .
So what is a broke 20 something supposed to do to make sure they can smoke every day and often ?
Conserve , conserve , conserve !
Here are some things you can do to easily start conserving your weed and save yourself a lot of coin !
How To Conserve Your Weed Easily
Smoke less weed
Ahh , okay .
You did n’t want to hear it but it ’s the truest way to save some of your weed .
Smoke less !
It does n’t mean stopping altogether .
But perhaps it ’s time to let go of that wake and bake .
It means you wo n’t have to buy an ounce at a time and can save some money by buying quarters instead !
Save your roaches
A lot of smokers instantly dump their roaches .
This is unnecessary .
You ’d be surprised how much weed you can collect from your joint stumps .
At the end of the month , you can roll them all up in a blunt and enjoy a little bit of extra weed .
If you ’re not really left with much , you can empty them out and put them in a cone piece .
It sounds stingy , but remember that times are tough !
Cut off your scavenger friends
Usually I ’m an advocate for sharing weed with friends , but in difficult times it might be okay to tell a little white lie .
Tell them that you ’re busy when they call asking to smoke some weed , or tell them that you ’ve run out of herb .
There ’s nothing wrong with keeping your stash a secret from your scavenger friends .
After all , weed is expensive and when you ’re running low , it can be downright difficult to share .
Everyone ’s got that friend who loves to scrounge around for weed in your pocket .
So let them go for a while .
Start vaporizing
Vaporizing your weed is a great way to minimize how much you consume .
It gives a powerful high without actually using so much of your stash .
Plus , for those who do n’t know , you get more THC out of a vaporized smoke .
Some of the THC actually gets destroyed in the smoking process , whereas vaporizing it means you can get all the THC out .
You get higher by smoking less weed .
Stop joints , start cones
We all know how easy it is to chew through a bag when you ’re smoking blunts and joints .
You need a lot of herb to fill up a paper or a blunt .
Plus , blunt wraps and papers cost money .
If you put your weed in a pipe or cone piece , you can conserve your weed for much longer .
Some weed even gets lost to the storytelling process .
We all have that friend who lets the joint burn down while telling stupid jokes .
Smoke some , sell some
Image Source
Now , I ’m not suggesting you turn into a big time drug dealer .
But you can save a lot of money by selling some of your weed .
When you buy in larger amounts it ’s usually cheaper .
Then you can sell grams for more to your cheap friends .
You might even end up getting your weed for free this way after you calculate all the costs and the money you can make .
You probably have some friends that like to smoke weed , too .
So sell them a gram or two here and there .
Do n’t carry all of your weed
So you ’ve been invited over to a friend ’s place or a smoking circle .
If you take the whole quarter , chances are you are going to smoke a lot of it , if not all of it .
So every time you find yourself on the way to a friend ’s place , just carry a gram bag with you .
That will ensure that you do n’t end up smoking your whole stash .
You ’ll be able to save most of your ganja for yourself without looking stingy at the smoking circle .
Corner the bowl
By lighting just one corner of the bowl , you can get way more smoke out of your cone .
You ’ll also be surprised how stoned you can get off just half of the weed you actually put in the cone .
If you ’re sharing , then one cone will be enough for two or three people .
If not , then you ’ll have some weed left in the bowl in a couple of hours when it ’s time for your next smoke .
Use a one hitter
A one hitter pipe is one that usually just fits one hit inside of it .
It ’s enough to get high without overdoing it and wasting a whole ton of weed .
A lot of the time , we smoke way more than necessary .
It ’s a “ eyes bigger than your appetite ” kind of situation – except that the appetite is never satisfied .
Take one hit and watch how high you get !
And also watch your stash decrease much slower .
Store your weed in a jar ( and do n’t grind it all )
It can be really tempting to grind your entire stash as soon as you get it so that it ’s ready to be used .
But this can deceive you into smoking way more than you should .
When you get your bag , put some of it in a jar and hide it somewhere .
It will make for good storage and give you something to smoke at the end of the month .
If you do this every time you buy a bag , you might even start to collect a whole bunch of storage .
This can then be smoked in those really difficult times !
Use a three tier grinder
Image Source
When you use a grinder that has three tiers , there is usually a compartment at the very bottom for collecting kief .
Yes , it takes a long time to collect kief this way .
But after a few months of using that grinder ( and that grinder only ) , you can be left with a few grams of very powerful kief .
This is especially true if you like to smoke top quality weed that has a lot of trichomes on it .
They all fall to that bottom compartment and create something like a reserve for when things get rough and you run out of herb .
Do n’t let your weed go bad
By storing your weed in a glass jar , you avoid the risk of it going bad .
In a plastic baggy ( especially in humid places ) it can go bad really quickly .
Glass jars are how growers cure their weed over a long time , and it can actually get stronger .
However , in a baggy , weed can start to get moldy and lose its power .
Do n’t leave your jar on the window sill , either .
Storing it in a cool , dark place will make it last much longer .
This also means that it wo n’t dry out too much .
Smoking weed that has dried out a lot can be extremely harsh on the throat .
It also burns much faster , meaning that you ’re not really conserving that much at all .
How to make your weed last longer
To make your weed last longer , you need to control its exposure to air and heat .
Do n’t forget that heating up your weed is usually the way to use it up .
So by keeping it somewhere sunny or warm , you ’re contributing to its degradation .
Do NOT put it in the refrigerator .
It will accumulate moisture in there and cause you a myriad of problems , including mold .
The same is true of the freezer .
Freezing it can damage the trichomes , which are the part of your weed that get you the most high .
Avoid storing your weed in plastic or metal .
Glass is the best material to store your weed in .
Even though I do n’t recommend airtight jars , they also should n’t let too much air in .
It requires a very delicate balance to keep everything in the jar as it should be .
If you ’re feeling really desperate and want to store your weed for a really long time , you can always convert it to tinctures or oils .
They last for an extremely long time , as long as your oil is n’t easily perishable .
On the other hand , cannabutter goes off quickly because it ’s an organic kind of substance .
Alcohol is the best way to make your weed last for a really long time .
It extracts most of the cannabinoids and gives you a good storage location for a couple of ounces that you want to store for a really long time .
You ’ll love having a tincture lying around when there ’s nothing to smoke , too !
Greetings abducted Fold !
You know what ’s funny ?
I ’ve been getting the guest posts for next week in , and … well , they ’re better than mine .
Haha .
So , next week , be prepared for COLOR and BETTER ART !
I ’m excited , and you should be too .

Canada Border Services
Agency releases documents outlining searching policy
On Monday , the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association ( BCCLA ) posted the policies that the Canada Border Services Agency ( CBSA ) uses for searching " documents , personal papers , and electronic information " on laptops and other personal effects .
BCCLA obtained the documents through an official Access to Information request that it filed on October 21 , 2009 .
In a slide - show - style presentation about " Classification of Child Pornography , " one of the documents lists ( on page 13 ) a brief bullet point : " Japanese Anime — most not porn . "
However , it adds that anime can be classified as child pornography in Canada " only if characters are explicitly depicted as children involved in sex acts e.g. lack of secondary sexual characteristics , breast development , pubic hair . "
Although these guidelines exist in the CBSA document , they are not part of the legal definition of child pornography in Canada .
Child pornography , whether involving persons real or imaginary , is illegal in Canada .
The original law 1985 , law C - 46 section 163.1 , was upheld and clarified in the 2001 R v. Sharpe case where the Supreme Court of Canada found that " [ the law ] should include visual works of the imagination as well as depictions of actual people .
... " person " in s. 163.1 includes both actual and imaginary human beings .
" Exceptions exist for cases where the work serves a " legitimate purpose related to the administration of justice or to science , medicine , education or art ; and does not pose an undue risk of harm to persons under the age of eighteen years . "
In 2005 , an Edmonton area man pleaded guilty to importing manga containing explicit depictions of minors and was handed an 18 - month conditional sentence , 100 hours of community service , and a C$ 150 fine .
Canadian Bill C - 2 , passed in November 2005 ( after the conviction ) , requires mandatory jail time for any person convicted of importing child pornography .
In 2006 , the Canadian National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre , a Canadian government initiative , created a hentai and anime " fact " sheet that did not differentiate between explicit and non-explicit forms of anime and manga .

It turns out there really is growing inequality in America .
It 's the 45 % premium in pay and benefits that government workers receive over the poor saps who create wealth in the private economy .
And the gap is growing .
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) , from 1998 to 2008 public employee compensation grew by 28.6 % , compared with 19.3 % for private workers .
In the recession year of 2009 , with almost no inflation and record budget deficits , more than half the states awarded pay raises ...
Of all the harmful actions of modern psychiatry , " the mass diagnosing and drugging of children is the most appalling with the most serious consequences for the future of individual lives and for society , " warns the world - renowned expert , Dr Peter Breggin , often referred to as the " Conscience of Psychiatry . "
Dr Nathaniel Lehrman , author of the book , " Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs , " believes that giving infants and toddlers " powerful , brain - effecting psychiatric medication is close to criminal activity . "
" Giving them these drugs , " he says , " has no rationale , and ignores the basic fact that youngsters are very sensitive to their environments , both social and chemical , with the juvenile brain easily damaged by the latter . "
nventing Disorders
During an interview on ABC Radio National in August 2007 , Dr David Healy , the noted British pharmacology expert , and author of the book , " Mania : A Short History of Bipolar Disorder , " told reporter Jane Shields : " Just to give you a feel for how crazy things have actually got recently , it would appear that clinicians in the US are happy to look at the ultrasounds of children in the womb , and based on the fact that they appear to be more overactive at times , and then possibly less active later , they 're prepared to actually consider the possibility that these children could be bipolar . "
On April 9 , 2009 , Christopher Lane , author of the book , " Shyness : How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness , " published an interview on his Psychology Today blog with Dr Healy .
In the interview , Healy explained the history behind the drastic rise in the sale of anticonvulsants and antipsychotics as " mood stabilizers , " and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder .
" The key event in the mid-1990s that led to the change in perspective was the marketing of Depakote by Abbott as a mood stabilizer , " Healy tells Lane , and further explains :
" Mood stabilization did n't exist before the mid-1990s .
It ca n't be found in any of the earlier reference books and journals .
Since then , however , we now have sections for mood stabilizers in all the books on psychotropic drugs , and over a hundred articles per year featuring mood stabilization in their titles .
" In the same way , Abbott and other companies such as Lilly marketing Zyprexa for bipolar disorder have re-engineered manic - depressive illness .
While the term bipolar disorder was there since 1980 , manic - depression was the term that was still more commonly used until the mid-1990s when it vanishes and is replaced by bipolar disorder .
Nowadays , over 500 articles per year feature bipolar disorder in their titles . "
" As of 2008 , upwards of a million children in the United States -- in many cases preschoolers -- are on " mood - stabilizers " for bipolar disorder , even though the condition remains unrecognized in the rest of the world , " Healy points out .
" But there is no evidence that the drugs stabilize moods , " he says .
" In fact , it is not even clear that it makes sense to talk about a mood center in the brain . "
" A further piece of mythology aimed at keeping people on the drugs , " he reports , " is that these are supposedly neuroprotective -- but there 's no evidence that this is the case and in fact these drugs can lead to brain damage . "
Healy says the FDA 's decision to add a black - box warning about suicide to SSRIs likely had little to do with the switch to prescribing antipsychotics as safer for children .
What " was quite striking was how quickly companies were able to use the views of the few bipolar - ologists who argued that when children become suicidal on antidepressants it's not the fault of the drug , " he points out .
" The problem , they said , stems from a mistaken diagnosis and if we could just get the diagnosis right and put the child on mood stabilizers then there would n't be a problem , " he explains .
" There is no evidence for this viewpoint , but it was interesting to see how company support could put wind in the sails of such a perspective , " he says .
Because having just one label was very limiting , Healy says , child psychiatry " needed another disorder -- and for this reason bipolar disorder was welcome . "

Tory leader David Cameron has announced plans for a new tax on banks - even if other countries decide not to do so .
Mr Cameron has dropped his condition that he would only introduce such a tax if other countries did .
In a speech in London , he said the levy was " necessary " and the banks were one of the " vested interests " he was determined to confront .
Labour favours such a tax but only with international agreement .
Lib Dems say banks must pay for taxpayer protection .
The Tories , who have not yet provided any details of how their scheme would operate , hope that by adopting a more limited measure if the UK acts alone they will avoid driving banks into exile .
Speaking in Putney , south - west London , Mr Cameron said : " We had the biggest bank bail - out in the world .
We can't just carry on as if nothing happened .
ROBERT PESTON
The Tories and the government are less far apart on the imposition of a new tax on banks than may appear at first glance
Read Robert Peston 's blog " In America , President Obama has said he will get taxpayers back every cent they put in .
Why should it be any different here ? "
He said a Conservative government would introduce a new bank levy to pay back taxpayers for the support they gave and to protect them in the future .
Mr Cameron said it " wo n't be popular in every part of the City " , but he believed such a levy was " fair " and " necessary " .
In his speech , the Tory leader said his party has " the leadership , the energy , the strength of character to stand up to vested interests and make change happen " .
According to Mr Cameron , a Tory government would be " strong , resolute , taking on those who block progress so we see change through " .
' Systemic risk ' Chancellor Alistair Darling is expected to use next week 's Budget to signal the government 's support for a global bank tax , although only as part of an international agreement .
According to the Financial Times on Saturday , Mr Darling is to give his support to plans for a global tax on investment banks and institutions that pose a " systemic risk " .
Under the plan , money raised should go into Treasury coffers and not be used for an insurance fund against future collapse , the newspaper said .
Treasury Minister Lord Myners said : " This kind of tax on bankers needs to be international .
" As the chancellor has made clear , the UK - only bank tax the Tories want is a sure fire way of encouraging a banking exit from the UK - raising costs to borrowers , damaging Britain 's competitiveness and costing tens of thousands of jobs across the country . "
He said the government was " at the forefront of international negotiations , tightening regulation and levering money out for small and medium sized enterprises " , adding : " We have a plan to get our money back and we will : by selling the banks we own at the right time and the right price . "
Liberal Democrat economics spokesman Vince Cable said : " The other parties seem to be moving on to ground the Liberal Democrats have occupied for some time : banks must pay for the protection they enjoy from the taxpayer . "
Mr Cable said his party had been " very specific about how this crucial issue should be tackled , after extensive discussion with the City and others " .
He said it was " seriously worrying that both the Conservatives and the government still do not seem to have worked out a specific proposal " .
BBC business editor Robert Peston said : " With the last Budget of this Parliament only a few days away , it was inevitable that the Tories and the government would trade blows on whether and how to levy a new tax on the banks . "
He added that it was " a big shift for Alistair Darling to say that he favours a tax on some measure of the risks being taken by banks , as opposed to introducing an insurance premium on them to meet the costs of future bail - outs " .
Treasury sources say Mr Darling favours a tax over an untouchable insurance premium because he fears that banks could feel they were insured against the consequences of their actions and take even greater risks .

New facial recognition and motion sensor technology to roll out across more models , saving energy in the process
The next time you fall asleep in front of the TV , someone , or rather something , could be watching you – and all in the name of saving energy .
Sony last year launched a new addition to its Bravia range of TVs , which features facial recognition technology similar to that found in the electronics giants ' most advanced cameras .
As a result , the TV is able to " watch " you and can turn the picture off if you nod off in front of Match of the Day , saving the energy used by the backlight .
The Bravia WE5 also features a heat and motion sensor that similarly allows the system to turn off the picture if it is left playing to an empty room , and an ambient light sensor that reduces the output from the TV's backlight depending on the brightness of the room .
A spokeswoman for the company said that the new sensor technology will now be rolled out to other models in the Bravia 2010 range , delivering significant energy savings to those viewers guilty of leaving their TV on when it is not being watched .
" If you wonder off to make as cup of tea you will still be able to hear the TV but it wo n't be wasting energy showing the picture , " she said , adding that the picture returns as soon as someone walks into the room .
According to Sony , the new micro-tubular HCFL backlight also cuts the amount of power consumed by the TV by 50 per cent compared to previous LCD TVs .
The new innovations are part of a company - wide initiative designed to cut annual energy consumption of Sony products 30 per cent against a 2008 / 09 base line by 2015 .
The company spokeswoman said that its most recent TV had already met the target and that many product lines would aim to exceed the target .
" The 30 per cent target is an average so a lot of products like TVs will look to go far further than by 2015 , " she said .
The plan to roll out the sensor technology across new products follows Sony 's recent high profile commitment to deliver a " zero environmental footprint " by 2050 , eliminating eliminating carbon emissions and the use of non-renewable materials in its products and manufacturing .
First Past The Post and the UK General Election 2010
For the first time since 1974 the UK has a hung parliament , meaning that no party has an overall majority of 326 ( or more ) seats in the House of Commons .
The Conservatives are arguing against electoral reform which includes changes to the first past the post system ( they are , however , arguing for reducing the number of seats in the House of Commons ) .
The reason that the Tories give for liking the first past the post system , where the candidate in each constituency with the most votes is returned by that constituency , is that a hung parliament is less likely .
This , they say , results in strong and stable government .
Opponents of first past the post argue that the distribution of seats in the House of Commons does not accurately reflect the will of the people , saying that one of the myriad systems of proportional representation would be fairer .
Thanks to The Guardian 's datablog site , all the numbers from yesterday 's polls are available for people to pore over and analyse , and that 's exactly what I 'm doing here .
This is work in progress at the moment ; I 'm just seeing what I can find as I sift through .
Caveat emptor : I 'm assuming The Guardian 's information is correct , needless to say I can't check it on my own .
This is what I 've come up with so far .
P.S. None of this is in the least bit copyrighted .

319,638 people voted for the various independent candidates that ran ; Sylvia Hermon was the only one to be elected in North Down , County Down with 21,181 votes .
Pie charts of the Vote and Seat shares look like this :
Unused votes
649 constituencies have reported back ( the last , Thirsk & Malton , will not go to the polls until May 27th due to the death of the UKIP candidate ) .
A total of 29,650,211 people have voted and 52.84 % of them ( 15,667,992 ) voted for a losing candidate .
Winning Candidates and their Percentages
The smallest winning percentage of votes was the Lib Dem Simon Wright in Norwich South , who won his seat with just 29.36 % of the votes cast .
The largest winning percentage was Labour 's Steve Rotheram in Liverpool Walton , with 71.96 % of the vote .
The mean winning percentage was 47.04 % , almost matching the 47.16 % who voted for a winning candidate over all constituencies .
The graph of winning candidate percentage looks as follows :
( in each column , the candidates got less than the number at the bottom but more than that of the previous column )
The same data used to create the graph2 shows that in 433 constituencies , 66.72 % of all constituencies , more people voted for a losing candidate than for the winner .
Runners - Up and their Percentages
A number of runners - up came very close to winning the seat .
The distribution of percentages is as follows ( the number of runners - up getting between 40 % and 45 % of the winner 's votes is a mystery ) :
In eleven constituencies the runner - up got 99 % or more of the votes of the winner .
The top five were :
Constituency Winner Votes Runner Up Votes Fermanagh and South Tyrone 21,304 21,300 Hampstead 17,332 17,290 Warwickshire North 18,993 18,939 Camborne and Redruth 15,969 15,903 Bolton West 18,327 18,235
Oxford
Besides a number of wonderful museums , the city of Oxford is blessed with two parliamentary constituencies , Oxford East , and Oxford West and Abingdon .
The total of votes for each party over these two constituencies is as follows
Party Votes Liberal Democrat 41,087 Conservative 33,633 Labour 27,937 UKIP 2,720 Green 2,422 APP 143 SEP 116 Parenting 73
From the table we see that the Liberal Democrats enjoyed the votes of nearly 8,000 more people than the second largest party in Oxford , the Conservatives .
Unfortunately for the Lib Dems , the votes were divided over the two constituencies in the following way
Party Oxford East Oxford West and Ab. Liberal Democrats 17357 23730 Labour 21938 5999 Conservative 9727 23906 Green 1238 1184 UKIP 1202 1518 SEP
116 0 Parenting 73 0 APP 0 143
By coming in a strong second place in Oxford East , and being second by fewer than 200 votes in Oxford West , the Liberal Democrats were rewarded with no seat in Oxford .
( Thanks to reddit user beccaebdon for pointing this out ) .
In a similar , though less marked , story to Oxford , the adjacent constituencies of Hexham and Newcastle Upon Tyne North between them saw 27,543 votes for the Lib Dems , ahead of the Conservatives with 26,761 votes and Labour with 26,203 .
Here , Hexham returned Conservative candidate Guy Opperman whilst Newcastle Upon Tyne North returned Labour candidate Catherine McKinnell .

TREVOR HAGAN / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Tomas Sohlberg , with his wife Anneen DuPlessis , is oening the Boon Burger Cafe at 79 Sherbrook St. in June .
It will be the city 's first vegetarian burger joint .
The buzz on Winnipeg 's newest burger joint first originated in B.C .
Quadra Island , to be precise , between Vancouver Island and the mainland , where Tomas Sohlberg and his wife , Anneen DuPlessis , owners of the soon - to - be- open Boon Burger Café , first ventured into the vegetarian restaurant business with a place called Khameleon a couple years back .
" That was our first go at a vegetarian restaurant , " Sohlberg , 38 , said .
" We had a full menu but people went crazy over a couple of our veggie burgers .
They were addicted to them .
" We thought , ' Man , this could really fly if we took this idea of opening a veggie burger restaurant in the city . '
That 's how the idea for Boon started . "
After looking into locations in and around Vancouver and Victoria , the couple decided to come back to the cheaper start - up options in Winnipeg , where they lived a decade ago .
Securing a location on the eastern edge of Wolseley ( at 79 Sherbrook St. , formally the Common Ground Café ) , Sohlberg is in the process of remodelling the space into what 's believed to be Winnipeg 's first vegetarian burger joint .
The plan for Boon is simple :
The menu will consist of eight to 10 unique burgers -- each themed in a special way .
Among Sohlberg 's ideas are a Mexican salsa burger and a Thanksgiving burger , a treat that will offer all the flavours of the fall holiday .
Burger patties will vary between mushroom , chick pea , lentil , and tofu options .
" Everything is made from scratch , " he said .
" We 're going to be gluten - free .
And rather than just have a bunch of vegan items on the menu , we 'll offer a choice .
Everything can be vegan - ized . "
Translation :
If you 'd rather pass on the mayo , no problem .
Substitute homemade hummus instead .
Baked fries will be on the menu , as will various soups and salads .
Thirsts can be quenched with fresh smoothies , homemade iced tea and loose - leaf teas .
And , of course , good coffee .
" Really good fair trade coffee , " Sohlberg promised .
" European - style , brewed per cup .
Hot , fresh and strong . "
Sohlberg is planning for some casual seating in the front of the space , but insists the spot will be more of a to - go place , complete with a walk - up window on the south side of the building .
He expects to manage an initial staff of six or seven employees .
" We 've learned that we do n't want to bite off more than we can chew , " he said .
" We 're going to be a small operation at first . "
Until then , the word on the street about the place continues to grow .
" It 's really unbelievable , " laughed Sohlberg , who is originally from Norway .
" We put the signs up and started a Facebook group , and it 's been off the wall .
People are stopping by and asking us when we 're opening all the time .
One person asked when we 're planning on opening in Montreal .
" We have n't even opened here yet ! "
Sohlberg expects to have Boon up and running in June .

SOMETHING ’S GOTTA GIVE ….
The typical American does not know or care about legislative procedures .
It ’s challenging to keep up on current events , and getting a grasp on things like “ cloture votes ” and “ holds ” takes some effort .
Most folks do n’t want to bother , and I do n’t necessarily blame them .
For folks who are n’t especially familiar with the ins and outs of modern American politics , the existing power structure must seem exasperating .
If there ’s a Democratic Congress working with a Democratic White House , we should be seeing all kinds of progress on a wide variety of fronts .
What they do n’t realize , regrettably , is that Republicans have enough power to make legislating impossible , and the GOP is abusing that power in ways no party ever has in American history .
House Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) is n’t some random person who lacks familiarity with the political process — he ’s a member of the congressional leadership .
He knows full well why Congress is dysfunctional , and he knows that it ’s his party that ’s responsible .
So today , it was almost nauseating to see the Post Turtle ’s office issue a press release that read , “ Quick question for the Administration : Who controls the process ? ”
It noted that the Democratic Party at least ostensibly has authority in the House , Senate , and White House — suggesting that Dems should be able to govern as they please , even though intelligent observers know better .
It makes clear the problem we ’ve discussed many times : voters will blame Dems for failing to deliver , and wo n’t blame Republicans for preventing Dems from governing .
It ’s insane , it ’s exasperating , it turns logic and reason on their head , but it ’s the truth .
Dems are running the show , so they ’ll get blamed , even if the GOP sabotages the show .
Greg Sargent explains very well that it leaves Democratic leaders with a limited number of options .
[ Democrats ] can scale way back and find common ground with the GOP .
Or they can press forward and continue highlighting GOP obstructionism , in hopes that the public will eventually tune in to the procedural shenanigans and blame everything on Republicans .
That ’s unlikely , however .
Or Dems can try to change the underlying dynamic — as hard as this might appear — by challenging , and perhaps changing , the procedural realities that make this dynamic possible .
A fourth possibility —
Dems pursue the agenda they promised voters to work on , and the public pressures Republicans to cooperate — no longer appears feasible .
The GOP is immune to public pressure , and the public is n’t engaged .
So , Democrats , what ’s it going to be ?
Passing weak and ineffective legislation , passing nothing and blaming the GOP , or working on restoring the legislative process that served the United States well for its first 200 or so years .
There are no other choices .
Your majority and legacy are on the line .

Most of Prince Myer 's adventure involves fighting flying rats and blue bouncy balls by throwing his sword .
The manual describes it like this :
" SHORT SWORD --
You start the game with this sword .
It is so weak , you feel lonely ( you have no confidence in this sword ) . "
Do n't try to make sense of it .
Just do everything in your power to not play this game .
Oh no !
Prince Myer !
He is feeling lonely because of his weak sword !
And the ultimate deadly combination of fireballs , puddles and blue beach balls has placed him in deadly peril !
Can you save Prince Myer from his fate in this fantastic game of skill and wits ?

I think this game was released by a concerned parent group to get kids to stop playing Nintendo .
And it worked .
Hundreds of children everywhere threw their controllers at the television and went outside , desperate for any activity that did n't involve Prince Myer or his deadly water puddle enemies .
Others continued to play , and inevitably dismembered most of their families .
Was it all worth it ?
Just so a few kids could get some sun ?
Since then , a group has formed called , " C.h.a.d. T.a.c.o. " ( Concerned Humans Against Deadly Towers And Christian Orgasms ) .
They tend to be a little extreme , but you have n't lived until you 've been to a Chad Taco cartridge burning party .

Take every besmirching comment I 've made about how the other 19 games suck .
Now stick them all here and add some vulgarities .
Put an exclamation mark at the end of every sentence and scream them out loud .
That 's how much I hate this game .
Party Use : 5
You can play a drinking game with Deadly Towers .
Have one of your friends ( the smallest one in case they need to be restrained ) play the game .
The rest of the people watch , and drink every time he vocally expresses his disgust with the game .
You can theoretically take turns , but everyone will probably be too drunk to move in a few minutes .

Hi there !
I 'm Mili .
I released a little thought of mine into the wild that is my LiveJournal the other night , and Charlie found it and liked it and very kindly invited me to repost it here .
This post has been two years in the making .
I had the insight for it about two years ago and have been meaning to blog about it since then , all the time wondering why no one has twigged this yet , or whether they have and were too scared to say , or whether I just did n't know that they had .
Anyway , what with the Digital Economy Bill having become the Digital Economy
Act last week , it 's about bloody time I get my act together and put this out there .
So , let 's have a bit of economics to start with .
Because this is what 's it's all about - the money , the economic incentives and the economic possibilities ; and because I 'm an economist by training , though I do n't like to admit to it most days .
There 's a theory in economics about things called " public goods " .
To understand the distinction between private goods , public goods and the couple of shades of grey in between , you first need to get your head around two concepts : rival and excludable .
Rival : ( Wikipedia seems to call this " rivalrous " , but when I were a young economist lass we used to call it rival so I 'll stick with that . )
A good is rival if my consumption of it diminishes the amount of the good that you can consume .
Say we had 10 apples , and I ate one .
There would now be 9 apples left which you could eat .
If we had one apple and I ate all of it , tough luck , no apples for you .
Knowing whether a good is rival or not tells you whether you want to use the market ( if I were a good economist that would possibly be capital - M Market ;-) to allocate access to that good .
If it 's rival , then the market is an efficient way of allocating the good ; if it 's not , then you might want to think about other ways of getting your good to people .
Remember that scary anti-piracy clip at the start of your DVDs which says " You would n't steal a handbag " ?
Hold that thought for a minute .
Excludable : A good is excludable if you physically have a way of stopping people from consuming it .
Back to the apples : if they 're in my fridge , inside my locked house and you do n't have a key , you can't have my apples .
( Yes , yes , you could break in .
The law provides additional protection here , but ultimately there 's probably a better way for you to obtain an apple than breaking into my house , right ? )
Knowing whether a good is excludable tells you whether you can use the market to distribute the good .
If your good is excludable , go ahead and sell it on the open market ; if it 's not - you might struggle because you can't stop people from just taking it for free .
So .
Most of the goods you deal with in your day - to - day life are both rival and excludable .
We call them pure private goods .
But there 's a few things here and there that are n't as clear - cut , and this is where it gets a little messy .
If a good is rival , but not excludable , we call it a common good .
In that case , we want to use the market to allocate that resource but it 's actually quite difficult to do .
Fish in the sea is a good example : my overfishing the seas stops you from being able to fish and leads to long - term damage to fish stocks , yet it 's remarkably difficult to stop me from doing it using just market tools .
If a good is non-rival but excludable , we call it a club good .
The classic example given in economics textbooks is cable television but I 'm going to steer away from that for reasons which will become obvious .
A better example for me is a golf course .
My wandering around hitting a ball with a stick does not diminish your ability to do the same ( as long as there 's not thousands of us in the same place ) , and with a judicious application of fences I can stop you from coming in and therefore charge you money for the privilege ( i.e. use the market ) .
Is that the most efficient allocation of golf courses ?
Not necessarily , but it works , more or less , because they 're excludable and therefore we can use the market .
Here 's the important part : a good that is neither rival nor excludable is called a pure public good , and the market is neither a practical nor an efficient way of allocating that good .
The textbook example here is national defence .
I 'm in the UK , so are you ; the UK has an army which protects us both ( Theoretically speaking - this is not about the value or otherwise of the army , kay ? ) , no matter what either of us do .
Purely by virtue of being here we benefit from it - there 's no way of stopping one of us from benefiting from defence , nor does my enjoyment of this good in any way diminish yours .
So , to recap , for pure private goods , the market is both a practical and efficient way of allocating resources , and that 's what we do most of the time .
As soon as we move away from the pure private good paradigm , either because our good is non-rival or non-excludable or both , the market ceases to look like a good idea .
In practice , what happens is that we try to use technical and / or legislative means to help us approximate private goods when dealing with any type of not purely private good .
We can , for instance , make it a crime to overfish the seas , or put fences around our golf course to stop people from overrunning it without paying ; we can make it a crime not to pay the tax that contributes to running the armed forces .
( Oh and , incidentally , using a public - type good without paying your dues is called " free - riding " .
It 's something economists are obsessed with stopping . )
Okay , enough with the theory .
Let 's look at content in practice .
Remember that little clip at the start of your legally purchased DVD that delays your enjoyment of the film you 've paid to see to tell you about how you would n't steal a handbag and thus should not steal a movie either ?
If you 've been paying attention you should by now have spotted that these two things ( the handbag and the movie ) are not alike .
If I steal a handbag it stops you from having it ; if I download a movie from Piratebay , there is nothing that stops you from enjoying that same movie ( either by getting it from Piratebay yourself or by forking out 20 quid at HMV or a fiver at Tesco's ) .
In other words , while handbags are rival , movies are n't .
Hold the rotten tomatoes .
I am not saying that stealing a movie is a victimless crime , or that it 's not stealing , or that the people who make the movies should n't get paid because I can get my movie off Piratebay .
What I 'm doing is describing the behaviour of movies as goods in economic terms .
We 'll come to the moralising in a bit .
What 's been happening over the last 10 or 15 years is that it 's become progressively more difficult to make content ( such as movies or music or cable television ) excludable .
Thanks to progress in technology , such as making the media via which content is distributed cheaper , faster and easier to copy , if I want to watch a movie tonight I do n't have to go to the cinema or to HMV to obtain it , I can just stay in the comfort of my own home and download it from the internet .
This kind of progress is n't new .
Remember how home taping was killing music ?
Same phenomenon really , but the internet has just scaled it up by a factor of 1 with lots of zeros on the end .
In the 1980s , if I bought an album and then made a copy on tape for my friends , there were only a limited number of people I could distribute those tapes to : 5 , 10 , 100 if I tried really hard and did n't mind forking out money for the blank tapes .
Along came Napster , and all of a sudden my copy of The Black Album could be accessed by millions of people at no marginal cost whatsoever .
Remember how , to make public - type goods behave more like private goods , we use technology or legislation ?
The content distributors made DRM , we cracked DRM , they made more DRM , we cracked it again , rinse , repeat .
Turns out technology was n't very good at this .
The other tool in the box is of course legislation .
Copyright laws already existed and , let 's face it , we 'd already been breaking them cheerfully for years ( see home taping ) before Napster made an appearance - at least in part because copyright legislation is n't fit for purpose ( see breaking the law by ripping your CD to put it on your iPod ) .
So the content distributors ( distributors , not creators - important distinction ) lobbied our elected representatives to tie our hands even more using legislation .
The DMCA was born , and more recently the Digital Economy Act .
Other countries , too , are reviewing their copyright provisions .
There 's been a recent government consultation in Canada , and ACTA is on its way .
( I trust you can google DMCA and ACTA if you 're not familiar with them . )
Here 's the thing though : no amount of legislation will put that particular genie back in its box .
Or at least no amount of legislation that is either acceptable in a democratic society ( Yes , the Digital Economy Act arguably crosses that line already , but it 's easily circumvented by technological means and I certainly do n't believe we can go much further beyond the line . ) or cost - effective to enforce .
Content has never been a rival good and recent technological progress has made it , for all intents and purposes , non-excludable .
It 's time to face the music : Content is a public good .
Here 's what this does n't mean :
It does n't mean content is free ( Cleverer people than me have explained why information does n't want to be free . ) , or cheap to make ( though it can be ) , or that content creators should not get rewarded for their efforts .
And here 's what it does mean :
It means that old business models based on content being a club good simply do n't work .
It means we have to rethink our relationship with content - as creators , as distributors and as consumers .
It means that there are a lot of giants in the content distribution industry whose livelihoods ( profit margins ) are being pulled out from under them faster than they can say " illegal downloads " , and they are fighting it .
Of course they 're fighting it .
They 've had an incredibly profitable business model for about a century and suddenly they do n't .
Let 's face it , human beings do n't like change at the best of times , and we sure as hell do n't like it when it means less cash in our pockets .
And here 's what it also means : Content creators have direct access to content consumers ( see " we have to rethink our relationship " above ) .
There 's a myriad of ways to create , promote and make available your content ; and those are just the ones we 've thought of so far - more are coming .
While old industries may be victims of change , the money that previously went to them is being redistributed , creating new industries .
For most of us , this is something to get excited about .
( And even for David Geffen it 's an opportunity to come up with something new and shiny and exciting , if he only took it ! )
So what does the future of content look like ?
The short answer is that I do n't know , but here are a few guesses and extrapolations from what I 'm seeing already .
There is by now more than just anecdotal evidence that , for certain types of content at least , putting it up for free on the internet will actually increase your sales .
Books are a good example here and Cory Doctorow demonstrates this quite nicely - all his books are available for free from his website and he 's selling loads of them .
( I suspect part of the reason why this works so nicely with books is that we bibliophiles already have a special relationship with dead - tree versions of things , we like to own them , and we like to support the people who create them .
It 's in the culture . )
Putting your stuff up for free on the internet does two things .
Firstly , it helps you reach a wider audience .
A lot of people who would n't fork out the best part of a tenner on a book or CD will happily download it for free .
They might find they like the book or CD , and that might make them pay up , or it might make them recommend it / share it with their friends , and some of them might pay up .
Secondly , it allows you to price - discriminate in the most finely - tuned way possible - it allows you to charge every single person who comes across your content exactly what they 're willing to pay for it .
This is actually a good thing for content creators : it maximises your ( the creator 's ) profits while the consumer pays for the content according to how much they value it - no more , no less .
This may mean I get lots more content more cheaply now , or I focus on giving my favourite artists more money - the choice is up to me .
( Price discrimination is traditionally seen as Evil by economists who believe in the Market .
In many cases it is .
In this case ... I have yet to see an argument to convince me . )
I think another trend we 're likely to see is a move away from big blockbuster type content ( bands like Metallica , or the Foo Fighters , movies like Avatar , big - budget TV shows , etc. ) towards a wider range of smaller artists .
Being a rock star may not make one or two bands a year hugely , astronomically rich , but more artists should hopefully be able to make a living off their art .
We 're going to see a wider variety of distribution models .
My favourite example at the moment is the just - released Indelicates album which comes as a " pay - what - you - like " download , CD , iTunes type formats , CD plus various levels of extras such as art books , and the super special edition where Julia and Simon Indelicate rock up at your house , perform the album , record the performance and sign over the rights to the master .
( I 'm thinking that 'd make a great 30th birthday present - hint - hint ... )
Amanda Palmer is also experimenting with different ways of making money , including pay - what - you - like releases and webcasts where she auctions off her finance 's daughter .
Ditto Zoe Keating .
Kickstarter looks like a great way of funding art too .
Consumers ' relationship with art and artists will change .
It will be a lot more direct .
Art is n't the shiny disc that you buy from Tesco 's anymore .
It 's the project that your favourite artist announces on their blog and asks you for funding and posts updates about and that you wait for with increasing excitement .
How we find new artists we like will change .
I did a little calculation back in February on how much money I 'd spent on music over the previous 6 months , and had to stop counting at the 300 quid mark lest I gave myself a heart attack .
Of all of the musicians whose music I bought , I 'd only discovered one or two through the radio ( and that was Radio 4 , so they , too , were fairly obscure ) .
One set were street musicians whose CD I bought .
A few I 'd discovered through other artists I liked ( Amanda Palmer through Neil Gaiman , Zoe Keating and the Indelicates through Amanda Palmer , etc. ) .
One CD
I 'd meant to buy for a while and was prompted by seeing the artist in an episode of a TV series which I 'd nabbed from Piratebay .
A substantial number I discovered through friends pointing me in their direction and giving me free samples to listen to .
Of course there will be free - riders .
Not everyone will pay for the content they download for free , even if they really like it .
But those people might point their friends in the direction of that artist .
( There 's a reason why I 'm plugging a bunch of artists in the previous paragraph . ;-)
And even if they do n't , you know what ?
That 's okay too .
As long as there are enough of us willing to pay for our art so that artists can make a living , that 's fine .
It 'll be a bit like public services : some people pay their taxes , some people find all the loopholes , some people claim more benefits than they 're allowed .
It 's not always 100 % fair , but in the grand scheme of things , it works .
I think the sooner artists start engaging with their fanbase in a direct way and looking for creative ways to distribute their art , the more successful they will be .
Content consumers need re-educating , and those artists who reach out to do that education first will be ahead of the game .
Those who hide behind their record labels , sue their fans and see them as the enemy ... well , we 'll see , but I ain't buying CDs from Metallica anymore - have n't ever since they helped shut down Napster .
The distribution models I 've talked about do n't necessarily suit all types of media .
They work well for books and music , they may not work well for the type of TV and movies that we 're currently used to .
But we 're already seeing innovation in those sectors too ( Hulu , or being able to buy individual episodes of series from iTunes ) .
It 'll come .
Bottom line : change is happening .
There will be winners and losers , it 'll be a long and difficult process .
But the sooner we collectively stop sticking our heads in the sand and admit that content is a public good , and that that puts some responsibility on consumers too , the sooner we can start figuring out - together , rather than as enemies - what we want the future to look like .
Christopher Poole ( aka " Moot " ) founded the unruly message board 4 chan as a place for anime enthusiasts to hang out .
Now it 's a crazy , sometimes - scary morass of nascent memes , porn , racism .
But Poole is about to go legit .
Poole 's company , Canvas Networks , Inc. just got $ 625,000 in start - up funding from an unknown source , according to an SEC filing posted here .
It 's unclear exactly what Canvas Networks will be making , though Poole gave a hint in an interview with the Times ' Nick Bilton last month :
I 'm working on a new project to reimagine what an image board should be today using the current technologies available ... our code is a decade old , the foundation is really rickety and the layout is old .
So imagine if you were to start 4 chan today , what would it look like , how would it work with a modern browser .
It 's kind of like a reboot , but it will be something separate to 4chan .
4 chan users famously hacked Time 's 2008 " Person of the year " poll to put Poole atop the list .
Maybe with this new venture he 'll end up there for real .

Video transcript :
The tea party movement is huge .
The mandate of our victory tonight is huge ...
The tea party movement is about saving the country from a mountain of debt that is devouring our country and I think could lead to chaos ...
I think we stand on a precipice , we are encountering a day of reckoning ...
We have a President who went to Copenhagen and appeared with Robert Mugabe , Hugo Chavez , and others — Evo Morales — to apologize for the industrial revolution .
...
These petty dictators say that to stop climate change it ’s about ending capitalism .
...
The president by attending Copenhagen gives credibility and credence to these folks and he should not go ...
When we had a crisis recently , when we had a crisis and things were teetering in the balance , people blamed capitalism , wrongly so .
It was government !
It ’s the government that needs to be regulated ...
People are already saying now you need to weave and dodge , now you need to switch .
Now you need to give up your conservative message , you need to become a moderate .
You need to give up the tea party .
You need to distance yourself .
[ Shakes head . ]
The tea party message is not a radical message .
It ’s not an extreme message ...
I ’m humbled by this victory tonight , I ’m humbled by your support .
I hope you ’ll fight on with us until November and I thank you very much for coming out tonight .
Let ’s have a party !
Patents and trademarks .
The idea of “ branding ” cannabis grown in Humboldt is a fine one , but I hope growers are bracing themselves for the day when Big Tobacco walks into the US Patent and Trademark Office and files a patent for every strain of cannabis on the market .
That ’s a patent , folks , as in , a piece of paper that prohibits anyone else from asexually reproducing , selling , or using the patented plant without permission .
Now , plant patents are complicated and well beyond the scope of this article , but suffice it to say that the day may come with the patent office is ready to accept plant patents for cannabis .
Who ’s working on that paperwork ?
A trademark is another beast entirely .
Plant trademarks are controversial ; some plant growers ( including outspoken nurseryman Tony Avent ) point out that a trademark only protects a brand , not individual products within that brand .
So trademarking an individual plant species or cultivar is , people like Avent claim , a misuse of the trademark process .
Trademarking a line of plants all sold under one brand name would be a legitimate use of trademarking .
And yes , the Feds are probably not ready to accept a trademark application for what will remain , in their view , an illegal product .
But that could change .
Who ’s going to be the first to file a trademark when it does ?
And what happens when the owner of that trademark starts sending lawyers to Humboldt to block the use of terms like “ Trainwreck ” and “ Purple Haze ” ?
I ’m not a plant patent and trademark lawyer , but if I had a stake in this game , I ’d sure call one .
Responsible business practices .
Legit agricultural businesses have to file reports of their pesticide use with the county ag department , enforce health and safety standards for their workers , pay fair wages and taxes , pass inspections , and generally run a clean and safe operation .
Those laws are on the books for a reason : without them we risk chemical spills , electrical fires , and a total lack of worker protections .
Sound familiar ?
Now , the tricky bit here is that a person who decides to make their living growing pot is probably doing it in part because they do n’t want to deal with the Establishment .
But this is California , and we regulate our agriculture .
I ’d get busy complying with those laws and learning how to keep records , follow rules , and all that grown - up stuff .
In fact , why not just voluntarily start complying with California ’s agricultural and labor laws ?
It ’s the right thing to do .
Right ?
Eco-labels .
We all know that our homegrown industry is an environmental nightmare .
Pollution , harsh chemicals , massive energy consumption , diesel spills — it ’s a mess .
Meanwhile , the rest of the ag business has been focused on cleaning up its act and marketing its products as organic , eco-friendly , or sustainable .
What ’s that going to look like for marijuana ?
Want to sell organic pot ?
Guess what — you ca n’t use the term “ organic ” unless your operation has been certified by one of a number of third - party certification programs .
Are any of those programs ready to start inspecting marijuana grows ?
If I was hoping to sell organic , Humboldt homegrown to the masses , I ’d be Googling “ USDA National Organic Program ” right about now and schooling up .
Even if the USDA ’s not ready for it , we should be .
Or what about creating a new standard just for pot ?
One that takes into account energy consumption , spills and runoff , and worker safety , but perhaps allows limited use of mild synthetic chemicals in some situations ?
Guess what — mainstream agriculture ’s already doing it .
Google “ ANSI Sustainable Agriculture ” and start reading about what the Leonardo Academy ’s doing to develop voluntary , industry - wide standards that define “ sustainable . ”
A similar sustainability standard for pot could have Humboldt ’s name on it — or not .
Depends on who gets there first .
Go to Holland .
And no , I ’m not talking about studying Amsterdam ’s permissive pot economy .
I ’m talking about their flower industry .
As the actual growing of flowers moved to regions of the world where the climate , labor costs , and real estate costs made agriculture more affordable — think Bakersfield for pot — Holland ’s flower industry adapted .
They kept the tourism piece of the business .
They patent and market new plant varieties .
They export their expertise , their technology , and their equipment .
They have established eco-labels , developed a giant auction and warehousing business , created the best industry trade shows , and generally remained the leader in the flower business — even as more and more of the actual flowers are grown in Africa and Latin America .
Do n’t be in denial about this change ; it will happen .
Figure out how to embrace it and own it .
Develop standards for THC content .
It ’s like the proof on a bottle of alcohol .
Be kind to your new customers ; let them know what they ’re in for .
If Humboldt cannabis tourism is going to happen , let ’s make sure our visitors have a safe and pleasant experience that does n’t send them to the hospital , run them off the road , or knock them off their feet .
Own the home gardening market .
Expect to see a lot of gardeners adding a new plant to their backyard next year .
Trust me , there are legions of garden writers out there who have no idea what to tell their readers about it .
Let ’s create a gardener - friendly retail business that offers helpful advice , friendly service , and products that are easy to use — and then work with the mainstream garden media to promote it .
Garden centers and hydro shops are miles apart in terms of atmosphere , appearance , and customer service .
Just as Restoration Hardware started here and went national , why not get the home gardening retail model figured out here and go statewide with it , cementing the Humboldt brand along the way ?
Could happen .
For now I just hope that our local growers will look to the horticulture , agriculture , and mainstream gardening communities for inspiration and expertise in running a legitimate industry .
A man arrested on suspicion of drug charges and child endangerment said he is concerned with the actions of police who shot two dogs they described as “ aggressive ” while serving a drug - related search warrant at his home earlier this month in southwest Columbia .
Police arrested Jonathan E. Whitworth , 25 , of 1501 Kinloch Court on Feb. 11 on suspicion of possession of drug paraphernalia , possession of marijuana and second - degree child endangerment .
A police SWAT team entered Whitworth ’s residence around 8:30 p.m. suspecting a large amount of marijuana at the location , police spokeswoman Officer Jessie Haden said .
SWAT members encountered a pit bull upon entry , held back and then fatally shot the dog , which officers said was acting in an uncontrollably aggressive manner .
Whitworth was arrested , and his wife and 7 - year - old son were present during the SWAT raid , Haden said .
A second dog , which Whitworth ’s attorney Jeff Hilbrenner described as a corgi , also was shot but was not killed .
“ The family is concerned with what happened , ” Hilbrenner said .
“ We do n’t feel like what happened in the home was appropriate .
The priority right now for us is the misdemeanor charges . ”
Police discovered a grinder , a pipe and a small amount of marijuana , Haden said .
Because the SWAT team acts on the most updated information available , the team wanted to enter the house before marijuana believed to be at the location could be distributed , she said .
“ If you let too much time go by , then the drugs are not there , ” she said .
Drug distributors traditionally have a history with firearms , which is why the SWAT team is used when executing such warrants , Haden said .
If the SWAT team believed they could have executed the warrant successfully during the daytime when the wife and child were not present , they would have , she said .
Now there ’s video , which you can watch below .
It ’s horrifying , but I ’d urge you to watch it , and to send it to the drug warriors in your life .
This is the blunt - end result of all the war imagery and militaristic rhetoric politicians have been spewing for the last 30 years — cops dressed like soldiers , barreling through the front door middle of the night , slaughtering the family pets , filling the house with bullets in the presence of children , then having the audacity to charge the parents with endangering their own kid .
There are 100 - 150 of these raids every day in America , the vast , vast majority like this one , to serve a warrant for a consensual crime .
I now really mean it when I say , “ Fuck the Police ” .

Verizon and Google are working together to bring a tablet to the U.S. market , Verizon Wireless CEO Lowell McAdam today told the Wall Street Journal .
Part of Verizon and Google ’s join aims to bring the “ next big wave of opportunities ” to the U.S. wireless industry , the Verizon - Google tablet is intended to clip the wings of the ever - soaring iPad .
While he declined to discuss which company will be responsible for manufacturing the tablet or even hint at when it will be available , McAdam did note that the tablet is symbolic in that it highlights the intensifying relationship between the two companies .
The question is : Will it be Android or Chrome ?
UPDATE : Bloomberg is reporting tablet will run Android and that more details will be announced this week .

YOU F***ING ROCK DUDE !
These books are amazing .
I can't get over these .
I knew I 'd be impressed , but wow !
Thank you thank you thank you !
You can most definitely start a college course on UFOlogy now with these .
Are you ready to do a UFO conference lecture yet ?
John ( Washington )
This book is absolutely fascinating !
It 's incredible to see that while the world was working on and " perfecting " the automobile , there were also inventors working on designs for these " exotic " and potentially more efficient transportation systems as well .
It 's like there 've been " two worlds " all along and somehow the public got stuck in the wrong one .
I think increased public acknowledgment of these technological accomplishments will hopefully steer us back to the right path , and increased distribution of this book is an excellent first step !
It 's called " UFO - How To " for a very good reason .
The author says if you follow the instructions , you can build your own .
Specifically , the patents relate to the construction of craft that use a variety of unorthodox structural components , fuselage configurations , propulsion and control systems .
You might be surprised to learn ( though you should n’t be ) that many of the drawings that accompany the patent applications , depict craft that you would think come straight out of movies like “ Close Encounters of the Third Kind . ”
However , unlike Hollywood , we are not mixing fact and fiction here .

How UFOs Work
The UFO How - To series has thousands if pages to it , 99 % of the content is complete patent information , only 1 % of the content is commentary .
Over four thousand ( 4000 + ) pages are devoted to UFO craft and their propulsion systems , over twenty - eight hundred ( 2800 + ) pages are showing the complete patents of power systems that can be used for UFO craft , homes , and even automobile , over six hundred ( 600 + ) pages dedicated to navigation and communication systems , with the remainder dedicated to miracles of science like full body teleportation and hyperspace generators .
But you do n’t need to read all those pages , or even understand all those pages to understand how UFOs operate .
To make it easier , I broke them down into six main categories :
1 ) Air powered .
Some of the oldest patents are air foil discs and giant blowers .
2) Electrogravitic .
Large voltages of electricity pulsed into the right receivers .
3 ) Plasma Propulsion .
Think of rockets that run on lightning .
Or David Adair .
4 ) Magnetohydrodynamic .
These are the ‘ glowing balls of light ’ people see .
5 ) Fusion .
A catch all category for fusion , fission , and antimatter drives .
6 ) Inertial .
Mechanical momentum powered craft .
You can choose which area you want to start , because the first six books of the UFO How - To series are divided as above .
All except the first book , “ 100 Years of UFO Patents . ”
That first book has all kinds of UFOs in it , from the first “ Aerial Machine ” to the “ Gyro Stabilized Flying Saucer ” to the “ Gravitational Wave Propulsion System . ”
Important People of Interest
The following people are ‘ persons of interest ’ in the history and development of the modern human built UFO .
Each one of them has played a critical role in the science of UFO propulsion systems , and has a portion of the UFO How - To series .
Nikola Tesla :
In 1884 Tesla came to America with four cents in his pocket and a notebook under his arm .
In that notebook were the plans for “ the perfect flying machine , ” the UFO .
This man gave the United States 117 patents , was the father of alternating current , radio , neon lighting , automotive distributors , remote control … and would have given the world free power , global communication , and the ability to travel anywhere on the planet in seconds , back in 1905 .
But he was shut down by the money powers .
Unfortunately for the money powers , he inspired others to follow in his footsteps .
This is great for the rest of us , because , Tesla never patented his UFO plans .
He was too concerned that those in power would use the UFO as a weapon of war , being able to cause a blitzkrieg in mere seconds , re-supplying weapons in seconds , returning in seconds , ultimately raining down months worth of devastation in minutes .
Tesla felt that the plans were best kept by him , to prevent the horrors of war from being magnified to a level never before seen .
( You can read more about Tesla in Volume II of the UFO How - To series , “ Electrogravitics . )
But by the time he shifted his self - perception to that of guardian of the UFO secret , he had already inspired a young T. Townsend Brown to follow in his footsteps as researcher extraordinaire .
Thomas Townsend Brown : Brown ’s legacy is documented in his patents , a progression of understanding how high voltage pulses cause capacitors to lurch , and how that lurching ( “ electrokinetic movement ” ) could be harnessed for flight .
Long before completing his education , or progressing along his impressive career , Brown would bring his discovery to Prof.
Biefeld .
Prof .
Biefeld latched on to Brown ’s discovery and used his tenure to get this phenomenon officially recognized in physics .
Thomas Townsend Brown ’s discovery bears his name to this day : The Biefeld - Brown Effect . ”
Impressive is definitely the word to use to describe Brown ’s career : Naval Research Laboratory , International Gravity Expedition to the West Indies , Johnson Smithsonian Deep Sea Expedition , Officer - in - charge Atlantic Fleet Radar Material School , Atlantic Fleet Gyrocompass School , Materials and Processes Engineer at Glenn LD Martin Aircraft Co. Baltimore , Md. , Radar Consultant at Lockheed Aircraft Co. Consulting physicist at Pearl Harbor Navy Yard , Bahnson Laboratories …
His work with high voltages would spark ( no pun intended ) the development of the UFO as a classified project in the United States , coming to open testing in the late 1940 ’s .
Brown ’s work was classified for decades , and the fact that any portion of it has been released is practically a miracle in itself .
But much of it is available , and you can read more about TT Brown in Volume II of the UFO How - To series , “ Electrogravitics .
While Brown ’s work helped solidify Tesla ’s dream of the “ perfect flying machine , ” it was the work of Wallace that made it a reality .
Henry W. Wallace : A brilliant scientist who worked for GE Aerospace and GE Re-Entry Systems , he discovered and openly patented the secret of inertia and gravity shielding .
It is because of Wallace that we understand how pilots and passengers can travel in a craft moving at thousands of miles per hour , making right angle or sharper maneuvers without being crushed by the G - Forces generated .
His patents titled “ Method And Apparatus For Generating A Dynamic Force Field ” , and “ Method And Apparatus For Generating A Secondary Gravitational Force Field ” expose the miracle of gravitational and inertial shielding , and generating electrogravitic propulsion .
You can read these in Volume II of the UFO How - To series , “ Electrogravitics .
In those patents , Wallace details the missing secrets from Brown ’s work , that the way to create shielding of inertia and gravity is by using materials with significantly high ratio of odd nuclear spin values ( the proportions of the nucleus are not balanced , it is not about radioactivity ) .
You can learn more about this in the two free videos I ’ve posted at Flash Presentation Part I and Flash Presentation Part II .
.
And do n’t confuse “ lifter technology ” with electrogravitic propulsion .
That ’s like confusing a hot - air balloon with a surface - to - air missile .
But Wallace ’ work was n’t just about shielding , it was about propulsion .
These same materials with odd nuclear spin values can harness the propulsive effect mechanically .
That ’s why Wallace patented inertial transmission and variable speed gearing devices that rotated at such high speeds .
If a person were to hook up a device like Tesla ’s turbine , which is capable of tens of thousands of revolutions per minute safely , to Wallace ’ gearing and transmission system , in turn rotating his mechanical secondary gravitational force generator ( Wallace ’ overall plan ) , you could design a UFO capable of the high speeds , intense maneuvers , that is gravitationally and inertially shielded , without the high voltage electricity pulses .
Nicholas Christofilos : Christofilos is the father of Fusion Theory as we understand it today because his discovery of the “ Magnetic Bottle . ”
Like all truly brilliant minds , his discovery was attempted to be usurped by members of academia who tried to steal his work and take credit for his discoveries .
The right circumstances shed light on the fact that his work was first in this field , and history has been corrected , but it almost was n’t so .
You can read more about Christofilos ’ magnetic bottles , fusion reactors , astrons and other inventions of Volume V of the UFO How - To series .
So to all you garage tinkerers and home lab researchers , NEVER GIVE UP if someone tries to steal your work !
RECAP
I broke down the main UFO types into the six main books :
1 ) Flying saucers , whether powered by air , gyro , or by gravity waves .
2) Electrogravitic .
Dynamic force thousands of times stronger than gravity .
3 ) Plasma Propulsion .
Think of rockets that run on lightning .
4 ) Magnetohydrodynamic .
These are the ‘ glowing balls of light ’ people see .
5 ) Fusion .
The catch all category for fusion , fission , and antimatter drives .
6 ) Inertial .
Mechanical momentum powered craft .
There is also a book entirely on Electromagnetic UFO Systems .
This book has become popular because it ’s the only one where ‘ defensive ’ systems are discussed .
Everyone who wants to create a Star Trek , Star Wars , Farscape , or whatever kind of reality can find that type of ‘ hostility - deterrent ’ technology explained here .
( Who knows what we may find in the solar system or beyond ! )
I ’ve dedicated an entire section on my site to answering the most frequent questions about UFOs and the books .
It ’s at my Q & A page .
I broke down power systems technology into three main categories :
1 ) Hydrogen power systems .
Splitting water for power is easier than you think .
2) Permanent magnet systems .
They can be self - powered , and over - unity .
3 ) Esoteric power systems .
From engines with no input or exhaust , to those that recycle atomic waste , run by the Casimir effect , run on cosmic rays , or even run on sound , all these devices are catalogued here .
These power systems technologies can be used for all kinds of “ green ” applications .
They can power homes , factories , automobiles , airplanes …
Recently I produced a new book about Navigation and Communication Systems .
But this is not the only book that discusses that .
The same 300 or so pages of patent that discuss ‘ hostility - deterrent ’ in Electromagnetic UFO
Theory also discuss application for “ telecommunication ” and as an “ illuminator for an active sensor and / or guidance system . ”
If you ’re thinking that the 600 or so pages of each of these books are too much for you to digest , you can start with The Basics .
At a mere 121 pages , this book touches on one example of each of the main propulsion types with about a quarter of the content in commentary .
Yes , even with this smaller book you will still be armed with enough public domain ( no royalties to pay if you build a UFO ! ) information to build UFO craft .
So why did I provide this ?
Because I found the answer to the question of “ Does man possess UFO technology . ”
I ’m tired of TV shows that never give answers , books that never give answers , public speakers that charge too much money to come and talk about UFOs without giving real answers .
We do possess this technology and the technical layouts are available for you to review .
I found out we can build them , and I want a spotlight shined on it .
We can use this to save the environment , save the economy , and help prevent global over - population .
We can use these technologies to start the next great human expansion into the solar system and beyond .
I talk about this in my prospectus , which you can download here , if you want .
We were so serious about this that we started a Trust to fund the project of building these craft and would have shown the results here .
The Trust was granted public charity tax exempt status .
You or anyone could have made a donation to the Trust and taken it as a tax write - off After five years of campaigning to raise awareness and find donations , we had to close the Trust because we only raised a mere $ 500.00 , and that included the money the Trust 's own board members donated .
Evidently society is unready or unwilling to contribute to this kind of project .

TOPIC : Exotic Propulsion Systems and the Global Economy
In reviewing the recent economic history of the United States , it can be seen that the last democratic president came into power under similar financial circumstances .
He had inherited a massive economic debt in recession left over from the republican incumbent .
That president had a technological development that catapulted commerce out of the recession : the internet .
The internet caused an explosion of commerce , the ability to order and pay for merchandise accelerated .
The current president needs a similar technological boost to reinvigorate the US and global economies .
It can be found in the concealed technology of Exotic Propulsion Systems .
Exotic Propulsion Systems are methods of transportation that far exceed the capabilities of the currently used paradigm of cargo shipment and personnel travel .
For the last century , these methods have been available , but have been hidden beneath a mountain of paperwork and filing numbers at the patent office .
So unfamiliar with the public are these Exotic Propulsion systems that they have erroneously garnered the title of Unidentified Flying Objects ( UFO ) .
The reality of the matter is that these systems have been restrained from public use over the last 100 years because of Cold War concerns and profit margins of corporations vested in the currently existing technologies .
Now that the Cold War is over , petroleum reserves are reaching critical shortage levels and the earth is repercussing violently from the impacts of global warming , there is little logical opposition to implementing propulsion systems into the current global transport structure that :
1 ) Produce no greenhouse gases ;
2 ) Are not subject to the chaotic forces of changing weather conditions ;
3 ) Can fly with the certainty and speed that will reduce aerial travel times from hours to minutes , and replace shipping time from days to minutes , in trans - oceanic transportation ;
4 ) Will increase profitability in direct proportion to the referenced speeds listed above ;
5 ) Are technologies that can be reconstructed by the average man , opening the next great economic expansion to all .
QUESTIONS :
1 ) What is the application of UFO / Exotic Propulsion Systems to the Global Economy ?
2 ) What is the expense of implementation of UFO / Exotic Propulsion Systems ?
3 ) What is the history of UFO / Exotic Propulsion systems ?
4 ) What research is required before UFO / Exotic Propulsion Systems can be Implemented ?
ANSWERS :
1 ) Application of Exotic Propulsion Systems to the Global Economy .
Exotic Propulsion technology can repair the global economy by opening the next great economic expansion .
These exotic propulsion systems are predominantly public domain material ; their use can increase commerce and profit margins with minimal investment .
The increase of commerce can be used to establish global governance by swaying the peoples of the earth to be willing participants in their financial advancement , in the greater picture of improving the quality of life for all by expanding the speed and efficiency of trans - oceanic and trans-national transportation .
In the past , governments and big- money interests have glossed over alerting the public to these technologies because it was much more profitable to encourage dependence on the current system .
But now that the current system is in trouble , with ever more bailouts , skyrocketing fuel costs , and failing revenues , this technology can be integrated into the current system and made much more profitable .
Who would fly a regular plane of any type when the craft employing an Exotic Propulsion system is much faster , safer , and more atmospherically stable ?
The corporations that rely the most on government subsidies and short supply to increase their corporations ' bottom lines now can return to the ideology that improvement in performance can lead to greater profits than reliance on the current failing system .
Convincing corporate heads that implementing technology that increases performance by a factor of 48 times or greater should not prove difficult .
TIL that NASA estimates that the value of minerals in the asteroid belt exceeds $ 600,000,000,000,000,000,000 .
Or nearly $ 100 billion per person alive .
The repercussions of the implementation of these exotic propulsion technologies will be felt in the stock market , with graduated recurrent increases as corporate performance improves by the integration of this superior technology into the market .
As market performance increases ( shorter trip times encourage more flights ; produce and other commodities can be delivered same - day for better quality and less spoilage ... ) and profitability expands , faith in the market will return and stabilize , and the economies of all participating nations shall thrive .
The open use and acceptance of these technologies will repair the global economy by opening the next great economic expansion .
Space tourism can become a reality in a much shorter time and a more profitable manifestation .
The cruise industries will find great profits in tours around the moon and the outer giants .
Material resources need no longer be in short supply as mining the asteroid belt becomes a commonplace event .
Oil prospecting on Jupiter ’s moons could likewise easily be achieved .
The threat of overpopulation can be eradicated , as the technology to create lunar bases and settlements in other locations of the solar system can be implemented .
Transport and shipment of supplies between these settlements and the Earth will be feasible because the speeds achieved are far in excess of currently implemented rocket technologies .
2) Expense of Implementation of Exotic Propulsion Systems .
These Exotic Propulsion Systems will not be deterred by expense .
The materials used to construct them are in fact commonplace : copper wire , simple ceramics , and basic frame building that can be accomplished by automobile manufacture plants , airplane construction plants , and shipyards .
The subsystems of propulsion that are categorized for this prospectus can be reduced to the following categories :
1 ) Plasma Propulsion ;
2 ) Electrogravitic Systems ;
3 ) Magnetohydrodynamic Systems .
In reality the above mentioned systems are so closely interrelated that some persons might say that the sub - divisions are splitting hairs .
Be that as it may , the technical requirements for comprehension of functionality are not excessive .
It does not require engineers with doctorate degrees to design and build these systems .
It has been stated , “ If you can design a Tesla Coil , you can build an Exotic Propulsion System craft . ”
3 ) The History of Exotic Propulsion Systems :
The bulk of the numerous patents that have been issued in the United States , Britain , and Canada over the last 100 years for electrogravitic and magnetohydrodynamic propulsion patents are merely rehashes of the same principle of physics — that a high voltage discharged as impulses can be harnessed to defy gravity and propel at velocities far in excess of those achieved by conventional aircraft .
Thomas Townsend Brown is the most prominent early figure in the recovery of actual data regarding electrogravitic propulsion systems in the United States .
While many historians trace the source of the work to his role model and inspiration , Nikola Tesla , Tesla ’s secrecy in disclosing data to sources in the West preclude him as a reliable source for hard facts for the purposes of this prospectus .
Brown is credited with the discovery that high voltage impulses in a capacitor will cause that capacitor to lurch in the direction of that capacitor ’s north pole ; this discovery is recognized in physics as the “ Biefeld - Brown Effect . ”
But this discovery does not give a complete enough answer for Exotic Propulsion Systems for our purposes .
It is the work of Henry W. Wallace , another important figure in Exotic Propulsion Systems , that completes the feasibility of their integration into the transport paradigm of the global economy .
Wallace discovered that high speed rotation of elements with odd nuclear spin values cause directional movement that is neither centrifugal nor centripetal motion .
It appears from the numerous patents on these Exotic Propulsion Systems that elements with odd nuclear spin values increase the propulsive effect regardless of whether the high speed rotation method or the high voltage electrical impulse method of Brown are used .
Through Brown ’s work , high speed electrogravitic propulsion is realized , but it is through Wallace ’s work that the ability for a human being to withstand the high - G maneuvers that Exotic Propulsion Systems ( EPS ) craft perform is realized .
Put simply , the occupants of the EPS craft are shielded from gravitational and inertial forces .
4 ) Research Required Before Exotic Propulsion Systems can be Implemented .
Most of the research has been laid out already , as evidenced by the hundred years of patents that recreate the same craft on the same principle of physics .
Research and development will consist solely of stress testing the existing craft based on the existing craft plans to determine life spans of the craft involved , and maximum cargo capabilities .
CONCLUSION :
The implementation of this technology , as chronicled by Mr. Fortune , can stimulate the health and expansion of the Global Economy , by encouraging the transnational corporations and world governments to incorporate the use of the Exotic Propulsion Systems for purposes of cargo and personnel transportation to foster growth on an unprecedented scale that can balance the global economy , address global warming , fuel shortage concerns , and over - population issues , while leveling the economic playing field between nations and improving the quality of life for all peoples on this planet .
It is the endeavor of the author to show how these technologies can be replicated by the average person , by building a craft , and making a public disclosure of the process , of such craft utilizing Exotic Propulsion Systems .
For the technical elements and specifications of implementing these technologies as delineated above , please see the books listed in the Bibliography .

Baduel has become a rallying point for Venezuela 's opposition
The former defence minister of Venezuela has been sentenced to almost eight years in prison for corruption while he was in office .
Raul Baduel was a key Hugo Chavez ally , and played an important role in defence of the president when he was temporarily ousted in a 2002 coup .
But after the two fell out in 2007 , Mr Baduel was arrested on corruption charges .
He has also been banned from ever holding political office again .
Mr Baduel was one of the four founding members of President Chavez 's revolutionary movement , MVR - 200 .
' Twittering ' from jail But , more than that , he was the key military man who returned Mr Chavez to power after a short - lived coup against the socialist leader in 2002 .
Mr Chavez values loyalty like no other trait in his inner circle , and responded by making Mr Baduel his defence minister .
But in 2007 , while President Chavez was campaigning to change the constitution to allow him to stand for office beyond the limit of two terms , his former confidant and friend deserted the party and denounced the campaign .
He said that Mr Chavez was attempting to usurp the constitutional powers of the Venezuelan people , and wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times entitled Why I Parted Ways with Chavez .
Several months later , the retired general was arrested on corruption charges , accused of misappropriating state funds while he was defence minister .
For the past year - and - a - half he has been in prison awaiting trial .
His case has now been heard in a military court and Mr Baduel , who insisted he was innocent , has been sentenced to seven years and 11 months in jail .
During his imprisonment , he has become something of a rallying point for the opposition , who consider him to be a political prisoner in Venezuela .
Mr Baduel has maintained his opposition to Mr Chavez from prison , using the social networking website Twitter and other devices to get his message out .
As well as his jail sentence , he has been banned from ever holding political office again .

Once again a South American president extrapolates in his verbal excesses .
As if not enough Lula and Hugo Chavez , now was the time of Evo Morales .
Bolivian President , Evo Morales , has surprised his audience by ensuring that the chickens of industrial production are responsible for “ deviations ” of men for homosexuality and baldness in Europe .
At the opening of a social summit held in your country to discuss climate change , Morales attacked the intensive rearing of poultry with those statements and others , about the supposed health hazards of Coca - Cola and Dutch potatoes .
According to the trustee , the chickens are fattened with female hormones .
“ The chicken we eat is loaded with female hormones .
Therefore , men who eat these chickens have deviations in their being as men , ” Morales told thousands of people at the opening of the Peoples of the World Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth .
He also added , to the consequences of this type of food , baldness , and prophesied : “ At fifty , everyone will be bald . ”
According to the president , these data demonstrate that the “ West brings increasingly more and more poison . ”
The idea that hormones are added to poultry in commercial farms is considered a myth without foundation by specialists .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
As many as 20 bidders are interested in buying software company Novell Inc NOVL.O , which has put itself up for sale and is this week accepting bids , the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday .
Most or all of the companies expected to make serious bids are private equity firms , the Journal said , citing people familiar with the matter .
The report said it was unlikely that a tech company would bid for all of Novell , but private equity firms could break up the company .
A Novell spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment .
In March , Novell rejected a $ 2 billion takeover offer from investment fund and shareholder Elliott Associates , calling its offer of $ 5.75 a share inadequate .
Novell shares closed up 3.6 percent on Wednesday at $ 6.03 .
Initial offers for Novell are expected to top the Elliott bid , the Journal reported , adding that a private buyer could acquire Novell for about $ 500 million in cash and take on debt to cover the rest of the cost .
Split Stacks in GCC
Ian Lance Taylor
The goal of split stacks is to permit a discontiguous stack which is grown automatically as needed .
This means that you can run multiple threads , each starting with a small stack , and have the stack grow and shrink as required by the program .
It is then no longer necessary to think about stack requirements when writing a multi- threaded program .
The memory usage of a typical multi- threaded program can decrease significantly , as each thread does not require a worst - case stack size .
It becomes possible to run millions of threads ( either full NPTL threads or co-routines ) in a 32 - bit address space .
This is currently implemented for 32 - bit and 64 - bit x86 targets running GNU / Linux in gcc 4.6.0 and later .
For full functionality you must be using the gold linker , which you can get by building binutils 2.21 or later with -- enable - gold .
Basic implementation
The stack will have a guaranteed zone which is always available .
The size of the guard area will be target specific .
It will include enough stack space to actually allocate more stack space .
Each function will have to verify that it has enough space in the current stack to execute .
The basic verification will be a comparison between the stack pointer and the current bottom of the stack plus the guaranteed zone size .
This will have to be the first operation in the function , and will also be target specific .
It must be fast , as it will be executed by each called function .
There are two cases to consider .
For functions which require a stack frame less than the size of the guaranteed guard area , we can do a simple comparison between the stack pointer and the stack limit .
For functions which require a larger stack frame , we must do a comparison including the size of the stack frame .
Possible strategies :
Reserve a register to hold the bottom of the stack plus the guaranteed size .
This will have to be a callee - saved register .
Each function with a small stack frame then starts with a two instruction sequence : cmp %sp , %reg bg 1f expand stack 1 : Use a TLS variable .
In the general case , in a shared library , this will require calling the __tls_get_addr function .
That means that that function will have to work without requiring any additional stack space .
This is infeasible unless the whole system is compiled with split stacks .
It would require LD_BIND_NOW to be set , so that the __tls_get_addr function is resolved at program startup time .
Even that is probably insufficient unless we can ensure that the space for the variable is fully allocated .
In general I do n't think we can ensure this , because dlopen can cause a thread to require more space for TLS variables , and that space will be allocated on the first call to __tls_get_addr .
So I do n't think this approach can work in general .
Have the stack always end at a N - bit boundary .
E.g. , if we always allocate stack segments as a multiple of 4 K , then align each one so that the stack always ends at a 12 - bit boundary .
Then the amount of space remaining on the stack is SP & 0xfff .
We then have a four instruction sequence : mov %sp , %junkreg and $ 0 xfff , % junkreg cmp $ framesize plus slop , %junkreg bg 1f expand stack 1 : Introduce a new function call which handles the comparison of the stack pointer and the stack expansion .
This function call would be part of the threading library and can use special knowledge - - e.g , the ability to quickly locate information about the stack of the current frame .
This function call would have to use a special calling sequence , with a single argument which is the size of the stack frame .
Then each function would start with a call to this function .
On some targets this function call could perhaps be combined with a function call required by PIC code-- e.g. , __i686.get_pc_thunk.bx .
Reuse the stack protector support field .
When using glibc each thread descriptor has a field used by the stack protector .
We can reuse that field to hold the stack limit .
Of course it is then not possible to use split stacks in conjunction with stack protector .
At least on x86 , arrange to allocate a new field in the TCB header accessible via % fs or % gs .
This is probably the best solution , and it is the one implemented for i386 and x86_64 .
Expanding the stack
Expanding the stack requires allocating additional memory .
This additional memory will have to be allocated using only the stack space slop .
All of the functions used to allocate additional stack space must be compiled to not use a split stack .
A new function attribute , no_split_stack will be introduced to mean that the stack should not be split .
It would also work to ensure that the stack is large enough that they do not need to split the stack during the allocation call .
After expanding the stack , the function will copy any stack based parameters from the old stack to the new stack .
Fortunately , all C++ objects which require a copy or move constructor are implicitly passed by reference , so copying the parameters on the stack is OK .
For varargs functions , this is impossible in general , so we will compile varargs functions differently : they will use an argument pointer which is not necessarily based on the frame pointer .
For functions which return objects on the stack , the objects will be returned on the old stack .
This should normally happen automatically , as the initial hidden parameter will naturally point to the old stack .
When expanding the stack , the return address of the function will be munged to point to a function which will release the allocated stack block and reset the stack pointer to the caller .
The address of the old stack block , and the old stack pointer , will have been saved somewhere in the new stack block .
Backward compatibility
We want to be able to use split stack programs on systems with prebuilt libraries compiled without split stacks .
This means that we need to ensure that there is sufficient stack space before calling any such function .
Each object file compiled in split stack mode will be annotated to indicate that the functions use split stacks .
This should probably be annotated with a note but there is no general support for creating arbitrary notes in GNU as .
Therefore , each object file compiled in split stack mode will have an empty section with a special name : . note .
GNU - split - stack .
If an object file compiled in split stack mode includes some functions with the no_split_stack attribute , then the object file will also have a .note .
GNU - no - split - stack section .
This will tell the linker that some functions may not have the expected split stack prologue .
When the linker links an executable or shared library , it will look for calls from split - stack code to non -split - stack code .
This will include calls to non-split - stack shared libraries ( thus , a program linked against a split - stack shared library may fail if at runtime the dynamic linker finds a non -split - stack shared library ; it might be desirable to use a new segment type to detect this situation ) .
For calls from split - stack code to non-split - stack code , the linker will change the initial instructions in the split - stack ( caller ) function .
This means that the linker will have to have special knowledge of the instructions that the compiler emits .
The effect of the changes will be to increase the required framesize by a number large enough to reasonably work for a non -split - stack .
This will be a target dependent number ; the default will be something like 64 K .
Note that this large stack will be released when the split - stack function returns .
Note that I 'm disregarding the case of split - stack code in a shared library calling non-split - stack code in the main executable ; that seems like an unlikely problem .
Function pointers are a tricky case .
In general we do n't know whether a function pointer points to split - stack code .
Therefore , all calls through a function pointer will be modified to call ( or jump to ) a special function __fnptr_morestack .
This will use a target specific function calling sequence , and will be implemented as though it were itself a function call instruction .
That is , all the parameters will be set up , and then the code will jump to __fnptr_morestack .
The __fnptr_morestack function takes two parameters : the function pointer to call , and the number of bytes of arguments pushed on the stack .
( This is not yet implemented . )
Debugging
The debugger will have to learn about split stack mode .
There are two major issues : unwinding the stack , and finding the arguments to a varargs function .
Fortunately DWARF is complex enough to represent the unusual return sequence used by a split stack function .
Therefore , the only major issue is that gdb expects all stack address to monotonically decrease .
Some marker will be needed to tell gdb to disable this sanity check .
For a varargs function , the varargs will be accessed via an argument pointer rather than on the stack .
gdb may need to be adjusted to understand this .
Implementation steps :
An anonymous reader writes Other experts are a little more cautious :
" We know the oil has not entered the Loop Current , " Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry said at a news conference Monday afternoon .
" A leading edge sheen is getting close to it , but it has not entered the Loop Current .
The larger volume of oil is several miles from the Loop Current . "
" We cannot order people to evacuate the city ... but provisions have to be made .
At least five million should leave Tehran so it is less crowded and more manageable in case of an incident , " Mehr news agency quoted him as saying .

How hard could it be to not install wires ? "
A car bomb left in Times Square made of easily purchased items , including alarm clocks and gasoline , could have sent a “ significant fireball ” hurtling through one of the world ’s busiest tourist spots , police said Sunday as they searched for a man caught on film who might be linked to the failed attempt .
The incident , coming months after a foiled plot by Afghan immigrants to blow up New York subways , underscored the vulnerability of heavily policed Times Square , which since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks has been under close watch by police and scores of surveillance cameras .
“ We ’re very lucky .
We know we live in a dangerous world , ” said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Sunday , describing the incident as a “ further reminder of the dangers we face . ”
After a night that saw most of the theater district under lockdown , Times Square on Sunday was jammed again with tourists , street vendors and shoppers who seemed to view the incident as an unavoidable result of a perilous world .
“ No matter what they say about safety , there ’s no real safety , ” said Fati Adam , who was in town for the day from neighboring Connecticut .
“ Even with all the police around , these things happen . ”
“ Look how busy the place is , ” she added , glancing at the throngs of people jostling for space on the sidewalks beneath a blazing sun .
“ How can you police everything ? ”
Police are hoping that hours of footage from cameras positioned around Times Square — packed with major hotels , theaters , stores and office towers — will help identify the driver of the dark green Nissan Pathfinder that came to a stop on West 45th Street near Broadway at 6:28 p.m. Saturday .
Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said one camera captured images of a man walking swiftly down Shubert Alley , about half a block from the SUV , glancing over his shoulder in a “ furtive manner . ”
Police were searching for the man , described only as white and in his 40s .
Kelly said the man ’s actions “ could be perfectly innocent , ” but he made clear that his mannerisms drew investigators ’ attention as they watched the video .
Police also planned to meet with a tourist from Pennsylvania who filmed the policeman on horseback who first responded to calls of a suspicious vehicle .
The tourist told police he might have video of the person who was driving the SUV .
An Islamist website on Sunday said the Pakistani Taliban had claimed responsibility for the bomb , but there was no independent confirmation of the claim , and Kelly said there was no evidence to support it .
A monitoring group later said the Pakistani Taliban released a video — apparently dated early April — of their leader promising an attack on major U.S. cities “ in some days or a month . ”
The video did not specifically mention the New York bombing attempt ..
IntelCenter , which keeps track of militant media messages , said the nearly nine - minute video appeared credible .
In a city notorious for its lack of parking , the SUV that glided to the curbside in the heart of Times Square on a traffic - choked Saturday night was bound to draw attention .
Within minutes , street vendors had become curious about the unattended vehicle with the tinted back windows .
Duane Jackson left his handbag stall and trotted across West 45th Street to peer into its front windows , seeing keys dangling from the ignition .
Lance Orton , a T - shirt vendor , spotted smoke coming from the Pathfinder and alerted a policeman on horseback .
In the ensuing minutes , fear spread through the crowds .
A series of loud “ pops ” rang out from the Nissan .
Smoke began pouring from the vehicle .
People scrambled to get away .
“ I ran like everybody else , ” Jackson said .
Nobody was injured Saturday , and police quickly closed most of the area and brought in a robot to scour the vehicle for explosives .
Kelly said it was unclear why the bomb did not detonate as planned , but he said the Pathfinder concealed a lethal mix of plastic cans filled with gasoline , M - 88 firecrackers , three propane tanks , two alarm clocks , wires and a 70 - pound metal gun box holding bags of a material “ granular in nature . ”
Police later said the material was fertilizer , which in some forms can be used to make explosives , such as those used by Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing of April 1995 that killed 168 people .
However , police said the fertilizer in the SUV was nonexplosive .
Still , Kelly said he was told that had the bomb gone off , “ the vehicle itself would have at least been cut in half .
We were lucky it did n’t detonate . ”
FBI agent George Venizelos , speaking at a news conference Sunday , agreed : “ A lot of lives were probably saved . ”
Kelly said the license plate on the SUV did not match the vehicle but instead belonged with a vehicle traced back to a Connecticut junkyard .
The mayor described the Times Square bomb as “ amateurish ” in the immediate aftermath of the incident , and on Sunday , Bloomberg said there was no indication it was the work of an international terrorist group .
Other officials described it in more serious terms as the details of the car ’s contents became known , and most agreed that the incident amounted to a form of terrorism , be it a homegrown lone wolf or someone acting on behalf of an international group such as Al Qaeda .
“ We ’re taking this very seriously , ” Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on CNN ’s “ State of the Union . ”
“ We ’re treating it as if it could be a potential terrorist attack . ”
Times Square ’s regulars and visitors appeared to take it in stride Sunday .
The man who calls himself the Naked Cowboy , who wears only briefs and a cowboy hat while roller - skating through the tourist spot , had no shortage of giggling tourists posing for pictures with him .
Street vendors said that business was no worse than usual and that the drop in tourism caused by the recession and the eruption of a volcano in Iceland — which disrupted air travel — had created more problems than the failed bomb .
“ You ’re never even safe in your own kitchen .
There ’s always a butcher knife or a bread knife around , ” said Jackson , dismissing the idea that the spot where he has worked as a vendor for the last six years might be too risky .
“ It ’s the same here . ”
Times Square appeared to have more uniformed officers on patrol than usual Sunday .
The Associated Press reported that the Transportation Security Administration had increased random screenings of passengers on outbound flights along the East Coast , quoting an unidentified Homeland Security official .

FRANKFURT —
Greece ’s credit rating was lowered to junk status Tuesday by a leading credit agency , a decision that rocked financial markets and deepened fears that a debt crisis in Europe could spiral out of control .
The ratings agency , Standard & Poor ’s , downgraded Greece ’s long - term and short - term debt to non-investment status and cautioned that investors who bought Greek bonds faced dwindling odds of getting their money back if Greece defaulted or went through a debt restructuring .
The move came shortly after S.&P. reduced Portugal ’s credit rating and warned that more downgrades were possible .
The downgrades , announced near the end of trading in Europe , came amid rising political tensions across the Continent that had already punished Greek bonds and sent stock prices down sharply from London to Paris to New York .
The Dow Jones industrial average slumped by 213.04 points to close at 10,991.99 , a fall of 1.9 percent for the day ; major indexes in Western Europe fell by 2.5 percent or more .
Investors , worried about shock waves in the broader European economy , also migrated away from the euro and pushed the dollar and Treasury bonds higher .
The euro slid to $ 1.3316 in afternoon trading in New York from $ 1.3382 late Tuesday .
“ This is a signal to the markets that the situation is deteriorating rapidly , and it ’s not clear who ’s in a position to stop the Greeks from going into a default situation , ” said Edward Yardeni , president of Yardeni Research .
“ That creates a spillover effect into Portugal and Spain and raises the whole sovereign debt issue . ”
Ted Kennedy ’s replacement in the Senate does n’t appear to be quite as articulate as his predecessor .
Newly minted Sen. Scott Brown ( R - MA ) , elected to the late Kennedy ’s seat in a special election , stumbled after reporters asked him why he opposed financial reform .
The new legislation will take a financial toll on the nation ’s largest banking institutions in an effort to forestall future financial meltdowns .

Asked by the Boston Globe how he ’d like to see the bill improved , Brown fumbled — appearing not even to know what it was he wanted changed in order to garner his support .
Brown left open the possibility that he could support a compromise .
“ I want to see when it ’s going to come up , how it ’s going to come up , ” he said .
“ I ’m always open to trying to work something through so it is truly bipartisan . ”
Brown , whose vote could be critical as Democrats seek to find a GOP member to avoid a filibuster , assiduously avoided talking about specifics .
When asked what areas he thought should be fixed , he replied : “ Well , what areas do you think should be fixed ?
I mean , you know , tell me .
And then I ’ll get a team and go fix it . ”
Even the Globe struggled to explain Brown ’s position : “ He appeared to oppose the creation of a consumer protection agency within the Federal Reserve .
‘ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s more government , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s more government regulation at a time when businesses are trying just to pay their bills , ’ he said .
‘ Is that good ? . . .
If itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s an area we need to fix , then IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m certainly open to it .
But I have nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t heard that that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the biggest thing that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s problematic with it . ' ”
Liberal bloggers immediately jumped down Brown ’s throat , pointing out that he received a veritable truckload of cash from the financial services industry just before his election .
ThinkProgress , the blog of the progressive thinktank Center for American Progress , noted that their analysis found that Brown received $ 200,000 in campaign donations from Wall Street and business executives .
$ 106,000 came from Wall Street executives alone .

The Chamber of Commerce , a Republican - oriented trade group , also spent $ 1 million on issue ads supporting Brown in the final days of his campaign , ThinkProgress noted .
Brown ’s comments were first highlighted by Washington Monthly .

Progress is good , but we need to make sure that we ’re progressing in the right direction .
Our fundamental skills and the craft of design have started to take a back seat .
Using the right tools and techniques is certainly an important part of design .
But do our tools and resources make us better designers ?
Taking a close look at the current state of design , we can see that sometimes modern design tools and processes do more harm than good .
Please note that in preparing this article , we presented basic questions to designers , from beginner to expert , in an unscientific poll .
Close to 600 designers participated .

Draw Comics The Marvel Way
As a teenager , I loved comic books : the art , the stories , the super - powers I wished I had .
I remember the point when I went from reading and enjoying comics to wanting to create them .
I became obsessed with being able to draw exactly like the great comic book artists of that time , people like Jim Lee .
Taking books like How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way out of the library was like having the artists themselves sitting next to me , showing me the way .
Many designers can relate to this , because today through blogs and Twitter we can follow those whom we consider to be the best designers in the world , learning what they read and where they go and maybe even getting a glimpse of how they create the work we so admire .
Batman and Superman , drawn by Jim Lee .
This “ how to ” approach is reflected in the design resources we find today .
Soon after a certain style or effect becomes popular , tutorials and other tools to create it become available .
But the element that was missing from my “ how to ” books is the same element that is missing from these tutorials , lists , and galleries : “ why . ”
Why did they choose that typeface ?
Why did they opt for a minimalist style ?
Why did they use that particular technique to spotlight the product ?
We can go through the motions of creating a design , but we really need to understand why it works .
As we ’ll see , certain historical developments offer additional insight .
Imitation And The Cargo Cults
What is original ?
More to the point , is anything original ?
Defining originality in design is one of those complex gray areas .
This subject has sparked ongoing debate about what is inspired and what is blatantly copied .
Last year , Jeff Veen gave a talk that showed how the cargo cults of the World War II era relate to this discussion about design today .
During the war , islands in the Pacific region were key tactical locations in the battle between the US and Japan .
The two countries began to air - drop food , weapons , medicine and other supplies there .
Some of these supplies were shared with the indigenous people who lived on the islands .
When the war ended and the air bases were abandoned , the cargo stopped dropping .
Cults sprouted up that enacted rituals imitating what they saw the soldiers do , believing this would bless them with supplies .
They even constructed air strips , bamboo control towers and straw planes , all in the hope of bringing back the airplanes with their bountiful cargo .
The reason this copying did n’t work , Jeff Veen points out , is that they missed all of the underlying principles .
Straw plane made by a cargo cult of the South Pacific .
We can see modern - day examples of this by comparing the iPhone to the subsequent copycat phones that failed by only mimicking what their designers thought made the iPhone a success .
Simple imitation completely misses the point of what made the original great .
Some phone makers , including HTC , wound up being sued by Apple for patent infringement .
This goes back to how we use the design tools and learning resources available to us .
There needs to be an element of intention and a deeper understanding first .
The Modern Designer
The Designer ’s Diet
The diet of a typical designer is low in in - depth content and high in inspirational lists , tutorials and freebies .
A review of blogs and our poll of design professionals shows a clear trend in the informational diet of creatives .
They consume a lot but bypass a deeper understanding of design .
In - depth articles and case studies are the least - read articles .
Over 75 % of the articles that designers read are either design tutorials or inspirational lists .
Designers feel most comfortable starting their latest project by sifting through inspirational lists and working in their favorite computer application ( Photoshop was used by our poll respondents more than all other software combined ) .
And what about those freebies ?
Designers devour them for their projects .
In fact , they said they use freebies more than client - provided , stock or original assets .
To be fair , this is likely because these types of articles and tools are highly visible online , but this is still a bit daunting to hear .
This content would not exist without such a big audience .
Tutorials Should Foster Thinking
On nearly every design blog right now , you can find some sort of design tutorial .
They range from useful techniques to borderline useless “ how - to ”s .
The problem is n’t just the tutorials themselves or their perceived usefulness ; it ’s how they are positioned relative to design .
These tutorials are not “ design ” tutorials ; they are , more accurately , tool tutorials .
This may seem a negligible difference to some .
The problem with the former label is that it implies , falsely , that you are learning to design .
If someone follows certain steps in creating an effect , that is learning how to use a particular software application .
“ Design ” has many definitions , and every designer will give you a different one .
But I think most designers can agree on what design is not .
And it is not a 10 - step recipe for creating a “ Super - Awesome Laser Beam Effect . ”
Online tutorials focus so much on the tools that many designers are learning to use the software well but are losing fundamental design skills .
In his article “ Do n’t Be a Tooler , ” Von Glitscha talks about how the craft of design is being watered down and skills like drawing are being forgotten .
Many designers have traded in the pencil for the pen tool .
He says , “ Too many designers look for the easy way out when it comes to a creative process , and that is problematic to their creative growth .
Instead of bolstering a core skill like drawing , they pursue a path of least creative resistance , and the end result is a Tooler . ”
The focus on trendy effects encourages cargo cult - like ritual in which designers mimic a technique without understanding what makes it suitable for a project .
A Photoshop filter or gallery feature becomes the driver and turns a design into a meaningless visual layer .
This reflect poorly on the industry , showing designers as being proficient with design applications and resources but not design itself .
Ingredients of Good Design
Good design is the result of great thinking , as well as great ingredients .
Typical ingredients are compelling photography and strong content .
The job of the designer , as a sort of master chef , is to measure , blend and cook these elements into a successful project .
Where do these ingredients come from , and just how good are they ?
Some elements come from clients , some are original work , and others come from stock vendors like iStockPhoto and Veer .
But the majority of ingredients come as freebies .
Free WordPress themes abound .
One can download thousands of textures , graphics and social icons to use in their next project .
Burger Chef customer service promotional photo , 1960s ( via bayswater97 ) .
Using cheap or free design elements is like a five - star chef using canned sauces and pre-made dishes in the spirit of a fast - food restaurant .
Creating from scratch seems to be a thing of the past .
Photo shoots and original illustration are now usually done only by agencies that work for big clients with deep pockets .
Certainly , factors outside of the designer ’s control will affect these decisions , such as budget .
But the price of using only cheap or free assets is that designs will increasingly look like replicas of each other .
In addition , clients will come to expect assets for free or next to nothing , so budgets will not be there for future projects .
There are even risks with using paid assets such as stock photography .
A photo could be used by another company for another purpose , thus diluting your client ’s brand .
Granted , not every client can afford a certain caliber work .
Time and money are often a luxury .
Many designers openly use freebie art and pre-designed WordPress themes for clients to save time and money .
The question is not whether this is right or wrong .
This is up to the designer to disclose to the client .
The question is is this making the craft of design more efficient , or is it killing it ?
Harmful to Your Design Health
Dependance on resources such as freebies and tutorials is turning our design industry into an assembly line that churns out the same exact piece , with perhaps slight variation .
Design is not a commodity , but the more that designers use freebies and the like , the more it will become one .
The Web is just a large copy machine , as Kevin Kelley puts it .
Design seems to be going down this road , too .
Even our information resources — the design blogs themselves — are clones of each other .
“ When copies are super abundant , they become worthless .
When copies are super abundant , stuff which ca n’t be copied becomes scarce and valuable . ” — Kevin Kelly ( Image : Ibeamee )
No wonder many clients see the designer ’s role as being to create eye candy or a beautiful “ skin . ”
With this view prevalent , designers will never be considered people who can solve problems for businesses and their customers and who can effectively communicate ideas .
We will simply be a mindless pair of hands that knows how to apply some trendy colors and glossy effects to make things look nice .
A technique with no purpose makes a design irrelevant .
If design becomes irrelevant , then at some point we may be , too .
Return to the Art of Design
The solution is not to never read this type of content or to use these assets , but it needs to be measured .
Designers need to push themselves with the fundamental craft of design .
Inspiration Requires Perspiration
Remember when special effects in movies were real ?
When the stunt man actually jumped onto a moving car ?
When characters ran around a luscious green jungle in South America , not in front of a flat green screen in a warehouse in Los Angeles ?
Computer technology has become integral to the creative workflow .
It definitely has benefits ; but the problem is that the “ should we ” has crept into “ we can , so we will . ”
Many shallow stories are built around amazing effects , as opposed to engaging stories being supported by technology .
In design , the “ story ” is communication and problem - solving .
We need good reasons to use the techniques and graphics that we use in our designs .
I ’ve seen posts in forums from designers looking for great paper textures or certain free graphics .
What about finding a real piece of paper , scanning it and creating your own texture ?
Or sketching a graphic element and importing it to the computer to create your own unique piece of art ?
Sometimes we need to get our hands dirty .
In the end , it will give us a new appreciation of the work , and we will be proud of the result .
It does n’t always work out because of time or budget constraints , but make sure the decision is based on those and not laziness .

Reading a quick article online or scanning a few nice websites is easy .
More difficult is digging deep in a book or finding the time and money to attend a conference .
Plenty of books and offline resources have great information on design .
A little research is all it takes to find plenty of libraries and universities with good graphic design programs in all parts of the world .
Great design takes more effort than a few clicks .
Build Skills With Purpose
Practicing and honing skills are vital to growth .
Knowing the ins and outs of our software is an important part of the job , too .
Thinking conceptually and devising solutions should come first , though .
If a designer finds that he needs to brush up on a tool or technique , then a tutorial is the ideal way to learn .
Our tools and resources are a means to good design , not the end .
Identify the purpose first .
The purpose might relate to the website ’s user experience or a message in a product advertisement .
After you ’ve determined the purpose , find the best tool or technique to support it .
From the article “ The Role of Sketching in the Design Process . ”
Designers are more comfortable with their favorite design application than with good old pen and paper .
Sketching is about getting ideas out and finding the best solution on which to iterate .
Some sketchbooks of designers are so beautiful that they are almost intimidating .
But great drawing skill does n’t make the thinking or result any better .
And some of that skill is gained with practice .
The point , though , is to focus not on how great the sketch looks but on how sound the concept or user experience is .
On the computer , we focus too much on getting the lines and colors just right , which ends up distracting us .
Buy a pencil and paper : it ’s cheaper than any application you ’ll find .
Train Your Design Brain
Boxing is one of the most brutal sports .
Learning techniques and conditioning the body is critical to being able to compete .
But even boxing has more to it than the aggressive physical displays that the audience sees from the seats .
Some of the greatest boxers , like Muhammad Ali , recognized this balance ; they were great not just at knocking out opponents but at out - thinking them , too .
Mike Rooney , a former boxing trainer of Mike Tyson , says , “ Boxing is 80 % mental and 20 % physical .
Anyone can get in physical shape . ”
Muhammad Ali versus Sonny Liston ( 1965 ) , by Neil Leifer .
Design is similar in that anyone can imitate or find free assets that make for pleasing visuals .
To be great designers , we need to improve our mental game .
We have many ways to get our minds in shape to be the best tool in our arsenal .
When we get in the ring with the client , we need to be ready to take some punches .
We also need to be trained and armed with the fundamentals so that we can help clients understand that we ’re not just sharing our feelings or loose opinions but that we have sound reasons behind our design choices .
If you do n’t understand or ca n’t explain fundamental design principles such as negative ( or white ) space , balance and contrast , how do you expect to consult with a client on the best approach for a project ?
The website design industry is great , and many designers are self - taught .
They do n’t need certification to ply their trade , and they are n’t required to continue their education , as in other professions .
But this is also a disadvantage , because anyone without training or understanding can call himself a designer .
A deeper understanding or a degree in design ( or a related field ) can make all the difference .
Great Design Is History
( Image : Paul Rand )
Design began like any craft : people practiced it , studied it and challenged themselves .
While modern design tools and resources certainly make our many tasks easier , they do n’t always improve our work .
Tools and shortcuts are temporary .
Great design is timeless .
The best tool available is sitting in our heads ; we just need to upgrade it once in a while .
Training and experience leads to solid solutions and happy clients who demand our expertise .
We determine the type of information made available to us .
Every click ( and tweet ) can be a vote for a better and smarter design community .
Please choose wisely .
Resources
It ’s 32 years old , and it remains the single greatest book ever written about a programming language .
Its crown is secure ; even if you ’d not already read the title of this article , you ’d know what book I ’m talking about .
It ’s the only language - specific book in Top Five programming books of the Programming Reddit ’s FAQ .
Co-written by Reinvigorated Programmer regular Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie , it ’s not just the definitive book about the language in question , it ’s the book the rewrote the book on what it means to be definitive .
Step forward , please , The C Programming Language ! [ amazon.com , amazon.co.uk ]
The biography of the Beatles at allmusic.com has a very astute and resonant bit of analysis right in the first paragraph , saying that “ they were among the few artists of any discipline that were simultaneously the best at what they did and the most popular at what they did . ”
You could say the same for K&R , as it ’s affectionately known : everyone knows it ’s the best book on C , and ( for once ) the thing that everyone knows is actually true .
So what makes it so great ?
Short , comprehensive , dense
First : it ’s so short .
At 272 pages ( this is for the second edition , published in 1988 and describing ANSI C ) , it ’s shorter that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ( 317 pages ) and little more than one third the length of Order of the Phoenix .
Second , it ’s so comprehensive .
There is , essentially , nothing to be known about C beyond what is in this book .
If you can read those 272 pages , and understand them all , then you are well on the way to being a C wizard .
( Er , assuming you have the patience to go on to accumulate a decade of experience leading to wisdom , taste , good judgement and technical intuition . )
Third , and this is really a consequence of the first two , it ’s so dense .
This is not a book that wastes words .
There are no extended introductory sections on Why You Should Learn C and C’s Place In The World .
The two prefaces ( for 1st and 2nd editions ) are one and a bit pages each .
The introduction is four pages .
Then we ’re straight into Chapter 1 .
A Tutorial Introduction , which is 30 pages long and in that space covers :
1.1 Getting Started
1.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions
1.3 The For Statement
1.4 Symbolic Constants
1.5 Character Input and Output
1.6 Arrays
1.7 Functions
1.8 Arguments — Call by Value
1.9 Character Arrays
1.10 External Variables and Scope
At the end of that chapter , on page 34 , is a sequence of five exercises , culminating in this one ( and enjoy the characteristic Kernighanian understatement in the final sentence ) :
Exercise 1 - 24 .
Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unbalanced parentheses , brackets and braces .
Do n’t forget about quotes , both single and double , escape sequences , and comments .
( This program is hard if you do it in full generality . )
And , as tough as that may seem after only 30 pages , they really have given you all the tools you need to do the exercise by this point .
Say what you mean , simply and directly
Apologies if you ’re getting bored of reading this Kernighan - and - Plauger epigram every time you return to this blog , but I really do n’t think it can be over - emphasised .
Although this advice ’s appearance in The Elements of Programming Style is of course in the context of writing programs , Kernighan also follows his own advice when it comes to writing prose .
No words are wasted ; neither is your time .
Yet somehow the book avoids feeling rushed despite packing so much into so little space .
After the tutorial introduction , the remaining chapters cover :
Chapter 2 . Types , Operators , and Expressions
Chapter 3 . Control Flow
Chapter 4 . Functions and Program Structure
Chapter 5 . Pointers and Arrays [ this , by the way , on page 93 ]
Chapter 6 . Structures
Chapter 7 . Input and Output
Chapter 8 . The UNIX System Interface
That ’s it for the chapters .
So they ’ve got you doing systems programming by page 169 ; from page 185 to the end of the chapter , they show you how to implement malloc ( ) .
These guys are not messing about .
And then it ’s on to the appendices , which rival those of The Return of the King for comprehensiveness ( though thankfully without the notes on the differences between Eldar and Númenorean calendars . )
Appendix A. Reference Manual [ because all the chapters are tutorial ]
Appendix B. Standard Library [ yes , all of it , in 18 pages ]
Appendix C. Summary of Changes [ since the 1st edition ]
And finally , there ’s just time for a characteristically comprehensive index before the book comes to a close .
In praise of small
Kernighan and Ritchie ’s much - quoted preface explains the philosophy behind the book ’s characteristically dense structure :
We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition .
C is not a big language , and it is not well served by a big book . [ … ]
Appendix A , the reference manual , is not the standard , but our attempt to convey the essentials of the standard in a smaller space . [… ]
As we said in the preface to the first edition , C “ wears well as one ’s experience with it grows . ”
With a decade more experience , we still feel that way .
And it ’s true that the book is only able to be as short as it is because the language that it describes is as small as it is .
I have the second edition of Stroustrup ’s The C++ Programming Language , which clearly models itself on K&R and is about as terse as such a book can be , but its 691 pages make it fully two and half times the size of the original .
This , mind you , is the second edition of Stroustrup , published in 1991 only three years after the K&R second edition , when C++ was still a relatively well under control .
( I have not dared look beyond the cover of the current , 3rd , edition , but I see from Amazon that it weighs in at 1040 pages , and I am not in the least surprised . )
There is much , much more that I could say about the smallness of C , but rather that go against everything I ’ve just been saying by bloating this review up into a monster , I am going to save that for a separate article .
Do it yourself
It ’s also characteristic of K&R that they have this statement on the copyright page :
This book was typeset ( pic|tbl|eqn|troff - ms ) in Times Roman and Courier by the authors , using an Autologic APS - 5 phototypesetter and a DEC VAX 8550 running the 9th Edition of the UNIX ( R ) operating system .
That they did their own typesetting is not just a cute touch , but an insight on the completeness of their mastery of what they were doing , and the care they took over it .
The book is not what you would call beautiful to look at , but the typesetting is wholly functional , at one with the text rather than fighting against it .
( Also , this statement is a gentle indirect boast , as Kernighan wrote the pic program and co-wrote eqn with Lorinda Cherry . )
( Kernighan , left , railing against innumeracy ; Ritchie , right , auditioning for the role of Saruman . )
If I could analyse it , I ’d do it myself
Finally , we come to the aspect of The C Programming Language that is hardest to explain — and hardest to do .
The bottom line here is that writing is an art .
You can hack your way through to producing tolerable text without being an artist , just as an uninspired programmer can bash his way through to wiring together an uninspired web application .
But just as it takes a Ken Thompson to invent and write UNIX , and a Dennis Ritchie to invent C and write the initial compiler , so it takes a Brian Kernighan to write The C Programming Language .
( Kernighan , by the way , is consistently very clear that he had no part in the birth of C , a common misapprehension due to his co-authorship of the book ; but reading between the lines , it seems that he was very much the main writer of K&R . )
If all it took to write a truly great technical book was to write down everything there is to say about a subject and then ruthlessly distill it to its essence , then great technical books would be much less rare than they are .
That , I think , is a prerequsite ; but it ’s Necessary But Not Sufficient .
There is a graceful quality about the writing in K&R , even when it is brutally technical ; it draws you on and in ; it ’s just pleasant to read .
It is , on occasion , gently humorous , though certainly not written for laughs the way that , say , Programming Perl is .
It ’s exhilarating how the book takes you somewhere worth getting to , and does it so quickly .
It treats you like a grown - up ; it is not “ For Dummies ” , but its intelligent approach is not the elitist kind that seems to want to make the reader feel inferior , but a warm intelligence that lifts you up to its level .
In short , it ’s a book that wants to make you a better programmer .
The best way I can express it is to say that at the end of each section and subsection , you want to read on and find out what ’s next .
That stands in stark contrast to too many other technical books , where I find myself peeking ahead to find out how much more of the current chapter there is to plough through before I can stop reading .
I wish I knew how they did it .
But I ’m glad that they did .
Kernighan and Ritchie , we salute you !
Update ( later the same day )
Nice dicussion on Hacker News , and some comments on Reddit .
As always there are dissenting opinions , but it ’s been interesting to see the strong consensus that K&R really is the classic that I see it as .
( I add these updates with links to other discussions partly for my own benefit , to make it easier to track down what ’s being said elsewhere .
Are they useful to others , too , or should I just keep the links in private notes rather than appending them to articles ? )
Oktoberfest is good for reactivating German but bad for livers .
( ( c ) Dave77459 )
How can you possibly maintain fluency in two foreign languages — let alone five or six — if the opportunities to use them are months or years apart ?
In 20 minutes , I leave from JFK for Iceland , then Scotland , and then a circle in Europe that will include Oktoberfest in Munich .
Germany is strategic , as I want to “ reactivate ” my German before the media tour there .
Few topics provoke more anxiety and depression in language lovers than the prospect of forgetting a hard - earned language .
After you return to your English - dominated homeland , how do you maintain your newfound skills , which seem to have yogurt - like expiration dates ?
Having juggled close to a dozen languages — keeping some and losing others — and having suffered the interference that goes it all , my answer now is simple : you do n’t .
It is easier , and much more time - efficient , to catch up versus keep up .
Why struggle to maintain a foreign tongue in the US , for example , when you most often gain nothing more than bad habits ?
If you acquire the language in a native environment and attain an intermediate or advanced level of fluency , you can reactivate your language skills in four weeks or less when approached methodically .
Would you rather spend four hours per week on your new language , only to see it get sick and bloated with a distinctly foreign - sounding twang , or spend two hours per day for 1 - 3 weeks and be right back at your fluency level from years prior ?
I began reactivation of irretrievable German just over a week ago and can already hold a decent conversation .
This is not a testament to my ability , but to the efficacy of a process that begins with massive passive exposure and avoids time - consuming review from square one :
1. Days 1 - 7 : German films with English subtitles for at least two hours each evening for one week .
2. Days 3+ : 10 - 20 pages of dialogue - rich manga ( Japanese comics , here translated into German , that can be ordered in most languages from comic stores in your target country ) for 30 minutes each morning and prior to bed .
I ’m a big fan of One Piece .
3 . On the plane : Read a phrasebook in its entirety for active recall practice of common phrases ( 45 minutes of study alternated with 15 minutes of rest — this takes advantage of what is called the “ primacy and recency ” effect ) .
4. Upon arrival : Continue with manga and grammar reference checks as needed , using an electronic dictionary to reactivate vocabulary from conversation that is familiar but not understood .
5. Weeks 2 - 3 : Thirty to sixty Vis- Ed flashcards daily .
This seems like a lot , but most will have been covered in steps 1 - 3 using active recall ( English to German ) .
Vis-Ed compiles its sets of flashcards from word frequency lists and includes sample phrases for usage .
I begin flashcards after three or four days in - country .
The sooner you decide to reactivate languages when needed , instead of maintaining them for an unspecified time in the future , the more leisure time you will have and the less diluted your language abilities will be when you need them .
Do n’t fear losing languages if you ’ve attained real fluency .
They ’re just in temporary storage with the covers pulled over them .

When Jake Shields becomes a part of the UFC in the next little while , the first question everyone has to ask is , " Who is he going to fight first ? "
It seems like Shields would be a lock to grab an immediate title shot against champ Georges St. Pierre , but that probably wo n't be the way it goes down .
GSP 's next title defense will be against Josh Koscheck , leaving a healthy time period between him and Shields , eventually locking up .
While that 's going on , Shields will likely have to fight one bout against another contender in the division .
The UFC should either forgo this , or pick Shields ' opponent wisely .
With Thiago Alves and Jon Fitch set to finally rematch this summer , it would seem that a perfect timeline is emerging for Shields to face the winner for a title shot .
The only problem I have with this is that the other side of the contender bout really does n't deserve a shot .
Why on earth would we want to watch a GSP / Koscheck rematch , and then another rematch between GSP and Alves / Fitch ?
This can happen if Shields is to lose to either of them in a contender bout .
While I do n't think Jon Fitch stands a stones throw in hell of beating Jake Shields , Thiago Alves and the bombs in his hands and feet could easily put Shields ( or anyone ) to sleep .
If the UFC decides to match up Shields for a fight with one of these two to determine a clear cut title contender , it could come to fruition that Thiago Alves clips Shields ( because anyone can get caught ) and set up a scenario where Shields is n't in line to compete for the strap and there 's no interesting fight left for GSP .
Here is where I think the UFC needs to take this — either let Shields await GSP , or feed him an easy win .
I know Shields will want to stay busy , so the UFC should probably lean toward the latter .
In comes Matt Hughes .
Hughes continually states that he wants to get back to the title but he does n't actually want to fight anyone good to get there .
Why not send him in there against Shields to get pummeled into retirement ?
Hughes will likely try to duck Shields ( or anyone else that 's good ) by any means necessary , but the UFC needs to step in and make him fight an elite fighter if he does n't want to go out looking like a joke .
It could be a win-win .
Shields grabs a title shot after one warm - up fight against a legendary name who has finished his career , and Matt Hughes can go quietly into the night with a loss against a top - tier opponent .
If all hell freezes and Hughes wins that fight , then Shields really did n't deserve anything anyway .
Clegg does not rule out Lib Dems joining any coalition
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Nick Clegg has refused to rule out the Liberal Democrats joining a coalition government - but said he would not back the Conservatives ' spending cut plans .
Speaking to the BBC's Jeremy Paxman , he would not rule out joining a coalition under Gordon Brown or David Cameron .
If there was a hung parliament , he said " politicians will need to speak to each other to give the stable ... reasoned , sane government that people deserve . "
Mr Clegg added that the election was " wide open " .
The Lib Dems are due to publish their manifesto on Wednesday .
' Responsible role '
If no political party ends up with an outright majority following the election , Mr Clegg said the one that got the most votes would have the " moral mandate " to try to form a government .
Of course I would vote against cuts which would destroy any chance we would have of having a sustainable recovery
Nick Clegg Despite saying the Lib Dems would not support any major public sector spending cuts from a Conservative government , Mr Clegg would not be drawn on whether he favoured joining an administration led by either Labour or the Tories .
He said the Lib Dems would " play a responsible role in making sure that people get the kind of government that this country deserves " .
Mr Clegg added that the Lib Dems would not put forward a " price " to join any coalition government .
Instead he said the party had four core " priorities " it would like to see taken forward - tax reform , increased school funding , splitting up the largest banks , and a " complete clean up of Westminster politics " .
He added that this was " not a pick and mix menu " and a vote for the Lib Dems was " not a vote for anyone else " .
' Unjustified ' Questioned about the need to tackle the public deficit , Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems recognised the need for " big , long - term decisions " .
But he added : " Do I think that these big , big cuts are merited or justified at a time when the economy is struggling to get to its feet ?
Clearly not .
" Of course I would vote against cuts which would destroy any chance we would have of having a sustainable recovery . "
Mr Clegg 's comments were in response to Tory plans to hold an emergency budget within 50 days of coming to power as part of a programme to get the £ 167bn public deficit under control .

Mr Clegg earlier announced that under a Liberal Democrat government the first £ 10,000 of UK earnings would be tax - free under a " radical overhaul " of the tax system .
He admitted in the BBC interview that this would not apply to the very rich , at the same time as people on middle incomes would benefit more than the least well off .
However , Mr Clegg said the estimated £ 1.5 bn of extra money that the proposal would give people on the lowest wages would be a " serious break " .
The Lib Dems say the policy would mean more than 3.5 million people not paying income tax .
Labour launched its manifesto on Monday , pledging not to increase income tax , or extend VAT to children 's clothes or food .
The Conservatives plan to cancel some of the 1 % rise in National Insurance contributions that is due to come into effect from April 2011 .
Poor ' taxed more ' Earlier , Mr Clegg said Labour " cannot be trusted " on fairness because of figures suggesting the poorest are paying more tax than in 1997 .
According to the party 's research , the poorest 20 % of households pay £ 107 more tax annually in today 's prices than in 1997 , while the richest 20 % pay £ 319 less .
According to the Lib Dems , the poorest 20 % of households have seen the share of their gross income which is taken up by tax increase from 37.8 % in 1997 to 38.7 % in 2008 .
By contrast , the party says , the burden of tax on the richest 20 % fell from 35.3 % of gross income in 1997 to 34.9 % in 2008 .
But the Institute for Fiscal Studies said : " The Liberal Democrats have , once again , claimed that the poor pay more of their income in tax than the rich , and that this gap has got larger under Labour .
" But , by ignoring the fact that the poor get most of this income from the state in benefit and tax credit payments , and by overstating the extent to which indirect taxes are paid by the poor , this comparison is meaningless at best and misleading at worst . "
More interviews
The BBC has said it hopes to follow the interview with Mr Clegg with programmes featuring the Labour and Conservative leaders .
Mr Paxman ended the broadcast saying : " Next week we hope to be talking to David Cameron , the week after that to Gordon Brown . "
The BBC said : " We are planning a broad range of interviews - including party leaders across the BBC .
" As usual , as part of this process we have scheduled a series of interviews with the major party leaders . "

The future is now for New York Mets first - base prospect Ike Davis .
The Mets promoted Davis from Triple - A Buffalo on Monday afternoon , and he joined the team at Citi Field in time to bat sixth in its series opener against the Chicago Cubs .
Davis had quite the debut , too , going 2 - for - 4 with an RBI .
He singled to right field in his first at - bat , off right - hander Randy Wells .
In his final at - bat , after bailing at a pair of breaking pitches from left - hander Sean Marshall , Davis recovered to produce a run-scoring single up the middle .
The latter hit came during a five - run seventh that lifted the Mets to a 6 - 1 victory .
Davis ' inability to make a backhand scoop of a one - hop throw from shortstop Alex Cora did prolong the sixth inning , setting up Chicago 's lone run .
He nonetheless became the ninth
Met with two or more hits in his major league debut .
The last : Nick Evans at Colorado in 2008 .
" It 's been a long day and it 's been a dream come true , " Davis said after the game .
" Now I just have to work hard and try to make it last longer . "
Davis was scratched from the Buffalo lineup shortly before a 1:05 p.m. game versus Scranton - Wilkes Barre on Monday .
Davis said he was called into Bisons manager Ken Oberkfell 's office and told to report to New York .
" I think actually it 's going to be better playing my first game [ at Citi Field ] , " Davis told ESPNNewYork.com 's Adam Rubin by phone before the game .
" Baptism by fire , or whatever that saying is .
I think it 's going to be a better experience since you play most of your games at home .
You have to do it sometime ; might as well get it over with . "
Davis said he had never been to Citi Field , although he did go to Shea Stadium once when he was signed by the team .
He spent plenty of time around Yankee Stadium as a young man -- Davis ' father , Ron , pitched 11 seasons in the majors , including with the Yankees from 1978 to 1981 .
With the help of amateur astronomers , the composite infrared spectrometer instrument aboard NASA 's Cassini spacecraft has taken its first look at a massive blizzard in Saturn 's atmosphere .
The instrument collected the most detailed data to date of temperatures and gas distribution in that planet 's storms .
The data showed a large , turbulent storm , dredging up loads of material from the deep atmosphere and covering an area at least five times larger than the biggest blizzard in this year 's Washington , D.C. - area storm front nicknamed " Snowmageddon . "
" We were so excited to get a heads - up from the amateurs , " said Gordon Bjoraker , a composite infrared spectrometer team member based at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. Normally , he said , " Data from the storm cell would have been averaged out . "
Cassini's radio and plasma wave instrument and imaging cameras have been tracking thunder and lightning storms on Saturn for years in a band around Saturn 's mid-latitudes nicknamed " storm alley . "
But storms can come and go on a time scale of weeks , while Cassini 's imaging and spectrometer observations have to be locked in place months in advance .
The radio and plasma wave instrument regularly picks up electrostatic discharges associated with the storms , so team members have been sending periodic tips to amateur astronomers , who can quickly go to their backyard telescopes and try to see the bright convective storm clouds .
Amateur astronomers including Anthony Wesley , Trevor Barry and Christopher
Go got one of those notices in February and were able to take dozens of pictures over the next several weeks .
In late March , Wesley , an amateur astronomer from Australia who was actually the first person to detect the new dark spot caused by an impact on Jupiter last summer , sent Cassini scientists an e-mail with a picture of the storm .
" I wanted to be sure that images like these were being seen by the Cassini team just in case this was something of interest to be imaged directly by Cassini or the Hubble Space Telescope , " Wesley wrote .
Cassini scientists eagerly pored through the images , including a picture of the storm at its peak on March 13 by Go , who lives in the Philippines .
By a stroke of luck , the composite infrared spectrometer happened to be targeting the latitude of the storms .
The instrument 's scientists knew there could be storms there , but did n't know when they might be active .
Data obtained by the spectrometer on March 25 and 26 showed larger than expected amounts of phosphine , a gas typically found in Saturn 's deep atmosphere and an indicator that powerful currents were dredging material upward into the upper troposphere .
The spectrometer data also showed another signature of the storm : the tropopause , the dividing line between the serene stratosphere and the lower , churning troposphere , was about 0.5 Kelvin ( 1 degree Fahrenheit ) colder in the storm cell than in neighboring areas .
" A balloonist floating about 100 kilometers down from the bottom of Saturn 's calm stratosphere would experience an ammonia-ice blizzard with the intensity of Snowmageddon , " said Brigette Hesman , a composite infrared spectrometer team member who is an assistant research scientist at the University of Maryland .
" These blizzards appear to be powered by violent storms deeper down -- perhaps another 100 to 200 kilometers down -- where lightning has been observed and the clouds are made of water and ammonia . "
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
JPL , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The composite infrared spectrometer team is based at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. , where the instrument was built .
You do n't love the man you 're with but do n't think you 'll do any better ?
Leave him .
Do yourself and the poor guy a favor .
If you stay with a man because you 're afraid to be alone , you 'll end up ruining two lives .
The woman who makes such a choice is hedging her bets , and basing her choice on , not love .
Women who marry men they do n't love come to resent their mates , and heap upon them their own feelings of inadequacy , self - and .
Resentment will , in some cases , turn not only into contempt , but into hatred .
" On Women Who Hate Their Husbands , " a paper originally read at the New Orleans Society , dealt with the phenomena of women who married in order to " play it safe . "
Discussing patients who married " second - choice husbands , " Dr. David Freedman argues that in each case the woman 's " choice of mate had been based on the specific defect of her own ego system implied by inability to see herself as a person of sufficient potential significance and ability to hold a man she really admired . "
In effect , the women in question believed that they were not worthy of fully desirable husbands , and so chose mildly undesirable men instead .
" She had chosen someone who combined the contradictory , but for her safe , qualities of substantial but not outstanding ability in his own professional sphere , and a passive , dependent , and placatory orientation to the significant female in his life . "
But this proved to make such women dreadfully unhappy because " Rather than satisfying , the relationship proved inevitably to be fraught with and frustration . "
I knew one woman who , having resigned herself to marring a " second - choice husband , " then made a out of belittling any sign of between two other people .
" Those love - birds are headed for a fall , " she cluck over any new couple , palpably longing for disaster .
She could n't stand the idea that anyone might actually have a relationship based on passion , fun , or even simply the promise of an equal match between the partners .
When her own daughter wanted to marry an interesting , handsome and devoted man , this woman was torn .
She wanted her daughter to be happy , of course .
But , on some level , she was also tormented by seeing her own compromised and diluted life pale in comparison to the promise held by daughter 's union .
If this was playing it safe , I thought to myself , I can't abide the payoff .
To marry a man simply because he seems a " safe bet " is cheating : it cheats the woman out of actually working through towards a real understanding of herself and what she needs , and it cheats a man out of being the real love - object for a woman who believes he is the best man she could find .
Shuttle to streak across America during re-entry
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : April 18 , 2010
The Discovery astronauts tested the shuttle 's re-entry systems Sunday and packed up for landing Monday at the Kennedy Space Center , weather permitting , to close out a space station resupply mission with a fiery dawn plunge across the heartland of America .
This is the ground track for Discovery 's first landing opportunity on Monday leading to an 8:48 a.m. EDT touchdown .

Commander Alan Poindexter and pilot James Dutton plan to fire Discovery 's braking rockets for three minutes and 11 seconds starting at 7:43:20 a.m. EDT Monday , slowing the ship by about 217 mph and setting up a landing on runway 15 at the Florida spaceport at 8:48:36 a.m .
A second opportunity is available one orbit later at 10:23:30 a.m .
There are no technical issues of any significance with the space shuttle , but forecasters are predicting an overcast sky with a broken deck of clouds at 8,000 feet and a chance for rain showers within 30 nautical miles of the runway .
Conditions are expected to improve slightly on Tuesday , but good weather is expected both days at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif. , NASA 's backup landing site .
NASA is not staffing Edwards Monday and if the weather prevents a Florida landing , Discovery 's flight will be extended another day and the crew will try again Tuesday .
In that case , Edwards would be staffed and available .
" It 's always a great time to spend ( an extra day ) on orbit , " Poindexter told a reporter earlier Sunday .
" We 're confident the folks in Houston and the folks in Florida will do everything they can to get us home when the weather will allow it . "
Entry flight director Bryan Lunney said Discovery has enough on - board supplies to remain in orbit until Wednesday at the latest .
But NASA holds the final day in reserve to handle technical problems , so if Discovery does n't get down Monday , Lunney will attempt to bring the crew home , on one coast or the other , Tuesday .
" We 'll see what happens overnight , " he said .
" If it violates our flight rules and it's not a good day to go land , then we 'll wave off until Tuesday . "
This is the ground track for Discovery 's second landing opportunity on Monday leading to a 10:23 a.m. EDT touchdown .

If the Florida weather cooperates Monday or Tuesday , it likely will be the last chance for viewers in the continental United States to witness the fiery streak of a shuttle re-entry .
In the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster , NASA has favored southwest - to - northeast entry trajectories that carry the shuttle above the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean , avoiding seasonal , potentially dangerous noctilucent clouds in the northern hemisphere .
The favored trajectories also require less propellant and , while not a requirement , keep descending shuttles well away from any densely populated areas in the United States .
Discovery 's return is the second so - called " descending node " entry since 2003 .
NASA managers ordered the change of plans to give the astronauts more time to complete the station resupply mission and to bring in a daylight landing opportunity at the end of a long flight .
The high , icy clouds that can be a concern are not an issue at this time of year .
" The neat thing about the descending opportunities is it 's going to come across the country and folks will get a good opportunity , hopefully , to see the orbiter as it goes overhead , " Lunney said .
Assuming an on - time descent , Discovery will plunge back into the discernible atmosphere at an altitude of about 76 miles above the central Pacific Ocean south of the Aleutian Islands at 8:17 a.m. , crossing the western Canadian coast " just above where the Winter Olympics were , " Lunney said .
" The vehicle will be about ( 43 miles up ) at that point , traveling at a speed of about Mach 23 , moving very fast , very high , " Lunney said .
" We took a quick look at the weather forecast and we think the western side of the United States will be relatively clear .
So hopefully folks there will get a view .
The eastern side might be a little bit more cloudy , so hopefully you 'll get a hole and you can see it through the clouds . "
With the shuttle surrounded by superheated plasma as atmospheric friction reduces its 5 - mile - per - second orbital velocity , viewers in the west will see a " streak of white light way up high , " Lunney said .
" When it 's down lower , it 's going to be more the glowing cloud plowing through .
I think both will be clearly visible if the clouds allow it to be . "

NEW YORK CITY –
We are all screwed if Iran gets a nuke .
And we may be just as screwed if the United States attacks Iran to keep Tehran from getting that nuke .
Okay , I 'm paraphrasing a bit .
But that 's the core of the message from America 's top military officer , who reiterated today his canyon - deep reservations about any military solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis .
Sure , U.S. strikes might set back Tehran 's atomic weapons program – for a while .
But the " unintended consequences " of a hit on Iran 's nuclear facilities could easily outweigh the benefits of that delay , Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen told a forum at Columbia University .
" Iran getting a nuclear weapon would be incredibly destabilizing .
Attacking them would also create the same kind of outcome , " Mullen said .
" In an area that 's so unstable right now , we just do n't need more of that . "
At Columbia , Mullen also pushed back on a New York Times report that the Obama administration essentially had no strategy for dealing with Iran if Tehran got to the threshold of building a nuke – without quite going over .
" What the mainstream of that article talked about … is that we have no policy and that the implication is that we 're not working on it .
I assure you , this is as complex a problem as there is in our country .
And we have expended extraordinary amounts of time and effort to figure that out – to get that right , " Mullen said .
" This has a focus .
The focus of the President of the United States .
I am his principal military adviser , and it has from the moment I have spent any time with him – even before he has sworn in , " Mullen said .
But the admiral did n't detail what strategy all that time and all that focus had generated .
" It has been worked and it continues to be worked , " Mullen added .
" If there was an easy answer , we would 've picked it off the shelf . "
Analysts have speculated that Iran might respond with terror strikes or naval blockades in the Persian Gulf if its nuclear facilities came under attack .
Mullen declined to speculate what the results of a strike might be , except to say : they would probably be unexpected , and they would probably be bad .
" From my perspective , " Mullen added , " the last option is to strike . "
But simply accepting Iran as a nuclear state wo n't work either , Mullen added .
Again : it 's the unintended consequences .
" I worry about Iran achieving a nuclear weapons capability .
There are those that say , ' C'mon Mullen , get over that .
They 're gonna get it .
Let 's deal with that . '
Well , dealing with it has [ results ] that I do n't think we 've all thought through .
I worry other countries in the region will then seek - – actually , I * know * they will seek – nuclear weapons as well .
And the spiral headed in that direction is a very bad outcome , " Mullen said .
When it comes to a nuclear Iran , none of the outcomes look very good .

Reformist Political Action as a Diversion , Part Two
In my previous commentary in this series , I suggested that the state , by its very nature , was amenable to control primarily by groups of insiders .
This is due , in part , to the “ Iron Law of Oligarchy ” stated early in the 20th century by Robert Michels , in Political Parties : the tendency , regardless of the pattern of formal democracy by which bodies are elected , for delegates to accumulate power at the expense of their principals , for higher bodies to concentrate power despite their theoretical responsibility to lower bodies , and for permanent staffs to accumulate power at the expense of elected officials .
This is inevitable , for one thing , because we are primates genetically wired for participation in hunter - gatherer groups of a few dozen people .
Most people , after devoting their primary attention to family , work , friends and neighborhood , have little energy left over for monitoring political events .
For those on the inside , running the machinery of government , on the other hand , the policy arena IS their work and a major part of their primary social circle .
So the people running the machinery on a day - to - day basis will always have an advantage in energy , attention , information , and agenda control over those on the outside to whom they are nominally responsible .
And as a matter of simple interpersonal geometry , it ’s almost impossible for a large body of people to exercise authority collectively over a small policy - making body .
That ’s something that can only be done by individuals and small groups , coming into direct personal contact with the policymakers on a regular basis .
So the system is predisposed to evolve into an interlocking set of small elites .
This would be true even if you took the money out of politics .
There ’s a school called “ Structuralist Marxism ” which argues that , even when the government is avowedly leftist or “ progressive ” and intends to govern the economy in the interests of working people and consumers and at the expense of large corporations , that government will still be compelled for structural reasons to serve primarily the interests of big business .
Given the structure of the economy , the higher policy - making circles of the state will be heavily influenced by metrics like GDP growth , employment levels , investment levels , and so forth .
They will gravitate almost automatically toward policies that promote the profitability and stability of the corporate economy , as a proxy for promoting full employment and prosperity .
These incentives will be reinforced , even when a consciously leftist government resents the necessity , by such things as the threat of international capital flight .
Hence people like Lula da Silva in Brazil , who have gravitated toward the center - left and been integrated for the most part into a global neoliberal framework .
Immanuel Wallerstein has argued , on that basis , that even state socialist regimes like the USSR were functionally integrated into the larger capitalist world - system .
Information dynamics also come into play .
Even if “ progressive ” politicians do n’t depend on big business for their campaign finance , the economic planners and regulators will still depend on the regulated industries as their primary source of data .
Unless the state administration creates a managerial framework directly parallel to the corporate economy , and sends all its own people to get MBAs in preparation for serving as “ political officers ” monitoring coporate hierarchies from the inside , the information the state relies on for drafting economic policy will mainly be internally generated by large corporations .
And even the most “ progressive ” regulatory apparatus will tend to be coopted into a regulator - regulated complex dominated by “ opposing ” parties who share the same organizational culture of white men in suits , and share the same implicit assumptions ( what C. Wright Mills called “ crackpot realism ” ) about what ’s realistically possible .
Just about anything favored by the decentralist , libertarian left will be off the table from the outset , excluded by the unconscious operating assumptions of both reglators and regulated .
And all of this ignores the fact that the “ progressives ” who control the White House and Congress really are n’t very left - wing or anti-corporate at all .
Far from representing a countervailing power to big business , as I argued in the previous installment , they really just represent the more “ progressive ” faction of big business itself , willing to treat its workers more humanely in return for guaranteed profits from the state .
So changing the fundamental structure of our system , as an alliance between the centralized state and the giant corporation , will be extremely difficult ( if not impossible ) through the political process .
Having elected the most “ progressive ” President and Congress realistically possible , the American people still see economic policy being made by the usual suspects from Goldman Sachs and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , digital copyright policy written by the RIAA and MPAA , etc .
Even if tens of millions of people were willing to swim against the current and make a full - time career out of activism , the minute their attention wandered or their energy wavered the usual suspects would be waiting at the table to resume control of things .
So if politics and reform are the only game in town , we ’re screwed .
Acer 's been busy doing a presentation over in Beijing today , and the highlight of the show was the first sighting of the company 's 7 - inch Android tablet .
It 's described by Shufflegazine as " pretty fast with sensitive touch , " though CEO Gianfranco Lanci was apparently reluctant to disclose any of the specs .
He told the gathered press to expect it in the fourth quarter of this year , which sounds all kinds of 2000 - and - late , but we have to consider the fact that only a couple of months ago Acer was telling us it was n't going to enter the tablet realm at all .
What 's interesting is that Lanci described network operators as an " obvious " sales channel , suggesting the slate has an integrated 3G module , while it also looks like the silvery bottom of the device is occupied by a QWERTY keyboard not unlike that found on Amazon 's Kindle .
Interesting times lie ahead , that 's for sure .

I do n't know why it took me 5 years to write a review ... but this is the most comical piece of art I 've seen to date .
Roadies carry equipment through a door reading " back stage " .
The mic roadie hears music .
He sees that it 's an ice cream truck .
He asks the rock star performer if they can go get ice cream , and he screams and says they do n't have enough time .
The roadie is mad about that .
Later , the star is on stage about to rock out with his guitar .
But he sees his microphone has been replaced with an ice cream cone .
Meanwhile , out back , the roadie is eating his ice cream .
“ Who do you think will win the mayor ’s race ? ” a neighbour asked me this week .
I said I thought George Smitherman , currently ahead in the polls , would .
“ So , do you think he can do a better job than David Miller has done ? ” my neighbour then asked .
The question made me pause .
After a few moments , I said I had to admit that I was n’t sure .
Nor was I convinced any of the other candidates running to be Toronto ’s next mayor can lead the city any better than Miller has over the last seven years .
With the distressing state of the current mayor ’s race , it is becoming increasingly obvious that Miller might have been a serious candidate to keep his job if he had n’t announced last September that he would not seek a third term .
That ’s because , despite five months of campaigning and endless public debates , the latest held only several days ago , none of the major candidates has been able to capture the imagination of a wide range of voters .
For many voters , it requires a leap of faith to believe Smitherman , known as much for his temper as his organizational skills , would make a better mayor than Miller .
And do you seriously believe Rob Ford , Rocco Rossi , Giorgio Mammoliti , Joe Pantalone or Sarah Thompson would be an improvement over Miller ?
Miller decided not to run again after his popularity hit an all - time low following last summer ’s 39 - day strike by city workers .
At that time , with garbage piled around the city , winning a third term seemed impossible .
Both Smitherman and John Tory , the former Ontario Conservative leader , were itching for battle .
Many of Miller ’s former allies were abandoning him .
He had disappointed many voters who supported him in 2003 and 2006 and who felt he could have done much more for the city .
He had made many enemies , especially at Queen ’s Park , in business circles and in the media .
Today , though , the perception of Miller ’s term as mayor is changing , albeit slowly .
“ What did he do seriously wrong ? ” my neighbour asked .
Probably the best answer is that he failed to live up to expectations .
He swept into power in 2003 promising to clean up corruption and incompetence at city hall and to reverse the city ’s decline that started in the 1980s .

An honest look at his record shows he did just that — and more .
Indeed , despite the criticism being heaped on him — plenty of it deserved —
Miller arguably has been the best Toronto mayor in the past 30 years .
His legacy includes Transit City , the suburban light - rail plan to connect underserved areas better to downtown Toronto .
Under his leadership , Toronto became a world environmental leader , introducing a city - wide recycling plan , buying Green Lane landfill and stopping the embarrassment of trucking our garbage to Michigan .
He spearheaded the drive for better relations with the police , saw development start finally in the eastern part of the downtown waterfront , lobbied successfully for new powers for the city , promoted the redevelopment of Regent Park and Lawrence Heights and strove to put more resources into 13 priority neighbourhoods .
In addition , he championed a cultural renaissance with such events as Luminato and new structures such as the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts .
In short , he got the city moving .
Put together , it ’s a legacy that would make Miller a formidable candidate against Smitherman , Ford or anyone else .
If he was running , that is .

The New Zealand government is in the process of changing Copyright laws in an attempt to crack down on file sharing in contravention of copyright laws .
The trouble is , the law they want to pass will seriously affect your rights online , whether or not you share files without permission .
One of the problems is that the bill is very badly written , and potentially affects far more than what you conventionally think of as being your ISP - for example , certain pay websites will be caught in the net as well .
In addition , if you share an Internet connection with flatmates , or if someone hacks into your computer or wireless , you could be liable for up to $ 15,000 because of other people 's actions .
You could also get your Internet disconnected .
Perhaps the worst part is that it forces everyone considered an ISP under the law ( including websites , for example ) to collect Internet usage information on you , in case someone later accuses you of copyright infringement .
Once collected , the information could be used for much more than that .
So the law basically outlaws privacy and anonymity on the Internet ( unless someone masks your identity for you for free - but then they might be liable ) , and treats you and I like criminals before they are even accused of doing anything .
What can you do ?
You can make a submission to the Select Committee on the bill before 18th of June , 2010 , at this form here .
To get you started , I have included my submission .
Feel free to use all or part of my submission , but be aware that it will be more effective if you put it in your own words .
Submission of
Your name and address here
to the
Commerce Select Committee
on the Copyright ( Infringing File Sharing ) Amendment Bill
Date
I wish to appear before the Select Committee .
1. Abstract
I support the repeal of Section 92A ( as inserted by the Copyright ( New Technologies ) Amendment Act 2008 , but not in force ) .
I also support government efforts to support a knowledge economy ( in parallel with efforts to increase the pool of publicly funded , public domain information ) .
I do not support the creation of a mandatory data retention regime , nor do I support Internet disconnection as a remedy for Copyright infringement .
I have also identified a number of technical problems with the bill .
2. Definition of ISP and the safe - harbour provision
There are currently two applicable definitions in the bill for ' Internet Service Provider ' ( ISP ) .
One of the definitions defines ISPs for the purpose of the safe - harbour provision which protects ISPs from liability from their user 's actions ( I 'll refer to this as the â€œsafe - harbour ISP definitionâ€ ) , while the other defines which ISPs need to participate in the notice system ( the â€œnotice ISP definitionâ€ ) .
The safe - harbour ISP definition should be as broad as possible .
The Internet has been spectacularly successful , and one of the major reasons for the continuation of this success is that , in jurisdictions where many Internet businesses operate , businesses are not held liable for the actions of their users .
This means that many processes can be automated without opening up liability for the service provider .
If New Zealand is to successfully foster a home - grown Internet industry , it is essential that the safe - harbour provisions are broadly applicable , unambiguous , and do not create unreasonable liability for service providers .
The safe - harbour ISP definition should therefore at least include all web service operators , all data storage providers , and all network routing service providers .
The following part of the definition is very narrow : â€œoffers the transmission , routing , or providing of connections for digital online communications , between or among points specified by a user , of material of the user 's choosingâ€ .
There are several problems here .
Firstly , the concept of connection is confusing because it has varying technical and legal meanings .
According to Wikipedia , as of the 23rd of May 2010 , a â€œconnection - orientated communicationâ€  is one where , â€œin case of digital transmission , in - order delivery of a bit stream or byte stream is providedâ€ .
The protocol which is used to route data over the Internet , called Internet Protocol , is not connection - orientated , but rather datagram - orientated , meaning that a series of datagrams ( packets ) are sent .
Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) , which is used to assemble datagrams into connections , operates between the two endpoint hosts without the involvement of the ISP .
Part of the problem is that it is unclear if the definition is supposed to mean :
â€ œ
offers :
( i ) transmission , or ,
( ii ) routing , or ,
( iii ) the provision of connections
for digital online communications
â€ 
Or alternatively ,
â€ œ
offers the :
( i ) transmission of , or ,
( ii ) routing of , or ,
( iii ) provision of ,
connections for digital online communications
â€ 
I would suggest making it clear which one is intended , and would suggest that the former is a broader , and better definition , for the reasons discussed above .
The requirement that points be â€œspecified by a userâ€ and that the material be entirely â€ œof the user 's choosingâ€ are the most problematic , as some types of network will place restrictions on which users material is routed between ( for example , in some cases it may be sent to everyone on the network ) , and will also place certain restrictions on the material .
For example , a service provider might offer a service intended to allow musicians to broadcast their music to interested people .
The service might allow the musician to determine the source , and the listeners to determine the destination ( so the points would therefore not be of a single user 's choosing ) , and would presumably only allow music , so the material is not entirely of the user 's choosing either .
However , the hypothetical site should , in all fairness , be eligible for the safe - harbour provisions in the event someone broke the rules of the site and broadcast music in which copyright rests with someone else , without a license .
I suggest an additional class of provider also be added to 92A :
â€ œ( c ) provides computational resources to one or more Internet Service Providersâ€ 
This definition will cover infrastructural providers ( such as providers of Virtual Private Servers , and services like Amazon EC2 [ Enterprise Compute Cloud ] ) that provide services which are used by ISPs , even if they would n't otherwise qualify as an ISP themselves .
In addition , I would suggest that â€œoffersâ€ in part ( a ) be changed to â€œprovidesâ€ , so that people who unwittingly route traffic for others because their computer systems have been compromised are also protected .
3. Definition of ISP for the purposes of the notice scheme
While the definition of ISP for the safe - harbour provision is too narrow , the definition of ISP in new section 122A for the purposes of the notice regime is too broad .
As discussed earlier , Internet Protocol ( IP ) is a datagram - based protocol which works by allowing a series of messages to be sent between two points .
If a court concludes that the definition is intended to include IP , by extension it would also include any point - to - point message - sending system .
For example , any subscription website which offers the ability to send private messages between users would meet the definition .
4. Mandatory data retention
The bill creates a mandatory data retention regime ; for example , inserted section 122Q requires that â€œevery ISP must retain , for a minimum of 40 days , information on the use of the Internet by each account holderâ€ .
This is a very bad idea for several reasons .
It will prevent anyone in the country from operating a legal , and commercially supported anonymous or anonymising service ( that is , a service which allows access to information , without creating any record of the source of the request of the information ) .
Privacy on the Internet plays an important role in ensuring that the public are free to seek and impart information , without fear of reprisal .
It allows people to safely speak out about organised and corporate crime , as well as oppressive and corrupt governments .
Keeping computer systems secure is a very difficult task , as many types of software error can open up the system to exploitation .
Great effort is focussed on ensuring that fixes for security issues which are discovered are promptly deployed , as once efforts to fix the problem commence , potential attackers can analyse the fix to discover and exploit the problem .
However , a determined attacker can work to find an issue which is not previously known ( a â€œzero dayâ€ issue ) .
The exact amount of effort required depends on the software in use , but for an experienced programmer , would probably require a few weeks work ( i.e. a likely financial cost to an attacking organisation of under $ 10,000 ) .
Because not all attacks will be discovered , and because many ISPs do not disclose attacks due to the negative publicity associated with them , it is likely that a single one - day exploit could be used to attack more than one ISP .
Alternative options which would allow an organisation to identify and unlawfully retaliate against a critic trying to remain anonymous would be to bribe employees of the ISP for the information , or to file a bogus lawsuit and seek an order to disclose the information .
In addition , in the case of high - profile pseudo - anonymous users , there is a risk that employees of the ISP could look up and disclose the information out of interest .
For this reason , the best way to keep information private is to not store a record of it in the first place , and to destroy or obfuscate information which is not required for business reasons as soon as possible ( reference : Electronic Frontier Foundation Best Practices for Online Service Providers .
http://www.eff.org/wp/osp).
Mandatory data retention laws passed in Europe have recently been found to be a violation of the human right of respect for private life and correspondence in both Germany ( http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rs20100302_1bvr025608.html) and Romania ( http://www.legi-internet.ro/english/jurisprudenta-it-romania/decizii-it/romanian-constitutional-court-decision-regarding-data-retention.html).
For this reason , for New Zealand to pass mandatory Internet data retention laws here would likely damage New Zealand 's reputation as a country which respects human rights .
As a country , we should be pushing for greater privacy , and less voluntary data retention , rather than for mandatory data retention .
The benefits of mandatory data retention are far outweighed by the costs .
I suggest that the bill be updated so that ISPs are not legally required to retain any data about the use of the Internet by subscribers , and are only required to send a notice if they have retained enough data to send the notice .
5 . Account holders who are also ISPs
An account holder is defined as ' a person who has an account with the ISP ' .
The Internet is , by definition , an interconnnected network .
A tier 1 network is defined by Wikipedia , as of the 24th of May , as â€œa network that can reach every other network on the Internet without purchasing IP transit or paying settlementsâ€ .
By these definitions , any ISP connected to the Internet which is not a tier 1 network is an account holder .
The same Wikipedia article suggests there are only 14 tier 1 networks in the world , none of which are New Zealand businesses .
For this reason , every ISP in New Zealand is an account holder .
In practice , tracing a connection back will often reveal an entire series of ISPs ( who are also account holders ) .
For example , consider the following hypothetical ( but realistic ) situation :
Big commercial ISP
A holds an account with many other ISPs around the world , and exclusively focuses on providing services to other ISPs .
Medium sized commercial ISP B is an account holder with ISP A , and offers services both to other ISPs , and directly to consumers .
Small ISP C is an account holder with ISP B .
They focus on providing services for home users .
Doug ( D ) is an account holder with ISP C .
He acts as an ISP for his flat , and collects money from everyone in the flat to pay C. Emma ( E ) lives with her husband and children in the flat .
She pays Doug ( is an account holder ) and owns a network switch , which she uses to act as an ISP for her family ( her family do n't pay her for the Internet , so she is an ISP for the purposes of the safe - harbour provisions , but not the notice regime ) .
Fred ( F ) is Emma 's son , and he connects to her switch .
He acts an ISP by running a wireless network for the benefit of visitors in the area .
This exposes two problems with the bill .
Firstly , there is an inherent contradiction , when an account holder is also an ISP , between existing section 92 B ( 2 ) ( c ) , which states â€œmerely because A uses the Internet services of the Internet service provider in infringing the copyright , the Internet service provider , without more , â€¦ , subject to subsection ( 3 ) , must not be subject to any civil remedy or criminal sanctionâ€ , and new section 122N ( 1 ) , which states that
â€ œ(1 ) The Tribunal must order an account holder to pay a copyright owner a sum if the Tribunal is satisfied thatâ € ”
â€ œ( a ) each of the 3 alleged infringements that triggered the infringement notices issued to the account holder were infringements of the copyright owner 's copyright that occurred at an IP address of the account holder ; and
â€ œ( b ) the 3 notices were issued in accordance with this Act .
I suggest that in addition , a new clause be inserted which states that â€ œHowever , the Tribunal must not make an order under subsection ( 1 ) unless it is satisfied that the account holder was not an Internet Service Provider within the meaning defined in section 92A '' .
Secondly , there is a lack of any procedure for dealing with the situation where an ISP receives a notice in respect of an account holder who is also an ISP .
Continuing the example given above , if big commercial ISP A receives information that identifies an IP address at which an infringement of its copyright is alleged to have occurred , it must issue an infringement notice to Medium Sized Commercial ISP B.
Instead , there should be a procedure for an ISP who is also an account holder to inform B that they are an ISP .
At this point , the record of the notice would be cancelled on A's system , and A would be required to collect a fee for B to send the notice on the Copyright holder 's behalf , as well as a fee for collecting the fee .
This process would continue all the way down to E .
However , E would signal to D that they are not required to send the notice , and this would be passed back up to the alleged copyright owner .
Where an ISP is also an account holder , it is still important that the ISP not be identified .
For example , in this case , identifying D as the ISP could reveal the location of the flat .
In addition , I believe there should be explicit provision for benefit of the doubt where there is evidence that a computer may have been compromised , and that a user may have unwittingly become an ISP .
6. Jurisdictional issues
The Internet is very much an international network .
For this reason , this bill should be very clear on issues of jurisdiction , but it does not address the issue at all .
I suggest that it be limited to apply only to services which are provided by hardware physically present within New Zealand , operated by people who are subject to New Zealand jurisdiction , and are used to provide services to people in New Zealand .
This will ensure that there is no limit on how competitive New Zealand businesses can be in other markets where other players are not facing similar limitations .
7. Internet Disconnection as a penalty
Access to the Internet is become increasingly important to allow access to government information , and to participate in modern society .
For this reason , I strongly recommend against sections 122O and 122P , and suggest that financial penalties are sufficient to discourage copyright infringement .
The only protection a user has against abuse of their personal information , when it is obtained under section 122P , is an undertaking to the court made by the alleged copyright holder .
This would be of little reassurance to a blogger whose information was released to potentially violent agents of a government , criminal gang , or corrupt business who they have criticised .
8. Conclusion
While this bill is an improvement over section 92A , it has numerous issues which need to be addressed before it can be passed .
If nothing else , I strongly suggest that the Select Committee remove the mandatory data retention requirements , deal with the problem of account holders who are also ISPs , and to strike out new sections 122O and 122P .
Since the advent of Blu-ray and the HD media format , people have been eagerly awaiting the inevitable Star Wars release .
Many expected an announcment soon after the format war between Blu-ray and HD - DVD had ended , but when none came , people began to lose hope .
Hope rose when The Clone Wars came out on Blu-ray , yet still no announcment came .
( HD screen from Episode 1 )
After years of waiting Steve Sansweet , the head of fan relations at Lucasfilm ( a very nice man , met him at Fan Days 3 ) confirmed that the Star Wars Blu-ray is in the works , and have been for quite some time .
Here ’s what he had to say :
“ I wo n’t call it the Ultimate Set because we keep finding stuff — but , a very full set of all six movies on Blu-ray with lots of extra material .
We ’re finding all kinds of scenes from dailies that have never been seen before …
It wo n’t be in the too distant future . ”
There you have it , not only will it be on glorious Blu-ray , but it will also feature the entire saga ( a box set fans have been clamoring for even on regular DVDs ) .
Not much more details than that , but I ’m sure if Steve had more to say it was undoubtedly lost in the cacophony of fans screaming for joy .
Whether or not these will also feature the original versions of the films on top of the Special Editions , is yet to be seen , nor is it known whether or not the Bearded One ( George Lucas ) has made any other modifications .
I ’m sure in the next few weeks we ’ll have more information , and if I were a betting man , I ’d be keeping my eyes open for a holiday release .

This giant TV - billboard in the Rembrandtplein is perfectly situated to be stared at whilst ones waits for the tram .
I 've often stood there and stared at TV - commercials contemplating what would be the ultimate idea to run in this space .
And , here it is .
There 's a problem in The Netherlands that public service employees face aggression and violence , and witnesses do nothing to help or stop the situation .
This PSA holds a mirror up to the people on the street , showing them onscreen ( as people do love to look at themselves ) , but with a little help of a scene previously filmed against bluescreen background , they find that they are now in a scene where paramedics face violence , and they play the part of the onlookers who do n't intervene when the paramedics need help .
Another billboard in Rotterdam shows the same scenario .
Genius .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
I do n’t usually sing the praises of fanatical atheists .
They seem like such a dour lot .
Besides , I ’m a little suspect of anyone who gets as excited as a charismatic about claiming there ’s nothing to believe in .
But I have to give credit where it is due .
The Freedom from Religion Foundation ( FFRF ) recently won a federal lawsuit that ruled the National Day of Prayer is a violation of the First Amendment .
Pretty impressive , considering that only two atheists run the FFRF as co-presidents : Annie Laurie Gaylor and husband Dan Barker , a former evangelical minister .
These two nonbelieving , true believers from Madison , Wis. , seem to have more spirit than me and most other believers I know .
Last Christmas - I mean solstice - they put up a message in the Wisconsin Capitol Rotunda that said , “ Religion is but a myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds . ”
They do n’t just devote themselves to their nonreligion one hour of one day a week as many Christians do .
They and their eight staff members put in countless hours carrying out thankless tasks such as sending out letters to mayors of more than 1,000 cities and governors urging them not to take part in prayer day .
The work has borne fruit .
Four recent polls show that 82 percent to 88 percent of Americans claim to be Christian .
Yet the numerically insignificant FFRF ( 14,000 members ) has effectively put Christianity and all other religions in America on the defensive .
Anyone participating in prayer day will now have to justify it , and in so doing , acknowledge the atheists ’ legal challenge .
FFRF filed suit against the federal government two years ago , claiming prayer day violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution , which states that “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . ”
President Harry S. Truman signed the law in 1952 , requiring the president to issue an annual proclamation asking Americans to pray .
Many state and local officials do the same .
Turns out the new ruling cannot take effect until all appeals are exhausted , and the Obama administration has said it will appeal the case , which will likely kill the challenge .
But that wo n’t stop our atheist friends .
They now have a toehold in the promised land , and they do n’t intend to go back .
FFRP feels empowered by its higher profile brought on by the increased press coverage resulting from their temporary legal victory .
And they will continue to say that prayer day amounts to separation of church and state even after a legal defeat .
The atheists know that their real battle is in the court of public opinion , and that if one says something often enough - true or not - perception will often prevail .
So Ms. Gaynor makes the point that the law that established National Prayer Day “ is based on lies and bad history . ”
She contends that our Founding Fathers did not establish our Constitution based on Judeo - Christian beliefs , and that a prayer day was never part of our traditions .
It does n’t matter that in 1775 the Continental Congress called on Colonists to pray as tensions with England increased .
Nor does it matter that George Washington called for prayer while he was president , and that Abraham Lincoln established a “ Day of National Humiliation , Fasting and Prayer ” during the Civil War .
Nor will FFRF ever acknowledge that President Franklin D. Roosevelt led the nation in a radio prayer on D - Day , the invasion of Normandy during World War II .
The atheist group is on a “ holy ” mission , which I respect .
I understand what faith the size of a mustard seed can do .
This is n’t about turning the other cheek .
Jesus never said lie down and play dead when the other side gets out of hand .
Ask the money changers .

Bobro ’s magisterial bearing was undiminished by his inglorious chambers , which are roughly the size of the reinforced - glass cubes gas-station clerks inhabit in bad neighborhoods .
I asked him if he could explain how he reached judgments in witchcraft cases , and he cracked open his filthy , plastic - bound copy of the penal code .
Without consulting the table of contents , he found the section on PCS , or the “ practice of charlatanism and sorcery , ” and let me read along as he quoted from memory the section that dictates a decade or more in jail and a nominal fine for engaging in witchcraft .
In practice the penalties were significantly less , because the town had insufficient funds to maintain a jail .
But Bobro supported the law ’s preservation , perhaps because it gave him so much authority .
The classic study of witchcraft in Africa occurred among the Azande , who inhabit the eastern edge of the Central African Republic .
The anthropologist Edward E. Evans - Pritchard found that the Azande attributed a staggering range of misfortunes — infected toes , collapsed granary roofs , even bad weather — to meddling by witches .
Nothing happened by chance , only as an effect of spell - casting by a wicked interloper .
That sentiment remains widespread among Central Africans , who demand that the law reflect the influence of witchcraft as they understand it .
The standard legal concept of force majeure , under which a defendant cannot be held liable for an “ act of God , ” is thus rendered meaningless .
Foreign human - rights groups have noticed that many of the targets of prosecution are vulnerable types ( like Pygmies , or even children ) , and nongovernmental organizations that exist to encourage the rule of law are embarrassed that the “ law ” in this case resembles the penal code of 17th - century Salem .
In response , the Central African parliament is considering striking the clause outlawing witchcraft from its books .
The parliament is in Bangui , the capital , which sees far fewer witchcraft cases per capita .
Even so , most lawyers I consulted there favored keeping the law intact , although they admitted that it fits uneasily in a modern legal system .
“ The problem is that in a witchcraft case , there is usually no evidence , ” said Bartolomé Goroth , a lawyer in Bangui , who recently defended ( unsuccessfully ) a coven of Pygmies who had been accused of murder - by - witchcraft in Mbaiki .
Goroth said the trials generally ended with an admission of guilt by an accused witch in exchange for a modest sentence .
I asked how one determined guilt in cases where the alleged witches denied the charges .
“ The judge will look at them and see if they act like witches , ” Goroth said , specifying that “ acting like a witch ” entailed behaving “ strangely ” or “ nervously ” in court .
His principal advice to clients , he said , was to act normally and refrain from casting any spells in the courtroom .
Trucks are among the most popular vehicles in America , and your choice between the models available is dependent on your budget , brand and styling preferences , and towing and hauling requirements .
If , however , you ’re new to pickup truck ownership or you ’re an existing owner who is open to change , you might want to examine those models rated highest in quality according to the people who own them .

Well , this certainly explains a whole lot .
Both Apple and Microsoft have stated that the legality of Theora is highly debatable , and as it turns out , they knew more than we do – most likely courtesy of their close involvement with the MPEG - LA .
Responding to an email from Free Software Foundation Europe activist Hugo Roy , Steve Jobs has stated that a patent pool is being assembled to go after Theora .
Update : Monty Montgomery of Xiph ( Ogg and Theora ’s parent organisation ) has responded on Slashdot : “ If Jobs ’s email is genuine , this is a powerful public gaffe ( ‘ All video codecs are covered by patents ’ ) .
He ’d be confirming MPEG ’s assertion in plain language anyone can understand .
It would only strengthen the pushback against software patents and add to Apple ’s increasing PR mess .
Macbooks and iPads may be pretty sweet , but creative individuals do n’t really like to give their business to jackbooted thugs . ”
Hugo Roy published an open letter to Steve Jobs in response to the Apple CEO ’s letter regarding Adobe and Flash .
In it , he praises Jobs for his position on Flash and Apple ’s involvement with HTML5 .
He then goes on to remind Jobs that H264 is not an open standard .
“ May I remind you that H.264 is not an open standard ?
This video codec is covered by patents , and ‘ vendors and commercial users of products which make use of H.264/AVC are expected to pay patent licensing royalties for the patented technology ’ , ” Roy writes , “ This is why Mozilla Firefox and Opera have not adopted this video codec for their HTML5 implementation , and decided to chose Theora as a sustainable and open alternative . ”
Roy also sent the open letter to Steve Jobs ’ email address , and lo and behold , he received a reply .
The reply is genuine ( he published the email headers ) , and it does n’t bode well for the future of the Theora codec .
This is what Jobs had to say :
All video codecs are covered by patents .
A patent pool is being assembled to go after Theora and other “ open source ” codecs now .
Unfortunately , just because something is open source , it does n’t mean or guarantee that it does n’t infringe on others patents .
An open standard is different from being royalty free or open source .
The reply is a little vague about who is assembling this patent pool to go after Theora and other open source codecs , but seeing Apple ’s close involvement with the MPEG - LA , it seems most likely that ’s where it ’s all happening .
It ’s obvious that Microsoft will be involved as well .
I am quite shocked about this .
It seems that after a decade of empty threats , the MPEG - LA is finally planning on making a legal move against Theora .
Such a move will send a shockwave through the industry , and would open yet another front on the Apple - Google tug - of - war : Google , Mozilla , Opera , and Wikipedia are among some of the major names that implement Theora support and / or employ Theora .
A lot of pieces of the puzzle suddenly fall into place .
Both Apple and Microsoft ( as well as the MPEG - LA ) have expressed concerns over Theora ’s legality , but these concerns were always empty , and never backed up by any facts .
It now seems they knew more than we did .
It also explains why Google openly distanced itself from Theora ; their legal department is probably aware of what ’s coming their way .
It never made any real sense for Google to support H264 , since Google is not part of the MPEG - LA , and thus , has to follow the whims of its biggest competitors ( Apple and Microsoft ) .
It seems like the future of a truly open web now depends on Google opening up VP8 , hoping they did their homework and made it not infringe .
Google , please open up VP8 , and launch a HTML5 / VP8 YouTube version , which will work flawlessly on Chrome , Firefox , and Opera .
Serve Flash to every browser that does not implement it .
Harsh , but fair .
Force - feed Apple and Microsoft that Flash pie .
- video encodings still in process -

A former nurse is to stand trial in the US after being charged with two counts of aiding suicide over the internet .
But the case , which is one of the first of its kind , only came about because of the diligence and detective work of a woman in the UK .
William Melchert - Dinkel is alleged to have posed online as a female nurse
For more than a year and a half , Celia Blay , a 65 - year - old from a small town in Wiltshire , delved into the world of online chat rooms with suicide themes , on the trail of someone she believed was hiding their identity in order to establish friendships with vulnerable young people , eventually encouraging them to end their own lives .
That person , William Melchert - Dinkel , appeared in court on Tuesday in Minneapolis , US , charged with with two counts of aiding suicides .
The charges stem from the deaths of 32 - year - old Mark Drybrough , who took his own life in Birmingham , England , in 2005 , and 18 - year - old student Nadia Kajouji , who died in Ottawa , Canada , some three years later .
It is believed to be the first case of its kind in North America - and only one of a handful that have been brought across the globe .
Suicide pact
It was 2006 when Ms Blay received a message from a 17 - year - old from South America whom she had befriended online .
" Out of the blue , she told me she was in a suicide pact with a young woman she had met on the internet .
She told me she was going to take her own life in four days ' time .
Celia Blay tracked down Mr Melchert - Dinkel with the help of friends online " I tried to dissuade her but she said she did n't want to let the other girl down . "
Ms Blay 's friend , who was a regular user of online suicide - related groups , had been depressed for some time .
" I had given her the same advice you would give a depressed teenager , advising her to talk to friends , talk to a doctor , or a priest , " Ms Blay told the BBC News website .
She says she persuaded her friend to give her the name of the young woman she believed she had made a pact with .
The name - " Li Dao " - was then checked on private suicide - related groups and message boards by Ms Blay .
News of several other " pacts " spread across the message boards , and " very shortly about half a dozen people were comparing notes , " she says .
WORLDWIDE PROBLEM
In 2006 , Australia became the first country to criminalise such sites .
According to a report in 2009 : Legal Bans on Pro suicide websites , the decision was highly controversial .
" Concerns were expressed that the law cast the criminal net too widely ; inappropriately interferes with the autonomy of those who wish to die ; and has jurisdiction limitations with off - shore websites remaining largely immune , " the report stated .
In Australia , like most other countries , taking your own life is not illegal .
Luke Neal , one of the report 's authors , said that as far as he knew no prosecutions had yet been made .
At the end of last year , MPs in Canada overwhelmingly backed a motion put forward by MP Harold Albrecht to revise the criminal code legislating against aiding and abetting suicide , to reflect technological advances .
The first recorded case of two or more people using the web to form a suicide pact was in Japan in 2000 .
The country has introduced stricter monitoring of suicide websites .
Last year South Korea , which has had a spate of online suicide pacts , announced that it would ask internet portals to ban websites promoting suicide and improve tracking systems to delete wording encouraging people to kill themselves .
" It appears those people had been in apparent suicide pacts with the same person , and in some cases they had been scheduled for the same time , " says Ms Blay .
Details and language contained in some of the communication - and in some cases pictures - led Ms Blay to believe that " Li Dao " - who is now thought to have used other aliases , including " Cami " and " Falcon Girl " - was responsible for entering into pacts with no intention of carrying them out .
" I gathered about 20 messages and took them to my local police , " she says .
" But they said they could n't investigate because the sources were anonymous .
Eventually some did agree to reveal their identities , but still , she says , she got nowhere .
Finally , Ms Blay and a friend set up an " online sting " .
They established contact with the person they believed to be " Li Dao " .
Friends she had met online helped her track down IP and email addresses used by " Li Dao " , which eventually led to William Melchert - Dinkel , a husband and father in Minnesota .
While the charges - which each carry a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison - stem from two deaths , Mr Melchert - Dinkel estimates that he helped a number of other people commit suicide , according to papers filed with a court in Minnesota .
Those same papers say he " admitted to being an internet advisor in suicide methods " because of his background as a nurse , and that he later stopped because of " moral , ethical and legal issues " .
Minnesota 's law does not specifically address assisted suicides involving the internet , or suicides that occur out of state , and legal experts have pointed out that the case faces many challenges .
Dan Reidenberg , executive director of Minnesota 's Suicide Awareness Voices of Education , said the case was unprecedented and would focus on the challenging legal issues surrounding free speech and the internet .
" There is the issue of how suggestions and comments are interpreted .
Everyone has a right to say what they want to say .
The defence might argue that what another person does with this is up to them . "
Grey area Legal experts have also pointed out potential problems with jurisdiction : one death occurred in Canada , the other in the UK , while Mr Melchert - Dinkel is alleged to have offered advice in the borderless realms of the internet .
Many countries have laws against assisting suicide , but most of these pre-date the internet era .
" In most countries , the law is vague - you have to do a lot to prosecute , " says Paul Kelly of Papyrus , a charity in the UK that works to prevent young people taking their own lives .
" It is related to the whole question of freedom of speech .
The difficulty is how the promotion of suicide is defined - after all , there are books , plays and films that deal with the issue .
There are alternatives - medical help , therapies and more importantly the help of family and friends
Paul Kelly , Papyrus
" In the UK , for example , you need to prove that there is a direct connection between what someone was saying and a person 's death .
You also need to prove that there was an intention of the person discussing or promoting and someone acting . "
In 2001 , Mr Kelly 's son Simon took his own life after obtaining instructions from an internet suicide website .
According to Mr Kelly , the 18 - year - old had also been given the " psychological encouragement to go ahead " from a suicide chat room .
" There are positive sites people can access , " he says .
" Somebody feeling very distressed or suicidal , and who cannot immediately get hold of their family or friends , could seek help from such UK organisations as the Samaritans or Papyrus .
" There are alternatives - medical help , therapies and more importantly the help of family and friends .
There is not just one solution . "
He says that suicidal thoughts are very often " temporary " and that people do recover .
" If necessary people should seek professional help . "
There are no official figures for how many people have taken their own lives as a result of visiting online sites , but Mr Kelly says that Papyrus has tracked 39 such cases since 2001 .
Mr Kelly says he would like to see an independent body set up to deal with complaints about potential " life threatening sites " , and to be given the authority to block them if necessary .
" I believe Germany , France and Portugal have laws allowing such sites to be blacklisted , but I do n't know how effective they are , " he says .
A number of other countries have moved to try to limit the scope of such websites .
But , for Celia Blay , although she has nothing but praise for investigators in Minnesota , her long and tireless effort has led her to conclude that , generally : " Suicidal people have low priority in every country . "

Hamas police wielding clubs beat and pushed residents out of dozens of homes in the southern Gaza town of Rafah on Sunday before knocking the buildings down with bulldozers , residents said .
Gaza 's militant Hamas rulers said the homes were built illegally on government land .
Newly homeless residents were furious over Palestinians on bulldozers razing Palestinian homes .
More Law Enforcement Hamas burns recreational drugs , taxes cigarettes Associated Press Gaza rulers burn nearly 2 million painkillers many residents of Strip take in search of relief from territory 's hardship Hamas burns recreational drugs , taxes cigarettes
For years , Palestinians have criticized Israel for destroying houses , mostly because they were built without permits issued by the military .
Now , Rafah residents complained , their own government , run by the Islamic militant Hamas that seized power in Gaza in July 2007 , has done the same .
" They promised reform and change – instead they 've destroyed our homes , " shouted Miasar Gan , a 54 - year - old woman .
Gan said she and her husband had nowhere else to go .
" I found my mattress , and that 's where I 'll be sitting , " she said , standing next to the concrete chunks – all that was left of her house .
Her neighbor , Nazira Abu Jara , 56 , said policewomen wearing face veils typical of conservative Muslim women beat her with clubs until she fled her house with her husband and two children .
" Neighbors help us get by with charity .
We can't afford to build again , " Abu Jara said .
Others picked through rubble to retrieve dusty clothing and mangled furniture .
Residents said between 30 and 40 homes were torn down , ranging from concrete structures to tin shacks .
They did not know how many people were affected .
Hamas officials did not allow reporters into the area until the demolition was over .
Residents said more demolitions in the area were expected Monday .
Even if they are allowed to rebuild , Israel does not allow most building materials into the territory it has blockaded since Hamas seized power .
The newly homeless residents are unlikely to be able to afford the steep black market prices for concrete , steel and wood .
Some of the families cannot afford rent .
Rafah 's mayor , Issa Nashar , promised alternative housing .
Gaza 's housing minister Yousef al - Mansi said he had no information about such housing .
LOS ANGELES —
In a show of solidarity , many of the film industry ’s major players , and some sympathetic lawmakers , have aligned in an 11th - hour push to block new financial instruments that would allow traders to swap contracts tied to box - office results .
A coalition led by the Motion Picture Association of America was expected to file by Thursday comments that would urge the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to reject a request by Veriana Networks to create a market for film futures contracts .
Some of Hollywood ’s largest labor unions and professional organizations will back the M.P.A.A. ’s push .
Among those who spent the week coordinating their objections were the Directors Guild of America , the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and the Independent Film and Television Alliance .
The M.P.A.A. represents the major film studios , including 20th Century Fox , Paramount Pictures , Sony Pictures Entertainment , Universal Studios , Walt Disney Studios and Warner Brothers .
The expected comments will address the first of four approvals that would allow Veriana Networks and a separate exchange run by Cantor Fitzgerald to begin making markets in the contracts .
Supreme Court Rules ' Sexually Dangerous ' Can Be Held Longer Than Sentences Supreme Court finds it acceptable to detain some sex offenders indefinitely .
WASHINGTON , May 17 , 2010  -- A 7 - to - 2 majority of the Supreme Court ruled today that Congress has the authority to pass a law allowing federal prisoners who have been deemed " sexually dangerous " to be held beyond the date of their original sentence .
The law , a provision of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act , was passed in 2006 .
A lower court had ruled that Congress overstepped its boundaries in passing the law .
But Justice Stephen Breyer , writing for the majority , found that the Constitution grants Congress the authority to enact the law .
" The statute is a necessary and proper means of exercising the federal authority that permits Congress to create federal criminal laws , to punish their violation , to imprison violators , to provide appropriately for those imprisoned , and to maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of others , " he wrote .
Take the Quiz : How Well Do You Know the Supreme Court Justices ?
The decision stemmed from the case of Graydon Comstock , who found that days from finishing his sentence for possession of child pornography , the attorney general had made a determination that he must stay in jail because he had been certified by the government as a " sexually dangerous person . "
Comstock and five other respondents argued the designation was unconstitutional because Congress had exceeded its powers in passing the law .
The law allows confinement in a federal facility until either the person 's mental condition improves to the point where he is no longer dangerous , or the state assumes responsibility for his care and treatment .
Breyer wrote , " Congress routinely exercises its authority to enact criminal laws in furtherance of , for example , its enumerated powers to regulate interstate and foreign commerce , to enforce civil rights , to spend funds for the general welfare , to establish federal courts , to establish post office , to regulate bankruptcy , to regulate naturalization and so forth . "
At oral arguments , Solicitor General Elena Kagan told the court that the law has only been applied to a small fraction of federal prisoners .
One - hundred - five individuals have been subject to the law out of more than 188,000 federal inmates .
Justice Thomas : Let States , Not Feds , Handle Dangerous Prisoners
Breyer , citing the government 's argument , said the law is a " reasonably adapted and narrowly tailored means of pursuing the government 's legitimate interest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its prison system . "
In dissent , Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that states have the power to take charge of a federal prisoner released within their jurisdiction .
" The assumption " Thomas wrote , " that a state knowingly would fail to exercise that authority is , in my view , implausible . "
Thomas criticized the majority for assuming that without the law , the state would take no action when informed by the Bureau of Prisons that a sexually dangerous federal prisoner was about to be released within the state 's jurisdiction .
" In light of the plethora of state laws enacted in recent decades to protect communities from sex offenders , " he wrote , " the likelihood of such an occurrence seems quite remote . "
Ten - year old Afghan youth Agha Gul poses for a portrait at the end of his duty around a bazaar area just outside a US Marines combat outpost , in Marjah , Helmand province , southern Afghanistan , on April 11 , 2010 .
Since the end of US Marines - led biggest offensive against the Taliban in more than nine years of war , some 50 village children between the ages of three and twelve have been taking part in a US Marines development program called The Commander 's Emergency Program Response ( CERP ) , which was set up to provide funds for necessary repairs resulting from combat activity .
The program conducts large - scale civic cleaning that employs as many local inhabitants as possible .
Children are designated to dig holes where rubbish which they have picked up is burned and also to take part in the building and repair of walls .
US Marines pay a thousand Afghanis ( USD 5 ) per child for a working week of four eight hour days .
Many of the families of those children employed have been threatened by Taliban insurgents as Marjah has been without school since early 80's .

A few weeks ago I ran into one of my son's oldest friends .
He had attended an Ivy League school , studying drama and music , and was now back living at home .
He is a smart , talented , enterprising young man and I have always liked him , in part because he engages with adults in a way many young men do not .
( For example , he actually makes eye contact . )
I asked him if he had found a job yet and he replied , a bit sheepishly , " Not exactly . "
He then explained that he was working as an intern at a street fair on the Lower East Side of New York City .

Officials acknowledge that officers will still be able to grab a bite on the beat , easily defeating the department ’s dietary guidelines .
“ We have to accept that the culture of snacking is present in most of the population , and the police also have this habit , ” Dr. Peniche said .
But the department still hopes to inculcate better eating habits in the police force .
Mexicans as a whole have rapidly expanding waistlines .
The Health Department said in a report released this year that obesity levels in Mexico were second in the world only to those in the United States , and the problem is especially acute among the young .
And it is not just large portions that are the problem .
Mexicans do not exercise enough , officials say , and a recent government health study found that Mexicans consumed almost twice the amount of salt recommended by the World Health Organization , leading to elevated rates of hypertension , heart disease and kidney failure along with obesity .
Many Mexico
City officers are going along with the healthier menus , and initial reports are that waistlines are shrinking .
But there is also plenty of cheating as officers admit to supplementing their official fare with more filling food from the street  overflowing tacos , tortas , quesadillas and huaraches , all washed down with sugary sodas .
“ It ’s good to lose weight , ” acknowledged Crescencio Aguilar , 48 , an 18 - year veteran of the transit police who weighs just over 200 pounds , has a protruding abdomen and was interviewed near a rather aromatic stand selling beef tacos and quesadillas .
“ But the truth is , the way I am , I ’ve been chubby since I was a boy , and it ’s going to be difficult to drop down . ”

For years , craft brewers have been pushing beer as a dinner - table alternative to wine .
So it 's worth asking : how 's that going for you ?
I 'm sure that in places like Portland and Denver , it 's common for people to bring a four - pack of your favorite microbrew to a dinner party .
But here on the East Coast , I 've yet to see it .
At least in the circles I travel in , great beer is respected , but it has yet to knock over wine as the drink of choice with a fine meal .
I doubt I 'm alone , if only because there are still some pretty high barriers to beer 's tabletop ascendancy .
Beer may want to be taken seriously , but its marketing often says otherwise .
Conversely , people may want to take beer seriously , but they do n't know how .
And beer is consumed in quantities that make it tough to split a 22 - ounce bottle five ways .
Goose Island , the grandfather of Chicagoland craft breweries , believes it has the solution .
For much of its life it has focused on making predictably good if not always great beers , in crowd - pleasing styles like IPA , nut brown ale , and English bitter .
But over the last few years , Goose Island has found religion , and alongside its old standbys , has started to churn out edgier , higher - end beers .
Its Bourbon County Stout , one of my favorite domestic brews , is a 13 percent ABV bomb with a dark rainbow of malt , chocolate , and raspberry flavors ; it 's like drinking liquefied ( and heavily spiked ) Black Forest cake .
Like good wine , BCS is best stored for at least six months , to let the alcohol mellow a bit .
( Along with the brewery 's regular - production BCS , this year it 's putting out a few limited - release expressions , including coffee , vanilla bean , and " rare , " aged in Pappy Van Winkle bourbon barrels . )

As a single guy who 's gotten out there a fair amount , I 've learned how to play the game .
The way I see it , if someone 's interested , great .
If not , no skin off my nose .
Take last night : I got the number of this hot young thing at a bar and decided to give her a call .
And now that I 've left my painfully uncomfortable six - minute - long voice message on her cell , I 'm not going to waste my time obsessing over my next move .
The ball 's in her court .

If she wants to make the next move and return my panicked and barely coherent phone message , that 's fine by me .
If not , she can take a hike .
See , I 've laid the groundwork , and if I do say so myself , it was pretty fucking painful : I stared blankly at my phone for a few hours ; I dialed the number and said hello but in a voice so low that I had to clear my throat and repeat it several times ; I spent a full minute awkwardly trying to explain that I was the guy drinking vodka tonics , but then , realizing that other people she was talking to were drinking gin and tonics , which look pretty similar , I said that maybe she 'd remember me as the one wearing a bomber jacket and singing along to most of the songs that came on the jukebox ; after that , I sealed the deal by stuttering my own name a half dozen times before spitting out " Vince . "

Or did I say Victor ?
Look , I could be a total loser and stay up all night waiting for her to get back to me , and I almost certainly will do that .
But , why bother ?
If she calls , she calls .
I put my sweaty , desperate cards on the table , and now it 's on her .
And unless I 'm mistaken — which I usually am — as soon as she hears the sound of my trembling voice she 'll be digging through her purse for the Arby 's receipt that I frantically scribbled my name and number on .

What can I say ?
I guess my voice just has that effect on some women .
And when she does call , I am not going to freak out like it 's the first time a woman 's ever called me or something .
In fact , I may just let it ring and keep her on ice for a while , assuming I do n't panic first and start screaming into the receiver the second I hear the phone ring .
Advertisement
Because I 'm the kind of player who likes to come on too strong .
Just a nice , pitiful , borderline disturbing phone message , and I 'm on with my life .
It 's not like I invited her and her sister to come have tacos with my parents and me tomorrow night or anything .
At least , I 'm pretty sure I did n't .
To be honest , the last few minutes of the message were kind of a blur .
All I 'm saying is , if she wants to get in touch with me , she knows how to reach me .
After all , when I left the voicemail , I helpfully supplied her with my cell phone number , my home number , my work number , both my e-mail addresses , and my old pager number .
I even repeated the info twice so she could find a pen and paper and write it all down .
I just hope that she does n't communicate by fax machine .
If she does , well , then , tough cookies , because I do n't have one .
Advertisement
That 's just how I roll .
Hey , if she does n't want to come over to my tiny , filthy apartment for a brief round of underwhelming , surprisingly messy sex , then that 's her loss .
Really , it 's cool .
I got a whole line of girls ready to politely exchange numbers with me as I stare at my feet , too petrified to make eye contact .
It 's not like I 'm hard up for females or anything , someone whose breasts I can clumsily fumble over until , in disgust and disappointment , she makes up an excuse to leave .
Advertisement
Yes , sir , I 'll just be here hanging out , playing it cool , and checking my voicemail messages every 45 seconds or so .
No big deal .
No big deal whatsoever .
Unless you think something went wrong with her voicemail and she could n't retrieve my message .
Could that have happened ?
Huh .
You know what ?
Maybe I should call her back real quick .
Just in case .
Yeah .
Just in case .

Blinking neurons give thoughts away
Max Planck scientists use a genetic light source to measure brain signals
Electrical currents are invisible to the naked eye - at least they are when they flow through metal cables .
In nerve cells , however , scientists are able to make electrical signals visible .
Working with fellow experts from Switzerland and Japan , scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg successfully used a specialized fluorescent protein to visualize electrical activity in neurons of living mice .
In a milestone study , scientists are able to apply the method to watch activity in nerve cells during animal behaviour .

Neurons communicate with one another via so - called action potentials .
During an action potential , voltage - gated calcium channels are opened resulting in rapid calcium ion influx .
Because of this tight coupling , fluorescent calcium indicator proteins can visualize action potentials .
These proteins have two fluorescent subunits , one of which radiates yellow light and the other blue .
When the proteins bind calcium , the proportion of yellow to blue light changes .
Colour variation from blue light towards yellow thus reports different calcium levels - which is why the protein has been dubbed a " cameleon " .
Measuring action potentials optically
With the cameleon protein YC3.60 , a fairly new variant , the scientists succeeded in recording the reaction of nerve cells to sensory stimuli in the intact brain of mice : every time the whiskers were deflected by a puff of air , there was a change of colour in the cameleon proteins in the nerve cells of the sensory areas of the cortex .
It could therefore be deduced that the affected cells had reacted to the stimulus with action potentials .
" The cameleon protein YC3.60 gives us the ability to measure action potentials not only in brain slices , but also in the intact brain .
The molecule reacts quickly and sensitively and also captures changes in calcium concentrations occurring in rapid sequence , " explains Mazahir Hasan from the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research .
The scientists were able to investigate activity in single cells as well as in whole groups of nerve cells .
" YC3.60 has therefore proven to be a suitable tool for studying nerve tissue at different levels : on the one hand , we can monitor the fluctuation of calcium to infer action potentials within nerve cells .
And what is even more advantageous , we can simultaneously measure the activity of neural networks or entire brain regions , " says Mazahir Hasan .
Consequently , the next step the scientists want to do is to selectively introduce cameleon proteins into a specific cortical layer or into different types of nerve cells .
" Then we may be in a position to understand how different nerve cells in brain circuits generate complex behaviours , " states Mazahir Hasan hopefully .
Measuring without electrodes
Cameleon proteins could therefore revolutionize the study of electrical activity in the brain .
To date , the only way scientists could do this is by inserting electrodes into the nerve tissue or the cells .
This electrode technique is blind to cell identity and it damages the tissue .
By contrast , the cameleon protein ’s colour changes can be observed in a much less invasive procedure using glass fibres as light conductors or with the help of modern fluorescence microscopes - known as two - photon laser - scanning microscopes .
Moreover , cameleon proteins can be formed by cells themselves provided a corresponding section of DNA has been inserted into the genome in advance .
In the experiments conducted by the scientists , viruses served as the vehicle for smuggling the genetic information for the cameleon proteins into the nerve cells .
In two earlier studies , an international team of scientists headed by Mazahir Hasan were the first to demonstrate that similar genetic probes can successfully detect natural sensation ( such as smell and touch ) in the mammalian brain in the form of unique activity patterns ( Hasan et al. , 2004 ) and , more importantly , with single - cell , single - action - potential resolution ( Wallace et al. , 2008 ) .
In the current study , they have reached yet another major milestone as they demonstrate that the cameleon YC3.60 can be used to record activity from a large number of nerve cells during behaviour in freely moving mice .
Additionally , it is well suited for recording activity from the same nerve cells in the same animals over a long time period and should help scientists to understand how network activity patterns form to code for different experiences and animal behaviour .
These new advances , using light to study the brain , provide us with a unique opportunity to investigate how memories are formed and lost and , furthermore , when and where nerve cell activity patterns become altered as in the case of aging and also in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer ’s disease , Parkinson ’s disease and schizophrenia .
WASHINGTON — The Obama administration has approved flight operations by an unmanned aerial vehicle to patrol a section of the U.S. - Mexico border between the El Paso region and Arizona .
Rep. Henry Cuellar , D - Laredo , and Rep. Michael McCaul , R- Austin , said the Federal Aviation Administration had approved a certification of authorization to permit the flights beginning June 1 .
Cuellar , who has been pushing for the operations , is chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over border issues .
“ This is the first of two steps in getting unmanned aircraft vehicles approved to patrol the entire Texas - Mexico border , ” he said .
“ This is very good news for Texas as we seek to provide additional security measures along the Rio Grande in light of escalated border violence . ”
McCaul said the use of drones is “ a major step forward in securing our border with Mexico , ” adding they will “ allow us to patrol areas that are difficult to access on the ground in the Big Bend region . ”
Sen . Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Texas , called the decision “ an important step forward , ” but said much remains to be done .
McCaul , Cuellar and Sen. John Cornyn , R - Texas , vowed to keep the heat on .
“ The American people are terribly upset , scared , and angry with the federal government , and they do n’t understand why we are n’t doing more . ”
Cornyn said .
“ I will continue pressing the FAA to allow these Predator patrols to expand to the rest of the Texas border , and pursue additional ways to enhance our border security . ”
The cancer vaccine is not a " cure " for prostate cancer A " vaccine " which harnesses the body 's own immune system to fight prostate cancer has been approved for use by US drug regulators .
Provenge - which is designed to be used in men with advanced disease - is the first of its kind to be accepted by the Food and Drug Administration .
Each dose has to be individually tailored and it is an expensive treatment at $ 93,000 per patient .
It will add to , rather than replace , existing treatments , said experts .
There are still questions to answer , even if the treatment fulfils its early promise
John Neate , The Prostate Cancer Charity Doctors have been working on therapies that prompt the immune system to fight tumours for decades .
Potential success stories include an experimental vaccine for melanoma which is in the late stages of development .
This latest therapy is made by collecting special blood cells from each patient that help the immune system recognise cancer as a threat .
These are then mixed with a protein found on most prostate cancer cells and a substance which kick - starts the immune response .
Advanced disease
The drug is not a " cure " but is used in advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other sites in the body and is no longer responding to standard hormone treatment .
Clinical trials showed that the treatment extended the lives of patients by four months .
This compares with an average of three months with chemotherapy .
Dr Phil Kantoff , an oncologist at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute who helped run the studies of Provenge said : " The big news here is that this is the first immunotherapy to win approval , and I suspect within five to ten years immunotherapies will be a big part of cancer therapy in general . "
Prostate cancer accounts for about 12 % of male deaths from cancer in the UK and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men .
In older men aged 85 and over , the disease is the most common cause of all deaths from cancer .
John Neate , chief executive of The Prostate Cancer Charity , said : " The news that this type of immunotherapy may offer additional survival benefit is promising . "
But he added : " There are still questions to answer , even if the treatment fulfils its early promise .
" At present , we believe there are currently no laboratories in Europe equipped to undertake this treatment .
" Furthermore , this treatment is not currently approved in the UK and it will still be some years before doctors know enough about its long term effectiveness and side effects to be confident about its potential place in the armoury against advanced prostate cancer . "
Dr Chris Parker , Cancer Research UK 's prostate cancer expert said : " We hope this approval will open new avenues of research into using a patient 's own immune system to treat cancer . "

Game industry analyst and monkey juggler Michael Pachter does not think that Ubisoft 's DRM is a bad thing .
In fact , as a lawyer he believes it is Ubisoft 's right to protect its games in any way the publisher sees fit .
" I ’m an old guy , " he says .
" I ’m ethical and I ’m a lawyer by trade .
I feel if you steal a copy of a game by copying a friend ’s file then it ’s like going into the shop and stealing a copy .
That ’s how I feel about it .
Please feel free to disagree .
When a company sells you a game they have no problem if you resell it and someone else buys it and they have no problem if you give it away .
If you make copies , though , it ’s against the law .
The guys that ran bittorrent are in jail : it is illegal . "
First of all , publishers have a HUGE problem with you reselling a game or giving it away , as their long history of bitching about used sales demonstrates .
But let 's continue with what Pachter has to say :
" I think anything a publisher does to make sure you do n’t rip off their games if their right , and I think that people who steal should be in jail .
I welcome the flamer comments on this one ; if you think that ’s right good for you ; we have no interest in your business since you do n’t pay for stuff anyway . "
Pachter is doing exactly what publishers have done in this situation -- hide behind " rights " in order to justify punitive measures against people who legally purchase videogames .
The people stung by Ubisoft's DRM the most are the people who dropped fifty bucks on a game that demands a persistent Internet connection and craps out when one is n't available , or can't access the publisher 's shitty servers .
Pachter said it himself , that pirates " do n't pay for stuff anyway . "
If they 're not gonna buy Ubisoft 's games , then DRM only affects real consumers .
And I think real consumers have a right to be upset and offended by that .
The biggest publishers are the most butthurt , whiny , greedy , grasping companies in town .
They hate used sales .
They hate the idea of gamers sharing discs with friends .
They hate freebies and discounts and they hate not having every last penny flowing their way .
Do n't ever ask decent people to feel sorry for them .
Pachter : “ Using DRM is Ubisoft ’s right ” [ VG247 ]

IT IS 15 years since Moisés Naím coined the memorable phrase “ corruption eruption ” .
But there is no sign of the eruption dying down .
Indeed , there is so much molten lava and sulphurous ash around that some of the world 's biggest companies have been covered in it .
Siemens and Daimler have recently been forced to pay gargantuan fines .
BHP Billiton , a giant mining company , has admitted that it may have been involved in bribery .
America 's Department of Justice is investigating some 150 companies , targeting oil and drugs firms in particular .
The ethical case against corruption is too obvious to need spelling out .
But many companies still believe that , in this respect at least , there is a regrettable tension between the dictates of ethics and the logic of business .
Bribery is the price that you must pay to enter some of the world 's most difficult markets ( the “ when in Rome ” argument ) .
Bribery can also speed up the otherwise glacial pace of bureaucracy ( the “ efficient grease ” hypothesis ) .
And why not ?
The chances of being caught are small while the rewards for bending the rules can be big and immediate .
When in Rome , behave like a Swede
But do you really have to behave like a Roman to thrive in Rome ?
Philip Nichols , of the Wharton School , points out that plenty of Western firms have prospered in emerging markets without getting their hands dirty , including Reebok , Google and Novo Nordisk .
IKEA has gone to great lengths to fight corruption in Russia , including threatening to halt its expansion in the country , firing managers who pay bribes and buying generators to get around grasping officials holding up grid connections .
What is more , Mr Nichols argues , it is misguided to dismiss entire countries as corrupt .
Even the greasiest - palmed places are in fact ambivalent about corruption : they invariably have laws against it and frequently produce politicians who campaign against it .
Multinationals should help bolster the rules of the game rather than pandering to the most unscrupulous players .
And is “ grease ” really all that efficient ?
In a paper published by the World Bank , Daniel Kaufmann and Shang - Jin Wei subjected the “ efficient grease ” hypothesis to careful scrutiny .
They found that companies that pay bribes actually end up spending more time negotiating with bureaucrats .
The prospect of a pay - off gives officials an incentive to haggle over regulations .
The paper also found that borrowing is more expensive for corrupt companies , probably because of the regulatory flux .
The hidden costs of corruption are almost always much higher than companies imagine .
Corruption inevitably begets ever more corruption : bribe - takers keep returning to the trough and bribe - givers open themselves up to blackmail .
Corruption also exacts a high psychological cost on those who engage in it .
Mr Nichols says that corrupt business people habitually compare their habit to having an affair : no sooner have you given in to temptation than you are trapped in a world of secrecy and guilt .
On the other hand , the benefits of rectitude can be striking .
Texaco , an oil giant now subsumed by Chevron , had such an incorruptible reputation that African border guards were said to wave its jeeps through without engaging in the ritual shakedown .
Moreover , the likelihood of being caught is dramatically higher than it was a few years ago .
The internet has handed much more power to whistle - blowers .
NGOs keep a constant watch on big firms .
Every year Transparency International publishes its Corruption Perceptions Index , its Bribe Payers Index and its Global Corruption Barometer .
The likelihood of prosecution is also growing .
The Obama administration has revamped a piece of post - Watergate legislation — the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ( FCPA ) — and is using it to pursue corporate malefactors the world over .
The Department of Justice is pursuing far more cases than it ever has before : 150 today compared with just eight in 2001 .
And it is subjecting miscreants to much rougher treatment .
Recent legislation has made senior managers personally liable for corruption on their watch .
They risk a spell in prison as well as huge fines .
The vagueness of the legislation means that the authorities may prosecute for lavish entertainment as well as more blatant bribes .
America is no longer a lone ranger .
Thirty - eight countries have now signed up to the OECD 's 1997 anti-corruption convention , leading to a spate of cross - border prosecutions .
In February Britain 's BAE Systems , a giant arms company , was fined $ 400 m as a result of a joint British and American investigation .
Since then a more ferocious Bribery Act has come into force in Britain .
On April 1st Daimler was fined $ 185 m as a result of a joint American and German investigation which examined the firm 's behaviour in 22 countries .
Companies caught between these two mighty forces — the corruption and anti-corruption eruptions — need to start taking the problem seriously .
A Transparency International study of 500 prominent firms revealed that the average company only scored 17 out of a possible 50 points on “ anti-corruption practices ” ( Belgium was by far the worst performing European country ) .
Companies need to develop explicit codes of conduct on corruption , train their staff to handle demands for pay - offs and back them up when they refuse them .
Clubbing together and campaigning for reform can also help .
Businesses played a leading role in Poland 's Clean Hands movement , for example , and a group of upright Panamanian firms have formed an anti-corruption group .
This may all sound a bit airy - fairy given that so many companies are struggling just to survive the recession .
But there is nothing airy - fairy about the $ 1.6 billion in fines that Siemens has paid to the American and German governments .
And there is nothing airy - fairy about a spell in prison .
The phrase “ doing well by doing good ” is one of the most irritating parts of the CSR mantra .
But when it comes to corruption , it might just fit the bill .
( AP ) -- Radioactive water that leaked from the nation 's oldest nuclear power plant has now reached a major underground aquifer that supplies drinking water to much of southern New Jersey , the state 's environmental chief said Friday .
The state Department of Environmental Protection has ordered the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station to halt the spread of contaminated water underground , even as it said there was no imminent threat to drinking water supplies .
The department launched a new investigation Friday into the April 2009 spill and said the actions of plant owner Exelon Corp. have not been sufficient to contain water contaminated with tritium .
Tritium is found naturally in tiny amounts and is a product of nuclear fission .
It has been linked to cancer if ingested , inhaled or absorbed through the skin in large amounts .
" There is a problem here , " said environmental Commissioner Bob Martin .
" I am worried about the continuing spread of the tritium into the groundwater and its gradual moving toward wells in the area .
This is not something that can wait .
That would be unacceptable . "
The tritium leaked from underground pipes at the plant on April 9 , 2009 , and has been slowly spreading underground at 1 to 3 feet a day .
At the current rate , it would be 14 or 15 years before the tainted water reaches the nearest private or commercial drinking water wells about two miles away .
But the mere fact that the radioactive water - at concentrations 50 times higher than those allowed by law - has reached southern New Jersey 's main source of drinking water calls for urgent action , Martin said .
He ordered the Chicago - based company to install new monitoring wells to better measure the extent of the contamination , and to come up with a plan to keep it from ever reaching a well .
The contamination is not a new issue , plant spokesman David Benson said , questioning the need for Martin 's order .
" We have monitoring wells on site , and the tritium concentration is down steadily , sometimes by as much as 90 percent , " he said .
" We are drilling more wells , and we will work closely with the state .
We have been all along . "
Should the plant fail to stem the spread of the contaminated water , the state will do it and bill the company for three times the cost as a penalty , the environmental department said .
Department spokesman Lawrence Ragonese said there are several potential ways to address the contamination , including pumping tainted water out of the ground , or injecting a different part of the aquifer with water to force the plume of contaminated water backward and away from wells .
No option has yet been decided upon .
The radioactive water leaks were found just days after the plant got a new 20 - year license in 2009 that environmentalists had bitterly fought for four years .
Those problems followed corrosion that left the reactor 's crucial safety liner rusted and thinned .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Exelon insist Oyster Creek can operate safely until it is 60 years old .
But environmental groups disagree .
" The bad news is Exelon 's Oyster Creek plant ... has now become a major threat to South Jersey 's drinking water , " said David Pringle of the New Jersey Environmental Federation .
" The good news is NJDEP Commissioner Martin is taking aggressive action to safeguard our water and hold Exelon accountable for this leaky 40 year old plant . "
Julia LaMense of the Eastern Environmental Law Clinic hailed the state 's action and condemned the NRC " for letting it come to this . "
" It 's a sad day when the ' wait and see ' approach taken in response to yet another ' trust us ' from Exelon results in exactly what we feared - contamination of one of the most significant aquifers in the region , " she said .
Oyster Creek went online Dec. 1 , 1969 , the same day as the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Generating Station near Oswego , N.Y .
But Oyster Creek 's original license was granted first , technically making it the oldest of the nation 's 104 commercial nuclear reactors that are still operating .
Located about 60 miles east of Philadelphia and 75 miles south of New York City , Oyster Creek generates 636 megawatts of electricity , enough to power 600,000 homes a year , and provides 9 percent of New Jersey 's electricity .

There are now three ways to play these mazes .
The first is a modification of Toby Nelsons original Java applet , which you can play on the Theseus page of this site .
The applet has three training levels to help explain the mazes , then seven fairly tricky levels .
It should take you about a week to get through those seven levels , and they provide a good introduction to the game .
Second , there is the Kristanix download .
This has 87 large - screen levels for computers .
Its price is $ 9.95 , but you can download the entire game for free , then play it for a while before you decide whether to buy it .
Third , there is the version for the iPhone and the iPod Touch .
It has the same 87 levels and only costs $ 3.99 .
There is also a free version , Theseus Lite , that has a sampling of levels from the full version .
The Theseus page has more about the three ways of playing these mazes .
It also has a long history of the mazes , which goes back to my original print version in 1990 .
There is also a discussion of Toby Nelsons layout - generating program , and there is an amusing updating of the Theseus myth .
Israel is expected to unveil plans this week to build a nuclear power plant , reports say .
They say an announcement will be made by Israeli Infrastructure Minister Uzi Landau at an energy forum in Paris .
Israel is facing a crisis over electricity supplies , but environmental objections have blocked efforts to build a new coal - fired plant .
Israel has two nuclear reactors , including the Dimona facility which is said to have produced nuclear weapons .
The secret reactor is located in the south of the country .
Israel neither confirms nor denies having nuclear weapons under its policy of " ambiguity " .
The other facility is a research reactor near Tel Aviv , which is open to international inspections .
Israel is not a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) which is designed to curb the spread of nuclear technologies with bomb - making potential .
' Joint project '
Mr Landau is expected to tell the conference in Paris that Israel is considering building a nuclear power plant , reports say .
He has reportedly discussed the possibility of co-operating in the project with French Energy Minister Jean - Louis Borloo , together with neighbouring Jordan .
France is one of the world leaders in electricity production from nuclear power .
In the 1950s , Paris helped Israel to build the Dimona facility .

It ’s time to put another console myth to rest — that consoles are boring to look at .
Just to emphasize , this is not Xorg :
That is screen with the vertical split patch running in fbterm , which can display wallpaper borrowed from a framebuffer image viewer .
No X , no tiling window managers , no fancy kernel recompilation .
All that in a measly 27 Mb or less , puttering along at 300 Mhz and 1024×768 .
I ’ve mentioned fbterm in the past , as a way to add a few other oddball features to your text - only experience — like turning the entire display on its side .
As I understand it , it ’s really just a terminal emulator that pushes itself up against the framebuffer , in the same way xterm or urxvt or any of emulator of your choice pushes itself up against the X server display .
It just does n’t have any window borders .
But that does mean you ’ll want to get the best possible screen dimensions you can , and that could require you to make sure the proper dimensions are set when you boot the machine .
For a refresher on that , take a look at this chart , or better yet , look over Ali Gunduz ’s short tutorial on finding unusual framebuffer codes .
And remember to pick the highest color depth your system can do , or your wallpaper will appear psychedelic .
If it is n’t already .
After that , the fbterm man pages show a simple script that pipes a image through fbv , which fbterm snaps and then uses as an underlay ( is that a word ? ) for its terminal session .
Sort of the same way aterm or other terminal emulators allow you to apply a particular backdrop to their work areas .
I suppose if you wanted you could use fim or fbi or any other framebuffer viewer , but I have n’t tried it .
Here ’s the script , in case you just want to cut - and - paste .
#!/bin/bash # fbterm - bi : a wrapper script to enable background image with fbterm # usage : fbterm - bi / path / to / image fbterm - options echo - ne " \e [ ? 25l " # hide cursor fbv - ciuker " $ 1 " << EOF q EOF shift export FBTERM_BACKGROUND_IMAGE=1 exec fbterm " $ @ "
( Double - check that against man fbterm , because WordPress.com enjoys eating code , even if it ’s nested in sourcecode tags . 🙄 )
fbterm will need fontconfig , libjpeg , libungif , libtiff and a few other packages that you probably do n’t usually have installed on a console - only system , but the results are worth it .
You can feed it almost any font you like in any size you like , which means you now have the luxury of moving away from the traditional console fonts and picking up more exotic ones .
You can set the foreground and background colors either in the script or as fbterm is running , to make text easier to read against your image .
What you see in the screenshot above was actually converted to grayscale in Gimp then shaded considerably , so the text colors would be more visible .
What you do with your wallpaper is your business though .
A couple of downsides — I ’ve noticed that font displays between standard framebuffer - based consoles and fbterm ’s emulation seem a little skewed ; for an example , there ought to be grids and borders drawn in a lot of the applications you see above .
Not that it ’s a huge deal , and I probably can fix that with a little tinkering , but I should mention it .
I should also mention that in Arch , fbterm commandeers the entire framebuffer and holds it hostage until the session is complete .
Pressing CTRL+ALT +F2 and so forth do n’t have much effect so long as fbterm has your attention .
The upside of that is fbterm ’s ability to run multiple window instances , so what you lose in a couple of extra tty ’s you gain back in an equal ( if not greater ) number of simultaneous emulator sessions .
Edit :
This is not true ; actually , it seems I have four or five busted F - keys . 😦
Additionally , you might get weird behavior from things like mplayer , which are used to painting over the framebuffer too , and the two things might have a little argument if you run them at the same time .
Or they might play well together .
It depends .
Personally I plan on using this a lot more , just because it makes the screen a lot more attractive and because I like the idea of flaunting this for the GUI junkies and Xorg - addicts .
At 300 Mhz with less than 30 Mb in use , I get the same degree of function as a computer 10 times as fast and 30 times as much memory .
And now I can get the same degree of pretty , too . 😈
CELERY has been labelled " vegetable Viagra " after research shows it increases the pheromone levels in men's sweat , making them more attractive to women .
Judy Gaman , Dr Walter Gaman and Dr Mark Anderson , authors of the new book Stay Young : Ten Proven Steps to Ultimate Health , said celery contains androstenone - a naturally occurring steroid - and upping your concentration of it should increase pheromone secretion .
They said the effects of eating it are immediate , but warned men not to go overboard , men 's lifestyle website asylum.com reported today .
" We recommend that a guy work out , have a nice warm shower , chomp on a few sticks of celery , brush his teeth and then head out the door smelling good , " said Dr Gaman .
Another reason why men should be keen to eat their vegetables is that celery also increases sex drive and ups the amount of ejaculatory fluids , making climax stronger .

What 's a lexer ?
A lexer is a string - eating state machine that uses regular expressions to define transitions from one state to another .
Lexers appear most frequently as the very first phase of a compiler , where they 're used to " tokenize " the input .
They ought to appear more frequently as protocol - parsers , but the blocking I described makes them unsuitable .
Lex is a lexer - generator tool that outputs C code .
In lex , a lexer specification is a collection of rules that have the following form :
< STATE > regex { action }
In English , each rule means " if in state STATE and regex matches the longest prefix of the remaining input , match this prefix and perform action . "
Actions can be arbitrary code , and they have access to an API for emitting a token or changing to another lexing state .
I have another article on lexers ( in JavaScript ) if you want to know more .
A Scala DSEL for regular expressions
To embed a lexing toolkit in Scala , we 'll need a way to describe regular expressions .
We can't use the Java regex library , because we 'll need to be able to compute the derivative of a regular expression , and for that , we need access to its structure .
The heart of the DSEL is the class RegularLanguage , whose interface describes all of the regular operations :
/** A regular language is a set of strings constructable from union , concatenation and repetition .
*/ abstract class RegularLanguage { //
Kleene star ; zero or more repetitions : def * : RegularLanguage ; //
Exactly n repetitions : def ^ ( n : Int ) : RegularLanguage //
Kleene plus : one or more repetitions : def + : RegularLanguage ; //
Option ; zero or one instances : def ? : RegularLanguage ; // Concatenation : def ~ ( suffix : RegularLanguage ) : RegularLanguage ; // Union / alternation : def || ( that : RegularLanguage ) : RegularLanguage ; //
For computing derivatives : def derive(c : Char ) : RegularLanguage ; def deriveEND : RegularLanguage ; // Properties : def acceptsEmptyString : Boolean ; def rejectsAll : Boolean ; def isEmptyString : Boolean ; } //
Useful implicits for regular expressions : object RegularLanguageImplicits { implicit def charToRegEx(c : Char ) : RegularLanguage ; implicit def stringToRegEx(s : String ) : RegularLanguage ; trait CharRangeable { def thru ( end : Char ) : RegularLanguage ; } implicit def charToCharRangeable ( start : Char ) ; } //
Matches end of input : case object END extends RegularLanguage //
Matches no strings at all : case object EmptySet extends RegularLanguage //
Matches the length - zero string : case object Epsilon extends RegularLanguage //
Matches any character : case object AnyChar extends RegularLanguage
Live Streams : A non-blocking interface
Supposing we have a lexer defined as a collection of rules , what we want is a lexer encoded as an object that can consume input characters , one at a time , and perform lexing actions as soon as it gets enough input to do so .
If we stop feeding the lexer input , or we do n't give it enough , the lexer should return to us without hanging .
To pull this off , we 'll use the abstraction of " live streams " for both the input to and the output of the lexer .
A live stream is a linked list whose tail can grow dynamically .
In Scala , my interface for live streams is :
class LiveStream [ A ]( val source : LiveStreamSource [ A ] ) { def isPlugged : Boolean ; def isEmpty : Boolean ; def head : A ; def tail : LiveStream [ A ] ; }
So , it 's almost exactly a linked list .
The difference is that a live stream has a source , and a particular stream node can be temporarily " plugged . "
A stream node is plugged if the source has n't yet provided enough input for this location in the stream .
( A plugged stream node becomes empty if the source declares the end of the input is reached . )
The interface for a stream source is a wrapper around a queue :
class LiveStreamSource [ A ] { def isTerminated : Boolean ; def isEmpty : Boolean ; def terminate ( ) ; def addListener ( listener : List [ A ] => Unit ) ; def has Next ( ) : Boolean ; def next ( ) : A ; def += ( a : A ) ; def ++= ( seq : Iterable [ A ] ) ; }
A useful addition here is the addListener method .
Since the lexer encodes its output as a live stream , a client of this lexer can add a listener to pick up its computation once more input is available .
Internally , the non-blocking lexer adds a listener to the input source , so that it automatically makes what progress it can any time more input becomes available .
A Scala DSEL for non-blocking lexers
To create a non-blocking lexer in Scala , you have to create a new class that inherits from NonblockingLexer , whose interface is sketched below :
// Eats C's , emit A's. abstract class NonblockingLexer [C <% Char , A ] { //
Attaches this lexer to a stream : def lex ( input : LiveStream [ C ] ) ; //
Contains the emitted A's : def output : LiveStream [ A ] //
Internal lexing states : abstract class LexerState ; //
User - definable states : class MajorLexerState extends LexerState { trait Matchable { def apply ( action : => Unit ) ; def over ( action : List [ C ] => Unit ) ; } trait Switchable { def to ( action : => LexerState ) ; def over ( action : List [ C ] => LexerState ) ; } //
Methods for adding rules to this state : def apply ( regex : RegularLanguage ) : Matchable ; def switchesOn ( regex : RegularLanguage ) : Switchable ; } class StatefulMajorLexerState [ S ] ( private var state : S ) extends MajorLexerState { //
Methods for adding rules to this state : def apply(s : S ) : StatefulMajorLexerState [ S ] def update ( regex : RegularLanguage , stateAction : ( S , List [ C ] ) => LexerState ) ; } // Called by actions : protected def emit ( token : A ) ; //
Create new lexing states : def State ( ) : MajorLexerState ; def State [ S ]( state : S ) : StatefulMajorLexerState [S ] //
Where the lexer starts : protected def MAIN : LexerState ; }
So , a lexer creates states with the State methods .
Then , it associates rules with them using the methods inside states .
Finally , it selects one of the lexing states as the initial lexing state : MAIN .
Example : A lexer for Scheme
As an example , here 's the body of a lexer that tokenizes Scheme :
// Abbreviations : val ch = " #\ \ " ~ AnyChar val id = ( ( ' A ' thru ' Z ' ) || ( ' a ' thru 'z ' ) || ( ' 0 ' thru ' 9 ' ) || oneOf ( " -+/*_?%$#&^=!@<> : " ) ) + val int = ( " - " ? ) ~ ( ' 0 ' thru ' 9 ' ) + val ws = oneOf ( " \r\t
" ) + val com = " ; " ~ ((!oneOf ( " \r
" ) ) * ) // States : val MAIN = State ( ) val BANGCOMMENT = State (0 ) val STRING = State [ List [ Char ] ] ( List ( ) ) // Rules : //
State switching rules MAIN switchesOn ( " # ! " ) to { BANGCOMMENT ( 1 ) } MAIN switchesOn ( " \ " " ) to { STRING ( List ( ) ) } // Regular tokens MAIN ( " , @ " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " , @ " ) ) } MAIN ( " , " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " , " ) ) } MAIN ( " ` " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " ` " ) ) } MAIN ( " ' " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " ' " ) ) } MAIN ( " # ( " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " # ( " ) ) } MAIN ( " ( " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " ( " ) ) } MAIN ( " ) " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " ) " ) ) } MAIN ( " [ " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " [ " ) ) } MAIN ( " ] " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " ] " ) ) } MAIN ( " { " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " { " ) ) } MAIN ( " } " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " } " ) ) } MAIN ( " . " ) { emit( PunctToken ( " . " ) ) } MAIN ( " #t " ) { emit( BooleanToken ( true ) ) } MAIN ( " #f " ) { emit( BooleanToken ( false ) ) } MAIN ( END ) { terminate ( ) } MAIN ( ws ) { } MAIN ( com ) { } MAIN ( ch ) over { chars => emit( CharToken ( chars ( 2 ) ) ) } MAIN ( int ) over { chars => emit( IntToken ( chars ) ) } MAIN ( id ) over { chars => emit( SymbolToken ( chars ) ) } //
Nested #! ... !# comments BANGCOMMENT ( " # ! " ) = { ( n , chars ) => BANGCOMMENT( n+1 ) } BANGCOMMENT ( AnyChar ) { } BANGCOMMENT ( " ! # " ) = { case ( 1 , chars ) => MAIN case ( n , chars ) => BANGCOMMENT( n - 1 ) } // Strings STRING ( " \ " " ) = { ( string , _ ) => { emit( StringToken( string.reverse.mkString ) ) ; MAIN } } STRING ( " \\\ " " ) = { ( string , chars ) => STRING ( ' " ' :: string ) } STRING ( " \\\\ " ) = { ( string , chars ) => STRING ( '\\ ' :: string ) } STRING ( AnyChar ) = { ( string , chars ) => STRING ( chars.reverse ++ string ) }
Example : A lexer for HTTP requests
Here 's the body of the lexer that parses an incoming HTTP request in my ( newly enhanced ) non-blocking web server :
// Abbreviations : val nl = " \r
" || "
" val headerLine = ((!oneOf ( " \r
: " ) ) + ) ~ " : " ~ ((!oneOf ( " \r
" ) ) + ) ~ nl // Lexing states : val METHOD = State ( ) val RESOURCE = State ( ) val VERSION = State ( ) val HEADER = State ( ) val DATA = State ( ) val DONE = State ( ) // Initial state : protected val MAIN = METHOD //
Find the method , GET or POST : METHOD switchesOn ( " GET " ) to { method = GET ; RESOURCE } METHOD switchesOn ( " POST " ) to { method = POST ; RESOURCE } //
Read in the resource : RESOURCE switchesOn ( (!oneOf ( " " ) ) + ) over { chars => { resource = chars ; VERSION } } // Grab ( and ignore ) the version : VERSION switchesOn ( " HTTP / 1.1 " ~ nl ) to { HEADER } VERSION switchesOn ( " HTTP / 1.0 " ~ nl ) to { HEADER } //
Parse a header line : HEADER ( headerLine ) over { chars => val line : String = chars val parts = line.split( " : " ) val header = parts ( 0 ) val value = parts ( 1 ) . trim headers = ( headers ( header ) = value ) //
Watch for significant headers : header match { case " Content - Length " => { contentLength = Integer.parseInt( value ) //
The client intends to send data .
//
Extend the lexer to read the input data : DATA switchesOn ( AnyChar ^ contentLength ) over { chars => { // emit the request now : emit ( new Request ( conn , method , resource , headers , data ) ) this.data = chars DATA.reset ( ) DONE } } } case _ => {} } } //
Blank line means end of headers : HEADER switchesOn ( nl ) to { if ( contentLength > 0 ) DATA else { // emit this request : emit( new Request ( conn , method , resource , headers , data ) ) DONE } } DONE ( END ) { /* do nothing */ }
Compared with the previous request - parsing architecture , I 'm now in a much better place to implement features like Keep - Alive connections .
The old code was an ad hoc implementation of a finite state machine .
Under the hood : Regex derivatives
A traditional lexer - generator like lex converts all of the regular expressions into NFAs and compiles them into a special deterministic finite state machine .
It then generates a C program that acts as the lexer .
This approach is too heavyweight and inflexible for modern lexing needs .
Aside from the fact that lex produces blocking , non - thread - safe lexers , modern lexers might need to modify themselves on the fly .
See how my HTTP lexer handles client data , for instance .
Or , consider that some programming languages , even C , require the lexer to change its behavior as the program is parsed .
Or , just imagine what kind of a programming language you could create with a lexer that can modify itself .
So , what we need is a way of amortizing the cost of what would have been lexer - generation across the lexing process itself .
This means that NFA conversion , and especially DFA compilation , are out .
We 're going to have to work with the regular expressions themselves as the intermediate state of the lexer .
This is where the derivative of a regular expression comes in .
I 've already written a detailed explanation of these , so I wo n't go into much detail here .
I 'll just restate the definition of the derivative :
The derivative of a regular expression with respect to a character is a new regular expression that matches the tails of all strings beginning with that character and which match the original regular expression .
Confused ?
Do n't be .
It 's a simple concept once you see some examples .
Most implementations of the method derive are one - liners !
In short , every time we consume a character , we 're going to take the derivative of all of the rules in the current state with respect to that character .
The result is the new lexing state , and a quick examination of the new rules tells us if we 've found a longest match and need to fire an action .
Even without optimizations or caching , this approach is fast .
Code
The makers of a new biopic of the late comedian Bill Hicks have come up with an unusual and ingenious way of depicting his early life , in the absence of any live footage .
Rather than use talking heads , they 've cleverly animated scenes from his early life around two - dimensional photographs of him – which is sort of like standing a cardboard cut - out at a bar , I fancy , and buying it a drink .
This seems , quietly if perhaps inadvertently , to make a point .
Hicks 's reputation is now so fixed , so singular , and – among the more rabid of his many fans – so two - dimensional that , a decade and a half on from his death at the age of 33 , he 's already halfway to being a cardboard cut - out – or a plaster saint , at the very latest .
There is no comic in history held in quite the same regard as Hicks .
Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor come closest , but neither enjoys the status Hicks does .
Of an iconoclast , Hicks 's fans have made an icon .
He is described not in the sort of terms you typically hear used for standup comics , but in the vocabulary of naked religious devotion .
If you Google " Bill Hicks " and " prophet " , you get 47,000 - odd hits .
In Garth Ennis 's comic - book series Preacher , Hicks appears in flashback .
Sitting beside Ennis 's hero at the bar after a gig , Hicks notices Jesse Custer 's dog-collar and says : " Holy shit – you 're a preacher ! "
Custer replies , with the soppy face of every Hicks fanboy : " I guess that makes two of us . "
In 2004 , the Labour MP Stephen Pound put down an early day motion asking the house to recognise the 10th anniversary of Hicks 's death , describing him as an " unflinching and painfully honest political philosopher " .
Hicks was great , I agree – but is n't it time we got a sense of perspective ?
They say Hicks fearlessly told the truth to The Man .
And I suppose he did , if by The Man , you mean liberal comedy club audiences .
But he was n't political in a particularly complicated or dangerous way .
He had a very good line in sarcasm about war and the arms industry ; he was a libertarian on drugs ; he was anticapitalist in a T - shirt - slogan sort of way ; and he was a fine advert for the sacred right to talk dirty in public .
Not everything Hicks did was nice or even consistent .
He mocked the stupid and / or ill - educated – waffle waitresses , rednecks , Republican presidents – and he gave succour to the tobacco and pornography industries .
Some also found him misogynistic , though I come down on the side of thinking his porn-loving , priapic alter - ego Goat Boy ( " Goat Boy likes young girls . . . 16 years old . . . heh heh heh " ) essentially self - mocking .
Hicks 's worldview – we are all energy ; money and status are meaningless distractions ; authenticity of feeling is paramount ; embrace love , not fear – basically made him a hippy disguised as a punk .
There was a faint hint of rightwing anarchism about him , too : a sense that big business , the military , the federal government and New Kids on the Block were all engaged in a malevolent conspiracy .
But Hicks did n't live in a fascist regime any more than the Sex Pistols did when they sang God Save the Queen – and he was n't saying the unsayable .
Preferring rock music to Michael Bolton and Rick Astley is quite proper , but it is n't a revolutionary statement .
Getting a routine censored from the David Letterman show does n't put you up there with Solzhenitsyn and Aung San Suu Kyi .
Hicks 's politics were among the least interesting things about him .
What was great him was that he was really funny – a smart , aggressive comedian with a humane outlook and a killer technique .
But is it healthy when a comic is revered not for being funny , but for being righteous ?
Hicks had a routine to counter that complaint .
When somebody reproached him that they did n't come to comedy shows to think , he responded : " Where do you go to think ?
I 'll meet you there . "
The problem is that like many charismatic people whose basic manifesto is : " Use your brains !
Think for yourselves ! " , he has acquired a whole bunch of fans whose idea of thinking for themselves is to quote Bill Hicks .
I have high hopes that the cardboard cut-outs in this new biopic will help restore Hicks to three dimensions .
What does a cosmetology school just outside Dallas need with a 5W adjustable cell phone jammer ?
Blissful quiet in the classrooms , apparently .
But the school 's decision to install the jamming unit ( it had three more that were n't yet set up ) in 2009 was one link in a chain that last week led the Federal Communications Commission to propose a $ 25,000 fine against the company hawking the products .
London - based Phonejammer.com has actually been in the FCC 's view for some time .
Back in 2008 , the agency issued a citation to Phonejammer ( PDF ) for " marketing in the United States radio frequency devices designed to intentionally interfere with cellular and PCS frequencies . "
Despite the company 's claim that it was not marketing such products in the US , where they remain illegal , FCC staff noted that the jammers were all priced in US currency , the United States was set as the default shipping location , and the site contained " testimonials of United States citizens regarding phone jammers and that they had purchased from Phonejammer . "
Also , the site 's jammers target US cellular and PCS frequencies .
You might suspect that the interests of the federal government in your business practices might be reason enough to change them , but then again , you do n't run Phonejammer .
On November 9 , 2009 , the FCC received a complaint ( apparently from AT&T ) about cellular interference in the 800MHz and 1900MHz bands .
Staff from the FCC's Texas field office tracked the problem to the Cosmetology Career Center in Carrollton , Texas and found a 5W jammer on the premises ( PDF ) .
The jammer was handed over to the Feds , as was a " copy of an April 21 , 2009 invoice sent by e-mail from sales@phonejammer.com for the sale and shipment of a Model PJ005 . "
The invoice clearly showed a US shipping address .
When the FCC contacted Phonejammer earlier this year , the company 's lawyer claimed that Phonejammer " has not shipped or distributed units to the United States . "
Oops , I did it again
In March 2010 , the FCC got another complaint from Florida , where the St. Lucie County 's Sheriff 's Office noted some interference that was affecting its detectives .
The FCC's Florida field office tracked the problem to a business in Port St. Lucie .
This time , agents found an 8W jammer , again sold by Phonejammer .
The FCC last week proposed a $ 25,000 fine ( PDF ) against the company for the two violations , higher than its minimum $ 14,000 fine amount due to " a pattern of intentional non-compliance . "
Phonejammer has 30 days to either pay the fine or challenge it .
As for that 5W jammer operated by the Cosmetology Career Center , it 's still available for $ 395 , it has two antennas , a jamming radius of 2 - 25 m , and it blocks PCS , GSM , and CDMA signals between 850MHz and 2100MHz .
The site lists its " operating location " as South America and Africa .
Phonejammer 's customers must have numerous questions about the legality of these jammers ; the list of frequently asked questions includes " will Customs allow your purchase ? " and the answer is a less - than - reassuring " to date , no items have been confiscated . "
The CommLawBlog , which highlighted the FCC 's proposed fine , concluded with this parallel : " Ironically , in both Texas and Florida it is legal to openly carry firearms into a Starbucks , say .
But not a phone jammer .
So when the cell phone at the next table erupts into The William Tell Overture and its owner bellows , “ HELLO ?
HEY !
YEAH , IN A STARBUCKS !
IT ’S RAINING HERE ! SO WHERE’RE YOU ? ” pulling out the jammer is not an option .
It ’s the firearm or nothing .
This may not be good public policy . "
University College Cork in Ireland is coming under international pressure to lift a punishment meted out to one of its academics .
Dylan Evans , a psychologist at the university ’s school of medicine , has been saddled with a two - year period of intensive monitoring and counselling after discussing a scientific paper with a colleague .
The title of the paper ?
“ Fellatio in fruit bats prolongs copulation time “ .
As part of what he says was an ongoing discussion on human uniqueness , Evans showed a copy of the fellatio paper to a female colleague in the school of medicine .
“ There was not a shred of a sign of offence taken at the time , ” Evans says .
“ She asked for a copy of the article . ”
A week later he got a letter informing him that he was being accused of sexual harassment .
Evans says the whole case is “ utterly bizarre ” .
The complainant ’s side of the argument is that she was “ hurt and disgusted ” , and asked Evans to leave a copy of the paper with her as way of cutting short the meeting .
No offence intended
It seems there was more to the grievance between Evans and the complainant than the fellatio paper incident , but an independent investigation found that Evans was not guilty of sexual harassment .
The investigation stated that it was reasonable for the colleague to have been offended and that showing the paper was a joke with a sexual innuendo , but that it was not Evans ’ intention to cause offence .
Advertisement
The university ’s president , Michael Murphy , nevertheless imposed a censure , which Evans says has prevented him getting tenure .
An online petition calling on the university authorities to back down has been set up and has been signed by high - profile academics including philosopher Daniel Dennett of Tufts University in Medford , Massachusetts , and Steven Pinker of Harvard University .
Dennett calls the punishment “ an outrageous violation of academic freedom ” and Pinker says the “ absurd and shameful ” judgment “ runs contrary to the principle of intellectual freedom and freedom of speech , to say nothing of common sense ” .
The paper , published last year in PLoS One , was covered in New Scientist and many other outlets .
The story had a certain prurient interest , which was only heightened by an explicit video that went with it .

THE local head of Sony Computer Entertainment says Australia should have an R18 + rating for computer games , adding authorities should drop the idea that gaming is just for kids .
" Gaming has moved on , the choice of content has moved on and I think it is time Australia gets in step with the rest of the world and has an R rating classification , " Michael Ephraim told AAP at a Playstation announcement in Sydney .
" I think it is just giving people choice .
You give people choice for movies , books , whatever .
Why are n't you giving them choice for gaming ?
" The Government needs to move on , to stop thinking that gaming is for kids , gaming has grown up .
Eight to 88 ( year olds ) play games now ... the average age of a gamer is something like 24 years old . "
Australian attorneys - general are currently debating changing the national computer game classification system .
More than 55,000 submissions were received during a public consultation on the issue .
They announced their project on April 24 .
They reached their $ 10,000 goal in 12 days , and the money continues to come in : as of Tuesday afternoon , they had raised $ 23,676 from 739 backers .
“ Maybe 2 or 3 percent of the money is from people we know , ” said Max Salzberg , 22 .
Working with Mr. Salzberg and Mr. Grippi are Raphael Sofaer , 19 , and Ilya Zhitomirskiy , 20 — “ four talented young nerds , ” Mr. Salzberg says — all of whom met at New York University ’s Courant Institute .
They have called their project Diaspora * and intend to distribute the software free , and to make the code openly available so that other programmers can build on it .
As they describe it , the Diaspora * software will let users set up their own personal servers , called seeds , create their own hubs and fully control the information they share .
Mr. Sofaer says that centralized networks like Facebook are not necessary .
“ In our real lives , we talk to each other , ” he said .
“ We do n’t need to hand our messages to a hub .
What Facebook gives you as a user is n’t all that hard to do .
All the little games , the little walls , the little chat , are n’t really rare things .
The technology already exists . ”
The terms of the bargain people make with social networks — you swap personal information for convenient access to their sites — have been shifting , with the companies that operate the networks collecting ever more information about their users .
That information can be sold to marketers .
Some younger people are becoming more cautious about what they post .
“ When you give up that data , you ’re giving it up forever , ” Mr. Salzberg said .
“ The value they give us is negligible in the scale of what they are doing , and what we are giving up is all of our privacy . ”
The Diaspora * group was inspired to begin their project after hearing a talk by Eben Moglen , a law professor at Columbia University , who described the centralized social networks as “ spying for free , ” Mr. Salzberg said .
The four students met in a computer room at N.Y.U. , and have spent nearly every waking minute there for months .
They understand the appeal of social networks .
Irina says : I am a professional photographer , I live not far from Moscow .
Animals live in our family since childhood .
Lived 13 years with our cat , whom we found a newborn and nursed .
For 17 years my mother had a dog which was also once took to the streets .
So this is a good tradition to rescue animals . ;)
The first were two cute little kitten .
I , as a photographer , could not pass on , showed them pictures in blog , and they quickly found the owners .
Then we saw two homeless kittens , bright red , they were perfectly healthy , and after a visit to the vet they too had gone to their new homes .
The following summer , while walking in the evening with a dog , I saw children who were seeing a kitten in a grass hut .
The kitten was very exhausted when I took it .
Veterinarian did not give assurances that it will survive .
But she really wanted to live and quickly recovered .
Our Sphinx always been friends with another of our cat and our dog , collie , and they all took to baby without any problems . :)
Eventually we have found owners for her too .
Her name is now Bree , she lives in Moscow .
This is not my merit , I 'm just a photographer and try not to pass someone else 's misfortune .
Thank you to those people who have taken up the families of these kittens .
Why do we like this ?
How about another throwback ?
Sure , why not !
" Postcards from Italy " is basically a classic at this point -- believe it or not , more than 10 years have passed since its release .
I actually remember the first time I heard this song while at University ; it blew my socks off .
If I 'm not mistaken , it was NPR who premiered his music , and boy oh boy did it catch on fast .
( CNN ) --
A former Harvard University student , who compiled world - class academic credentials by allegedly fabricating his own history and plagiarizing others ' work , pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him Tuesday , according to a Massachusetts prosecutor .
At his arraignment in Woburn , Massachusetts , Adam Wheeler , 23 , entered his plea against the 20 counts he faces , including larceny , identity fraud , falsifying an endorsement or approval and pretending to hold a degree , according to Middlesex County District Attorney Gerry Leone .
In a statement , Leone said Wheeler , of Delaware , is accused of falsifying transcripts that detailed an outstanding academic career at some of Massachusetts ' finest institutions .
He was exposed after submitting applications and references for the Rhodes and Fulbright scholarships while a student at Harvard University in 2009 , according to Leone .
A Harvard professor reviewing Wheeler 's application for one of the scholarships noticed similarities between Wheeler 's work and that of another professor .
After comparing both pieces of work , the professor determined that Wheeler had plagiarized most of his application packet , Leone said .
The university launched an internal investigation and began to look into Wheeler 's file .
University officials discovered that Wheeler had fabricated recommendations from Harvard professors , college transcripts reflecting perfect grades and a résumé listing numerous books he had co-authored , lectures he had given and courses he had taught , according to the release .
While he was at Harvard , Wheeler won the university 's Winthrop Sargent Prize in English and the Hoopes Prize for outstanding scholarly work , as well as a research grant , all with plagiarized submissions , Leone said .
" Not only was this defendant untruthful on his application to the University and his numerous scholarship applications , he is also alleged to have stolen over $ 45,000 in grants , scholarship and financial aid money awarded to him on applications and submissions of documents that were based on lies and reproductions of other people 's hard work , " Leone said .
Officials also discovered that Wheeler also had submitted false SAT scores and had fabricated transcripts from both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Phillips Academy in Andover , although he never attended either school , the prosecutor said .
Harvard officials also found that Wheeler had previously attended Bowdoin College in Maine , where he was suspended due to academic dishonesty , according to Leone .
In January , after leaving Harvard , Wheeler applied for an internship at McLean Hospital in Belmont , Massachusetts , " stating that [ he ] was taking the spring semester off from Harvard to work on two scholarly books , " Leone said in the release .
Wheeler was turned down by the hospital after a background check revealed he had falsified documents , Leone said .
At the same time , Wheeler also submitted transfer applications to both Yale and Brown universities , claiming to be an intern at McLean Hospital , according to the prosecutor .
The Tea Parties are the descendants of a number of conservative insurgencies from the past two generations : the anti-tax rebellion of the late ’ 70s , the Moral Majority and Christian Coalition of the ’80s and ’90s , and Pat Buchanan ’s presidential runs .
Like the Tea Partiers I saw in Washington — and the picture of the Tea Partiers put forward by the Winston and Quinnipiac polls — these movements have been almost entirely white , disproportionately middle - aged or older , and more male than female ( though parts of the Christian right are an exception on this count ) .
A majority of their adherents generally are not college - educated , with incomes in the middle range — attributes that also closely match the Tea Party movement ’s demographic profile .
( A misleading picture of Tea Partiers as college - educated and affluent came from a New York Times / CBS poll of people who merely " support , " but do n’t necessarily have anything to do with , the Tea Party movement .
The other polls surveyed people who say they are " part of " the movement . )
Sociologists who have studied these earlier movements describe their followers as coming from the " marginal segments of the middle class . "
That ’s a sociological , but also a political , fact .
These men and women look uneasily upward at corporate CEOs and investment bankers , and downward at low - wage service workers and laborers , many of whom are minorities .
And their political outlook is defined by whether they primarily blame those below or above for the social and economic anxieties they feel .
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century , the marginal middle class was the breeding ground for left - wing attacks against Wall Street .
For the last half - century , it has nourished right - wing complaints about blacks , illegal immigrants , and the poor .
Tea Minus Zero
It 's the core of the Rush fans and many middle class Reagan / Bush II voters .
They have legitimate gripes as the class stratification has increased , but look downward to kick those below them rather than fight those above them for a bigger piece of the pie .
To me , white skin privilege / supremacy is key .
These folks fear falling into the " other " economically , and thus only their white skin can make them superior in their own minds .
I see one major point of the Tea Party / anti-Obama reaction to be nothing more than the death pangs of white supremacy as an ideology .
I wrote about it last August :
White Racists Want Their America Back .
" At this point in my life , I have never seen my America turned into what it has turned into , and I want my America back , " said one woman , on the verge of tears . "
It 's not about health care , public options , details of plans .
That is not what motivates the opposition we see .
It 's the end of a way of life in which mediocre whites have better jobs , better lives , better health care , because of their skin privilege .
It 's the end of an idea , an idea that told some whites that they were better just because their skin was pinkish or " flesh - colored " as Crayola so racistly used to describe .
It is the death rattle of racism .
The racists feel it .
Their way of life is ending .
White privilege is going away .
Nonetheless , Judis brings up excellent points ( and he does recognize the racism ) in identifying the historical ideological strands that make up tea party ideology :
But the Tea Parties ’ roots in U.S. history go back much further than the conservative movements of recent decades .
The Tea Parties are defined by three general ideas that have played a key role in U.S. politics since the country ’s early days .
The first is an obsession with decline .
This idea , which traces back to the outlook of New England Puritans during the seventeenth century , consists of a belief that a golden age occurred some time ago ; that we are now in a period of severe social , economic , or moral decay ; that evil forces and individuals are the cause of this situation ; that the goal of politics is to restore the earlier period ; and that the key to doing so is heeding a special text that can serve as a guidebook for the journey backward .
snip
That is where the Tea Party movement ’s second link to early U.S. history comes in .
The Tea Partiers may share the Puritans ’ fear of decline , but it is what they share with Thomas Jefferson that has far broader appeal : a staunch anti-statism .
What began as a sentiment of the left — a rejection of state monopolies — became , after the industrial revolution and the rise of the labor movement , a weapon against progressive reforms .
The basic idea — that government is a " necessary evil " — has retained its power , and , when the economy has faltered , Americans have been quick to blame Washington , perhaps even before they looked at Wall Street or big corporations .
It happened in the late ’70s under Jimmy Carter and in the early ’90s under George H.W. Bush ; and it has happened again during Obama ’s first 18 months in office .
According to a Pew poll , the percentage of Americans " angry " with government has risen from 10 percent in February 2000 to 21 percent today , while another 56 percent are " frustrated " with government .
snip Simmering economic frustration also accounts for the final historical strain that defines the Tea Parties :
They are part of a tradition of producerism that dates to Andrew Jackson .
Jacksonian Democrats believed that workers should enjoy the fruits of what they produce and not have to share them with the merchants and bankers who did n’t actually create anything .
The Populists of the late nineteenth century invoked this ethic in denouncing the Eastern bankers who held their farms hostage .
Producerism also underlay Roosevelt ’s broadsides against economic royalists and Bill Clinton ’s promise to give priority to those who " work hard and play by the rules . "
During the 1970s , conservatives began invoking producerism to justify their attacks on the welfare state , and it was at the core of the conservative tax revolt .
While the Jacksonians and Populists had largely directed their anger upward , conservatives directed their ire at the people below who were beneficiaries of state programs — from the " welfare queens " of the ghetto to the " illegal aliens " of the barrio .
Like the attack against " big government , " this conservative producerism has most deeply resonated during economic downturns .
And the Tea Parties have clearly built their movement around it .
Tea Minus Zero
Judis ' analysis is as good as far as it goes , especially in locating one strand of ideas in Jacksonian democracy , but he fails to see the overriding issue of white supremacy that is animating many of these folks .
Let 's look at Andrew Jackson a bit .
Many folks as Democrats are uncomfortable with Jackson , but see him as helping to push an imperfect democracy .
I certainly believed that for a long time , although I was well aware of the Indian Removal policies and support for slavery .
A new look at Jackson , however , is in order :
Whereas this era has often been seen as a bumptious and buoyant period in American history , when " democracy " expanded well beyond the limited franchise the Founders imagined , Howe casts a much more somber eye over these years .
There is much that is dark here , and that darkness , for Howe , was embodied in the figure of Andrew Jackson .
Jackson emerges from this book as a villain whose sins were many and they reverberated for many years .
Howe faults Jackson for purging the Federal government of experienced employees and replacing them with patronage hacks ; he blames the economic depression of 1837 on Jackson ’s successful but wrong - headed fight to close the Second Bank ; he thoroughly condemns Jackson ’s role in the Indian removal .
More damning than these particulars , though , is Howe ’s central assertion that " Jacksonian democracy " rested first and foremost on a foundation of white supremacy .
Howe makes this point repeatedly and in various contexts .
" White supremacy , resolute and explicit , constituted an essential component of what contemporaries called ‘ the Democracy ’ – that is , the Democratic Party . " ( p. 423 ) Jackson ’s foil , both in real life and in the pages of this book , is John Quincy Adams .
The latter is portrayed here as the nation ’s hero to Jackson ’s rogue – principled , smart , and ultimately on the right side of history , especially about the question of slavery .
snip
Howe ’s suspicion of Jacksonian democracy – a populism that flourished hand in glove with white supremacy – will doubtless irk other historians of this era .
Review : ' What Hath God Wrought ? ' :
The Transformation of America , 1815 - 1848 .
Ideas do not flow through history into people 's minds as whole reproductions .
Yes the racism of Jacksonian Democracy found its way into some aspects of Southern Populism ( Pitchfork Ben Tillman ) , which led to segregation and Jim Crow .
Yes , there is deep anti-statism in American history and people pick up those idea .
And , yes , the Decline and Fall of Rome has long been an analogy for the far right .
And producerism has both right and left wing tendencies ( unions , socialism , and kick the poor ) .
Indeed , these tendencies can overlap and be held by the same people in different ways in different times .
Still , I submit that there would be no Tea Party if Barack Obama were white .
The world of the marginal middle class embraces a rough equality of WHITES , and embraces the dying embers of a thoroughly discreditted and pernicious ideology of white supremacy .
So I disagree with Mr. Judis ' conclusion :
None of this is what liberals want to hear , but we might as well face reality :
The Tea Party movement — firmly grounded in a number of durable U.S. political traditions and well - positioned for a time of economic uncertainty — could be around for a while .
There always may be marginal extremists and racists , but as a popular movement it will not be around for a while .
White supremacy animates the movement and that ideology is dying .
We should help it along by creating alliances of Americans who see and live a rainbow future .

Honeybees do n’t have much in the way of brains .
Their inch - long bodies hold at most a few million neurons .
Yet with such meager mental machinery honeybees sustain one of the most intricate and explicit languages in the animal kingdom .
In the darkness of the hive , bees manage to communicate the precise direction and distance of a newfound food source , and they do it all in the choreography of a dance .
Scientists have known of the bee ’s dance language for more than 70 years , and they have assembled a remarkably complete dictionary of its terms , but one fundamental question has stubbornly remained unanswered :
How do they do it ?
How do these simple animals encode so much detailed information in such a varied language ?
Honeybees may not have much brain , but they do have a secret .
This secret has vexed Barbara Shipman , a mathematician at the University of Rochester , ever since she was a child .
I grew up thinking about bees , she says .
My dad worked for the Department of Agriculture as a bee researcher .
My brothers and I would stop at his office , and sometimes he would show us the bees .
I remember my father telling me about the honeybee ’s dance when I was about nine years old .
And in high school I wrote a paper on the medicinal benefits of honey .
Her father kept his books on honeybees on a shelf in her room .
I ’m not sure why , she says .
It may have just been a convenient space .
I remember looking at a lot of these books , especially the one by Karl von Frisch .
Von Frisch ’s Dance Language and Orientation of Bees was some four decades in the making .
By the time his papers on the bee dance were collected and published in 1965 , there was scarcely an entomologist in the world who had n’t been both intrigued and frustrated by his findings .
Intrigued because the phenomenon Von Frisch described was so startlingly complex ; frustrated because no one had a clue as to how bees managed the trick .
Von Frisch had watched bees dancing on the vertical face of the honeycomb , analyzed the choreographic syntax , and articulated a vocabulary .
When a bee finds a source of food , he realized , it returns to the hive and communicates the distance and direction of the food to the other worker bees , called recruits .
On the honeycomb , which Von Frisch referred to as the dance floor , the bee performs a waggle dance , which in outline looks something like a coffee bean -- two rounded arcs bisected by a central line .
The bee starts by making a short straight run , waggling side to side and buzzing as it goes .
Then it turns left ( or right ) and walks in a semicircle back to the starting point .
The bee then repeats the short run down the middle , makes a semicircle to the opposite side , and returns once again to the starting point .
It is easy to see why this beautiful and mysterious phenomenon captured Shipman ’s young and mathematically inclined imagination .
The bee ’s finely tuned choreography is a virtuoso performance of biologic information processing .
The central waggling part of the dance is the most important .
To convey the direction of a food source , the bee varies the angle the waggling run makes with an imaginary line running straight up and down .
One of Von Frisch ’s most amazing discoveries involves this angle .
If you draw a line connecting the beehive and the food source , and another line connecting the hive and the spot on the horizon just beneath the sun , the angle formed by the two lines is the same as the angle of the waggling run to the imaginary vertical line .
The bees , it appears , are able to triangulate as well as a civil engineer .
Direction alone is not enough , of course -- the bees must also tell their hive mates how far to go to get to the food .
The shape or geometry of the dance changes as the distance to the food source changes , Shipman explains .
Move a pollen source closer to the hive and the coffee - bean shape of the waggle dance splits down the middle .
The dancer will perform two alternating waggling runs symmetric about , but diverging from , the center line .
The closer the food source is to the hive , the greater the divergence between the two waggling runs .
If that sounds almost straightforward , what happens next certainly does n’t .
Move the food source closer than some critical distance and the dance changes dramatically : the bee stops doing the waggle dance and switches into the round dance .
It runs in a small circle , reversing and going in the opposite direction after one or two turns or sometimes after only half a turn .
There are a number of variations between species .
Von Frisch ’s work on the bee dance is impressive , but it is largely descriptive .
He never explained why the bees use this peculiar vocabulary and not some other .
Nor did he ( or could he ) explain how small - brained bees manage to encode so much information .
The dance of the honeybee is special among animal communication systems , says Shipman .
It conveys concise , quantitative information in an abstract , symbolic way .
You have to wonder what makes the dance happen .
Bees do n’t have enough intelligence to know what they are doing .
How do they know the dance in the first place ?
Calling it instinct or some other word just substitutes one mystery for another .
Shipman entered college as a biochemistry major and even spent some time working in a biology lab studying the hemolymph -- the blood -- of honeybee larvae , but she quickly moved her interest in bees to the side .
During my freshman year , she says , I became more attracted to the beauty and rigor of mathematics .
She switched her major and eventually went on to graduate school and to a professorship at the University of Rochester .
For several years it seemed as though she had wandered a long way from her childhood fascination .
Then , taking an unlikely route , she found herself once again confronting the mysteries of bees head - on .
While working on her doctoral thesis , on an obscure type of mathematics known only to a small coterie of researchers well - versed in the minutiae of geometry , she stumbled across what just might be the key to the secrets of the bee ’s dance .
Shipman ’s work concerned a set of geometric problems associated with an esoteric mathematical concept known as a flag manifold .
In the jargon of mathematics , manifold means space .
But do n’t let that deceptively simple definition lull you into a false sense of security .
Mathematicians have as many kinds of manifolds as a French baker has bread .
Some manifolds are flat , some are curved , some are twisted , some wrap back on themselves , some go on forever .
The surface of a sphere is a manifold , says Shipman .
So is the surface of a bagel - - it ’s called a torus .
The shape of a manifold determines what kinds of objects ( curves , figures , surfaces ) can live within its confines .
Two different types of loops , for example , live in the surface of a torus -- one wraps around the outside , the other goes through the middle , and there is no way to transform the first into the second without breaking the loop .
In contrast , there is only one type of loop that lives on a sphere .
Mathematicians like to examine different manifolds the way antiques dealers browse through curio shops -- always exploring , always looking for unusual characteristics that expand their understanding of numbers or geometry .
The difficult part about exploring a manifold , however , is that mathematicians do n’t always confine them to the three dimensions of ordinary experience .
A manifold can have two dimensions like the surface of a screen , three dimensions like the inside of an empty box , four dimensions like the space - time of our Einsteinian universe , or even ten or a hundred dimensions .
The flag manifold ( which got its name because some imaginative mathematician thought it had a shape like a flag on a pole ) happens to have six dimensions , which means mathematicians can’t visualize all the two - dimensional objects that can live there .
That does not mean , though , that they cannot see the objects ’ shadows .
One of the more effective tricks for visualizing objects with more than three dimensions is to project or map them onto a space that has fewer dimensions ( usually two or three ) .
A topographic map , in which three - dimensional mountains get squashed onto a two - dimensional page , is a type of projection .
Likewise , the shadow of your hand on the wall is a two - dimensional projection of your three - dimensional hand .
One day Shipman was busy projecting the six - dimensional residents of the flag manifold onto two dimensions .
The particular technique she was using involved first making a two - dimensional outline of the six dimensions of the flag manifold .
This is not as strange as it may sound .
When you draw a circle , you are in effect making a two - dimensional outline of a three - dimensional sphere .
As it turns out , if you make a two - dimensional outline of the six - dimensional flag manifold , you wind up with a hexagon .
The bee ’s honeycomb , of course , is also made up of hexagons , but that is purely coincidental .
However , Shipman soon discovered a more explicit connection .
She found a group of objects in the flag manifold that , when projected onto a two - dimensional hexagon , formed curves that reminded her of the bee ’s recruitment dance .
The more she explored the flag manifold , the more curves she found that precisely matched the ones in the recruitment dance .
I was n’t looking for a connection between bees and the flag manifold , she says .
I was just doing my research .
The curves were nothing special in themselves , except that the dance patterns kept emerging .
Delving more deeply into the flag manifold , Shipman dredged up a variable , which she called alpha , that allowed her to reproduce the entire bee dance in all its parts and variations .
Alpha determines the shape of the curves in the 6 - D flag manifold , which means it also controls how those curves look when they are projected onto the 2 - D hexagon .
Infinitely large values of alpha produce a single line that cuts the hexagon in half .
Large values of alpha produce two lines very close together .
Decrease alpha and the lines splay out , joined at one end like a V .
Continue to decrease alpha further and the lines form a wider and wider V until , at a certain value , they each hit a vertex of the hexagon .
Then the curves change suddenly and dramatically .
When alpha reaches a critical value , explains Shipman , the projected curves become straight line segments lying along opposing faces of the hexagon .
The smooth divergence of the splayed lines and their abrupt transition to discontinuous segments are critical -- they link Shipman ’s curves to those parts of the recruitment dance that bees emphasize with their waggling and buzzing .
Biologists know that only certain parts of the dance convey information , she says .
In the waggle dance , it ’s the diverging waggling runs and not the return loops .
In the circle dance it ’s short straight segments on the sides of the loops .
Shipman ’s mathematics captures both of these characteristics , and the parameter alpha is the key .
If different species have different sensitivities to alpha , then they will change from the waggle dances to round dances when the food source is at different distances .
If Shipman is correct , her mathematical description of the recruitment dance would push bee studies to a new level .
The discovery of mathematical structure is often the first and critical step in turning what is merely a cacophony of observations into a coherent physical explanation .
In the sixteenth century Johannes Kepler joined astronomy ’s pantheon of greats by demonstrating that planetary orbits follow the simple geometric figure of the ellipse .
By articulating the correct geometry traced by the heavenly bodies , Kepler ended two millennia of astronomical speculation as to the configuration of the heavens .
Decades after Kepler died , Isaac Newton explained why planets follow elliptical orbits by filling in the all - important physics -- gravity .
With her flag manifold , Shipman is like a modern - day Kepler , offering , in her words , everything in a single framework .
I have found a mathematics that takes all the different forms of the dance and embraces them in a single coherent geometric structure .
Shipman is not , however , content to play Kepler .
You can look at this idea and say , ‘ That ’s a nice geometric description of the dance , very pretty , ’ and leave it like that , she says .
But there is more to it .
When you have a physical phenomenon like the honeybee dance , and it follows a mathematical structure , you have to ask what are the physical laws that are causing it to happen .
At this point Shipman departs from safely grounded scholarship and enters instead the airy realm of speculation .
The flag manifold , she notes , in addition to providing mathematicians with pure joy , also happens to be useful to physicists in solving some of the mathematical problems that arise in dealing with quarks , tiny particles that are the building blocks of protons and neutrons .
And she does not believe the manifold ’s presence both in the mathematics of quarks and in the dance of honeybees is a coincidence .
Rather she suspects that the bees are somehow sensitive to what ’s going on in the quantum world of quarks , that quantum mechanics is as important to their perception of the world as sight , sound , and smell .
Say a bee flies around , finds a source of food , and heads straight back to the hive to tell its colleagues .
How does it perceive where that food is ?
What notation can it use to remember ?
What terms can it use to translate that memory into directions for its fellow bees ?
One way , the way we big - brained humans would be most comfortable with , would be to use landmarks -- fly ten yards toward the big rock , turn left , duck under the boughs of the pine tree , and see the flowers growing near the trunk .
Another way , one that seems to be more in line with what bees actually do , would be to use physical characteristics that adequately identify the site , such as variations in Earth ’s magnetic field or in the polarization of the sun ’s light .
Researchers have in fact already established that the dance is sensitive to such properties .
Experiments have documented , for example , that local variations in Earth ’s magnetic field alter the angle of the waggling runs .
In the past , scientists have attributed this to the presence of magnetite , a magnetically active mineral , in the abdomen of bees .
Shipman , however , along with many other researchers , believes there is more to it than little magnets in the bees ’ cells .
But she tends not to have much professional company when she reveals what she thinks is responsible for the bees ’ response .
Ultimately magnetism is described by quantum fields , she says .
I think the physics of the bees ’ bodies , their physiology , must be constructed such that they ’re sensitive to quantum fields -- that is , the bee perceives these fields through quantum mechanical interactions between the fields and the atoms in the membranes of certain cells .
What exactly does it mean to say that the bees interact with quantum fields ?
A quantum field is a sort of framework within which particles play out their existences .
And , rather than assigning an electron to one position in space at one particular time , you instead talk about all the different places the electron could possibly be .
You can loosely refer to this collection of all possible locations as a field smeared out across space and time .
If you decide to check the electron ’s position by observing it , the interaction between your measuring device and the field makes the electron appear to be a single coherent object .
In this sense , the observer is said to disturb the quantum mechanical nature of the electron .
There is some research to support the view that bees are sensitive to effects that occur only on a quantum - mechanical scale .
One study exposed bees to short bursts of a high - intensity magnetic field and concluded that the bees ’ response could be better explained as a sensitivity to an effect known as nuclear magnetic resonance , or nmr , an acronym commonly associated with a medical imaging technique .
nmr occurs when an electromagnetic wave impinges on the nuclei of atoms and flips their orientation .
nmr is considered a quantum mechanical effect because it takes place only if each atom absorbs a particular size packet , or quantum , of electromagnetic energy .
This research , however , does n’t address the issue of how bees turn these quantum - mechanical perceptions into an organized dance ritual .
Shipman ’s mathematics does .
To process quantum mechanical information and communicate it to others , the bee would not only have to possess equipment sensitive to the quantum - mechanical world ; to come up with the appropriate recruitment dance , it would have to perform some kind of calculation similar to what Shipman did with her flag manifold .
Assuming that the typical honeybee is not quite intelligent enough to make the calculations , how does the bee come up with the flag manifold as an organizing principle for its dance ?
Shipman does n’t claim to have the answer , but she is quick to point out that the flag manifold is common both to the bee dance and to the geometry of quarks .
Perhaps , she speculates , bees possess some ability to perceive not only light and magnetism but quarks as well .
The notion that bees can perceive quarks is hard enough for many physicists to swallow , but that ’s not even the half of it .
Physicists have theorized that quarks are constantly popping up in the vacuum of empty space .
This is possible because the vacuum is pervaded by something called the zero - point energy field - - a quantum field in which on average no particles exist , but which can have local fluctuations that cause quarks to blink in and out of existence .
Shipman believes that bees might sense these fleeting quarks , and use them - - somehow - - to create the complex and peculiar structure of their dance .
Now here ’s the rub .
The flag manifold geometry is an abstraction .
It is useful in describing quarks not as the single coherent objects that physicists can measure in the real world but as unobserved quantum fields .
Once a physicist tries to detect a quark -- by bombarding it with another particle in a high - energy accelerator -- the flag manifold geometry is lost .
If bees are using quarks as a script for their dance , they must be able to observe the quarks not as single coherent objects but as quantum fields .
If Shipman ’s hunch is correct and bees are able to touch the quantum world of quarks without breaking it , not only would it shake up the field of biology , but physicists would be forced to reinterpret quantum mechanics as well .
Shipman is the first to admit that she is a long way from proving her hypothesis .
The mathematics implies that bees are doing something with quarks , she says .
I ’m not saying they definitely are .
I ’m just throwing it out as a possibility .
And when she publishes her research , probably sometime next year , no doubt many scientists will be turned off by her dragging quarks and quantum mechanics into the picture .
The joining of mathematics and biology is a fascinating endeavor and is just getting under way , says William Faris , a mathematician at the University of Arizona .
Connecting quantum mechanics directly to biology is much more speculative .
I frankly am skeptical that the bee dance is related to quantum mechanics .
The mathematics she uses may be related to a completely different explanation of the bee dance .
This is the universality of mathematics .
To venture into quantum mechanics may be a distraction .
Shipman is n’t the first scientist to go out on a limb trying to link biology to quantum mechanics .
Physicist Roger Penrose of Oxford University has postulated that nerve cells have incredibly tiny tubes that serve as quantum mechanical detectors , and other physicists have expressed similar ideas , but they are by no means widely accepted .
It is risky for a young scientist to take on a radical theory .
Championing an unproved or unpopular idea is a good way to put your academic career on permanent hold .
My thesis adviser was worried , too , says Shipman .
He was happy to know that I am beginning collaborations with biologists .
However , Shipman is too excited about the ideas to care about the risk .
To make discoveries that cross disciplines , someone has to start .
I know there is always resistance to new ideas , especially if you are approaching the problem from a different perspective .
Sometimes theory comes before discovery and points the way toward the right questions to ask .
I hope this research stimulates other researchers ’ imaginations .
Why does the pope wear underpants in the bath ?
Because he does n't like looking down on the unemployed .
I was always fond of this joke , though never more so than when still at school where – this being a Catholic boarding school – unemployment of this variety was rife ( albeit not so rife that there was n't an occasional visit to the job centre ) .
When it's not the object of irreverent humour , the vow of celibacy – in effect a vow of chastity – undertaken by the Catholic clergy is an issue of great seriousness .
We were reminded of its seriousness in March , when the occasionally freethinking cardinal of Vienna , Christoph Schönborn , suggested the issue of celibacy should be the object of " unflinching examination " within the church and enforced chastity may be linked with the secretive cultures of sexual abuse being exposed one after the other .
His call was quickly shot down by the Vatican , and Schönborn fell back into line .
But now the humorous side is back on top again , with the report that numerous former mistresses of the Roman clergy recently sent a petition to the pope asking him to reconsider the issue on the grounds that a priest , just like anyone else , benefits from being able " to live with his fellow human beings , experience feelings , love and be loved " .
The women of Rome are right , of course , as was Schönborn .
There is simply no question that forcing men and women of the cloth to forego sexual intercourse causes untold problems .
As with any physical or psychological force , hold it back in one place and it will come out somewhere else , most likely causing a good deal more damage on the way .
In Catholic doctrine , the virtue of chastity is taken to be the principal foil to everyone 's favourite deadly sin , lust .
But whether you take the trouble to read the Freudian literature on repression , or heed the folk observation that " absence makes the heart grow fonder ( while total abstinence makes it foam at the mouth ) " , it 's fairly clear that chastity is less of a foil than a fertiliser for lust .
As most of us know , the best and most common way to satisfy a sexual appetite is – surprise surprise – to have sex .
So , the real question is not whether it's a good idea but how on earth it came to be thought a good idea in the first place .
As with much Christian doctrine , the wisdom on celibacy has nothing to do with contemporary accounts of Christ .
There are no prescriptions for chastity in the gospels , nor any genuine attempt to pretend that Jesus 's various encounters with a certain lady of Magdala were anything other than of the usual kind .
It is also clear that most of Jesus 's apostles were married , and that in asking them to follow him , he was n't asking them to abandon their wives and children .
The first official decrees on the matter do n't come until the fourth century .
At the council of Elvira in AD306 , it was decided that a priest who has sex with his wife is not fit to celebrate mass the following day .
This is something I understand .
Popular wisdom at school had it that members of the rugby team should abstain from masturbation the night before a match .
I abstained happily , from rugby .
But it was n't long before the council of Nicea decreed in AD325 that priests should refrain from marriage altogether .
Soon after this , women were disbarred from the priesthood , more rot set in and congealed into institutional prejudices against flesh in general , and female flesh in particular , that had their roots not in Christ 's teaching or in early church practice , but in the resurfacing , in the form of Gnosticism , of an ancient sceptical dualistic metaphysics which pitted spirit against matter and body against soul .
This , to my mind , has been Christianity 's greatest single tragedy , turning a religion founded on a noble and genuine philosophy of love into an excuse for repression , oppression and persecution , in which suffering was turned into a cult and hypocrisy into standard practice .
In the meantime , the ancient conception of Eros as the love that bound sexual partners together no less than it was held to bind the flux of cosmos together was erased , substituted for by the idea of love as agape , or disinterested compassion understood as willing duty to God .
Yet , even though both terms are ancient Greek , it is only in Christian doctrine that they come to be seen as mutually exclusive .
As societies , we in the west suffer hugely from the stigmatisation of the erotic as a category , as if the most primal of our desires could have no meaningful relation with the rest of our lives .
But nowhere do people suffer more than in the church itself .
Comic and tragic anecdotes about the evil effects of celibacy in the church abound .
They range from the great raping and pillaging Pope Benedict IX – whose near successor Victor III remembered " his life as a pope so vile , so foul , so execrable " , that I shudder to think of it – to the de facto genocide of the Albigensian crusades against the Cathars .
But we can't change history , we ought to be able to change today .
Many of the monks I knew fell victim to the absurd demands of the faith in one way or another , paying variously with their vocations , their reputations as excellent teachers or scholars , or – in one case – by taking his own life .
Benedict IX 's namesake will not shift on this matter , however ; just as he is unlikely to shift on any of the other pointless , detrimental and irrational articles of faith to which the Catholic church clings .
Humour , often the best recourse in intractable situations , comes to our aid again .
As someone once said of another infamous ban , on contraception : if you can't play the game , do n't presume to make up the rules .
The Army says it can't find its own copy of the Wikileaks video showing the killing of two Reuters staffers in Baghdad in 2007 .
But according to Defense Department documents , the Army was supposed to use it for training .
Wikileaks released video last week showing U.S. gunships killing Reuters staffers Namir Noor - Eldeen and Saeed Chmagh and a group of armed men they were with in Baghdad in 2007 .
When the Army was asked to authenticate the footage , it rather bashfully admitted that it could n't even find its own copy , which may explain why it refused for years to comply with Reuters ' Freedom of Information
Act request for it .
But according to a legal review of the Army investigation into the incident released by the Pentagon , Brig .
Gen. Vincent K. Brooks ordered the Master Gunner of the 1st Air Cavalry Brigade to " compile [ the ] gun-camera footage for training purposes " — presumably to help prevent a replay of the slayings :
Of course , the video is already out , so it does n't really matter whether the Army can find its own copy .
But given the fact that it can't , it would appear that the 1st Air Cavalry Brigade never followed through on the Army 's own recommendations in the wake of the incident .
And it 's worth noting that the version released by Wikileaks contains a 30 - minute gap between the initial attack and a later missile assault on a nearby building .
Anyone curious as to what that gap contained might want to ask whomever the Master Gunner of the 1t Air Cavalry Brigade was in the summer of 2007 .
The Jerusalem Post
The European “ Freedom Flotilla ” will have a surprise waiting when it reaches Israel ’s southern waters this weekend .
Israel advocacy non-profit StandWithUs plans to greet the European convoy with its own demonstration at sea .
The organization expects the flotilla of European left - wing activists to reach Israeli waters this weekend , although their arrival has been delayed .
A fleet of privately owned Israeli boats will leave the Ashdod and Herzliya marinas in hopes of surprising the European activists Friday at 1 p.m .
The counter flotilla ships will be covered in “ Free Gaza from Hamas ” banners and boat owners will wear blood stained tee shirts , representing Hamas ’s terror record .
The demonstration will be funded by StandWithUs and individual donors .
The organization described their “ Free Gaza from Hamas ” flotilla as a “ counter PR stunt .
” “ What the other anti-Israel flotilla is doing is ignoring human rights abuses and focusing on a fake situation , ” Michael Dickson , StandWithUs Israel Director , told Thursday .
Dickson believes the European flotilla cares more about hurting Israel than helping the Palestinians in Gaza .
Lior Meyer , a StandWithUs Project Manager planning the counter flotilla , hopes their demonstration will show that Gaza is under Hamas siege , rather than Israeli occupation .
“ I hope they ’re not expecting anything .
When someone ’s surprised by the truth it ’s only a good thing , ” Meyer said , claiming that few people know the nature of Hamas ’s control .
Dickson said that the European activists ’ aid could have reached Gaza in one day instead of one week if they were n’t interested in making a publicity statement .
“ I think that the key thing is that this is not some fare minded mission coming in that cares for peace .
Their flotilla is driven by hate rather than peace .
They do n’t really care about the victims who live under Hamas in Gaza and the south of Israel , ” As of Thursday afternoon , five individuals volunteered their boats .
Dickson predicted more individuals would join their flotilla .
“ If the activists had done their homework instead of believing Hamas propaganda , they would also have found out that their assistance is n’t needed .
There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza , ” Dickson said .
As opponents of Arizona ’s tough new immigration law prepare a weekend of protests , the state ’s chief attorney vowed Friday to “ fight back vigorously ” if the Obama administration files legal action to stop its implementation .
Atty .
Gen. Terry Goddard said he met Friday with a Justice Department official , who informed him of possible legal action and asked for his input .
Speaking at a Phoenix news conference , Goddard said he urged the administration not to sue , because five other legal challenges are pending .
The law , set to take effect July 29 , would require police to determine whether people they stop are in the country illegally .
Addressing concerns about racial profiling , Goddard also said he told the Justice Department official that Arizona police would enforce the law in a “ fair and highly professional manner . ”
The state is preparing a 90 - minute video to train 16,000 police officers on the legal and constitutional standards involved in implementing the law , he said .
A federal lawsuit , Goddard said , would detract from efforts to fight crime and secure the border against illegal immigration , which surged 70 % in Arizona from 2000 to 2008 .
Several polls have shown widespread support for the law in Arizona and nationwide .
“ We need solutions from Washington , not more lawsuits , ” Goddard said .
Hannah August , a Justice Department spokeswoman , stressed that Arizona officials were not told there would definitely be a federal lawsuit and that department officials were in the state primarily to “ ask questions and listen and discuss ” the matter with authorities .
“ We continue to have concerns that the law drives a wedge between law enforcement and the communities they serve and are examining it to see what options are available to the federal government , ” she said .
In a series of Memorial Day weekend events , immigrant rights advocates are preparing to march in Arizona , debate new legislative strategies in an emergency meeting there and protest against the Arizona Diamondbacks in Los Angeles .
Busloads of more than 200 labor , religious and civil rights activists left Los Angeles on Friday for Phoenix , where they plan to join as many as 50,000 others in protesting the law .
On Sunday , more than 100 leaders from major Latino organizations will convene in Phoenix to debate new strategies for winning some kind of immigration reform this year .
They are close to pushing a new approach as hopes dim for passage of comprehensive legislation that would overhaul key pieces of the entire system and legalize the nation ’s estimated 11 million unauthorized migrants .
Many members of the National Latino Congress , which represents more than 500 organizations , have become impatient with the Senate ’s failure to introduce a comprehensive bill and will debate shifting toward an incremental strategy pushing smaller measures , according to Antonio Gonzalez of the William C. Velasquez Institute , a nonprofit public policy analysis organization .
Activists are particularly pushing measures to grant legal status to undocumented college students and farmworkers , both of which are backed by powerful interests .
The so - called Dream Act , which would offer legal status to undocumented youths who attend college or join the military , is now included in the Pentagon ’s strategic plan for fiscal years 2010 - 12 as a way to maintain the nation ’s all - volunteer military .
And agribusiness has teamed up with the United Farm Workers union , along with U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , to push a bill to provide a stable supply of legal farm workers .

Why Do Budget Hawks Keep Invoking Reagan ?
Created : May 07 , 2010 15:32 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
This morning , Texas Rep. Kevin Brady , senior House Republican on the Joint Economic Committee , wondered aloud why Democrats faced with the recent recession did n’t adopt the same policies favored by Ronald Reagan during the economic downturn nearly 30 years ago .
“ President Reagan pursued pro-growth policies , including large reductions in marginal tax rates , deregulation and open trade , ” Brady said , arguing that those moves “ laid the foundation for two decades of prosperity . ”
In contrast , Brady continued , the Obama White House has tackled the current crisis by relying largely on deficit spending — a strategy Brady called “ reckless ” and “ clearly unsustainable . ”
“ Unless these excessive spending deficits and debt accumulation are quickly reversed , the United States may experience its own debt crisis , ” Brady said .
He was warning that the U.S. is en route to becoming the next Greece .
He did n’t mention the following :
When Reagan was elected to the White House in 1980 , the federal debt stood at roughly $ 908 billion .
Eight years and several tax cuts later , it was $ 2.6 trillion — a leap of 186 percent .
Put another way : Reagan racked up more debt in eight years than the previous seven presidents had managed in 35 — a span that included the Korean and Vietnam wars .
Some conservatives get this .
Earlier this year , Libertarian Party Executive Director Wes Benedict noted that Reagan ran “ the biggest - spending administration ( as a percentage of GDP ) since World War II . ”
Why he remains a conservative icon , despite that track record , is a mystery .
What went wrong in Greece ?
Greece 's economic reforms that led to it abandoning the drachma as its currency in favour of the euro in 2002 made it easier for the country to borrow money .
Greece went on a debt - funded spending spree , including high - profile projects such as the 2004 Athens Olympics , which went well over budget .
It was hit by the downturn , which meant it had to spend more on benefits and received less in taxes .
There were also doubts about the accuracy of its economic statistics .
Greece 's economic problems meant lenders started charging higher interest rates to lend it money and widespread tax evasion also hit the government 's coffers .
There have been demonstrations against the government 's austerity measures to deal with its 300bn euro ( £ 267bn ) debt , such as cuts to public sector pay .
Now the government is having to access a 110bn euro ( £ 95bn ; $ 146.2 bn ) bail - out package from the European Union and International Monetary Fund .
Greece 's problems have made investors nervous , which has made it more expensive for other European countries such as Portugal to borrow money .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT Eurozone members and the IMF have agreed a 110 bn - euro ( £ 95bn ; $ 146.2 bn ) three - year bail - out package to rescue Greece 's embattled economy .
In return for the loans , Greece will make major austerity cuts which Prime Minister George Papandreou said involved " great sacrifices " .
The EU will provide 80bn euros in funding and the rest will come from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
The deal is designed to prevent Greece from defaulting on its massive debt .
However , it must first be approved by some parliaments in the 15 other eurozone countries .
Luxembourg 's Prime Minister , Jean - Claude Juncker , said up to 30bn euros would be disbursed to Greece in the first year .
The first loan tranche will be released before 19 May - the date of Greece 's next debt repayment , he said .
The leaders of the 16 - nation Eurogroup will hold a summit in Brussels on Friday to " draw initial conclusions from the Greek crisis " , he added .
Shoring up confidence HEWITT ON EUROPE Gavin Hewitt
BBC Europe editor
This was a day the European Union never imagined - that what could turn out to be the largest bail - out ever would be needed by a country using the euro .
Rescuing Greece remains very unpopular , especially in Germany , but German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was the only way to ensure the stability of the single currency .
What persuaded eurozone countries and the IMF to lend Greece such a large sum was the fear that if Greece defaulted other countries like Portugal or even Spain could follow .
Plenty of doubts remain , however .
The Greek economy will shrink by 4 % this year and today 's cuts could deepen the recession .
What the plan does do is to buy time and shelter Greece from the fierce winds of the markets .
Read Gavin 's thoughts in full
The IMF is expected to approve its portion of the loan this week , IMF managing director Dominique Strauss - Kahn said .
In return for the financial support , the Greek government has unveiled a fresh round of sweeping efficiencies , including further tax rises and deeper cuts in pensions and public service pay .
The Eurogroup is trying to speed up rescue efforts for Greece amid fears its debt crisis could undermine other debt - laden states that use the single currency .
Anxiety about contagion has focused on Portugal , Spain and the Republic of Ireland .
Germany has been the most reluctant to bail out Greece , but its Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle said there was a " good chance " of getting German parliamentary agreement by Friday .
Yet he said Greece had to implement its new austerity programme " quickly " and " to the letter " .
' Evident ' anger The Greek economy is still deep in recession and on Sunday the government forecast that GDP would fall by 4 % in 2010 .
The country 's national debt - currently at about 115 % of GDP - would rise to 149 % by 2013 before falling , it added .
It is not going to be easy on Greek citizens , despite the efforts that have been made and will continue to be made to protect the weakest in society

Have your say Mr Papandreou told a televised cabinet meeting that active and retired public sector workers would bear the brunt of the new wave of budget cuts .
" With our decision today our citizens will have to make great sacrifices , " he said , describing public anger at the new wave of cutbacks as " evident " .
" Our national red line is to avoid bankruptcy , " Mr Papandreou said , adding that " no - one could have imagined " the size of the debt that the previous government , which left office last year , had left behind .
The austerity plan aims to achieve fresh budget cuts of 30bn euros over three years - with the goal of cutting Greece 's public deficit to less than 3 % of GDP by 2014 .
It currently stands at 13.6 % .
Measures include : Scrapping bonus payments for public sector workers
Capping annual holiday bonuses and axing them for higher earners
Banning increases in public sector salaries and pensions for at least three years
Increasing VAT from 21 % to 23 %
Raising taxes on fuel , alcohol and tobacco by 10 %
Taxing illegal construction Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said Greece had been called on to make a " basic choice between collapse or salvation " .
" It is not going to be easy on Greek citizens , despite the efforts that have been made and will continue to be made to protect the weakest in society . "
New emergency legislation authorising the cuts and tax rises is now being drafted and is due to be put before parliament for approval by the end of the week .
However unions have vowed to fight the round of austerity measures .
The third nationwide general strike in as many months is scheduled for Wednesday .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Greece 's austerity plans were " very ambitious " and would spur other troubled eurozone members to do all they could to avoid the same fate .
" These countries can see that the path taken by Greece with the IMF is not an easy one .
As a result they will do all they can to avoid this themselves , " Mrs Merkel told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper .

A Honda spokeswoman declined to discuss specific issues in the strike negotiations .
The intense media coverage may evoke historical memories of the 1980 shipyard strike in Gdansk , Poland , that gave rise to the Solidarity movement and paved the way for the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe .
But the reality here is much different .
Instead of tens of thousands of grizzled and angry shipyard workers , the Honda strike involves about 1,900 mostly cheerful young people .
And the employees interviewed say their goal is more money , not a larger political agenda .
“ If they give us 800 renminbi a month , we ’ll go back to work right away , ” said one young man , describing a pay increase that would add about $ 117 a month to an average pay that is now around $ 150 monthly .
He said he had read on the Internet of considerably higher wages at other factories in China and expected Honda to match them with an immediate pay increase .
Many workers at other factories in southeastern China already earn $ 300 a month , but they do so only through considerable overtime .
And even that higher income is not enough to embark on the middle - class dream in China of owning a small apartment and subcompact car .
Officially , though , the government is discouraging heavy reliance on overtime , and workers here said that Honda was not assigning much .
The strikers said that Honda mainly hired recent graduates of high schools or vocational schools .
And so , most are in their late teens or early 20s , representing a new generation of employees , many of whom had not been born when the Chinese authorities suppressed protests by students and workers in Tiananmen Square in 1989 — a watershed event whose 21st anniversary falls next Friday .
The profile of striking workers seems to run more along the lines of slightly bookish would - be engineers — perhaps without the grades or money to attend college — rather than political activists .
Besides their low wages , the workers seem focused on issues like the factory ’s air - conditioning not being cool enough , and the unfairness of having to rise from their dormitories as early as 5:30 for a 7 a .m. shift .
Workers said that in addition to their pay , they also received free lodging in rooms that slept four to six in bunk beds .
They also get free lunches , subsidized breakfasts for the equivalent of 30 cents and dinners for about $ 1.50 .

She was the fourth woman to be nominated in the directing category , after Lina Wertmüller , Jane Campion , and Sofia Coppola .

( Washington , DC , March 12 , 2010 ) The American Humanist Association ( AHA ) stepped forward today and offered to plan and fund a prom for the Itawamba County Agricultural High School in Mississippi .
The Itawamba County School District made headlines earlier this week by cancelling their prom rather than letting a lesbian student , Constance McMillen , bring her girlfriend as her date .
“ It ’s shameful that closed - minded members of the school board are prepared to deprive an entire class of students their prom over their outdated religious mores . ” said Roy Speckhardt , Executive Director of the AHA .
“ People can hold to any belief or no belief in this nation , but the school board misuses their position when they try to impose their beliefs on the student population in Itawamba . ”
McMillen was barred from the prom after making it known that she intended to bring a same - sex date .
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) of Mississippi became involved and demanded the school reverse its policy .
The school board responded by cancelling the prom .
“ The ACLU is doing good work in Mississippi , and we humanists can also bring resources to the table that will defend students from a repressive school board , ” added Speckhardt .
“ Prom is a special event for teens across America ; we ’ll make sure it ’s a special night for these students as well . ”
AHA members Todd and Diana Stiefel made a $ 20,000 grant available to the AHA for the purpose of holding a prom in Itawamba County .
The AHA will be discussing logistics with the pertinent parties today .
Humanists and freethinkers have a history of speaking up for the rights of all .
The AHA was among the first to support civil rights , equal pay for equal work , and the right of same - sex couples to marry .
Recently the AHA launched the LGBT Humanist Council to advance equality for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people and their families .
( www.lgbthumanists.org).
The American Humanist Association ( www.americanhumanist.org) advocates for the rights and viewpoints of humanists .
Founded in 1941 and headquartered in Washington , D.C. , its work is extended through more than 100 local chapters and affiliates across America .
Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that , without theism , affirms our responsibility to lead ethical lives of value to self and humanity .

Thousands of tonnes of oil have poured into the Gulf of Mexico after the disaster at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig over two weeks ago .
But how does this leak compare with the largest offshore spills on record ?
The current size of the Deepwater Horizon spill is hard to measure exactly , but attempts can be made to estimate it .
Based on oil flow calculations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , Dr Simon Boxall , a marine pollution expert , says a total current spill can be estimated at about 7,000 to 10,000 tonnes of oil .
( See factbox below for how this was worked out . )
But such estimates should always carry a caveat , he says , as these can be affected by factors such as the condition of the rig , the well and the quality of information available .
CHANGING ESTIMATES
After the incident on 21 April , first estimate of the volume of oil leaking to surface was about 1,000 barrels a day On 29 April this was increased to 5,000 barrels a day and remains unchanged
In terms of lives lost ( 11 workers died in the rig explosion ) , financial cost and environmental damage , the Deepwater Horizon incident is clearly serious .
But it is not one of the world 's largest spills in terms of size alone .
In fact , based on the estimate above , it would not register in the largest 50 single incident , offshore oil spills that have occurred worldwide .
Even the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill - despite the controversy and coverage - is not in the top 10 .
However the potential for damage caused by Deepwater Horizon is apparent when looking at the events of June 1979 in the Bay of Campeche , also in the Gulf of Mexico .
In that spill , the exploratory oil well Ixtoc 1 suffered a blowout and was n't capped until more than nine months later , having released 461,000 tonnes of oil in total .
With the current situation in the Gulf of Mexico still uncertain , Dr Boxall , of the University of Southampton , points out reasons for optimism .
A plan to place a giant funnel over the leak could change things dramatically , he says .
" They reckon they will reduce the flow by 80 % to 90 % .
And while there is no such thing as a good oil spill , the environment can cope much better with 70 tonnes a day than with 700 tonnes a day .
"
Only two of the spills in our list of the world 's largest originated from oil rig explosions , the rest are tanker - related .
The largest of these came also in 1979 , from the Atlantic Empress .
It collided with the Aegean Captain in the Caribbean sea , spilling 287,000 tonnes of oil .
But far bigger than any of these peacetime accidents is the amount of oil spilled in the immediate aftermath of the first Iraq War , 1991 .
Although not a single offshore spill , it saw massive oil leaks that easily dwarf Ixtoc 1 with an estimated 1.4 million to 1.5 million tonnes of oil released into the Persian Gulf by Iraqi forces as they retreated from Kuwait .
1 . Ixtoc 1 : 476,000 tonnes Bay of Campeche , Gulf of Mexico 2 .
Atlantic Empress : 287,000 tonnes Off Tobago , West Indies 3 . Nowruz Oil Field : 272 , 000 tonnes Persian Gulf 4 . ABT Summer : 260,000 tonnes 700 nautical miles off Angola 5 . Castillo de Bellver : 252,000 tonnes Off Saldanha Bay , South Africa 6 .
Amoco Cadiz : 223,000 tonnes off Brittany , France 7 .
Haven : 144,000 tonnes Genoa , Italy 8 .
Odyssey : 132,000 tonnes 700 nautical miles off Nova Scotia , Canada 9 .
Torrey Canyon : 119,000 tonnes Scilly Isles , UK 10 .
Sea Star : 115,000 tonnes Gulf of Oman Exxon Valdez : 37,000 tonnes Prince William Sound , Alaska , US Deepwater Horizon : 7,000 to 10,000 tonnes Gulf of Mexico
The biggest leaks are not necessarily the most environmentally destructive .
The tanker Exxon Valdez , which ran aground on Bligh Reef , Alaska , in 1989 , caused serious damage to the environment , killing thousands of seabirds as well as seals , sea otters , whales and fish .
The remote location in sheltered waters only accentuated the problems .
The overall impact of an oil spill cannot be measured solely on size ; weather conditions , the type of oil and the time it takes to stem the flow are just some of the many factors that also need to be considered .

When Steve Jobs introduced the iPad he was quick to shake his finger in the nose of the other devices out there attempting to fill the gap between cell phone and full - sized laptop , and in particular those market - dominating netbooks .
In Apple 's opinion , the iPad may be the gadget for surfing the web , watching movies , reading books and running apps , but it 's surely not the only game in town .
And if you are n't sold on the iPad , but happen to be someone who 's looking to buy a secondary computing device to use while traveling or while simply lying on the couch , your choices at the moment come down to netbooks and ... well , more netbooks .
And that 's not such a bad thing , especially if you need a feature Apple 's tablet can't offer , like multitasking , a keyboard , or Flash support .
So , before you get up on Saturday morning and run off to purchase that iPad , you may want to peruse the best current ( as well as coming ) alternatives we 've rounded up after the break .

As stock market stories go , the listing of Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical in China came with a few special ingredients : two low - key founders who have been turned into multibillionaires overnight ; a stake held by Goldman Sachs ; and pigs ’ intestines .
On Thursday , in their first day of trade on the Shenzhen stock exchange , the shares of Shenzhen Hepalink , a heparin supplier , rose 18.3 percent above the offering price , valuing the company at about 70 billion renminbi ( $ 10 billion ) .
The initial value and the sharp rise on Thursday recalled the days before Lehman Brothers collapsed , and the gains bucked another weak session for Asian stock markets .
The listing has most likely catapulted the founders , Li Li and his wife , Tan Li , to the top of the list of China ’s richest people ; the two hold about 288 million shares of the company they founded in 1998 , according to the state - run news agency Xinhua .
At a closing price of 175.2 renminbi , their stake is worth about 50.5 billion renminbi ( $ 7.4 billion ) .
This easily tops the estimated fortune of Wang Chuanfu , president and executive director of the BYD Company , which makes cars and rechargeable batteries .
He had been China ’s wealthiest man , with an estimated fortune of $ 5.1 billion , according to data compiled by Hurun Report , a research and publishing house based in Shanghai .
*** PLEASE FORWARD WIDELY *** PLEASE FORWARD WIDELY *** This is OUR City -- not Glenn Beck ’s or Sarah Palin’sProtest the Tea Party Bigots 11:45 AM , April 15 , ThursdayDaley PlazaCorner of Dearborn Street & Washington BlvdOn April 15 , tea party activists will rally at the Daley Plaza .
Incited by Fox News goon Glenn Beck and failed vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin , these fake grassroots activists are useful tools for corporate America ’s political agenda – including opposition to public funding of any kind for human needs , from health care to education .
While claiming to be for “ small ” government and limited spending , they cheer on U.S. war spending at the current rate of $ 2 billion dollars a day – almost 60 % of the federal budget .
They support the Obama administration ’s wars in Afghanistan , Iraq and Pakistan .
They have no problem with spending even more to expand war into Somalia and Yemen , threaten war against Iran , or interfere in Latin American countries such as Honduras and Venezuela .
Bigotry saturates tea party protests .
In March , tea partiers called Georgia Rep. John Lewis a " n****r. Lewis , a civil rights movement veteran viciously beaten by a white mob in 1961 , was outside the U.S. Capitol building as protesters began chanting " Kill the bill , kill the bill " at him .
When Lewis told them " I 'm for the bill , " people chanted , " Kill the bill , n****r. " " It was a chorus , " said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver ( D - Mo. ) , who heard the chants .
" In a way , I feel sorry for those people who are doing this nasty stuff -- they 're being whipped up . "
Another protester spat on Cleaver , who is also Black .
Tea partiers have called gay Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) " f****t " and taunted him with " lisping " chants .
They have systematically hazed sick and disabled people trying to testify at healthcare meetings , and their anti-immigrant and anti-Latino signs cross the line into open racism .
Sarah Palin herself has referred to indigenous people as “ Arctic Arabs , ” and said “ So Sambo beat the bitch ” when Barak Obama defeated Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Party presidential primary .
Chicago is a city of African - Americans , immigrant workers and union members .
Large and politically active Mexican , Puerto Rican , Arab , Muslim and LGBT communities make their homes here .
We have a long tradition of fighting for progressive political change -- from the Underground Railroad and the Haymarket Martyrs to massive marches for immigrant rights and undocumented people .
Let 's stand together on April 15 against these right - wing extremists .
The M20 coalition calls on all progressive - minded people and organizations to join us to protest the tea party bigots on tax day .
Do n’t let the bigots take over our city .

Dear Wall Street ,
This is your cash - strapped cousin , MainStreet , writing .
How the heck are you ?
It ’s been a while .
You seem to be doing great .
I know you were going through some tough times , with the whole financial meltdown , but with the big bailout , the stock market coming back , and those enormous bonuses , it seems like you ’re back on top .
And that ’s just super .
We ’re happy for you .
But to be honest , cuz , things are n’t going so great here on Main Street , and that ’s why we ’re writing .
You see , that recovery that you guys are enjoying on Wall Street , the one that ’s funding your huge salaries and bonuses , the one that we made possible through a taxpayer - funded bailout … that recovery has n’t really made it to Main Street .
I know you ’re super busy following the markets and buying gold and stuff , but the news from Main Street remains pretty troubling .
The unemployment rate is stuck at 9.7 % , which is close to a 20 - year peak , foreclosure rates continue to rise while housing prices drop and personal bankruptcies are up sharply .
Plus , banks still are n’t lending .
It ’s tough to get a mortgage , but it ’s REALLY tough to get a small business loan .
According to some estimates , the credit market is tighter than it has been in 30 years and it could only get worse for us when interest rates start to rise , which is bound to happen sooner or later .
Listen , I do n’t want to be a buzz kill .
I know you guys are just starting to breathe easy again and enjoy your recently reconstituted giant piles of money , but we need to have a talk .
People say that this financial crisis was everybody ’s fault .
They say that Wall Street played a role , but that Main Street shares some of the blame too .
But let ’s be honest with ourselves , and each other .
We know that this is almost entirely your fault .
Relax .
This is not about blame or finger pointing , and yes , people on Main Street took on risky debt that they could n’t afford .
That happened .
But why did that happen ?
Why were banks throwing money at the most high risk people ?
They did that so that their mortgages could be bundled into securities that were overvalued and would ultimately fail so that certain people on Wall Street could bet against them .
It ’s all laid out in the SEC ’s lawsuit again Goldman Sachs ( and I know you have your own ideas about Goldman ) .
Now , President Obama has outlined a number of reforms , and I ’m sure you ’re worried that this is all turning into a big media showdown between Wall Street and Main Street ( and I know you have your own ideas about what Obama should be saying to the American people ) .
But let me assure you , Main Street is n’t looking to take you down .
I mean , Main Street does n’t even exist in the same way that Wall Street does .
You ’re one entity that has relatively uniform and clear ideals : the preservation of the free market system with as few encumbrances as possible .
On the other hand , there are thousands of Main Streets filled with millions of people and many different points of view .
We reached out to our residents and found a couple of thoughts that that we ’d like to share with you .
David Backlin from Fort Smith , Ark. , asks ,
“ Why should the general public have to pay for THEIR mistakes ? ”
A lot of people on Main Street feel this way , and I ’m sure you can understand why .
With regard to the bailout , the answer , as painful as it is to admit , is that it may have been cheaper for us to pay for your mistakes in the short run than do nothing and watch us both fail .
Or maybe you just bought off a bunch of Senators and Congressman .
As far as all of the other forms of payment – primarily the lost equity and income – well , we should n’t have had to pay that .
But that ’s all water under the bridge , and we ’re trying to look forward now .
Which brings me to another voice from Main Street that I ’d also like you to hear , Wall Street .
This note comes from David Riley , of Shelby Township , Mich .
“ The banking industry has EVERYONE by the short hairs , but such is a debt / creditor system …
I 've come to this resolve that either Main Street ( Wall Street included ) will run free , or the government will run free ; if I have to choose which gets to run free ... it should be Main Street ( & Wall Street ) .
… Main Street ( & Wall Street ) free = freedom , and the price we pay for being a free society .
The government running free = tyranny for the people !
There 's really no way around this ( save the life hereafter ) ! ”
Now , Mr. Riley makes some sense here .
First , he points out that we ’re in this together .
Furthermore , Main Street is pretty divided on the question of whether more regulation will fix these problems .
So whether or not our often incompetent federal regulators manage to gain some more oversight over the financial industry , we ’d like to ask you for a favor .
In exchange for us funding your financial adventures - with our taxes , 401 ( k ) s , investments , etc. - we ’d like to ask you to exercise a bit of restraint .
The next time you ’re putting together a deal , look to more than profits as a goal , and take a few minutes to consider whether or not it will have a negative impact on Main Street .
This is where you ’ve got to be really honest with yourself , Wall Street .
If you conclude that the deal is bad for Main Street ( and bad for America ) , maybe you should figure out another way to make money .
Stop smiling .
We ’re serious about this .
We know you guys are very good at pulling the wool over the eyes of the SEC ( when they happen to be paying attention ) and we both know that even if the government passes new laws , there will always be a few guys on Wall Street smart enough to figure out a way around them .
Sooner or later the rest of you guys will catch on , and before we know it we ’ll have another meltdown .
So , we really need you to step up to the plate here and promise us that you are really going to change .
It probably would n’t be a bad idea to enroll in some sort of 12 - step program and start seeing a shrink .
I think a little introspection could be good for you .
Anyway , in exchange , we ’ll continue to funnel our money through 401 ( k ) s and IRAs , and we might even bail you out if you get into some real trouble .
We ’re not asking for a mile , more like an inch .
We ’ll also try not to think about the fact that the average CEO makes as much as 262 times that of the average worker ( in 1978 it was only 35 times as much ) or the fact that Goldman Sachs paid out record bonuses this year ( somewhere between $ 19 and $ 22 billion total – an average of more than $ 500,000 per employee ) .
We ’ll also try not to think about the fact that you ’re probably reading this article on the deck of your Wi-Fi enabled , $ 12 million yacht in the Caribbean .
Yours ,
Main Street
Dexter star Michael C. Hall has “ fully recovered ” from cancer , says his wife .
The actor has returned to work on the hit show , in which he plays a serial killer who targets other murderers .

Jennifer Carpenter ( pictured with Michael at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in LA in January of this year ) has confirmed he is in remission and back on deck .
She also said her husband was “ incredibly brave ” when he announced in January he was undergoing treatment for Hodgkins lymphoma , a cancer that attacks the lymph nodes .

With the start of the Group Stage of the World Cup in South Africa drawing nearer and nearer it ’s time for us to take a look at some of the Arsenal players in the World Cup .
The 12 Arsenal players in the World Cup this summer is a testament to the ever expanding North London club .
Here I ’m going to take a look at some of the players who made their squads and how they ’ll impact their teams chances at world glory .
But to start off , let ’s take a look at one player who astonishingly did n’t make the 30 - man cut , Samir Nasri .
Nasri : Arguably one of the most important players for the gunners this year .
He has shown that he can pick himself up after getting injured during pre season training in Austria and perform at his best .
France is really losing a great player who would have added great skills to the midfield .
He has great technique , speed and excellent vision which allow him to roam freely in the park .
Why did n’t France decide to include him the squad ?
Because Domenech lacks “ tact ” and “ class ” according to Patrick Vieira .
If there was a moment for Nasri to shine for his country , it would have definitely been this moment .
Domenech has made a big mistake and will be fired after the World Cup due to his own mistakes .
Clichy :
He ’s a great player but has n’t really proved that he can be great quality for Arsenal .
Let us not forget that he did have a 3 month layoff due to a back injury but he also has competeition from Evra and Abdial who are also great players .
I do n’t think that Clichy would beat out Evra for a spot on the team but he can beat Abidal because he has n’t really had a great season also .
Clichy would provide speed and great attacking schemes on the left side for France but I really do n’t think he will receive many starts mainly because Evra has been amazing this season .
Gallas : Coming off a really great season with the help of Vermalean , Gallas is facing a fitness test that Domenech has been heavily imposing lately .
If he does make the squad , he will do great .
Many players who come off great club seasons end up having great international performances .
Gallas is a great leader for the defense and he is the face of toughness for France .
Many people say that he has an atittude issue but its mostly because he loves his team and teammates and he hates seeing his team go down so he will always give 100 % which is something France needs .
Diaby : I will constantly say this , he is the next Vieira .
Size , skills and aggressiveness , he has it all .
France needs this guy and it is good that they will have him .
He can play nearly every offensive position on the pitch and he can do it well .
My prediction is that after this World Cup he will prove why he deserves a starting spot on Arsenal and why Wenger made a good choice by signing him .
Sagna : Seeing him running up and down the right flank made him the most consistent player on Arsenal .
He is always consistent and never gives you a bad performance .
He has the mentality of a winner and is never scared to back down .
He will offer great support for the right flank of France .
With his attitude of serving the team , France can really use him since Domenech ca n’t serve the team .
Fabregas : Coming back from his performance against Barcelona , he will offer a threat for Spain .
A player like Fabregas , who is described by Wenger as “ 4 years ahead , mentally ” and “ an expert in passing ” by Messi , will have a great World Cup experience .
This will give him the chance to take over the midfield position in the future for Spain .
His techniques and vision will make Spain revolve the game around him .
Spain is known for using every player when it comes to building up a great play .
Fabregas will get the most touches for Spain this summer .
Senderos :
A great player that has n’t impressed Wenger which explains the loans that he has been on .
He is a great addition for Switzerland mainly because he has Serie A and EPL experience which is probably the best thing on his CV .
I ca n’t really say much about him because he really has n’t been getting much playing time while on loan this season .
The only positive note is his height .
He will get the nod and it will be his last chance to show Wenger why he is worthy to be a gunner next season .
Van Persie : Prior to his injury , he was in amazing form .
After he came back from his injury , he continued to perform great .
He will get the nod to start for Holland this summer and he will continue his great form this summer .
He has great and very quick technique which makes him hard to cover .
With his speed , Holland have a real threat and if they use him correctly , they can go very far in the tournament .
Vela :
A great player who has great potential but has n’t been able to get a whole lot of playing time for the gunners .
He has great skills and amazing patience when he plays the game .
Mexico wo n’t go too far in the tournament and Mexico wo n’t be able to play enough games so Vela can get one start in .
He will probably be used as a sub and will probably not be used because of his lack of experience .
Walcott :
He will be used in the same way Arsenal uses him .
With his blazing speed , England will deploy him in the right side 60 minutes into the game .
He does n’t have many skills that will make him a regular and he faces much competition from his fellow English teammates which is going to make it hard for him to start .
After being used as a substitute against Barcelona in the Emirates , Capello knows how to use him for the World Cup .
Song :
With the help of his uncle who was also called up , Song will perform and hold the midfield for Cameroon .
He has great tackling abilities which make him a threat .
After this season he has built the confidence that players need in order to perform at the top level and will show why Wenger has been so patient with him .
He does lack on the number of goals he has scored this season but he does not need to score to play great .
All he needs to do is to hold the midfield and hold his ground so he can win tackles .
Bendtner : After filling in the Van Persie role for Arsenal , he will do great for Denmark even though they wo n’t get too far this summer .
The only thing he lacks is speed and quickness .
He has great vision and size which are both a threat but he is too slow when it comes to passing the ball and giving it to another player .
He needs to develop better quickness so he can become a real threat and become the next Van Persie .
This summer he will do average mainly because the players around him will also do average this summer .
Eboue : Ivory Coast will always need a player like Eboue .
With their star studded lineup , Eboue offers speed , great technique and a positive attitude that every team wants on their team .
He will probably play in the right back position but if they feel that they can use him on the offensive positions of football then they have a great choice by picking him up .
With his skills , he can play anywhere in the park and he will always give 100 % no matter where he plays even if he is on the bench through his great attitude .

Our Favorite Summer Seasonals
Bell 's Oberon Michigan , 5.8 % ABV
If you live in a place where Bell 's is distributed and your fridge is n't full of Oberon right now , you should go take care of that and then meet us back here .
This American wheat ale is clean and drinkable , crisp and beautifully integrated .
It has subtle grassy hop notes and a hint of apricot and citrus , a whisper of vanilla and a long wheaty finish .
It 's a simple - seeming beer that rewards careful attention ; the delicate flavors unfold as you continue to taste it .
Good stuff .
****1/4
Goose Island Summertime Illinois , 4.7 % ABV
This fresh - tasting Kölsch - style beer would be perfect with a lobster roll or a mustard - smeared bratwurst .
It pours light yellow - gold and has a nice creamy mouthfeel .
It 's dry and balanced with hints of apricot and peach ( it could totally replace a bellini at brunch ! )
We 're big fans .
****
Blue Point Summer Ale New York , 4.39 % ABV Vibrant and fresh , with hints of lime , kumquat , and honeydew , this bright and flavorful part - wheat beer is one of the best summer seasonals available locally .
One taster noted a slight quinine flavor , but all agreed that it was a favorite .
****
Boulevard Brewing ZŌN Missouri , 4.4 % ABV
Make your Blue Moon - drinking friends try this Belgian - style witbier as soon as possible -- this one is rich and creamy , with nice yeasty ale character and subtle fresh coriander flavor .
The bright burst of orange peel reminded some tasters of Orangina soda .
Well balanced and perfectly refreshing , this well - made beer should be paired with a giant bowl of guacamole and a really hot day .
****
Firestone Walker Solace California , 6 % ABV
The brewery calls this beer a Belgo - Bavarian Zwickle Saison ; we just call it delicious .
It pours unfiltered hazy orange , with rich notes of caramelized banana and rum-roasted pineapple .
Crisp hops keep it refreshing , adding guava and tangerine notes to an earthy Wheat Smacks maltiness .
Try this with Asian dishes made with ginger and / or orange , or pair with grilled fish or shrimp .
***3/4
Choc Summer Belgian - Style Blonde Ale Oklahoma
This might be a bit richer and sweeter than you 're looking for in summer , but it 's a solid Belgian - style beer .
It 's full - bodied and cloudy , with hints of clove , banana , caramel , and orange peel .
***3/4
Brooklyn Summer Ale New York , 4.5 % ABV
It was interesting to stack up our local directly against the rest : be assured , New Yorkers , it 's a solid choice .
More flavorful than many other summer options , the Brooklyn Summer is mostly malty , with hints of fresh sourdough bread and a burst carbonation and bittering hops ( we tasted sage , lemongrass , and orange zest ) .
The finish is clean .
***3/4
Sierra Nevada Summerfest California , 5 % ABV
This flavorful take on pilsner is well integrated and a bit mellower than we expected .
It still bursts with pungent , resiny hops -- this is Sierra Nevada , after all .
We tasted a hint of orange / lemon oil and were slightly reminded of the scent of Pinesol , but not in a bad way .
***3/4
More Summer Sippers
Smuttynose Summer Weizen Ale New Hampshire , 5.8 % ABV
This beer has a subtle floral note ( the brewers tossed a bunch of chamomile flowers in at the end of the boil ) but it 's not overwhelming .
This well - integrated beer is very dry with mellow wheat and yeast flavors .
***1/2
Schlafly Helles - Style Summer Lager Missouri , 4.5 % ABV
This refreshing beer pours pale yellow , and would definitely be gulpable on a hot day .
It 's clean with a hint of toasted popcorn sweetness ; there 's very little bitterness here , which might make it appeal to those who are new to craft beer .
***1/2
Peak Organic Summer Session Ale Maine , 5 % ABV
There 's no warning on the bottle , but this is a pretty seriously hoppy beer !
The scent is pine and floral , and the first sip yields a burst of dry grapefruity flavor .
The crackery malts and Amarillo hops make this a very flavorful and super - dry beer ; it will definitely be too bitter for some .
***1/4
Breckenridge Summerbright Colorado , 4.5 % ABV
This crisp , sessionable beer has grainy cornbread flavor and enough citrusy crispness to balance it .
I would be happy to have this one in the fridge , though some of our tasters wanted something bolder .
***1/4
Saint Arnold Summer Pils Texas , 4.9 % ABV
This beer 's a little smoother and richer than most pilsners , without some of the sharpness we 've come to expect from the style .
We tasted a hint of peach and apple on this generally delicate and drinkable beer .
***1/4
Sweetwater Road Trip Georgia , 5.3 % ABV
With crisp , piney bitterness and sweet malt , this beer veers toward grassy .
Some tasters felt that the flavors got a little muddy .
***1/4
Anderson Valley Summer Solstice Cerveza Crema California 5.6 % ABV
This super- malty , copper - brown beer may not be what your usually expect from a summer ale , but once you get over that it 's pretty tasty .
We noted hints of maple candy and coffee syrup ; some tasters found it a little too sweet for them but thought it might go nicely with molasses - barbecued ribs or chicken in mole sauce .
***
Harpoon Summer Beer Massachusetts and Vermont , 5 % ABV
This Kölsch - style offering from Harpoon is dry and crisply bitter ; it has hints of lemon pith , fruity green grapes , and almost no sweetness .
Though some tasters found it a little bit metallic , others thought it would be perfectly refreshing on a super - hot day .
***
Anchor Summer Beer California , 4.6 % ABV
This beer was the first American wheat beer brewed in modern times .
It 's solid and simple , wheaty and dry .
It 's quite mellow and drinkable , if unexciting .
We prefer Anchor 's other offerings .
**3/4
Schell 's Zommerfest Minnesota , 5 % ABV
A drinkable spin on the Kölsch style , though not as full - flavored as some of the others .
It packs a bitter punch and finishes very clean and crisp , with a hint of grassiness .
Not a bad choice , especially if available fresh locally ( and probably better on tap ) .
**3/4
River Horse Summer Blonde New Jersey , 4 % ABV
This is a simple beer with a bit of toasted grain flavor and a sprinkle of lemon / lime .
It 's a little thin , but drinkable .
**3/4
Not Really Our Thing
Copper Canyon Summerzest Blonde Ale Michigan , 5.5 % ABV
This beer brewed with ginger , orange and lemongrass , adding spice and richness to the nice caramel malt flavor .
The dry flavor of the spices might not be what everyone 's looking for in the summer , but the tartness of this beer makes it refreshing .
Pair with pad thai .
**3/4
Pyramid Curve Ball Blonde Washington / Oregon / California , 5 % ABV Drinkable , but simple .
The grainy malt contributes a rye toast flavor , though we found this a little sour .
**1/2
Troegs Sunshine Pils Pennsylvania , 5.3 % ABV
Even though our tasters are generally fans of bitter beers , this one was a bit over the top for them .
On the front end , there 's a hint of mango sweetness , but the crisp bitterness then overwhelms and a hint of charcoal lingers on the finish .
**1/2
Geary 's Summer Ale Maine , 6 % ABV
This Kölsch - style beer pours darker than the Goose Island , and has a bit of spicy nutmeg and clove flavor , banana esters , and a grassy bitterness .
Some tasters liked it , but others wished the flavors were a bit more integrated ( and detected a hint of Band - Aid flavor . )
There 's a bit of toasted grain nuttiness that might make this a good beer to pair with barbecue .
**1/2
Blue Moon Honey Moon Summer Ale Colorado , 5.6 % ABV
This beer ( manufactured like its year - round sibling by Molson Coors ) is pretty much flavorless .
We were able to detect a hint of honey , but not much of the orange peel that it 's supposedly brewed with .

3 celery stalks , cut in large chunks 2 large white onions , quartered
2 large white onions , quartered 1 head of garlic , halved
1 head of garlic , halved 1 turnip , halved
1 turnip , halved bunch fresh thyme
bunch fresh thyme 2 bay leaves
2 bay leaves 1 teaspoon whole black peppercorn
Preparation :
Place the chicken and vegetables in a large stockpot over medium heat .
Pour in only enough cold water to cover ( about 3 quarts ) ; too much water will make the broth taste weak .
Toss in the thyme , bay leaves , and peppercorns , and allow the liquid to slowly come to a boil .
Lower the heat to medium - low and gently simmer for 1 to 1 1/ 2 hours , partially covered , until the chicken is done .
As it cooks , skim any impurities that rise to the surface ; add a little more water , if necessary , to keep the chicken covered while simmering .
Carefully remove the chicken and place it on a cutting board .
When it ’s cool enough to handle , discard the skin and bones .
Then , hand - shred the meat and put it into a storage container .
Carefully strain the stock through a fine sieve into another pot to remove the vegetable solids .
Use the stock immediately , cover , and refrigerate for up to one week , or freeze .

I am an enthusiastic user of the Verisign PIP two - factor authentication service .
It ’s a system that allows you to add additional security to sites that support OpenID by adding a one - time - password as a second factor of authentication .
So , even after you ’ve authenticated to sites like e-Bay and PayPal ( many big sites support it ) , you are prompted for a second value as seen below on PayPal :
With only a quick look , this seems pretty cool .
I ’m being asked for a second factor of auth–even after I ’ve logged in !
But hold on a second .
What ’s this stuff at the bottom ?
So let ’s see what that leads to–probably some sort of high - speed out - of - band deal .
Ouch .
It gives you standard “ forgot my password ” options .
And if you pick the last one on the list , you get decade - old security , i.e. user - controlled secret questions .
Great , my double - bolted titanium front door just got bypassed by having nothing but a screen door on the patio .
All that coolness … all that security –gone .
PayPal is giving the attacker an option : either bypass a two - factor authentication system , or , guess the name of my high school .
And yes , I realize that this all takes place after initially authenticating with a standard password .
But if PayPal is going to make a big deal about partnering with Verisign to implement two - factor authentication , they should n’t implement it in a way that effectively makes it an illusion .
Give people the option to disable simple questions and to require an out - of - band method for reset .
Something .
Anything .
Just not this . ::
[ A reader has correctly pointed out that the issue is with PayPal , not with Verisign , as PayPal is the one providing the bypass .
I ’ve updated the title and closing comments to make that more clear . ]
Penn State University prides itself on academics , athletics and “ improving the well - being and health of individuals and communities , ” according to its mission .
But in Brazil , there is a different view of Penn State .
The university is the largest holder of blood samples from an Amazon tribe known as the Yanomami .
In 2006 , the Brazilian government formally asked for the blood back .
Today , the blood still sits in a freezer in State College .
The samples have created a worldwide ethical firestorm .
They were collected in the 1960s by two American researchers .
Accounts vary on how much the tribe understood what was happening and whether the tribe was promised medical and other assistance that it never received .
That is a debate for another day .
It was an era before “ informed consent ” was the norm much like the case of the African - American woman Henrietta Lacks whose cells were taken from a cancerous tumor when she died in 1951 and used for medical research .
In the case of the Yanomami blood , there is a clear way to put things right : return the blood so it can be destroyed in the Yanomami custom .
The tribe believes all parts of the dead must be destroyed before a person can depart this world .
Penn State was once seen as a hero in this decadeslong saga .
After the Brazilian government made its formal request , Penn State is credited with getting the other holders of the blood — the American Cancer Institute and three other universities — on board with the notion of returning the blood samples .
State College is housing one of the other university ’s samples in an effort to streamline the return .
Everything seemed on track for a smooth transition .
But here in 2010 , Penn State is gaining a negative reputation for not keeping its word and drowning the situation in red tape .
When we called Penn State this week to inquire about the status , spokeswoman Lisa Powers reaffirmed the university ’s commitment to returning the blood , but said , “ We have never been given a specific person to send the blood to and in what manner . ”
That answer falls flat .
A Brazilian newspaper reported last week that a plan is in place to have the universities and American Cancer Institute bring their samples to Washington , D.C. , where the Brazilian health agency ( called Anvisa ) would then take over and transport the blood back to Brazil and ultimately to the Yanomami people .
There have been enough excuses .
While there are many parties involved in this seemingly simple transaction , concerns about how to transport the blood or that the universities could be liable for any hiccups in the return should have been sorted out in the last five years .
Enough is enough .
As Robert Borofsky , an anthropology professor at Hawaii Pacific University and author of a book on the Yanomami ordeal says , “ It ’s like the oil spill in the gulf .
There is enough blame to go around about everything , but now we need to keep everyone focused on returning the blood . ”
It ’s time to make good on the university ’s word .
Let Penn
State be the hero again by being the first to get the blood on its way to Washington , D.C. , this year and ultimately back to Brazil .
The matter and the blood should finally be laid to rest .
WASHINGTON —
In the movies , a president confronted with a massive oil spill would dispense with politics , go after his own crooked industry contributors for paying off regulators and ban future offshore drilling , cost be damned .
He might even fly down to personally shut off the leak .
It ’s a lot easier to be a movie president , of course , at least if you are the hero of the piece .
No matter what the crisis , no matter what the odds , you can be reasonably sure you will dispatch the biggest threat confronting the nation , and within two hours .
No cloture vote needed .
This is the weekend when Hollywood and Washington come together for the annual White House Correspondents ’
Association dinner , a once - journalistic event now transformed into a red- carpet celebrity affair where the visiting actors gawk at the politicians and the pols gawk right back .
Let ’s face it , Hollywood and Washington have been infatuated with each other for a long time , a mutual crush that has peaked again now that the largely liberal entertainment industry has a new favorite in the Oval Office .
“ We ’re each natural groupies of the other , ” said Dan Glickman , a former Democratic congressman and later chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America .
Indeed , one Hollywood actor , Kal Penn , put aside his career for a while to take a minor role in President Obama ’s White House .
And on Saturday night ’s guest list were several other presidents , including Michael Douglas ( “ The American President ” ) , Morgan Freeman ( “ Deep Impact ” ) and Jack Nicholson ( “ Mars Attacks ! ” ) .
" Chris Wallace was * this close * to looking at Trump and saying , ' N ---- , you got to shut the f--- up !'

Google has announced that it has rebuilt Google Docs from the ground - up .
The result is a massive overhaul of Google Docs , including completely redesigned spreadsheet , document , and drawing editors , group chat functionality , and the ability to collaborate with real - time character - by - character mark - up , much like Google Wave .
You can preview the new changes , starting today .
The one word that describes today 's updates is collaboration .
Google believes that " collaboration is broken " : People make revisions to the same document , but one bad save by a late person can ruin the whole document .
Thus Google 's belief is that creating a browser version of collaboration software that bridges the gap between the desktop and the web is key to better collaboration and quicker innovation .
Google Docs : A Complete Rebuild
The rebuilt Google Docs focuses on addressing those issues , starting with the document editor .
One of the biggest changes is that collaborators can now see what others are typing character - by - character .
In addition , up to 50 people can now collaborate on one document .
The company has also added a chat feature that allows collaborators to discuss a document in a popup that appears on the right - hand side .
Here 's what it looks like :
You might notice that Google Docs feels more like a word processor like Microsoft Word .
This is no accident : Google deliberately added features such as rulers , tab stops , spell - check as you type and floating images .
Spreadsheets have also gotten a hefty upgrade : new features include auto - complete , the ability to drag - and - drop columns and faster load times .
The best one , though , is probably autofill :
The final addition is a new " drawing editor " for Google Docs , which allows you to draw and download images that can be copied and pasted into multiple Google Docs .
Up to 50 people can draw at the same time ( we think that sounds chaotic , but have n't tried to draw with 50 people yet ) .
Finally , the images that you create can be published and embedded onto the web .
Here 's an image depicting the new drawing editor :
Google 's very proud of the newest version of Google Docs ; it compares it very favorably against Microsoft Office , only conceding that Office has more advanced ( or , in Google 's opinion , niche ) formatting features .
Collaboration , mobile access , multi-user editing and IM functionality are all things that Google touts .
What do you think of the new Google Docs ?
Is it enough to switch from Office ?

Throughout the offseason , I ’ll recap the Devils 2009 – 2010 season , covering the good , the bad and the ugly .
I ’ve already covered the Devils overall season , their solid record against the Atlantic Division , and the team ’s powerplay .
In this post , I ’ll take a look at Martin Brodeur , who had a strong bounce - back season after last season ’s torn biceps injury .
Coming into the 2009 – 2010 season , the Devils , for the first time in what seems like forever , had a question mark in goal .
Brodeur , the career leader in wins , missed four months with a torn biceps injury .
Despite his absence , the Devils still soared , reaching 51 wins last year .
Everyone realized Brodeur would come back an excellent NHL goalie .
But the injury did raise a slight red flag , and the smallest question mark loomed over Brodeur .
Whatever questions critics or fans had , Brodeur answered this past season .
Brodeur started 77 games this season , going 45 - 25 - 6 with nine shutouts .
The 77 games started were the first time in two years Brodeur started that many games .
The 45 wins and nine shutouts were tops among NHL goaltenders .
On April 19 , the NHL named Brodeur a finalist for the Vezina Trophy , along with Ryan Miller of the Buffalo Sabres and Ilya Bryzgalov of the Phoenix Coyotes .
Brodeur clearly came back strong after the first major injury of his career .
Brodeur , in what seems to be normal the past few years , set several career milestones this season .
On November 27 , 2009 , Brodeur broke the record for career minutes played by a goaltender , breaking Patrick Roy ’s record of 60,275 during the second period of the team ’s 2 - 1 shootout win .
Ten days later , the Devils ’ goalie tied Terry Sawchuk for first - place on the all - time shutout list with 103 in a 3 - 0 win over the Sabres .
On December 19 , Brodeur broke another Roy record , this for the most games played by a NHL goaltender .
Then , on December 21 , 2009 , in one of the sweetest moments of the season , Brodeur shut out the Pittsburgh Penguins , 4 - 0 , to break his tie with Sawchuk for the shutout record .
Brodeur also reached the 600 win plateau with a 3 - 0 shutout win over the Atlanta Thrashers on April 6 .
Brodeur continued to shatter records throughout the year .
But as the Devils entered the playoffs , Brodeur faced questions about his lackluster postseason play .
I even questioned it , wondering whether Brodeur needed rest to be sharper for the playoffs .
But , once again , Brodeur would prove me wrong .
This season ’s postseason numbers are n’t impressive ( 1 - 4 , .881 save % , 3.01 GAA ) , but I would blame his defense for failing to clear pucks and players from the front of the net .
Overall , I ’d say Brodeur was one of the only Devils to show up in their first - round loss .
He constantly made big saves , keeping the team in Game Three .
With an inferior goalie , the Devils would have been swept and beaten soundly .
One of the only reasons they were competitive was the play of Brodeur .
He did give up some weak goals , but he made some phenomenal saves , including the robbery of Simon Gagne :
Overall , Brodeur had a typical Brodeur season .
He started almost every game , collected over forty wins , and posted solid statistics .
He did face adversity , even admitting he struggled in the Olympics and the post - Olympics to find his rhythm .
Yet , in the end , Brodeur came back strong , helping the Devils to win their ninth straight Atlantic Division title .
A protein discovered in fruit fly eyes has brought a Johns Hopkins team closer to understanding how the human heart and other organs automatically " right size " themselves , a piece of information that may hold clues to controlling cancer .
The protein , named Kibra , is linked to a relay of chemical signals responsible for shaping and sizing tissue growth by coordinating control of cell proliferation and death , according to research published Feb. 16 in Developmental Cell by teams at Johns Hopkins and Florida State University .
In a series of experiments , the scientists manipulated Kibra 's role in a signaling network called the Hippo pathway , which consists of several proteins working together as a braking system .
Counterparts of the components in the Hippo pathway in flies are found in most animals , suggesting that this pathway may act as a " global regulator " of organ size control , according to Duojia Pan , Ph.D. , a professor of molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
" People have always been curious about what makes a hippopotamus grow so much bigger than a mouse , " says Pan , " as well as how our two hands , which develop independently , get to very similar sizes .
Our studies show that Kibra regulates Hippo , which keeps organs characteristically sized , preventing my heart or your liver from becoming as hefty as those befitting a large African amphibious mammal , " he adds , referring to the signaling pathway 's name .
Pan 's team identified the gene they named Hippo in 2003 , showing that an abnormal copy of it led to an unusually large eye in a developing fruit fly .
Two years later , the team established that Hippo lies in the middle of a signaling cascade :
Its " stop growing " message is relayed along a molecular pathway of biochemically linked proteins , which limits the expression of genes that otherwise promote cell division and cell survival .
In 2007 , they showed that by manipulating the pathway in a mouse liver , the organ grew to five times its normal size and became cancerous .
The new experiments , Pan says , moved the investigation " slowly and methodically upstream " to find Hippo 's trigger , where , he believes , " the key to size - control lies . "
The Hippo - Kibra link could be a key to understanding and treating cancer , Pan adds , because cancer is literally a disease of uncontrolled growth .
The Johns Hopkins and Florida State teams discovered Kibra by studying ovarian cells from adult flies and by using a gene - controlling technique called RNA interference ( RNAi ) to systematically turn off each of the approximately 14,000 genes in the fly genome , one at a time , in cultured fly cells .
They then analyzed the function of Kibra in the developing fly larvae .
Each of the specialized discs that develop into a fly 's eyes starts out with approximately 30 to 40 cells and then grows by about a thousand - fold in the larval stage before stopping , making larvae the ideal place to catch the right - sizing process in action , Pan says .
These studies told them that the Hippo pathway was not active in the absence Kibra .
Further studies on human cells measured the activity of the Hippo pathway while manipulating human Kibra and showed that like its fruit fly counterpart , human Kibra acts as a tumor suppressor protein that regulates Hippo signaling .
" The discovery of Kibra moves us an important step closer to identifying the initial signal that triggers Hippo's activation , " Pan says .
" We 're making progress along the Hippo pathway , heading toward the cell surface , and believe we will find that elusive signal en route . "
The name Kibra , a shortened combination of the words kidney and brain , is based on earlier evidence that Kibra is prominently expressed in those two organs .
Kibra 's role in memory performance in humans has already garnered interest .
Authors of the paper , in addition to Pan , are Jianzhong Yu , Stephen Klusza and Wu-Min Deng of Florida State University ; and Yonggang Zheng and Jixin Dong of Johns Hopkins .

VANCOUVER , BRITISH COLUMBIA - Taking vitamin D supplements during pregnancy is not only safe for mother and baby , but also can prevent preterm labor / births and infections , according to results of a randomized controlled study to be presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies ( PAS ) annual meeting in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada .
In the 1950s and '60s , people were concerned that vitamin D could cause birth defects , according to Carol L. Wagner , MD , lead author of the study and a pediatric researcher at Medical University of South Carolina .
It now is known that vitamin D is important for maternal and infant health , including bone health and immune function .
Recent studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is a serious public health issue .
" Diet does n't provide enough vitamin D , and we do n't go in the sun as much as we need , " Dr. Wagner said .
Therefore , she and her colleagues , including Bruce W. Hollis , PhD , who has worked in the field of vitamin D research for the last 30 years , set out to determine the optimal dose of vitamin D supplements for pregnant women without doing harm .
Researchers randomized 494 pregnant women at 12 - 16 weeks ' gestation into three treatment groups .
Group one received 400 International Units ( IU ) of vitamin D a day until delivery ; group two received 2,000 IU and group three received 4,000 IU .
The women were evaluated monthly to ensure safety .
" No adverse events related to vitamin D dosing were found in any of the three arms of the study , " Dr. Wagner said .
Investigators also looked at the effects of vitamin D supplementation on complications during pregnancy , including preeclampsia , gestational diabetes , infections , and preterm labor and birth .
" The spectacular part of the study was it showed women replete in vitamin D had lower rates of preterm labor and preterm birth , and lower rates of infection , " Dr. Wagner said .
The greatest effects were seen among women taking 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day .
Therefore , the researchers recommend this daily regimen for all pregnant women .
###
Dr. Wagner will discuss the two parts of the study in separate presentations .
The outcomes of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy will be presented on Saturday , May 1 , and the safety of vitamin D supplementation will be presented on Sunday , May 2 .

About 15,000 feet up on Tibet 's desolate Himalayan - Tibetan Plateau , an international research team led by Florida State University geologist Yang Wang was surprised to find thick layers of ancient lake sediment filled with plant , fish and animal fossils typical of far lower elevations and warmer , wetter climates .
Back at the FSU - based National High Magnetic Field Laboratory , analysis of carbon and oxygen isotopes in the fossils revealed the animals ' diet ( abundant plants ) and the reason for their demise during the late Pliocene era in the region ( a drastic climate change ) .
Paleo - magnetic study determined the sample 's age ( a very young 2 or 3 million years old ) .
That fossil evidence from the rock desert and cold , treeless steppes that now comprise Earth 's highest land mass suggests a literally groundbreaking possibility :
Major tectonic changes on the Tibetan Plateau may have caused it to attain its towering present - day elevations -- rendering it inhospitable to the plants and animals that once thrived there -- as recently as 2 - 3 million years ago , not millions of years earlier than that , as geologists have generally believed .
The new evidence calls into question the validity of methods commonly used by scientists to reconstruct the past elevations of the region .
" Establishing an accurate history of tectonic and associated elevation changes in the region is important because uplift of the Tibetan Plateau has been suggested as a major driving mechanism of global climate change over the past 50 - 60 million years , " said Yang , an associate professor in FSU 's Department of Geological Sciences and a researcher at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory .
" What 's more , the region also is thought to be important in driving the modern Asian monsoons , which control the environmental conditions over much of Asia , the most densely populated region on Earth . "
Yang co-authored the paper with paleontologists from the Department of Vertebrate Paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County , and the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology , Chinese Academy of Sciences ( Beijing ) .
The collaborative research project , which since 2004 has featured summer field study on the remote Tibetan Plateau , is funded by a grant from the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology Program of the U.S. National Science Foundation .
" The uplift chronology of the Tibetan Plateau and its climatic and biotic consequences have been a matter of much debate and speculation because most of Tibet 's spectacular mountains , gorges and glaciers remain barely touched by man and geologically unexplored , " Yang said .
" So far , my research colleagues and I have only worked in two basins in Tibet , representing a very small fraction of the Plateau , but it is very exciting that our work to - date has yielded surprising results that are inconsistent with the popular view of Tibetan uplift , " she said .
This summer , Yang and her colleagues from Los Angeles and Beijing will conduct further fieldwork in areas near the Tibetan Plateau .
" The next phase of our work will focus on examining the spatial and temporal patterns of long - term vegetative and environmental changes in and around the region , " she said .
" Such records are crucial for clarifying the linkages among climatic , biotic and tectonic changes . "
There is much still to learn and understand about those changes .
" Many of the places we 've visited in Tibet are now deserts , and yet we found those thick deposits of lake sediments with abundant fossil fish and shells , " Yang said .
" This begs the question : What came first and caused the disappearance of those lakes ?
Global climate change ?
Or , tectonic change ? "
Elected in 2014 , and re-elected in 2018 , Governor Ducey has applied his experience from a successful career in business to bring much - needed change to Arizona government .
Upon taking office , the governor inherited a $ 1 billion budget deficit .
He quickly took action and balanced the budget in his first year — without raising taxes .
Today , the state budget is balanced with a one billion dollar surplus and a record one billion dollars in its Rainy Day Fund .
Business is thriving and more people are moving to Arizona than almost anywhere in the country .
Committed to investing in public education , Governor Ducey led a historic and bipartisan effort to invest $ 3.5 billion into K - 12 schools in his first year , injecting more dollars into Arizona ’s classrooms .
With a focus on teacher pay , the governor also successfully championed the passage of legislation to increase teacher pay 20 percent by 2020 .
Governor Ducey has cut regulations and simplified taxes every year to stimulate job creation and economic growth .
He ’s also prioritized public safety , creating the Arizona Border Strike Force , a statewide , multi-agency effort to combat border - related crime .
By working across party lines , Arizona has led the way on some important public policies .
In 2015 , Arizona became the first state in the nation to pass the “ American Civics Act , ” requiring students to pass a civics test — the same test those seeking to earn American citizenship must pass — in order to graduate high school .
It was the first bill Governor Ducey signed into law .
In 2019 , Arizona became the first state to provide universal recognition of occupational licenses from other states , a priority of Governor Ducey ’s outlined in his January state of the state address .
Governor Ducey remains committed to making Arizona a land of “ Opportunity for All ” and has pledged to work every day to make that vision a reality .
***
Governor Ducey was born in Toledo , Ohio .
He moved to Arizona in 1982 to attend Arizona State University , where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Finance .
He and his wife , Angela , live in Paradise Valley with their three sons , Jack , Joe and Sam .
He is Arizona ’s 23rd governor .
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that juveniles who commit crimes in which no one is killed may not be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole .
Five justices , in an opinion by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , agreed that the Eighth Amendment ’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment forbids such sentences as a categorical matter .
“ A state need not guarantee the offender eventual release , ” Justice Kennedy wrote , “ but if it imposes the sentence of life , it must provide him or her with some realistic opportunity to obtain release before the end of that term . ”
The ruling marked the first time that the court excluded an entire class of offenders from a given form of punishment outside the context of the death penalty .
“ ‘ Death is different ’ no longer , ” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in dissent .

Medical Information For Cats
Author
Most cats will reach about 11 or 12 years of age .
Some make it 18 and very few to 20 and beyond .
Much of this will depend on whether or not a cat is indoors or allowed outdoors .
Outdoor cats average about 8 years and indoor only cats quite often reach 15 or more years of age .
As for " cat years " versus " human years " , according to material provided by the Gaines Research Center , cats will age 15 years in the first year ( 10 in the first six months ! ) and 4 years for every year after that .
Other vets will say 20 years for the first year , 4 years for each year thereafter .
Cats can suffer from a wide range of allergies .
A cat with one allergy often has others .
15 % of all cats in the U.S. suffer from one or more allergies .
Cats ' allergies fall into several categories , each with a parallel complaint among human allergy sufferers .
Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne articles , such as pollen , that irritate the nasal passages and lungs .
Contact alllergies manifest themselves when the cat has prolonged contact with a substance that it just cannot tolerate .
Cats have allergies to foods as well -- not so much to the chemical preservatives but to the grains , meats and dairy products used .
Some cats react badly to certain drugs , such as antibiotics or anesthesia .
Flea allergy is the most common of all allergies .
As cats age , their sensitivity to flea bites increases .
Prednisone ( oral or injection ) is commonly used for a bad reaction .
Between 5 & 10 percent of allergy cases are caused by food .
Like contact allergies , food allergies will show up as dermatitis and severe itching but in some cases will also cause vomiting and diarrhea .
Also , the cat may have excessively oily skin , ear inflammation , or hair loss ( which can also be a sign of hormone imbalance ) .
A food allergy does n't show up overnight .
It can take from a week to 10 years of exposure to show itself ; more than 80 percent of cats with food allergies have been eating the allergen - containing food for more than two years .
Studies are being done to determine possible connections between food allergies and FUS , with some success in eliminating foods and cutting down on FUS symptoms .
Results are still experimental .
Food allergies are treated with a bland , hypoallergenic diet -- rice with boiled chicken or lamb , and distilled water is commonly used .
Two weeks is the longest it usually takes for the bland diet to work .
Causes , symptoms , and treatments of some types of allergies :
Plants , especially oily - leafed ones , such as rubber plants , that might be brushed against .
Other contact allergens include : carpet fresheners , wool , house dust , newsprint , cleansers and topical medications .
Even the carpet itself .
Signs of contact allergens : dermatitis , pigmentary changes or skin eruptions .
Most noticable on the chin , ears , inner thighs , abdomen , underside of the tail , armpits and around the anus .
Skin patch tests are used to determine cause of contact allergies .
Medications that commonly cause skin eruptions : penicillin , tetracycline , neomycin and panleukopenia vaccine .
Each drug causes different symptoms , but the symptoms differ from cat to cat .
There is no way to predict how a cat will react .
Antihistamines or steroids may be used to eliminate symptoms ( after ceasing administration of the drug )
Kitty litter - when new brands of litter come out , vets frequently see a number of cats that have reactions to it .
Other inhalant allergies can include : dust from the furnace esp .
when it is first turned on ; cigarette smoke ; perfumes ; household sprays and air freshners ; pollen .
Inhalent allergies can also result in skin loss , scabbing pustules , or ulcerated areas on the skin .
This in addition to the asthmatic symptoms .
Treatment uses ... antihistamines , such as chlortrimetron .
More severe cases are treated with systemic steroids , which can have drawbacks .
Feline urinary syndrome or FUS is the name given to a group of symptoms that occur in the cat secondary to inflammation , irritation , and / or obstruction of the lower urinary tract ( urinary bladder , urethra , and penile urethra ) .
A cat with FUS can exhibit one , some , or even all of the symptoms .
FUS is NOT a specific diagnosis : there are many known and some unknown factors that may cause or contribute to FUS .
Any cause resulting in particulate debris in the urine is capable of causing obstruction in the male cat .
Males are much more likely to get this disease than females .
There is no known means of prevention .
Treatment can vary from diet to surgery .
Cats usually recover if the disease is caught in time ; often the cat must be watched for any recurrence of FUS .
May appear periodically during the life of the cat .
Females : straining to urinate , blood in the urine , frequent trips to the litter box with only small amounts voided , loss of litterbox habits .
Males :
In addition to the above symptoms , small particles may lodge in the male urethra and cause complete obstruction with the inability to pass urine - this is a life and death situation if not treated quickly .
Obstruction usually occurs in the male cat and is most often confined to the site where the urethra narrows as it enters the bulbourethral gland and penis ; small particles that can easily pass out of the bladder and transverse the urethra congregate at the bottleneck of the penile urethra to cause complete blockage .
( note that the female urethra opens widely into the vagina with no bottleneck ) .
Symptoms of obstruction are much more intense than those of bladder inflammation alone ; this is an emergency requiring immediate steps to relieve the obstruction .
Symptoms include :
Frequent non-producing straining - no urine produced , discomfort , pain , howling .
Gentle feeling of the cats abdomen reveals a tennis ball size structure which is the overdistended urinary bladder .
feeling of the cats abdomen reveals a tennis ball size structure which is the overdistended urinary bladder .
Subsequent depression , vomiting and / or diarrhea , dehydration , loss of appetite , uremic poisoning , and coma may develop rapidly within 24 hours .
Death results from uremic poisoning ; advanced uremic poisoning may not be reversible even with relief of the obstruction and intensive care .
Bladders can be permanently damaged as a result .
In general : any condition that causes stricture , malfunction , inflammation , or obstruction of the urethra .
In addition , any condition that causes inflammation , malfunction , or abnormal anatomy of the urinary bladder .
Known causes
Struvite crystals accompanied by red blood cells -- generally caused by a diet too high in magnesium relative to the pH of the urine .
Fish - flavored foods tend to be worse
The ability of a given diet to cause problems in an individual cat is highly variable : only those cats with a history of this kind of FUS may respond well to strictly dietary management .
Many cats do not have problems with a diet that may produce FUS in some individuals .
Bladder stones , may occur from struvite crystals , or be secondary to bladder infections .
There are metabolic disorders ( not all are understood ) that result in a higher concentration of a given mineral that can remain in solution ; hence stones are formed .
Diet may greatly modify the concentration of a given mineral in solution in the urine .
Water intake may modify the concentration of all minerals in the urine , and bacterial infection increases the risk of stone formation .
Anatomical abnormalities such as congenital malformations of the bladder and / or urethra ( early neutering is NOT a factor ) OR acquired strictures of the urethra and / or scarring of the bladder .
Trauma .
Neurolgenic problems affecting the act of urination ( difficult to diagnose except at institutions capable of urethral pressure profiles )
Primary bacterial infection -- RARE !
Tumors ( benign / malignant )
Protein matrix plug ( generally urethral obstruction of males ) ; can be from non-mineral protein debris , viral - based , other causes are unknown .
Suspected or unknown factors include non-bacterial infections , toxins , stress , and seasonal influences .
Obstruction of the male cat is a medical emergency .
The obstruction must be relieved immediately .
Failure to produce a good stream of urine after relief of obstruction is indicative of urethral stricture and / or stones or matrex plugs .
Failure of bladder to empty after relief of obstruction suggests bladder paralysis ( usually temporary unless present prior to obstruction ) .
In either event , a urinary catheter must be placed to allow continual urination .
Treatment of uremic poisoning requires IV fluid therapy with monitoring of blood levels of waste products until uremia is no longer present .
Permanent urethral damage with stricture , inability to dislodge a urethral obstruction , or inability to prevent recurring obstructions are all indications for perineal urethrostomy ( amputation of the penis and narrow portion of the urethra to create a female - sized opening for urination ) .
This procedure is usually effective in preventing reobstruction of the male cat , but this procedure should be a last resort
If FUS is indicated without obstruction , 75 to 80 % of FUS cats without obstruction may be sucessfully managed by diet alone if urine reveals typical crystals and red blood cells .
Unobstructed male cats or non-uremic obstructed males who have a good urine stream and bladder function after relief of an early obstruction may be managed as above initially .
Cats who are symptom - free after 7 to 10 days of dietary management and who have normal follow - up urines at 21 days , may be maintained indefinitely with dietary management only .
DL - Methionine is often prescribed for cats with FUS .
Most commonly , FUS - specific diets contain this acidifier .
Antibiotics may be used .
Distilled water for FUS - prone cats is often recommended as well .
Treatment may consist of a carefully regulated diet to keep blood sugar levels consistent ( especially if the diabetes was triggered by obesity ) .
In most cases , daily injections of insulin are needed .
Regular vet visits are required to determine the proper dosage .
In between visits , using urine glucose test strips available from the pharmacy helps you determine whether the dosage of insulin is sufficient .
A bottle of Karo syrup or maple syrup kept handy is essential for bringing the cat out of dangerously low blood sugar levels .
Diabetic cats should be kept indoors to prevent accidental feeding ( and thus disturbing the regulation of blood sugar levels ) .
You can try changing ( temporarily ) the cat 's diet to one or more of the following ( depending on the cat 's preferences ) :
boiled rice
cottage cheese
bread
plain yogurt
boiled chicken
chicken broth
baby food ( strained meat varieties )
The vet may or may not prescribe medication .
One - half teaspoon of kaopectate ( NOT peptobismol , it contains aspirin ) usually works pretty well too .
The vet may recommend withholding food for 24 - 48 hours to give the GI tract a rest before starting with some bland food .
Usually diarrhea lasts only a few days .
If it lasts longer than that , as long as the cat does not have a fever , it usually does not mean anything serious , but you must protect the cat from dehydration by making it take in plenty of liquids .
Causes of acute ( sudden onset ) diarrhea
Infections Viral Panleucopenia ( distemper ) Feline Leukemia Virus Coronavirus Rotavirus Astrovirus Bacterial Salmonella Campylobacter Escherischia coli ( not documented in cats ) Parasitic Roundworms Hookworms Coccidia Giardia Toxoplasma
Diet esp. dietary change or raid on the garbage
Toxic or drug - induced Acetominophen ( tylenol ) antibiotics
Miscellaneous partial intestinal obstruction
Causes of chronic diarrhea
Viral and Bacterial FIV FeLeuk Salmonella Campylobacter Clostridium
Parasites as above , except Toxoplasma
Dietary sensitivity
Miscellaneous Inflammatory Bowel Disease Drug Sensitivity Inappropriate use of antibiotics Bacterial overgrowth ??
Partial intestinal obstruction Idiopathic ( no known cause )
This disease impairs the cat 's immune system and it will often fall prey to some other opportunistic disease .
While the virus is related to HIV , it is NOT possible to contract AIDS from a cat with FIV .
FIV - positive cats should be kept inside and away from other cats .
With this and other precautions , they may live a fairly long time .
Because of their subsceptibility to secondary infections and complications , these cats are rather vet-intensive .
They do not often die directly from FIV , but rather one of the diseases that they can get when their immune system is impaired .
FIV appears to involve three stages : acute ( swollen lymph glands , fever , depression , bacterial infections ) ; latent ( apparent wel being , can last months to years ) ; and chronic ( cat is susceptible to all kinds of other viruses , fungii , and bacteria ) .
Survival over two years is rare .
Vaccines for FHV -1 , FCV , and Chlamydia are available and are generally given as part of the standard kitten shot series .
These vaccines protect against systemic infection ( symptoms like fever , diarrhea , pneumonia ) but they do not give such good protection against local infection of the upper respiratory tract ( symptoms like sneezing , runny eyes ) .
A vet will usually prescribe a broad spectrum antibiotic to clear up secondary bacterial infections , but there is no real cure for the viral infection , just management of it .
As in human herpes virus infection , cats may develop a latent infection that causes virus shedding or mild recurrent attacks when the cat is stressed .
If you know your cat has had herpes virus infection , try to keep your cat from getting stressed ( when that 's possible ) .
If he is under stress , he can begin to shed the virus again without showing any signs of being sick himself , which means he may infect other cats .
Note that FHV affects only cats .
Do n't worry , you can't get herpes from your cat !
Regular doses of Tapazol .
Surgery to remove most of the thyroid .
This is a difficult and potentially dangerous operation ( especially for an older cat ) , and it is not necessarily effective .
That is , it will reduce the thyroid activity , but not necessarily stop the runaway thyroid growth -- it may only reduce or delay the problem and you 'll have to give Tapazol anyway .
At the other extreme , you might also end up having to give the animal thyroid supplements ...
Radioactive Iodine treatment of thyroid .
This is reported to be very effective in solving the problem .
The troubles are it is very expensive , and it means leaving your cat at the facility where it is done for up to two weeks ( they have to monitor the cat to make sure all the radioactivity is gone before letting it go home ) .
Leaving a cat at a facility where there are other cats can expose it to the health problems of the other cats there .
On the other hand , a cat that suddenly starts to vomit , or vomits more than usual or in some way demonstrates a departure from its normal habits should be checked by the vet .
To help prevent this kind of vomiting , feed your cat on a regular basis some petroleum jelly ( aka as Vaseline ) .
If they do n't like it , you can try Petromalt , a malt - flavored petroleum jelly .
Pats of butter will also work .
To give it to them , if they wo n't eat it of their free will , smear some on top of their paw and they will lick it up as they clean it off .
Be careful to rub it in thoroughly , otherwise when they shake their paw , you 'll have gobs of vaseline go flying onto the walls or carpet .
Give it to them daily for a few days if they 've just upchucked or are in the midst of dry heaves ; go back down to a weekly dose once they 've gotten rid of existing hairballs and this should keep them hairball free .
Frequent brushing also helps ; every bit of hair on the brush is less hair in your cat 's stomach .
Another common reason for vomiting is overeating , particularly dry food .
The dry food absorbs water and swells , and then they have to throw it back up .
If the vomit looks like a semi - solid tube of partially digested cat food , that 's probably what it is .
A cat may vomit when it is allergic to its food .
You can check this out by trying another brand of food with substantially different ingredients and no food colorings .
Sometimes cats vomit when they have worms .
Consult your vet for a worming appointment .
If the vomit is white or clear , that can be one of the symptoms of panleukopenia , feline distemper .
If such vomiting occurs a coule of times over the course of a day or night , a phone call to the vet is in order .
If cats eat something that obstructs their digestive system , they may try to vomit it back up .
If you can see some of it in their mouth , DO NOT PULL IT OUT , especially if it is string .
You may just cut up their intestines in the attempt .
Take the cat to the vet immediately .
If the cat displays other changes of behavior along with the vomiting , you should consult the vet .
Eg. listlessness , refusing food along with vomiting may indicate poisoning .
Periodic throwing up can be a sign of an over - active thyroid .
This is particularly common in older cats .
Your vet can do a blood test and find out the thyroid level .
It can also be indicative of a kidney infection : something that your vet can also check out .
In general , as distasteful as it may be , you should examine any vomit for indication of why the cat vomited .
sudden change in diet
ingestion of foreign material ( garbage , plants , etc )
eating too rapidly
intolerance or allergy to specific foods
specific reactions to certain drugs
accidental overdosages
Lead , ethylene glycol , cleaning agents , herbicides , fertilizers , heavy metals all specifically result in vomiting .

acidosis
heat stroke
obstruction ( foreign body , disease or trauma )

There ’s no telling if the two events are connected , but their timing is mighty interesting .
The Polish government and the National Bank of Poland , in a “ rare moment of unity , ” agree to weaken Poland ’s currency , the zloty , in an act that would benefit Poland ’s exporters at the expense of Poland ’s trading partners — that is , the European Union , among others .
Then , the next day , Poland ’s president and the president of its national bank die in a plane crash .
From the Wall Street Journal in an item dated April 9 , 2010 :
In one of those rare moments of unity , the National Bank of Poland and the Polish government agreed on the need to weaken the Polish zloty , which over recent weeks has rebounded close to its pre-crisis strength .
The currency ’s strength is now seen a possible threat to economic recovery .
After several verbal interventions over the past few days , the central bank intervened with real money Friday , for the first time in more than a decade .
The bank followed through on its Thursday warnings that it is “ technologically and psychologically ” prepared to enter the currency market to prevent “ excessive strengthening of the zloty . ”
Government officials also said earlier this week that the “ strong zloty ” is damaging growth and , after Friday ’s intervention , said they fully back the central bank ’s move .
In moving to weaken the zloty , Poland ’s leadership was placing the interests of the people of Poland ahead of the interests of the European collective known as the European Union .
Then , the next day , the president of Poland dies in a plane crash along with numerous other top leaders , including the president of the National Bank .
From the Mail Online :
Polish president Lech Kaczynski and his wife Maria have been killed after their plane crashed on approach to Smolensk airport in western Russia .
Russian news agencies reported at least 87 people died in the crash near Smolensk airport in western Russia , citing the Russian Emergencies Ministry .
They reported 132 people were aboard the Tupolev Tu-154 .
The Army chief of staff , Gen. Franciszek Gagor , National Bank President Slawomir Skrzypek and Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Kremer were on the passenger list .
Poland has been dragging its feet in adopting the euro and joining the European Union , having pushed back its target date for doing so until 2015 .
Here in the U.S. , we might say that Poland is not a “ team player . ”
In the New World Order , bad things tend to happen to leaders who are n’t team players .
POSTSCRIPT : Finally , nearly a week after Government Against the People first raised these questions , the New York Times has reported that there are questions about the crash .
Russia has been forced to admit that the theory that the president coerced the pilot into landing is merely that–a theory .
Our follow - up is here .
Not to be too hard on the New York Times .
It ’s not a bad little newspaper , its crossword puzzle is the gold standard , and the paper was certainly influential in its day .

European Finance Ministers have put together a $ 1 trillion rescue package for Greece and the next possible dominoes in European capitalism ’s fall – Spain , Portugal , Italy and Ireland .
Italy ’s public debt , at 115 % of GDP , for example , is the same level as Greece’s .
This rescue package is for German and French banks to whom these countries are heavily indebted .
The banks ’ exposure to Greece is about $ 150 billion of which half is owed to French banks .
Multiply that by a factor of twenty and you get some idea of the level of indebtedness once the other debt ridden countries are included .
With the inconclusive British election results – it ’s called democracy – the markets have begun to turn an eye towards the UK which , with public debt at 68 percent of GDP is actually higher than Spain’s .
This is also about saving the euro .
The deal gives about $ 600 billion in guarantees to the banks .
If any country defaults European governments ( including those indebted countries ) will meet the debts .
In effect this means Germany and to a lesser extent France are promising to repay debts if their Euro zone partners default .
While the German economy is strong , it does n’t have the capacity to support the struggling Euro nations .
The danger is that in the next few months it will be dragged down the hole that the threat of sovereign default has created .
At the moment no money has changed hands because guarantees are only promises .
Even if Greece ‘ stabilises ’ other countries are on the hit list of the lenders and their interest rates will have to increase the levels they cannot afford , unless of course their governments massively attack social services and wages in their own countries .
The package is an attempt to provide ‘ certainty ’ to lenders and investors .
What it does in the slightly longer term is threaten Germany .
The announcement includes $ 300 billion from the IMF , which comes with strict austerity conditions attached as does a $ 100 billion quick release European stabilisation fund .
The results of austerity programs are clear to see from Greece .
What is happening there is a portent for the rest of Europe .
Average incomes have fallen 20 percent this year alone .
Pensions have been cut and the pension age increased .
New plans include spending cuts of 36 billion euros in the next three years .
This is 11 percent of the country ’s gross domestic product .
The ‘ Socialist ’ Government will freeze public sector wages for 3 years and take away their Easter and Christmas bonuses ( about two months pay ) with more cuts in benefits looming .
The Greek consumption tax is going to increase to 23 percent .
Angry Greek workers have responded with 3 general strikes in the last months .
On 5 May hundreds of thousands of Greek workers struck , stopping the country .
100,000 workers demonstrated across Greece against the austerity measures which will destroy their lives .
How has all this come about ?
The demands of workers after the second world war and then the long boom coming out of the permanent arms economy provided a carrot and stick to the bourgeoisie to improve workers ’ living standards .
The steady decline of profit rates in the industrialised West since the 70s however has seen that compact break down .
The rise of neoliberalism has been as a tool for attacking workers ’ living standards to increase the share of national product going to capital at the expense of labour .
Other countries , often fearful of an industrial backlash , borrowed to keep living standards at levels workers become accustomed to .
Now the chickens are coming home to roost .
30 years of the neoliberal experiment has n’t worked as the seemingly inexorable decline and stagnation of profit rates continues , based on more and more investment in capital at the expense of labour .
The latest financial turmoil reflects that underlying crisis of profitability and reinforces it .
The bankers do not have any faith in major European economies and the major European states , as lenders of last resort , together with the IMF , have stepped in .
But what happens when the last resort becomes the last post ?
The battle in Greece is set to be replayed across Europe as the financial crisis worsens and spreads and the bankers demand more and more attacks on the living standards of European workers to prop up profit rates .
The victory of Greek workers over the cuts would be an historic win and set an example for the rest of Europe .
It could even open up the possibility of a new world based on democracy and production being organised to satisfy human need .
Penny Rimbaud interview
by Richie Unterberger
Q : Crass had to fight legal prosecution on a few occasions .
What were the circumstances behind them ?
P : Really , there was two major situations .
One was very early on .
We were still with Small Wonder Records in those days , who were the people who had put out our first 12 - inch record .
We had difficulty getting the first track pressed , the first track being called " Reality Asylum . "
It was being pressed in Ireland .
The actual people on the shop floor objected to the content of the first track .
So we left a three - minute silence , or the length of the track silence , at the beginning of the album .
So that the management of Small Wonder were n't under any threat from it , we decided to press it ourselves as a single .
We found someone who'd do it in England .
Shortly after we released it , Small Wonder was raided by Scotland Yard 's vice squad , whose normal job is to sort of raid porn shops in Central London .
They could n't really understand quite why they 'd been sent out to a cottage in the Essex countryside to investigate the record .
They were completely out of their depth , basically .
There had been a similar case several years earlier with the Gay News [ which ] was prosecuted under exactly the same thing they were writing up , which was criminal blasphemy .
Which I do n't think exists in any other western country .
So they were investigating us on a case of criminal blasphemy .
Having interviewed us , they then said they were going to put it before the director of public prosecutions .
About six months later , we actually heard that they had decided to drop the case .
But we were given a very stern warning not to release any similar material , which naturally encouraged us to release more .
We then moved our material away from Small Wonder .
When we released Feeding the 5000 , we put the track back onto it .
We did a new version for the single release , we did an extended version .
Following that , obviously what the authorities had decided was that rather than prosecuting us and risking another sort of Pistols pantomime , we heard very soon after the case had been dropped that they were hassling shops , they were raiding shops throughout Britain , with no grounds whatsoever , they had no legal grounds to do so .
But they were just harassing ... mostly small shops , telling them that they were liable to prosecution if they sold our material .
Which of course had no legal backup whatsoever , but it was sufficient to scare off a lot of the small shops from stocking our stuff .
The authorities , rather than making a big newspaper case out of it , just decided to harass people individually throughout the country .
It clearly was a form of policy , which would have the same effect , or a better effect , than making us public names .
That followed us right through , from that point on we were in constant , sort of having problems , always at third hand , from the authorities .
We were never raided , we were never directly harassed .
But anyone who was arranging gigs , selling our material , etc. , was very liable to harassment .
Then basically we did n't get threatened with any sort of prosecution until after the Falklands War .
We released " How Does It Feel To Be Mother of a Thousand Dead , " which referred to Thatcher obviously .
She was actually asked , in the prime minister 's question time , whether she 'd listened to the record by a sympathetic left - wing member of Parliament , sympathetic to us , that is .
[ Someone ] was sort of given the job of opening prosecution against us this time for obscenity .
That completely failed .
The newspapers picked up on that very quickly .
Because we were quite hot news at the time , because we 'd actually divulged quite a bit of official secrets about the Falklands War .
We had a contact who was actually serving in the Falklands , so we actually got a lot of classified information sent to us by him , which we were able , one way or another , to sort of get out .
We ended up on the radio being confronted by [ conservative ] Tim Eggar .
Basically , he was completely flattened by our arguments .
At that point , the Tories withdrew proceedings , which had n't gotten any further than the director of public prosecutions looking at the case .
That was the second near - skirmish .
The third one was a prosecution , where a shop in Manchester was raided .
A large amount of material , including Dead Kennedys material , was taken by the police .
They put together , again , an obscenity case against us .
We lost the first round , and then we took it to appeal .
We decided to fight it in Manchester .
Having fought it in London , then it would have set a precedent .
Which would have meant had we lost , that we would n't have been allowed to sell our material anywhere in Britain .
As it goes , we 're still not able to officially sell our material in the Chester area of Manchester .
We took it to appeal .
We won the appeal , except on one count .
They managed to [ classify one ] track obscene , which actually was a sort of feminist statement about Chinese foot binding , mostly .
But obviously the magistrate sitting in the court probably reflected on his own sort of predilections .
So he found us guilty of obscenity on that .
We were fined peanuts for it .
But the case actually had cost us a phenomenal amount of money in terms of , if ever there was a time at which we were very nearly buried by what we put money into , that probably was it .
We 'd been promised money and support from quite a few of the underground distributors and the alternative music biz .
But when it actually came to it , we got very little support , and certainly very very little finance .
So it cost us a phenomenal amount .
It was probably the first time that we were actually encountered financial difficulties , really .
So maybe that story about the VAT thing stemmed from that .
We certainly had a problem at that point with money , which we had n't had up until then .
Mounting the case had cost us a phenomenal amount , and taking it to appeal had cost us a phenomenal amount .
All the way through , there was sort of mild harassment .
Those were the three sort of major situations , where the harassment was overt .
Q : What were the most important ways Crass ' music evolved over their career ?
P : I do n't really think one can talk in those terms .
I think after our first two albums , I think we responded .
I do n't think we were involved in sort of any evolutionary process , in the sense that we were n't a band for musical or lyrical reasons .
We were a band for political reasons , and therefore increasingly , as the years wore on , we were producing stuff out of response social situations .
Therefore , artistic or aesthetic considerations did n't really come into it .
I think we became increasingly angry , increasingly aware of our impotence , which makes our work increasingly more desperate .
But it was desperate in response to what was happening in the country , or globally , at the time .
It 's almost an irrelevant question , ' cause I do n't think we were in the least bit involved in developing as a band .
I do n't think that entered into the equation .
I think we simply ... our political analysis broadened , then narrowed , and broadened , or whatever it did .
And what we produced as a band was a reflection of where we stood politically .
Our response to things was n't a musical or a lyrical response , it was a political response .
I think that we brought to our music a wide range of influences .
But then they were n't employed as musical influences , if you understand .
We were n't a band .
We never were a band .
I do n't think we even saw ourselves as a band .
I certainly never saw ourselves as a band .
We certainly did n't belong in the sort of pantomime of rock 'n'roll , and probably even less in the pantomime of what became known as punk .
It was n't our interest .
I mean , we were n't interested in making records .
We were interested in making statements , and records happened to be a way of making statements .
It would have been nice to have had that time to think , it would nice to use a C sharp there .
But it was n't like that .
Maybe it was right at the beginning , where we were sort of consciously doing something .
But as the sort of machinery sort of grew , it demanded this , or it demanded that .
The machine demanded whatever response was necessary , particularly during and after the Falklands , where probably we lost our rag as a band .
I think we 'd probably blown it by then .
We were no longer being particularly rational .
I do n't think we ever were , particularly .
But certain situations were just so appalling , it starts to become sort of absurd to try and deal with it through that medium .
It 's sort of absurd to compare the Falklands with Vietnam , for example .
But protest songs , protest rock 'n'roll , can just be a joke against the real situation .
I think , certainly from the Falklands , I felt that .
And I think probably other members of the band did too .
It 's too serious to be dealing with in this possibly superficial way .
That was a big question for us over the last few years .
Obviously , no musical consideration comes in .
The considerations were , should we be doing this at all ?
Q : Can you see Crass ' influence on contemporary music and culture ?
P : We 're inseparable from the entire youth movement of the moment .
What we contributed was so broad , and so powerful , so invasive , that I think it 's in everything .
And I do n't think I 'm being pompous in that .
In everything alternative - - from the road protest to class war to feminist cells , whatever , to the American hardcore movement to the Polish , whatever .
It 's everywhere .
I do n't think there 's any single , individual influence .
I think that would be irrelevant .
Like the hippie movement .
People say , oh , it was just people wandering around with sort of long hair .
It was n't .
If you look at any health food shop or book shop or la la la , you 'll find the sort of effects of that movement .
Likewise with Crass and the sort of movement that it spawned .
I certainly think without Crass , none of what has now looked back as the effects of punk ... it would have had no effect at all .
I mean , the Pistols and that group , those commercial people , lasted for about two years .
They were just an extension of the usual music business tactics .
They had no sort of political overview whatsoever .
It was us that introduced a meaningful overview into what was then called punk .
And bands similar to us .
It 's an untold ...
I do n't think you could even quantify it .
It 's sort of like saying , well , what influence did Jean - Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir have ?
They wrote a few books that you might like or you might not like , but their influence is global .
I think it 's likewise with us .
I do n't think that 's pompous to compare ourselves with the sort of French existentialists .
They were similarly sort of authentic movement who had this profound global effect in all sorts of untold ways , I think .
I can see a bit of us in everything .
In a funny way , those things almost did n't enter into the equation .
As far as I was concerned , I was happiest about the fact that the young 'uns came up well that year , or the cat was n't sick , or I was making love nicely .
As far as Crass was concerned , we sacrificed those sorts of pleasures and pains for the common good .
I would almost go as far as saying , we did n't know what we felt on that sort of personal level .
That was n't part of the equation , that was n't part of the agreement .
It was a machine , an incredibly efficient machine , in which we could and did act as human beings .
But I do n't think ...
I can't recall any day thinking , that was a wonderful day , any more than I can recall thinking , that was a terrible day .
We made mistakes and we had successes , and they all seemed to be one and the same thing in a way .
' Cause we were what we were .
I 'm sure other members of the band would say , well , I remember such and such .
But I can't do that , ' cause I was n't me , I was Crass .
I think really we all were by degrees .
We had an incredible sense of omnipotence , in the sense that because we were Crass and we were n't individuals , there was this extraordinary sense we could take on anything .
And we did .
We were sort of relatively fearless in our attacks and our attempts to confront the authorities .
I suppose an awful lot of what we did was to test the boundaries all the time .
We were constantly testing the boundaries - how fast can we go ?
It seemed we could go as far as we wanted .
It seemed that we could do anything that we wanted to do , we were able to .
The only limitation was our imagination , lack of political analysis , or whatever .
But ultimately , we could do just what we wanted to do .
And no one seemed to get in the way .
And if they did get in the way , it did n't matter , because they were getting in the way of a name , Crass .
They were n't getting in the way of me at all .
I was still looking after the young 'uns and stroking the cats .
Things only make you frustrated if you 've got expectations .
I do n't think we had any expectations .
We did n't start with any expectations , and we did n't finish with any expectations .
So you can't really be frustrated if you have n't got any expectations .
I could n't now , and I did n't then , care whether or not a record was at # 10 in the charts or nowhere at all in the charts .
It did n't really interest me very much .
I do n't think it interested anyone particularly .
It did n't mean anything .
What meant something was that people were expanding their own consciousness .
And if we were a part of that , that was all well and good .
But again , we did n't know that we were .
We could n't know that .
We saw that people were happy to be at our gigs .
You can't qualify all that , or quantify it .
I think I was just happy to do it , ' cause it needed doing , I suppose , or I felt it needed doing .
I do n't think that we were a band in the conventional sense of the word .
I do n't think we saw ourselves as individuals within a band .
We stripped ourselves of that .
We were the band - we were Crass .
I think that 's why we were so strong , and why we were so impenetrable .
That becomes an irrelevancy , because if you have n't got individuals , then you can't ask certain questions , they became meaningless .
We 've become individuals now , but we were n't then .
I think our greatest achievement was to manage for however many long years it was , seven years , to sort of put aside our own individual passions and needs and desires , for what we believed was the common good .
And which some of us might no longer believe was the common good , but we certainly did at the time .

Live Rock curing and Aquascape ideas
My live rock has been curing in my basement for 5 days now .
Water parameters indicate active bacteria :
5/17 NH4 . 0.25
N02 . 0.25
NO3 . 20
pH. 7.8
SpG. 1.025
Temp . 78.7
I ’ve cut out some grate in the proportions of the BioCube , and was playing with some aquascape ideas .
On a remote mountain pass , with a reddening sun disappearing over the vast horizon , John Marston spots the criminal he 's been paid to track down .
As the reformed outlaw spurs his horse to give chase , a rumbling bass guitar groove starts up , the tempo seemingly accelerating to match the animal 's galloping hooves .
It is exhilarating stuff , a perfect matching of action and audio that recalls the partnership of Leone and Morricone .
But this is a video game , and the choreography of soundtrack and story is happening on the fly .
Red Dead Redemption is awash with moments like this .
Released last Friday , the open - world Western adventure from the publishers of Grand Theft Auto is being hailed by many as a game of the year contender .
Following Clint Eastwood - esque lead character , Marston , as he charges through the dying Old West , it 's a gritty , often thrilling ride , mixing the violent nihilism of the Grand Theft Auto series , with the panoramic beauty of a John Ford classic .
And it 's rendered even more immersive by the 14 - plus hours of original music contained on the game disc .
For Rockstar 's soundtrack supervisor , Ivan Pavlovich , the challenge of scoring Red Dead was always the sheer scale of the thing : it is , apparently , just too darn big .
Through the Grand Theft Auto series , the publisher defined the use of licensed music in video games ; especially in 2002's GTA Vice City where the coke - addled action was inseparable from the eighties pop tracks that accompanied every brutal shoot - out and sun-soaked car chase .
But the world of Red Dead Redemption is the largest the publisher has created , with players likely to spend hours riding the arid scrublands between towns and villages .
It 's also set in the early 1900s , which rather limits the options in terms of well - known contemporary recording artists .
" There was no way that we could really use licensed music as we 've done in the past , " contends Pavlovich .
" So we figured we 'd need to write an original score … "
Bulging music biz contacts book in hand , Pavlovich starting scoping out potential contributors .
The search ended with a cult band hailing from Tucson , Arizona .
" We were actually turned on to Friends of Dean Martinez by their manager , " he explains .
" We started listening to them and thought , ' wow , these guys could do a great modern interpretation of classic Western music ' .
So we talked with [ the group 's co-founder ) Bill Elm and the relationship grew from there . "
For those who 've missed out on wonderfully evocative albums like A Place in the Sun and Random Harvest , Friends of Dean Martinez is an instrumental collective that fuses alt rock with traditional southwestern sounds and instruments .
Think Mogwai with slide guitars , or maybe Angelo Badalamenti in a Stetson and you 're heading in vaguely the right direction .
The music is laidback but also simmering with dark emotion , and it has an absolutely unavoidable sense of place .
" Writing a review of Friends of Dean Martinez without mentioning the desert is like writing a book without the letter ' e ' " , began a review of the album Lost Horizon on influential US music site , Pitchfork .
And that says it all .
There 's been a rotation of members since the group signed to grunge label Sub Pop in the mid-Nineties , but the duo that came onboard the Red Dead project was Bill Elm and sometime member Woody Jackson , a multi- instrumentalist who 's worked with everyone from Ry Cooder to Smashing Pumpkins .
Importantly , perhaps , both musicians have experience with movie soundtracks .
They scored Richard Linklater 's Fast Food Nation together , while Jackson has been involved with pictures such as Youth In Revolt and Ocean 's 12 ( alongside regular collaborator , David Holmes ) .
But are there actually useful similarities between movie and video game work ?
" You know , it 's really similar and then it 's completely different , " says Elm .
" It 's similar in that you 're dealing with a visual medium , and you 're dealing with emotion .
I know it sounds pretentious , but you 've got to have great , emotive music – you 're really pushing for that .
" The obvious difference is that film music is written to fit a finite scene , whereas with the video game , we 're working in five - minute loops .
It 's really wide open , but also very hard , because there are all sorts of things happening with layers .
If the player shoots someone , suddenly the music changes , so we have to think , 'okay , does this work over the top of that ? '.
Also the big thing with a game is , you do n't know how long you 're going to be staying in that mood – you can't state too much , it 's kind of like implying a mood .
It 's a balance between having it interesting , but not so much that you get sick of it , because you could be riding that horse for 15 minutes … "
There 's also a difference in terms of commitment .
While Jackson says he 'll spend 12 weeks at most on a movie score , he and Elm worked on Red Dead for over fifteen months .
It has been , they admit , a meandering , organic experience .
For a while , they set about envisioning the project and laying down some creative guidelines .
" There was so much conversation , " says Pavlovich .
" Just sitting down and talking about music , and planning it out , deciding how to record it and what musicians to bring in . "
" Rockstar have used a composer once before , but really it was all new ground , " continues Jackson .
" It was n't like , ' you 're supposed to do this . '
It was more , ' let 's see how this works ' .
And for months we were just trying things out .
It was only at the end that it got really intense . "
This insouciant arrangement seems to have led to a series of loose experimental sessions , with Elm and Jackson bringing in a whole range of friends and colleagues to jam around the key themes and motifs .
" It was really creative and really open , " says Elm .
" The people we used just sound great , we did n't have to give them too much direction .
When we hit the horn section , I gave [ trumpeter ]
Mike Bolger a few references and all the melodies , and I said I needed this orchestrated , and he came up with these great horn parts for everyone to play . "
Other times , fortune would just throw up an interesting musician .
During the recordings , Jackson happened to be in a session with another group who 's drummer , Blake Colie , was providing some driving rocksteady rhythms .
Turns out he was playing with this band as a favour .
" I said 'hey , I can get you some money , if you can give me some of those beats ! ' " laughs Jackson .
And Colie was soon onboard .
" Music is n't super - lucrative at times , there are a lot of people doing favours , so that was nice .
I know from working on film scores where they do have a budget , when they call it 's like , ' great , now I can pay the rent ! ' "
Although this gives the impression of a formless improvisational process , because of the way the music reacts in real - time to the player 's actions , the underlying structure had to be meticulously planned .
If a dramatic sequence suddenly kicks off , the soundtrack switches to something with greater intensity , while a more foreboding sound is required during moments of suspense .
All of these loops have to segue into each other as events evolve on screen .
To ensure a seamless sound , then , the duo decided on set criteria – the whole score is composed in A minor and at 130 beats per minute .
It sounds incredibly restrictive , but as is often the case with creative limitations , there was also a sense of empowerment .
" It seemed like the hardest problem at the beginning , but then it was actually really freeing , " says Elm .
" Just learning how different elements work together ...
It was very different from making a band record : just letting the instruments and the sound fill the space , without having to think about writing better chord changes .
We were just letting the organic sound develop . "
Red Dead was also a chance for Elm and Jackson to explore instrumentation .
The game takes place in three major locations – New Austin , Mexico and , further North into the US , West Elizabeth – and each gets its own musical signatures .
" When the game starts , it 's the Frontier section , so we 've got some whistles , some violins , a harmonica , some guitars – it provides a real sense of peacefulness , " says Jackson .
" Then you go to Mexico where we have more horns .
And when you head North ...
That was a little bit of a struggle .
We changed it a couple of times .
We wanted it to relate to the Frontier , but to be totally different ... "
This apparently led to some of their more avant - garde experiments .
" I even used a heart beat , " continues Jackson .
" We were having a baby girl and I recorded the heart beat and used that as a drum beat .
I thought that would be kind of different .
The people at the hospital thought I was crazy – I was there recording with my iPhone , saying ' just put the scanner on the stomach again ' "
But then Jackson is apparently an obsessive collector of esoteric and vintage recording equipment , spending many an evening on eBay tracking down rarities .
The Red Dead score , and the subsequent album ( which comes free with the Limited Edition of the game , and is also available on various digital download sites ) were recorded and mixed at his own studio in LA , which was built in 1931 , making it the oldest privately owned studio in the city .
" The mixing board belonged to this guy Wally Heider , " explains Jackson .
" Basically every rock record from the late sixties to the early seventies was recorded on it , everything from T - Rex and Grateful Dead , to Herbie Hancock . "
Even when mastering the soundtrack , the duo managed to steep the process in musical history , selecting the Capitol Studios in Hollywood , where Frank Sinatra once recorded .
" They were showing us the echo chambers beneath the floor that Les Paul made , which are 50ft under the ground , " says Jackson .
" It literally looks like a video game where you need to crawl into a hole and down a ladder .
They would n't let us go down there , it 's too far and too dangerous .
But when we were doing the Widmore track , I was like ' put the chamber on ! ' and we did and it sounded great . "
That 's the fascinating thing about the Red Dead project – these are musicians steeped in traditionalist musicality , yet here they are providing music for a cutting edge piece of digital entertainment .
Neither of them are gamers , and they 've only just got their hands on the product they 've helped to shape ( throughout the recording process they were sent video footage of the game so they understood what developer Rockstar San Diego was putting together ) , but it has apparently been a rich experience for them .
As Jackson explains , " With film music you can go outside the remit a little bit , but it 's really constricting ... it ca n't be too quirky .
But with videogame music you can kind of go crazy – with sound design , with effects , anything you want – it 's liberating in that sense .
You can put it in there and as long as it sounds great , it 's great . "
Jackson also draws interesting parallels between the era of the game and the state of the music business today .
" There is n't really a music industry anymore .
It 's all homegrown .
It 's kind of like back to the Old West where everyone 's trying to make their own way .... "
Both Elm and Jackson are keen to work on video games again .
Until then , they 're considering performing some of the Red Dead album tracks live – they 're just working out the best way to do it .
When I ask Elm about his ambitions at the start of the project , he laughs it off - " Everything was like , ' Let 's just make it so no one turns off the music ' . "
But now he appreciates the important role the music plays in the experience .
And it must be strange , surely , to know that million of people are creating their own personal Western movies , for hours on end , with his work at the core of it all ?
" I only thought of that yesterday ! " he exclaims .
" It 's one of those things that I 'm going to think about when I 'm in the doldrums .
Right now it 's amazing , but in a couple of years if I 'm down , I 'll listen to it , it 'll be a pick - me - up … "
A post on Lambda the Ultimate recently was about an Oberon interpreter written in Javascript , allowing Oberon to be embedded in the browser .
This reminded me of an near - R5RS compatible Scheme written in Javascript called jsScheme .
It 's a very nice implementation to play with but is IE 6 only .
I 've done some hacking at it and made it compatible with Firefox .
I 've put the modified version here .
The modified version has some changes to cater for Firefox and some things still do n't work .
JIT compilation for example , so I 've left the checkbox for this disabled by default .
This does slow things down quite a bit but I 'll enable it again when I find the problem .
For IE JIT works fine and you can enable it .
If you find any other issues I 'd be keen to get feedback .
Leave a comment here or email me .
I 've also put the modified version in a darcs repository available with :
darcs get http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/repos/javascript-scheme
Please send me any patches you 'd like to apply .
What 's nice about this system is it has most of R5RS scheme implemented , including tail recursion and first class continuations .
A simple FFI for calling into Javascript is also available .
For example , here 's how to do some Javascript Date manipulation :
( define d ( js-eval " new Date ( ) ; " ) ) ( display ( js- invoke d " toString " ) ) ( newline )
' js - eval ' will evaluate Javascript code and return the object .
' js - invoke ' will invoke methods on that object .
There is also ' js - call ' which can call Javascript functions .
Unfortunately Firefox had problem using ' js - call ' on things like ' alert ' and ' setTimeout ' so I wrapped these built-ins with Javascript functions which can be called :
( js - call ( js-eval " jsAlert " ) " Hello World ! " )
' js - call ' will a Javascript function object .
The ' js - eval ' was required to return that function object given the function name .
Lambda the Ultimate also pointed to a Links paper recently .
In this paper they describe compiling the Links language to Javascript in continuation passing style and using this to implement user level threading for client side Javascript .
This should be possible using this Scheme system as well .
We can create continuations using call / cc and use the ' set - timeout ! ' function I added which wraps ' setTimeout ' to do the scheduling .
Here 's an example of using ' set - timeout ! '.
( set - timeout ! ( lambda ( ) ( alert " Hello World " ) ) 1000 )
This example waits one second and displays the alert .
Any Scheme function can be passed , including continuations :
( define abort # f ) ( define ( yield ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) ( set-timeout ! k 10 ) ( abort ) ) ) ) ( define ( spawn thunk ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( k ) ( set! abort k ) ( thunk ) ) ) ) ( define ( fib n ) ( yield ) ( if ( = n 0 ) 0 ( if ( = n 1 ) 1 (+ ( fib (- n 1 ) ) ( fib (- n 2 ) ) ) ) ) )
This code allows you to spawn a single thread which will run in the background of the browser .
That thread can call ' yield ' to return control back to the browser for a brief time .
A simple fibonacci function is provided which calls ' yield ' .
For example :
( spawn ( lambda ( ) ( display ( fib 10 ) ) ) )
This will return control immediately .
You can carry on using the browser and the result will be displayed when the thread completes .
A simple thread scheduler implementation would be an interesting exercise .
