SANTA MONICA , Calif. , July 2 —
Three teenagers loitered last week outside the ticket booth of an AMC
Theater at the upscale pedestrian mall here , skateboards underfoot , the marquee beckoning overhead .
They were weighing whether to see " Superman Returns , " the latest big - budget , Hollywood extravaganza to come hurtling out of the gate .
Siegfried Bodolai , 16 , called Siggy , had already seen the film once and found it old - fashioned , though he is enough of a movie buff to consider seeing it again .
" We 're more the ' Spider - Man ' ' X - Men ' generation , " he said .
His friend Daniel Andres , 17 , was in no great hurry to see " Superman . "
" The movies are repetitive , " he said .
" It seems like there 's about eight stories .
It 's like I 'm seeing the same movie , almost . "
After abandoning theaters in worrying numbers last summer , American moviegoers are returning to the multiplex , steadily if slowly .
Through the first 25 weeks of the year , domestic box - office revenue — helped by a boost in ticket prices — was up nearly 5 percent , to $ 4.6 billion , though it still trailed 2004 , according to the tracking company Exhibitor Relations .
Movie attendance was up about 1.65 percent to 699 million for the first 25 weeks , after a sharp decline the year before .
In the first video Moore also talks about the politicians and candidates and why they wo n't do anything to get something done on universal healthcare .
He also talks about how the Democrats were elected to end the war and that they need to find their spine before the next election .
He also talks about why Americans are afraid of the term socialized medicine .
Next Michael weighs in on the Presidential candidates views on nationalized healthcare , and how our system compares to other countries in the world .
He and Matthews talk about what the trade offs are to go to nationalized healthcare .
He also weighs in on how doctors who are general practitioners are paid in this country .
A Republican member of the audience who does n't agree with Moore weighs in and does a pretty lousy job of defending her position .
Here Moore talks about which candidate ( Kucinich ) has the best health care plan and what people can do to support universal health care and House Resolution 676 .
Moore also talks about the insurance companies and how they 're making decisions for doctors .
Here Chris Matthews reports on Bush 's recent veto threat and Cindy Sheehan 's arrest at Conyer 's office .
Michael Moore weighs in on impeachment .
He feels that Bush and Cheney should be impeached and tried for war crimes .
And here they have a little dust up after an audience member asks about the healthcare industy 's influence on the media .
Matthews seems to get his feathers ruffled a bit on this but does n't seem to be able to rebutt Moore very well either .
I thought Moore was excellent on tonight 's show , and it's too bad Tweety does n't do more shows like this where he gives someone a chance to have a meaningful debate on important issues .
UPDATE : From Terre ( h/t ) here is the link for Hardblogger 's Highlights of Michael Moore on Hardball Plaza if you want to read more about the show .
Also thank you to my buddies over at Crooks and Liars for the plug .
First time on the rec list ... yeah !!... lol ... and that was before C&L put the link up .
How fun !
Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment and recommend the diary .
PALANGKARAYA , Central Kalimantan ( Reuters ) - Bound hand and foot , disheveled orangutans caught raiding Borneo ’s oil palm crops silently await their fate as a small crowd of plantation workers gather to watch .
Orangutans lie beside each other at a forest school for orangutans in Palangkaraya , central Kalimantan May 3 , 2007 .
Branded pests for venturing out from their diminishing forest habitats into plantations where they eat young palm shoots , orangutans could be extinct in the wild in ten years time , the United Nations said in March .
Fighting against this grim prediction is the Nyaru Menteng Borneo Orangutan Survival ( BOS ) centre in Central Kalimantan , which rescues orangutans and returns them to the wild at the cost of US $ 3,000 per ape .
The orangutans learn how to survive in the wild during forest school .
They are taught to make nests , find the right foods and climb trees .

Lacking only hand - cuffs and finger - printing to complete the atmosphere of a criminal bust , such “ ape evictions ” have become part of life for Asia ’s endangered red apes .
Thousands have strayed into the path of international commerce as Indonesia and Malaysia , their last remaining habitats , race to convert their forests to profitable palm crops .
Branded pests for venturing out from their diminishing forest habitats into plantations where they eat young palm shoots , orangutans could be extinct in the wild in ten years time , the United Nations said in March .
Fighting against this grim prediction is the Nyaru Menteng Borneo Orangutan Survival ( BOS ) centre in Central Kalimantan , which rescues orangutans and returns them to the wild at the cost of US $ 3,000 per ape .
“ They will kill the animals if we do n’t go ...
It ’s cheaper to kill the orangutan than put up a fence or snares , ” said Lone Droscher - Nielsen , the Danish - born founder of the centre .
While harming the apes is illegal , her centre has amassed a slew of photographs of the grisly fates of some plantation trespassers :
Apes with their hands cut off and slashed to death with machetes , and others with bullets through their foreheads .
With dozens captured this year , cages are full , and finding secure land for releases is a constant challenge for the centre .
“ It ’s not just orangutans -- bears , gibbons -- everybody is losing their home , ” said Droscher - Nielsen .
“ If it was only the orangutan , people just say : ‘ Well it ’s only one species that ’s going to go extinct ’ .
But it ’s not just one species .
Those forests have millions of animals in them that are all going to go extinct if we continue ” .
SQUEEZED OUT
Indonesia and Malaysia together produce 83 percent of the world ’s palm oil .
Made by crushing fresh fruit , the reddish - brown oil is riding high in the commodities charts , with crude prices up over 15 percent this year after rising 40 percent in 2006 .
Used in cookies , toothpaste , ice cream and breads it is the world ’s second most popular edible oil after soy .
Demand is also soaring for palm oil - derived biofuel , despite objections from critics who slam the “ green ” alternative to pricey crude oil as “ deforestation diesel ” because of the destruction wreaked on forests to make way for palm plantations .
Of 6.5 million hectares cultivated in Malaysia and Indonesia in 2004 , almost four million hectares was previously forest , environment group Friends of the Earth calculated .
For orangutan , the clearances are a matter of life and death .
“ You can see how desperate the situation is ” , said forestry department official Sugianto , 43 , as he gestured at row after row of palms in the ape ’s last stronghold , Central Kalimantan .
“ The company knows the orangutan has a protected status ... if they have a permit to clear 60,000 hectares they clear 60,000 hectares , orangutan or not .
They only care about their profit ” .
Caught and reported to the Borneo Orangutan Survival centre by plantations who say they are trying to be responsible stakeholders , healthy animals are re-released deep in the forest .
Those too injured or too young to survive alone join 600 others at the rehabilitation centre .
Forty local Dayak women look after the current crop of 18 palm oil “ orphans , ” whose mothers have been killed ; bottle - feeding them milk , administering medicine and supervising their climbing and nest - building .
“ Some people still think it is a strange job , but others think it is normal now , ” said 31 - year old Sukawati .
After “ forest school , ” the apes graduate to eventual release .
“ They are cute and funny , ” said Sukawati .
“ They make me laugh ” .
BALANCING ACT
Orangutans once ranged across Southeast Asia .
Now an estimated 7,300 remain on Indonesia ’s Sumatra island and 50,000 on Borneo island .
An estimated 5,000 disappear every year .

Decades of habitat loss through rampant illegal logging , lethal annual forest fires , and poachers who earn hundreds of dollars for capturing orangutans for the illegal pet trade have all taken their toll .
But this latest threat is the worst , experts said .
“ The orangutans can withstand a certain degree of logging , as most loggers do n’t take the orangutan food trees , ” said Bhayu Pamungkas of the World Wide Fund for Nature .
“ But they have no chance with oil palm -… there ’s no chance for the orangutan if they clear - cut all the forest ” .
To rescue the industry ’s green credentials , several Indonesian and Malaysian palm oil companies have joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) , whose voluntary criteria include a ban on clearing primary forests and areas of high conservation value , such as forests containing orangutan .
Its more than 150 members also include major European end -users like Cadbury - Schweppes , Unilever and the Body Shop , that together take 40 percent of Asian exports , and who want to buy non-destructive palm oil .
But securing private sector support is a balancing act , said Fitrian Ardiansyah , 32 , an RSPO board member .
“ There is some genuine intention from progressive companies to distinguish between them and the bad guys , ” he said .
“ But if the push is too hard for them it ’s not going to be too difficult to switch the market to China and India , and emerging markets like the Middle East and Africa ” .
TREES AND PRIORITIES
Like whales , pandas , polar bears , and tigers , shaggy orange orangutan are classed “ charismatic megafauna ” by academics - endangered animals whose plight provokes compassion and concern .
Cute as they may be , their supporters need to keep perspective , said Derom Bangun , executive chairman of Gapki , the Indonesian Palm Oil Association , and an RSPO member .
“ We should see the whole picture , not only the orangutan .
They try to manipulate emotional side of orangutans so that housewives in Europe find it very pitiful , ” he said .
The country ’s clearance of almost 1.9 million hectares of forest a year between 2000 and 2005 , Asia ’s worst deforestation rate , also needs to be seen in its economic context , Bangun said .
While the government does need to better define which forest areas are to be preserved , not all will be kept , he said .
“ Other countries chopped down their forests when they were developing their countries .
If they would like us to preserve more than we can , they should do something to help us . ”
But while plantation workers have some choice whether they want to buy into the motorbikes and mobile phones offered by palm ’s economic opportunities , orangutans have no such choice , those on the front - line point out .
“ I ’m not against palm oil , ” said Droscher - Nielsen .
“ ( But ) if there ’s not proper protection of the forest the orangutans are not going to make it . ”
Walter Wolfgang , an 82 - year - old political veteran , was forcefully removed from the UK Labour party conference for calling a speaker , Jack Straw , a liar .
( Opinions on whether Jack Straw is or is not a liar are irrelevant here . )
He was later denied access to the conference on basis of anti-terror laws .
Keep in mind that as recently as the 1980s , Labour Party conferences were heated affairs compared with today ’s media shows .
From The London Times :
A police spokeswoman said that Mr Wolfgang had not been arrested but detained because his security accreditation had been cancelled by Labour officials when he was ejected .
She said : “ The delegate asked the police officer what powers he was using .
The police officer responded that he was using his powers under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act to confirm the delegate ’s details . ”
Also this :
More than 600 people were detained under the Terrorism Act during the Labour party conference , it was reported yesterday .
Anti-Iraq war protesters , anti-Blairite OAPs and conference delegates were all detained by police under legislation that was designed to combat violent fanatics and bombers – even though none of them was suspected of terrorist links .
None of those detained under Section 44 stop - and - search rules in the 2000 Terrorism
Act was arrested and no - one was charged under the terrorism laws .
Walter Wolfgang , an 82 - year - old Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany , was thrown out of the conference hall by Labour heavies after heckling the Foreign Secretary , Jack Straw .
When he tried to get back in , he was detained under Section 44 and questioned by police .
The party later apologised .
But the Home Office has refused to apologise for heavy - handed tactics used at this year ’s conference .
A spokesman insisted : “ Stop and search under Section 44 is an important tool in the on - going fight against terrorism .
“ The powers help to deter terrorist activity by creating a hostile environment for terrorists . ”
He added that the justification for authorising the use of the powers was “ intelligence - led and based on an assessment of the threat against the UK . ”
The shadow home secretary , David Davis , said : “ Laws that are designed to fight terrorism should only be used against terrorism . ”
A little while ago , an event was held by Valve Software , Inc. at their headquarters in Bellevue , Washington .
If you do n’t know Valve , it is the company behind the Source Engine , which powers Half Life 2 .
If you still do n’t know what I am talking about , this short article is probably of no interest to you . 🙂
Anyways , they have invited a couple of tech - journalists to tell them how they have parallelized their game - engine .
And while I was n’t invited ( now who would have guessed : P ) , I have stumbled across two articles covering the event : one from bit - tech.net and one from ArsTechnica .
Reading through both of these articles , I could not resist the urge to comment on some of the points they made ( need some practice in the self - control department , I guess ) . 😉
As usual , let me add a little disclaimer beforehand : I do n’t know too much about game - programming .
I have been to a seminar or two on the subject , and have had regular conversations with a colleague of mine who is very knowledgeable about it .
But of course , this does not make me an expert or anything , therefore I am going to try to stick to the parallel and threading part , because I am way more at home there .
I have thought about whether or not to give you an executive summary of the articles beforehand , but decided it was not worth it because you can always read through the referenced articles yourselves ( they are not that long ) .
Sorry , I am a bit on the lazy side today .
Or you can of course just try to make sense of my comments without the context .
Enough of the preface , let ’s start with the article on bit-tech.net :
“ Fundamentally , games are about what you do , not what you see .
So in terms of things which make games fundamentally profound experiences – and differentiate them from non-interactive entertainment such as TV and film – it ’s more about what you do on the CPU than on the GPU . ”
I wonder if NVIDIA agrees ?
But no , I am not going to get into this topic now .
🙂
I just found it funny to hear this quote and all the announcements about doing traditional CPU - tasks on the GPU in such a short time - frame . 🙂
To do this , Valve created its own set of tools .
Whilst it evaluated using existing programmes – such as operating system - level threading engines , or open source threading engines – it found that these were inefficient when it came to games .
Unfortunately , both articles are very light on details about what exactly makes these threading systems so inefficient for games – a point I would have very much liked to know more about .
Too heavy - weight ?
Not enough features ?
Too slow ?
Or even the old “ not invented here ” - syndrome ?
Its a shame they do n’t go into this further , especially since I would find it a considerable pain to have to maintain my own threading library along with my application when there are other , probably more tested alternatives available .
But then again , these companies operate in another league when it comes to resources , so what do I know . 🙂
“ We gravitated towards creating a custom work management system that ’s designed specifically for gaming problems – its job is to keep the cores 100 % utilised .
We make it so that there are N - 1 threads for N cores , with the other thread being the master synchronisation thread .
The system allows the main thread to throw off work to as many cores as there might be available to run on , and it also allows itself to be subjugated to other threads if needs be . ”
Or they could have just called it Master - Slave , like the High - Performance - Computing - world has done for ages :) .
They did not have to invent their own threading - system for that , that ’s for sure …
The engine uses lock - free algorithms to solve one of the major problems of threading – access to data .
…
“ We realised that , 95 % of the time , you ’re trying to read from a data set , and only 5 % of the time are you actually trying to write to it , to modify it .
So , we just allowed all the threads to read any time they want , and only write when the data was locked to that thread . ”
This part is very misleading , and I hope the journalists misunderstood something here .
What he describes are not lock - free algorithms in any way , he describes good old Reader - Writer locks .
These are far easier to write and far more portable than lock - free algorithms ( in fact , one of my students just wrote a Reader - Writer - Lock implementation with C++ and OpenMP without too many problems ) .
And therefore the terms should not be freely mixed in my humble opinion , because we are talking a whole new level of difficulty here ( and by the way , Reader - Writer Locks are also available in many threading systems , so I am starting to think it was not lack of features that made them implement their own ) .
That ’s the bits I wanted to comment on from the first article .
Let ’s take a look at the second one from ArsTechnica :
To accomplish this , programmer Leonard made use of a technique called lock - free algorithms .
He implemented a spin lock to replace the more traditional mutexes ( mutual - exclusion algorithms ) and semaphores that are used to flag threads as being “ safe ” to multithread .
The spin loop utilizes a new interlock instruction that is built into the CPU .
Now they claim lock - free algorithms can be implemented with spin-locks .
* sigh * .
Same mistake as in the other article .
Tom examined the threads ’ activity with profiling tools , and it turned out that 95 percent of the time the threads were reading memory while only spending 5 percent of their time writing .
A read / write lock allowed many threads to read the same bit of memory , but only one thread to write to it .
This sounds better and more correct : so they do know what a Reader - Writer lock is after all , and the above blurbs were probably things the journalists misunderstood .
* sigh of relief * 🙂
Not only was the speedup on the four - core Kentsfield chips nearly linear in most cases ( an average of 3.2 times over a single core )
Please repeat after me : Speedups are measured against the fastest sequential version , not against the parallel version run on one core .
Speedups are measures against …
If I had gotten a dollar for every time I heard this mistake in the past I would be a rich man by now – or maybe it ’s just selective memory :?…
The demo was run on a 2.6GHz Kentsfield CPU with four cores and 2GB of RAM .
On a single - core 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 , fewer than 100 critters could run around at the same frame rate , which looked much less impressive .
Let ’s not talk about comparing apples with oranges , shall we ?
Different architecture , different number of cores , different clock - speed – these numbers tell us exactly – not so much 8O .
The tools do n’t completely remove the responsibility of the programmer to think about the best approach to adding multithreading support to their code , but they do help programmers avoid common pitfalls and greatly diminish the time it takes for coders who are new to multithreading to get up to speed .
How come they always stop when it gets interesting ?
Why do these tools help so much ?
How are they different from ordinary threading - systems ?
These are the questions that are interesting to a multi- threading - junkie like me ( but I guess the target audience of both articles does not exactly fall into that category ) .
A question was asked about supporting executing game code directly on GPUs , an idea that some have considered due to the improvements in GPU speed over the last few years , Valve does not believe that this is the correct approach .
GPUs can’t natively execute existing x86 code whereas multiple cores can execute it directly , meaning less work for the programmers .
What a nice coincidence : the closing quote from this article is about the same topic as the first one : the power of GPUs and how to harness it .
I do n’t find this last sentence too convincing , though : I am regularly writing code that runs quite nice on non-x86 - hardware and as long as I have a compiler that understands and translates my programming language of choice into the target machine language , I could not care less about x86 - compatibility .
I would only expect problems if there were assembler - instructions scattered throughout the code , which of course would make a port extremely difficult .
On the other hand , porting code to a whole new programming paradigm ( like e.g. stream - processing ) is of course hard – but if the graphics hardware companies do deliver , what they have been promising lately , programmers should not have to worry about this sometime in the not so distant future .
This closes my little commentary on the two articles covering the Valve - event , hope you enjoyed my perspective a little !
Ron Paul : We Ignore the 1953 Coup at Our Peril
Congressman Paul on Iran , the CIA and " Blowback "
 The tired assertion that America supports democracy  in the Middle East is increasingly transparent .

Congressman Paul has discussed the unintended consequences , or blowback , of the illegal overthrow of Irans popular , democratically elected Prime Minister , Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh on the floor of the House of Representatives at least 11 times in the space of 5 years , plus numerous other mentions in speeches , interviews , and articles .
The event has clearly influenced his views on foreign policy and how America ought to engage with the world .
For the record , The Mossadegh Project presents a nearly comprehensive chronology of Ron Pauls public statements on this subject since 2002 .

Speaking at youth rally in Iowa City :
...we were involved in Iran , they were on their way to a developing a pretty democratic system , so in 1953 we said  No , we dont want you to have democracy , you might keep all your oil ... so we wanted to have our dictator in and so we installed the Shah and he was brutal .
Then after , what , 53 - 79  , whatd it do — it stirred up hatred and antagonism , not only against the Shah , but against us .
And just look at the consequences ...

Weve been at war in Iran for a lot longer than  79 [ 1979 revolution / hostage crisis ] .
We started it in 1953 when we sent in a coup , installed the Shah , and the reaction , the blowback came in 1979 , its been going on and on because we dont plain mind our own business .
That s our problem !

And quite frankly , I m not sure anybody knows that answer .
The Revolution : A Manifesto by Ron Paul ( 2009 ) Ron Pauls book The Revolution : A Manifesto became a New York Times Best Seller .
The 1953 coup in Iran was discussed in Chapter 2 : The Foreign Policy of the Founding Fathers .
" Blowback should not be a difficult or surprising concept for conservatives and libertarians , since they often emphasize the unintended consequences that even the most well - intentioned domestic program can have .
We can only imagine how much greater and unpredictable the consequences of intervention abroad might be .
A classic example of blowback involves the overthrow of Prime Minister Muhammad Mossadegh in Iran in 1953 .
American and British intelligence collaborated on the overthrow of Mossadeghs popularly elected government , replacing him with the politically reliable but repressive shah .
Years later , a revolutionary Iranian government took American citizens hostage for 444 days .
There is a connection here not because supporters of radical Islam would have had much use for the secular Mossadegh , but because on a human level people resent that kind of interference in their affairs . "

The Washington Times Op - Ed : July 1 , 2009 Ron Paul 's guest opinion column  Fight them over there vs. over here  a false choice advocates five principles in foreign affairs :
2 . We provide a strong national defense , but we do not police the world .
3 . We obey the Constitution and follow the rule of law .
4 . We do not engage in nation - building .
and :
5 . We stay out of the internal affairs of other nations .
America should conduct trade , travel and diplomacy with all willing nations .
Intervention , however , always has unintended consequences and almost always gets us in trouble .
For example , in 1953 , our CIA helped overthrow Mohammad Mosaddeq , the democratically elected prime minister of Iran and installed the Shah of Iran , a ruthless dictator .
The blowback from our actions was in large part responsible for the extremist Iranian Revolution of 1979 , the taking of our hostages and the many problems we have had with Iran ever since .
So much of our intervention makes no sense .
We backed Saddam Hussein for much of the 1980s , and then twice went to war against him .
In the 1990s , we bribed North Korea not to pursue atomic weapons with nuclear technology , and Kim Jong - il used that assistance to build several nuclear bombs .
Intervention simply does not serve our long - term interests .

Pillars of Prosperity : Free Markets , Honest Money , Private Property by Ron Paul ( 2008 )
Most Americans forget how our policies have systematically and needlessly antagonized the Iranians over the years .
In 1953 the CIA helped overthrow a democratically elected president [ correction : Prime Minister ] , Mohammed Mossadeqh [ sic ] , and install the authoritarian Shah , who was friendly to the U.S.
The Iranians were still fuming over this when the hostages were seized in 1979 .
Our alliance with Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Iran in the early 1980s did not help matters , and obviously did not do much for our relationship with Saddam Hussein .
The administration announcement in 2001 that Iran was part of the axis of evil didnt do much to improve the diplomatic relationship between our two countries .

September 10 , 2007 — Ron Paul vs. Bill OReilly :
There was no time for history lessons during Ron Pauls live interview with FOX News channels Bill OReilly show in September 2007 : OREILLY :
But when they re [ Iran ] seeking a nuclear weapon , when a countrys seeking a nuclear weapon that s a danger to the USA , a stated danger , and you want to withdraw from the theater , that gives them carte blanche to do what they want , does it not ?
RON PAUL : Well  well first off , you know , you have Pakistan , and they re not exactly the most pro-Western country ...
OREILLY : Yeah , but I m talking about Iran , Congressman , Im not talking about Pakistan at this point .
RON PAUL : Well , why dont you ever let me , you know , answer the question ?
OREILLY :  Because you re not directly answering the question , sir .
RON PAUL : Because  no , I do not fear them as you do , as many do , because they want another war .
They want to spread this war .
This has been the plan by the neoconservatives to have this major overall  this revamping of the whole Middle East , precisely the reason the Al Qaeda is growing .
The Al Qaeda is growing because of our policy .
Our national security is threatened because of our policy .
And it makes it much worse .
So I see the Iranians as acting logically and defensively .
Weve been fighting the Iranians since 1953 .
We overthrew their government through the CIA in 1953 .
We were allies with Saddam Hussein in the 1980s .
And we encouraged him to invade Iran ...
OREILLY : All right , so I just want to  we dont need the history lesson .
But I do want to get this on the record .
RON PAUL : But you have to understand ...
OREILLY : I do understand the region ...
RON PAUL : You have to understand the history ..
If you dont understand the history , you cant ....
OREILLY : But we dont have time to do the history lesson tonight .
But when they re [ Iran ] seeking a nuclear weapon , when a countrys seeking a nuclear weapon that s a danger to the USA , a stated danger , and you want to withdraw from the theater , that gives them carte blanche to do what they want , does it not ?
Well  well first off , you know , you have Pakistan , and they re not exactly the most pro-Western country ... Yeah , but I m talking about Iran , Congressman , Im not talking about Pakistan at this point .
Well , why dont you ever let me , you know , answer the question ? 
Because you re not directly answering the question , sir .
Because  no , I do not fear them as you do , as many do , because they want another war .
They want to spread this war .
This has been the plan by the neoconservatives to have this major overall  this revamping of the whole Middle East , the reason the Al Qaeda is growing .
The Al Qaeda isbecause of our policy .
Our national security isbecause of our policy .
And it makes it much worse .
So I see the Iranians as acting logically and defensively .
We were allies with Saddam Hussein in the 1980s .
And we encouraged him to invade Iran ...
All right , so I just want to  we dont need the history lesson .
But I do want to get this on the record .
But you have to understand ... I do understand the region ... You have to understand the history ..
If you dont understand the history , you cant .... But we dont have time to do the history lesson tonight .
August 2 , 2007 — Human Events Interview Ron Paul on the 1953 - 9/11 connection in his interview with the far - right publication Human Events : Ron Paul :
To me , if you overthrow a regime , its an act of war , and it backfires on us .
It has never served us well over the last 100 years .
It s sort of like what we did with 1953 by installing the Shah .
We worked with the regime , we worked the British then , and were still suffering the consequences
You re saying overthrowing Mossadegh in 1953 and putting in the Shah led to the hostage - taking and 9/11 ?
Ron Paul : Absolutely .
In other words , the militant fundamentalist regime took revenge on us for overthrowing the secular left - of - center regime in 53 ?
Ron Paul :
There is always some militant - violent - jihadist looking to rally that faction , but they have to have incentives .
The incentive is when we impose our will on them and we get involved in their internal politics .
Besides , it contradicts everything the Founders theorized , and theres no constitutional authority for us to march around the world undermining different governments .
June 5 , 2007 — NHPR Radio Interview
In this New Hampshire Public Radio interview with Laura Knoy from June 5 , 2007 , Ron Paul is asked to defend his criticism of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East :
It is nt my thoughts that came out of the blue , its reading and studying what our CIA has reported and looking at history .
And it shows that most often , our messing around and meddling in the affairs of other countries have unintended consequences .
Sometimes just over in those countries that we mess with , we might support one faction , and it doesnt work , and its used against us .
But theres the blowback effect , that the CIA talks about , that it comes back to haunt us later on .
For instance , a good example of this is what happened in 1953 when our government overthrew the Mossadegh government and we installed the Shah , in Iran .
And for 25 years we had an authoritarian friend over there , and the people hated him , they finally overthrew him , and theyve resented it ever since .
And that had a lot to do with the taking of the hostages in 1979 , and for us to ignore that is to ignore history and ignore causes .
. .
It wasnt just because they " hated Americans " that they captured the hostages , it was because they were angry at us .
Also , we have antagonized the Iranians by supporting Saddam Hussein , encouraging him to invade Iran .
Why wouldnt they be angry at us ?
.... the founders were absolutely right : stay out of the internal affairs of foreign nations , mind our own business , bring our troops home , and have a strong defense .
I think our defense is weaker now than ever .
June 5 , 2007 — Republican Presidential Debates 2
Following his dust - up with Giuliani in May , Ron Paul brought up Mossadegh and the 1953 coup for the second time during the 2008 GOP Debates in response to a question about oil from moderator Wolf Blitzer :
Wolf Blitzer [ CNN ] :
Let me bring Congressman Paul back into this conversation .
In 2005 , President Bush signed an energy bill that provided billions of dollars in tax breaks , subsidies to the oil companies with the goal of boosting domestic production at a time of these record profits .
Do you believe these companies need a helping hand from the federal government ?
Ron Paul : I dont think the profits is the issue .
The profits are okay if they re legitimately earned in a free market .
What I object to are subsidies to big corporations when we subsidize them and give them R&D money .
I dont think that should be that way .
They should take it out of the funds that they earn .
But Im also  you cant discuss energy without discussing our foreign policy .
Why  why do we go to the Middle East ?
You know that oil is very important about the Middle East and why were there .
Why did we , our government , help overthrow Mossadegh in 1953 ?
It had to do with oil .
So our foreign policy is designed to protect our oil interests .
The profits  thats not the problem .
It s the problem that we succumb to the temptation to protect oil interests by literally going out and fighting wars over oil .
May 25 , 2007 : Ron Paul on Real Time with Bill Maher
Real Time with Bill Maher .
Maher asked Paul to review the reading list he suggested for Giuliani at the National Press Club the day before .
As actor
BILL MAHER : And what of the things you suggested he read do you think are most important that he be aware of ?
RON PAUL : Well , I think its been known for quite a few decades that our foreign policy has what the CIA calls blowback .
It has unintended consequences .
You can go back to 1953 , when we put the Shah into power , us supporting Osama bin Laden and radicalizing Islamics to go after the Soviets , and that comes back as blowback , our support for Saddam Hussein in the 1980s , and this comes back to haunt us , and thats why I have been very attractive and very supportive of what I call a non-interventionist foreign policy mind our own business , and stay out of the internal affairs of other nations .

Shortly after his debate with Rudy Giuliani , Ron Paul was a guest on the HBO talk show .
Maher asked Paul to review the reading list he suggested for Giuliani at the National Press Club the day before .
As actor Ben Affleck nodded in approval , Mr. Paul offered his controversial talking points .
[ Video and transcript below ] :
May 15 , 2007 : Ron Paul vs. Rudy Giuliani
Below a transcript of the entire exchange .
Co-moderator Wendell Goler had asked Mr. Paul if non-interventionist tendencies in American foreign policy changed after September 11th , to which Mr. Paul responded :
Ron Paul :
Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us ?
They attack us because weve been over there  weve been bombing Iraq for 10 years .
Weve been in the Middle East — I think Reagan was right .
We dont understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics .
So right now were building an embassy in Iraq thats bigger than the Vatican .
We re building 14 permanent bases .
What would we say here if China was doing this in our country or in the Gulf of Mexico ?
We would be objecting .
We need to look at what we do from the perspective of what would happen if somebody else did it to us .
Goler :
Are you suggesting we invited the 9/11 attack , sir ?
Ron Paul : I m suggesting that we listen to the people who attacked us and the reason they did it , and they are delighted that were over there because Osama bin Laden has said ,  I am glad you re over on our sand because we can target you so much easier . 
They have already now since that time have killed 3,400 of our men , and I dont think it was necessary .
Rudy Giuliani : Wendell , may I comment on that ?
That s really an extraordinary statement .
Thats an extraordinary statement , as someone who lived through the attack of September 11 , that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq .
I dont think Ive ever heard that before , and Ive heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th .
And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didnt really mean that .
Goler : Congressman ?
Ron Paul : I believe very sincerely that the CIA is correct when they teach and talk about blowback .
When we went into Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah  yes , there was blowback .
The reaction to that was the taking of our hostages .
And that persists , and if we ignore that , we ignore it at our own risk .
If we think we can do what we want around the world and not incite hatred , then we have a problem .
They dont come here to attack us because were rich and were free , they come here to attack us because were over there .
Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us ?
They attack us because weve been weve been bombing Iraq for 10 years .
Weve been in the Middle East — I think Reagan was right .
We dont understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics .
So right now were building an embassy in Iraq thats bigger than the Vatican .

Ron Paul first ran for President as a Libertarian in 1988 .
As a candidate for President in the 2008 election , Ron Paul made his most public reference to the 1953 coup during the 2007 Republican debates in South Carolina .
The remark occurred during a question about 9/11 which was jumped on by fellow candidate Rudy Giuliani .
Although his initial comment and Giulianis indignant verbal ambush responding to Paul were widely broadcast on TV news highlights , Pauls response to Guiliani mentioning the 1953 coup was suspiciously absent .
Below a transcript of the entire exchange .
Co-moderator Wendell Goler had asked Mr. Paul if non-interventionist tendencies in American foreign policy changed after September 11th , to which Mr. Paul responded :
PBS TV show NOW — May 28 , 2004 :
MOYERS : Most people Ive talked to say that without an American military presence in Iraq , the country will almost certainly fall into civil war with bloody conflict that could bring the rest of the region in .
What if they re right ?
RON PAUL : Well , you know , I guess its always possible .
Theres no way to say there will be none .
But I think that s exactly what my concern has always been is that if we go over there and disrupt that area and pick sides and be involved , which weve been for years literally since we got rid of Mossadegh in Iran .
You know , that has led to many problems .
And that , still , is festering .
The fact that we were an ally of Iraq and in the war against Iran is another festering sore there .
So yes , I think our interference does exactly what we say were there to prevent .
There is that possibility .
But I think it would be a lot less .
And besides , I dont I never find I m never comfortable with assuming we have this moral authority to do what were trying to do .
Ron Paul interviewed by Bill Moyers
Here are excerpts from Ron Pauls speeches delivered before Congress between 2002 and 2006 : January 11 , 2007 : House Committee on Foreign Affairs Ron Pauls remarks before the briefing and hearings on Next Steps in the Iran Crisis :
So far the comments Ive heard are rather frightening .
Im afraid were going in the wrong direction .
I sense that theres a bit of gross overreaction to the concerns that we have about Iran .
I think everything Ive heard today about Iran could be applied to Iraq .
What about a nuclear 
Im sorry , to Pakistan .
We have a nuclear Pakistan .
Pakistan is run by a military dictator .
Hes vulnerable to overthrow .
He took over by ousting an elected leader .
And some claim  and its reasonable to assume that they re sympathetic to the Taliban .
And who knows , Osama bin Laden may well even be in Pakistan .
So I think this is gross overreaction , considering the fact that we created most of the problems anyway .
It was in 1953 , it wasnt in 1979 when this problem started .
It was in 1953 when the United States went in and put in their own dictator , the Shah , a ruthless dictator .
So we have to look at the entire history to realize how we contribute to some of our problems .
And this is some blowback that were getting  the unintended consequences .
And its the overall policy that , I think , puts us in such great danger .
And all the arguments used by the same people to generate this excitement about going into Iraq are doing this to Iran .
We have to consider some negotiations and talking because even today were considering what day will we be bombing Iran , tragically .
Ron Pauls remarks before the briefing and hearings on
House of Representatives — September 7 , 2006 :
[ Entire speech here : The Law of Opposites ]
Our policy toward Iran for the past 50 years is every bit as disconcerting .
It makes no sense unless one concedes that our government is manipulated by those who seek physical control over the vast oil riches of the Middle East and egged on by Israels desires .
We have attacked the sovereignty of Iran on two occasions , and are in the process of threatening her for the third time .
In 1953 , the U.S. and British overthrew the democratically elected Mohammad Mossadegh and installed the Shah .
His brutal regime lasted over 25 years , and ended with the Ayatollah taking power in 1979 .
Our support for the Shah incited the radicalization of the Shiite Clerics in Iran , resulting in the hostage takeover .
In the 1980s we provided weapons  including poisonous gas to Saddam Hussein as we supported his invasion of Iran .
These events are not forgotten by the Iranians , who see us once again looking for another confrontation with them .
We insist that the UN ignore the guarantees under the NPT that grant countries like Iran the right to enrich uranium .
The pressure on the UN and the threats we cast toward Iran are quite harmful to the cause of peace .
They are entirely unnecessary and serve no useful purpose .
Our policy toward Iran is much more likely to result in her getting a nuclear weapon than prevent it .
Our own effort at democratizing Iran has resulted instead in radicalizing a population whose instincts are to like Americans and our economic system .
Our meddling these past 50 years has only served to alienate and unify the entire country against us .
House of Representatives — April 6 , 2006 :
[ Entire speech here : Iran : The Next Neocon Target ]
In 1953 , our CIA , with help of the British , participated in overthrowing the democratically elected leader , Mohammad Mossadegh .
We placed the shah in power .
He ruled ruthlessly but protected our oil interests , and for that we protected him  that is , until 1979 .
We even provided him with Irans first nuclear reactor .
Evidently , we didnt buy the argument that his oil supplies precluded a need for civilian nuclear energy .
From 1953 to 1979 , his authoritarian rule served to incite a radical Muslim opposition led by the Ayatollah Khomeini , who overthrew the Shah and took our hostages in 1979 .
This blowback event was slow in coming , but Muslims have long memories .
The hostage crisis and overthrow of the shah by the ayatollah was a major victory for the radical Islamists .
Most Americans either never knew about or easily forgot our unwise meddling in the internal affairs of Iran in 1953 .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There are long - term consequences or blowback from our militant policy of intervention around the world .
They are unpredictable as to time and place .
9/11 was a consequence of our military presence on Muslim holy lands ; the Ayatollah Khomeinis success in taking over the Iranian government in 1979 was a consequence of our CIA overthrowing Mossadegh in 1953 .
These connections are rarely recognized by the American people and never acknowledged by our government .
We never seem to learn how dangerous interventionism is to us and to our security .
House of Representatives — March 28 , 2006 :
The Muslim world is not fooled by our talk about spreading democracy and values .
The evidence is too overwhelming that we do not hesitate to support dictators and install puppet governments when it serves our interests .
When democratic elections result in the elevation of a leader or party not to our liking , we do not hesitate for a minute to undermine that government .
This hypocrisy is rarely recognized by the American people .
It s much more comfortable to believe in slogans , to believe that were defending our goodness and spreading true liberty .
We accept this and believe strongly in the cause , strongly enough to sacrifice many of our sons and daughters , and stupendous amounts of money , to spread our ideals through force .
House of Representatives — February 15 , 2006 :
Most Americans forget how our policies have systematically and needlessly antagonized the Iranians over the years .
In 1953 the CIA helped overthrow a democratically elected president , Mohammad Mossadegh , and install the authoritarian Shah , who was friendly to the U.S.
The Iranians were still fuming over this when the hostages were seized in 1979 .
Our alliance with Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Iran in the early 1980s did not help matters , and obviously did not do much for our relationship with Saddam Hussein .
The administration announcement in 2001 that Iran was part of the axis of evil didnt do much to improve the diplomatic relationship between our two countries .
Recent threats over nuclear power , while ignoring the fact that they are surrounded by countries with nuclear weapons , doesnt seem to register with those who continue to provoke Iran .
With what most Muslims perceive as our war against Islam , and this recent history , theres little wonder why Iran might choose to harm America by undermining the dollar .
Iran , like Iraq , has zero capability to attack us .
But that didnt stop us from turning Saddam Hussein into a modern day Hitler ready to take over the world .
Now Iran , especially since shes made plans for pricing oil in Euros , has been on the receiving end of a propaganda war not unlike that waged against Iraq before our invasion .
House of Representatives — September 8th , 2005 :
After World War II the U.S. emerged as the # 1 world power , and moved to assume what some believed was our responsibility to control Middle East oil in competition with the Soviets .
This role prompted us to use our CIA , along with the help of the British , to oust democratically elected Mohammad Mossadegh from power in Iran and install the Shah as a U.S. puppet .
We not only supported Saddam Hussein against Iran , we also supported Osama bin Laden in the 1980s  aggravating the situation in the Middle East and causing unintended consequences .
With CIA assistance we helped develop the educational program to radicalize Islamic youth in many Arab nations , especially in Saudi Arabia to fight the Soviets .
We even provided a nuclear reactor to Iran in 1967  which today leads us to threaten another war .
All of this has come back to haunt us .
Meddling in the affairs of others has consequences .
House of Representatives — June 8th , 2005 :
Our Government for many years since 1953 , since we installed the Shah in Iran , we have used our ability and our power to have regime changes .
Now it is openly declared by our Government that regime change is a good policy , and , if we have to , we send in the troops , and even if we have to pressure or bend what the United Nations says , we should pursue this type of policy .
So this policy now is being institutionalized and put in to the United Nations .
House of Representatives — June 23 , 2004 :
Mr. Speaker , I rise in opposition to this legislation .
Though I certainly recognize the legitimate national security role of our intelligence community , I have concerns about this authorization and the questionable role played by components of the intelligence community .
Specifically , I am concerned about our history of secret regime changes carried out by our intelligence apparatus .
More often than not , we see many of the problems we face today were created as a result of this unwise practice of forcibly changing regimes in secret .
The stories of such activities are numerous .
In 1953 the CIA overthrew Mohammad Mossadegh in Iran , installing the Shah as dictator .
This led to increasing anti-Americanism , the overthrow of the Shah in 1979 , the kidnapping of Americans , the establishment of a hard - line Islamic regime hostile to the United States .
In the 1980s the United States provided covert support to Saddam Husseins Iraq in its war with Iran .
Ten years later the United States went to war against Saddam Hussein and then 11 years after that the United States went to war again against Saddams Iraq .
In the 1980s the United States provided weapons and training to the Taliban and what later became Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan as they sought to overthrow the communist government in power .
Some 20 years later , that same Taliban and Osama bin Laden struck out against the United States .
The United States then went to war against that Taliban government .
House of Representatives — May 6 , 2004 :
It is somewhat ironic that we are again meddling in Iranian affairs .
Students of history will recall that the US governments ill - advised coup against Iranian leader Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953 and its subsequent installation of the Shah as the supreme ruler led to intense hatred of the United States and eventually to the radical Islamic revolution of 1979 .
One can only wonder what our relations would be with Iran if not for the decades of meddling in that countrys internal affairs .
We likely would not be considering resolutions such as this .
Yet the solution to all the difficulties created by our meddling foreign policy always seems to always be yet more meddling .
Will Congress ever learn ?
House of Representatives — October 9th , 2004 :
Ever since its creation by the National Security Act of 1947 , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) has been meddling in affairs that have nothing to do with the security of the United States .
Considering the CIAs overthrow of Iranian leader Mohammad Mossadegh in the 1950s , and the CIAs training of the Mujahedin jihadists in Afghanistan in the 1980s , it is entirely possible the actions of the CIA abroad have actually made us less safe and more vulnerable to foreign attack .
It would be best to confine our intelligence community to the defense of our territory from foreign attack .
This may well mean turning intelligence functions over to the Department of Defense , where they belong .
House of Representatives — December 3 , 2002 :
The tired assertion that America supports democracy  in the Middle East is increasingly transparent .
It was false 50 years ago , when we supported and funded the hated Shah of Iran to prevent nationalization of Iranian oil , and its false today when we back an unelected military dictator in Pakistan  just to name two examples .
If honest popular elections were held throughout the Middle East tomorrow , the people in most countries would elect religious fundamentalist leaders hostile to the United States .
Cliché or not , the Arab Street really doesnt like America , so we should stop the charade about democracy and start pursuing a coherent foreign policy that serves Americas long - term interests .
Cannes is smacking its lips in anticipation of filmmaker and provocateur Michael Moore 's latest jeremiad against the US administration , which receives its premiere at the film festival today .
Sicko , a documentary tackling the state of American healthcare , focuses on the pharmaceutical giants , and particularly on health insurers .
The film has already caused Moore - who won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2004 with Fahrenheit 911 - to clash with the American authorities .
Now , according to movie mogul Harvey Weinstein , whose Weinstein Company is behind the film , the US government is attempting to impound the negative .
According to Weinstein , the US Treasury 's moves meant " we had to fly the movie to another country " - he would not say to where .
" Let the secret service find that out - though this is the same country that thought there were weapons of mass destruction , so they 'll never find it . "
He added that he feared that if the film were impounded , there might be attempts to cut some footage , in particular the last 20 minutes , which related to a trip to Cuba .
This , said Weinstein , " would not be good . "
In March , Moore travelled to the Caribbean island with a group of emergency workers from New York 's Ground Zero to see whether they would receive better care under the Castro regime than they had under George Bush .
He had applied for permission to travel in October 2006 and received no reply .
In a letter dated May 2 , the treasury department notified Moore that it was investigating him for unlicensed travel to Cuba , or , as the missive put it , engaging in " travel - related transactions involving Cuba . "
Now team Moore is hitting back .
Weinstein has hired an attorney , David Boies , who has lodged a request under the US freedom of information act to find out what motivated the treasury to begin its investigation .
" They have to tell us why they did it and what they did , " said Weinstein .
" And they are not too happy about it . "
Weinstein believes the investigation has a political agenda .
" We want to find out who motivated this .
We suspect there may be interference from another office , " he said .
" Otherwise , I do n't understand why this would have come about . "
Weinstein named no suspects in this putative political interference , but referred to outspoken critics of Moore on the Republican right - who tend to accuse him of peddling propaganda rather than of undertaking serious journalism - including presidential hopeful Fred Thompson .
" Senator Thompson has come out with a tirade against Michael .
Michael said he 'd debate him , but Thompson turned him down , " said Weinstein .
He also said that insurers and pharmaceutical companies had " already sent out letters advising employees how to react when the film comes out " .
Weinstein appeared to be enjoying the brouhaha that the film is stirring up before it has even screened .
" I 've already told the Treasury that they are saving me money on advertising . "
In Cannes , the Weinstein Company 's offices are decorated with a mural of the rotund Moore sitting in a hospital waiting area flanked by a pair of skeletons , and Sicko sticking plasters are being given away as promotional gifts .
Moore 's underlying thesis in Sicko relates to the structure of American society .
" Others see themselves as a collective that sinks or swims together , " he told Variety .
" It 's important to have a safety net and free universal health care .
In America , unfortunately , we 're more focused on what 's in it for me .
It 's every man for himself .
If you 're sick and have lost a job , it 's not my problem .
Do n't bother me . "
The insurance companies are a negative force , he believes .
" They get in the way of taking care of those who are ill .
They make it worse .
We do n't need them , " he said .
The health secretary , Patricia Hewitt , may be surprised by Moore 's ringing - if strictly speaking , factually inaccurate - endorsement for the NHS .
" The poorest Brit is healthier and lives longer than the wealthiest American , " he said .
Of his journalistic style , he said : " It 's the op - ed page .
You do n't say that 's not journalism .
I present my opinion , my take on things , based on indisputable facts .
They could be wrong .
I think they 're right . "
Moore 's biggest hit to date has been Fahrenheit 911 , which took $ 222 m ( £ 112 m ) worldwide .
He made Bowling For Columbine , his acclaimed film about US gun culture , in 2002 .
The rightwing backlash has spawned a number of documentaries questioning his methods , including Rick Caine and Debbie Melnyk 's Manufacturing Dissent .
Moore has hired Al Gore 's former press secretary , Chris Lehane , to help him to deal with " the forces I 'm up against " .

Former Senator Fred ( not Bob ) Thompson has criticised Michael Moore .
This has been corrected .
WASHINGTON DC --
The long awaited US military attack on Iran is now on track for the first week of April , specifically for 4 AM on April 6 , the Good Friday opening of Easter weekend , writes the well - known Russian journalist Andrei Uglanov in the Moscow weekly " Argumenty Nedeli . "
Uglanov cites Russian military experts close to the Russian General Staff for his account .
The attack is slated to last for twelve hours , according to Uglanov , lasting from 4 AM until 4 PM local time .
Friday is a holiday in Iran .
In the course of the attack , code named Operation Bite , about 20 targets are marked for bombing ; the list includes uranium enrichment facilities , research centers , and laboratories .
The first reactor at the Bushehr nuclear plant , where Russian engineers are working , is supposed to be spared from destruction .
The US attack plan reportedly calls for the Iranian air defense system to be degraded , for numerous Iranian warships to be sunk in the Persian Gulf , and the for the most important headquarters of the Iranian armed forces to be wiped out .
The attacks will be mounted from a number of bases , including the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean .
Diego Garcia is currently home to B - 52 bombers equipped with standoff missiles .
Also participating in the air strikes will be US naval aviation from aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf , as well as from those of the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean .
Additional cruise missiles will be fired from submarines in the Indian Ocean and off the coast of the Arabian peninsula .
The goal is allegedly to set back Iran 's nuclear program by several years , writes Uglanov , whose article was re-issued by RIA - Novosti in various languages , but apparently not English , several days ago .
The story is the top item on numerous Italian and German blogs , but so far appears to have been ignored by US websites .
Observers comment that this dispatch represents a high - level orchestrated leak from the Kremlin , in effect a war warning , which draws on the formidable resources of the Russian intelligence services , and which deserves to be taken with the utmost seriousness by pro-peace forces around the world .
Asked by RIA - Novosti to comment on the Uglanov report , retired Colonel General Leonid Ivashov confirmed its essential features in a March 21 interview : " I have no doubt that there will be an operation , or more precisely a violent action against Iran . "
Ivashov , who has reportedly served at various times as an informal advisor to Putin , is currently the Vice President of the Moscow Academy for Geopolitical Sciences .
Ivashov attributed decisive importance to the decision of the Democratic leadership of the US House of Representatives to remove language from the just - passed Iraq supplemental military appropriations bill which would have demanded that Bush come to Congress before launching an attack on Iran .
Ivashov pointed out that the language was eliminated under pressure from AIPAC , the lobbing group representing the Israeli extreme right , and of Israeli Foreign Minister Tsipi Livni .
" We have drawn the unmistakable conclusion that this operation will take place , " said Ivashov .
In his opinion , the US planning does not include a land operation : " Most probably there will be no ground attack , but rather massive air attacks with the goal of annihilating Iran 's capacity for military resistance , the centers of administration , the key economic assets , and quite possibly the Iranian political leadership , or at least part of it , " he continued .
Ivashov noted that it was not to be excluded that the Pentagon would use smaller tactical nuclear weapons against targets of the Iranian nuclear industry .
These attacks could paralyze everyday life , create panic in the population , and generally produce an atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty all over Iran , Ivashov told RIA - Novosti .
" This will unleash a struggle for power inside Iran , and then there will be a peace delegation sent in to install a pro-American government in Teheran , " Ivashov continued .
One of the US goals was , in his estimation , to burnish the image of the current Republican administration , who would now be able to boast that they had wiped out the Iranian nuclear program .
Among the other outcomes , General Ivashov pointed to a partition of Iran along the same lines as Iraq , and a subsequent carving up of the Near and Middle East into smaller regions .
" This concept worked well for them in the Balkans and will now be applied to the greater Middle East , " he commented .
" Moscow must expert Russia 's influence by demanding an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to deal with the current preparations for an illegal use of force against Iran and the destruction of the basis of the United Nations Charter , " said General Ivashov .
" In this context Russia could cooperate with China , France and the non-permanent members of the Security Council .
We need this kind of preventive action to ward off the use of force , " he concluded .

The software industry might be the world ’s greatest breeding ground for new systems of management .
From Agile , to Extreme Programming , to Test Driven Development ( TDD ) , the acronyms and frameworks keep piling up .
Why ?
Some say it ’s immaturity : that software is still a young industry and all the change is the path to some true fundamentals .
Others say it ’s because software people like making things up and ca n’t help themselves .
Well I say this : if we ’re going to have dozens of models we may as well have some that are honest , however cynical , to what ’s really going on much of the time .
There is a happy list of these I ’m sure , but this is the cynical one .
Asshole - Driven development ( ADD ) – Any team where the biggest jerk makes all the big decisions is asshole driven development .
All wisdom , logic or process goes out the window when Mr. Asshole is in the room , doing whatever idiotic , selfish thing he thinks is best .
There may rules and processes , but Mr. A breaks them and people follow anyway .
Cognitive Dissonance development ( CDD ) –
In any organization where there are two or more divergent beliefs on how software should be made .
The tension between those beliefs , as it ’s fought out in various meetings and individual decisions by players on both sides , defines the project more than any individual belief itself .
Cover Your Ass Engineering ( CYAE ) –
The driving force behind most individual efforts is to make sure than when the shit hits the fan , they are not to blame .
Development By Denial ( DBD ) – Everybody pretends there is a method for what ’s being done , and that things are going ok , when in reality , things are a mess and the process is on the floor .
The worse things get , the more people depend on their denial of what ’s really happening , or their isolation in their own small part of the project , to survive .
Get Me Promoted Methodology ( GMPM ) – People write code and design things to increase their visibility , satisfy their boss ’s whims , and accelerate their path to a raise or the corner office no matter how far outside of stated goals their efforts go .
This includes allowing disasters to happen so people can be heroes , writing hacks that look great in the short term but crumble after the individual has moved on , and focusing more on the surface of work than its value .
I ’m sure you ’ve seen other unspoken methods at work – what are they ?
Please add to the over 200 reader suggested methods in the comments .
This signposts document consists of two separate but closely related works : this timeline and perspectives on the future .
Perspectives takes up where the timeline leaves off , offering up a heftier dose of speculation about what the future may bring than is suitable in the timeline .
Perspectives helps illustrate some of the possibilities implied by the timeline , as well as how certain select personalities of various periods might perceive ( and exploit or respond to ) their circumstances .
Perspectives also includes facts and speculation about mankind 's past .
Virtually all credible historians and archaeologists agree that there 's many puzzles and mysteries regarding our past that have yet to be resolved .
Both the timeline and perspectives take an optimistic view of humanity 's possible future .
Therefore , they largely ignore or heavily discount the many threats to humanity 's survival and prosperity which currently exist , and appear to be mounting almost by the day .
Not the least of the risks sidestepped here stem from the latest findings of SETI and related astronomical research .
For it appears most ( perhaps even all ) technological civilizations in our galaxy destroy themselves not long after they reach our current stage of development ( and well before they could ever experience a Vinge technological singularity ) .
The references supporting this conclusion may be found in my separate study
The rise and fall of star faring civilizations .
For my current best recommendations as to how we might avoid a similar fate , please see Civilization 's best defenses against war , terrorism , technological stagnation , and economic ruin .
For a somewhat philosophical perspective , please see
The war for our destiny .
The present through 2049 AD : Human civilization is rocked by technological upheaval and growing uncertainties ...
2018 AD - 2025 AD : Consumer robotics and personal virtual realities go mainstream Personal virtual realities are taking marketshare from TV , radio , films , and other media ; near paperless offices , wireless appliances becoming the norm ; consumer robotics go mainstream ; do - it - yourself medical care becoming ever more practical and effective for many ailments ; adequate hardware to support human level intelligence at consumer level prices becomes available ( but suitable software remains elusive ) .
The true source of this page is
2026 AD - 2049 AD : Accelerated environmental decline , increased religious conflict , and a wholesale plunge into VR by citizens in the developed nations ( to escape mounting stresses )
The emergence of the ' Bounty Economy ' ; rampant identity theft and other cybercrimes lead to the first and most important privacy vs. security issues being resolved ; substantial religion - related conflict erupts ; budgetary priorities undergo fierce turf fights in the developed nations , with education and other consumer services usually winning ; the human senses are technologically expanded in wondrous new ways ; the final elements fall into place to allow software - based human level intelligence to become widely available ; 98 % of all cancers become curable ; mini-subs and STOL / VTOL warplanes ( both unmanned ) are the cutting edge of warfare ; tactical nuclear , biological , and space - based weapons use in conflicts not uncommon ; traditional aircraft carriers now obsolete ; troops enjoy numerous micromachine - based aids and supplements ; environmental decline due to pollution , accidents , terrorism , war , and excessive harvests becomes alarmingly obvious now , but business continues to actively lobby governments for minimal regulatory remedies .
Once upon a time there was a science fiction story .
A story so ambitious in scope it required substantial research just to define its boundaries : the ultimate limits of technology , and human potential .
This timeline is the result of that research project .
The Chance of a Realtime is the story .
Now available for Amazon Kindles and Kindle apps :
To see the larger context from which the story springs , you can examine this illustrated index .
ATTENTION science fiction writers :
One of the reasons I created the signposts document in the first place was to help nurture the creation of ' hard ' science fiction across - the - board .
Nothing so ruins a science fiction novel for many readers as a glaring implausibility , either in terms of technology or a reasonable historical order to events .
Even small errors of this sort tend to get magnified with the passage of time -- as can be witnessed today in much science fiction written five , ten , and twenty years ago .
Plus , the ' harder ' or more grounded in real science and history your fiction is , the more truly educational it will be for both yourself and your readers , thus possibly offering us all much more than momentary entertainment , in the form of knowledge and ideas which might aid us all in our own lives and pursuits .
So I encourage writers to use this chronology as a springboard from which to launch their own speculative fiction , with perhaps inclusion of a note acknowledging me and my web site where appropriate .
Any caveats ?
Yes .
Please respect my own fictional efforts by avoiding more than passing references to my Perspectives characters ( J. Staute , Kerri , Cluke , the Pearsalls , etc. , etc. ) .
And if such references to my characters are included in your work , please do not make any significant changes to the course of those events or actions specifically ascribed to them here ( unless of course your story explicitly describes an alternate or parallel universe or dimension (s ) , distinct and separate from that portrayed on my site ) .
If you feel strongly that a particular event in the signposts document requires correction or improvement of some sort , please email me about it .
Second caveat ?
The signposts document may be updated or expanded as warranted by breaking news and ideas and thus is always subject to significant change without warning ( though I always strive to maintain as much consistency and feasibility as possible throughout ) .

Satellite images reveal the changes in volume of water
Enlarge Image
Fed by a complex network of rivers , the subglacial reservoirs force the overlying ice to rise and fall .
By tracking these changes with Nasa 's Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite ( ICESat ) scientists were able to map the extent of the subglacial plumbing .
The results , published in the journal Science , show that some areas fell by up to 9 m ( 30 ft ) over just two years .
" We did n't realise that the water under these ice streams was moving in such large quantities , and on such short time scales , " said Dr Helen Fricker of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , University of California , and one of the authors of the paper .
" We thought these changes took place over years and decades , but we are seeing large changes over months . "
The results are important for understanding how the Antarctic Ice sheet , which contains nearly 90 % of the world 's ice , may respond to global warming and how much it may contribute to sea level rise .
Climate response
Nearly 150 subglacial lakes have been identified beneath the vast Antarctic ice sheet .
The new ones were found under the fast - flowing Whillans and Mercer Ice Streams that carry ice from the interior of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to the floating Ross Ice Shelf .
" It 's the fast - moving ice that determines how the ice sheet responds to climate change on a short timescale , " said Professor Robert Bindschadler of Nasa 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland , and one of the researchers on the study .
As atmospheric temperatures rise , melting the ice shelves , their ability to hold back the ice streams on land would be reduced .
" We are n't yet able to predict what these ice streams are going to do . "
However , understanding how much water flows beneath the ice is critical because it is one of the factors that determine how fast they flow .
More water could speed up the flow of ice into the sea , raising sea levels .
" It 's essentially the grease on the wheel , " said Professor Bindschadler .
Ebb and flow
Using elevation data from Nasa 's ICESat , cross-checked with other Nasa satellites , the team was able to map the rise and fall of the overlying ice , and hence areas where water pooled or flowed away .
Launched in 2003 , ICESat can measure changes in elevation as small as 1.5 cm ( 0.6ins ) from its orbit 645 km ( 400 miles ) above the Earth .
The study revealed a complex network of ponds and rivers , the largest of which occurred under the Whillans ice stream and covered an area of 500 sq km ( 190 sq miles ) .
It also showed that water was constantly moving between different reservoirs .
For example , a feature known as Lake Englehardt took just under three years to empty two cubic kilometres ( 2 trillion litres ) of water .
In the same period , Lake Conway filled with an additional 1.2 cubic kilometres ( 1.2 trillion litres ) of water .
Not all of the water was the same as some escaped to the ocean or was refrozen on to the base of the glacier .
Observations like these were only possible using the new satellite technique .
" Until now , we 've had just a few glimpses into what 's going on down there , " said Professor Bindschadler .
" This is the most complete picture to date what 's going on beneath fast flowing ice . "
The findings were presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) annual meeting here in San Francisco , US .
BEIJING / TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - China and Taiwan traded barbs on Tuesday over Taiwan ’s latest failed attempt to join the U.N. , as Beijing called the island ’s president “ scum ” and Taiwan said China could n’t face up to the fact of its sovereignty .
Taiwan 's President Chen Shui-bian speaks during the opening ceremony of an exhibition about Taiwan 's democratic movements in the past 20 years in Taipei July 15 , 2007 .
China slammed Taiwan 's latest failed attempt to join the United Nations on Tuesday , accusing its president of trying to split the nation and labeling him " scum " in some of the strongest language it has used in years .
REUTERS / Pichi Chuang
The United Nations on Monday rejected Taiwan ’s application to join the world body , citing Beijing ’s “ one China ” policy that says there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it .
Beijing has claimed sovereignty over self - ruled Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and has vowed to bring the island back under mainland rule , by force if necessary .
“ Scums of the nation who attempt to split the country cannot escape the punishment of history in the end , ” Xinhua news agency quoted an unnamed official with China ’s Taiwan Affairs Office as saying .
“ This has once again proved that ( Taiwan President ) Chen Shui-bian is an out and out plotter and saboteur who would not hesitate to sacrifice the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in Asia - Pacific . ”
Chen applied for membership of the organization under the name “ Taiwan ” , a departure from Taipei ’s past practice of applying as “ Republic of China ” , its official name .
Taiwan ’s Mainland Affairs Council fired back that China was failing to face up to reality .
“ China is attempting to use the international community to pressure Taiwan and that just shows that it does n’t dare to face the fact that Taiwan is sovereign and independent , and that the two sides do n’t belong to each other , ” the MAC said in a statement .
It added : “ The government ’s determination to join the United Nation and the direction to respect the willingness of all the Taiwanese people will never change . ”
The U.N. rejection has become part of an annual ritual for Taiwan , which has seen its application for membership in the world body rejected for 15 consecutive times due to pressure from Beijing .
Taiwan has just 24 diplomatic allies -- mostly small , impoverished nations in the South Pacific , Africa and Latin America , compared to around 180 for economically booming China .
Taiwan ’s foreign ministry expressed regret at the U.N. move , saying the right to representation for the people of Taiwan had not been resolved , according to a report from Taiwan ’s Central News Agency .
China has kept Taiwan out of most world bodies that require statehood as a condition for membership , blocking its attempt to join the World Health Organisation earlier this year .
Taiwan left the United Nations in 1972 when Communist China took over the seat from the Nationalist government that fled to the island after the civil war , and has been unrepresented in the body since then .
Chen ’s independence - leaning Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) , in power since 2000 , is also pursuing a referendum that would allow the island ’s residents to vote on whether it should pursue U.N. membership under the name Taiwan .
That campaign has drawn the ire of not only Beijing , but also the United States -- Taiwan ’s most important ally -- which has said it opposes moves by Taiwan that would unilaterally change the status quo between China and Taiwan .
いまジャンルそのものが絶滅寸前である女子プロレス界ですが、その中のさらにごくごく一部だけど話題沸騰中のレスラーがいるので紹介。
「 真琴」っていうデビューしたばっかりの選手なんですが。
とりあえず、所属する団体*1『アイスリボン』のブログにあるプロフィールを引用。太字は僕。
さらにデビュー直前の日記。書いてるのはアイスリボン代表のさくらえみという選手。
※真 琴 …16歳。166センチ、51キロ。 ２月頃さくら宛にメールが届きました。身長と年齢にうきうきした初対面の日、期待はすぐに裏切られました。 声がきこえない。
返事をうながすとせき込む。
目が合わない 。
スポーツするような服も靴ももっていない…。 当然なにもできません。
1番最初にやったリング上をくるくるまるく歩く練習で気分が悪くなり初日終了…。
困ったなぁと思いながら、もう来ないだろうと思っていましたが、３日連続で来ました！(４日目はさくらの用事)
相変わらずすぐ気分が悪くなり何もできなく、あやしい洋服での練習です。
すこーしずつ、すこーしずつできるようになるのですが、今日も声を出せなくて咳払いをしながらロープワークをしていました。
そんな真琴をアイスリボンのマットにあげようとおもったのはやめさせたかったからです。練習はしてても先がはるか彼方にもみえないし、でもとにかくやめないから、プロレスラーになれないことを早く悟ってやめてほしかったんです。
真琴が練習したいといえば出掛けて行き、気分が悪くなるということが続いていたのでうんざりしていました。
ところが、アイスリボンプレ旗揚げ戦でのデビューが決まると急にいきいきしだしました。
相変わらず返事をしてとうながせばせき込むだけの真琴でしたが、エルボーもストンピングも力強くなっていきました(あれでもです)
真琴に無気力ファイターと名付けたのはさくらですが、真琴にやる気はあるんですよ。
キャッチコピーは明日の試合で返上かも知れません。
いやー、アイドルレスラーとか言われても実際に見に行こうと思いませんが、元ひきこもりのレスラーって言われると「見てみたい」と思うものですね。これだけである意味プロといえます。銭を取れるわけですから。
子供の頃に虚弱体質だったっていうレスラーはわりと多いんだけど、それを克服しないままに入門、そしてデビューっていうのがすごい。
17歳の誕生日から個人ブログやってるんですけど（さくら代表に観察されるという形ではあるけど）、そこに写真もありました。
萌えとかは全然ないけど、これは応援したすぎる。
このように注目度は新人としては異例なんですが、さすがに戦績は目も当てられない状況です。
7・25 千本桜2 部 ○零( ０分56秒フィンガーロック ) 真琴×
8・15 千本桜 1 部 ○ひなた( ０分36秒弓矢固め ) 真琴×
8・15 千本桜 ○石井美紀( ７分43秒フロントネックロック) 春日萌花&真琴×
8・16 千本桜 ○あい か( １分05 秒ギブアップ ) 真琴× ※フルネルソ ン
だいたいこんな感じで、シングルだと1分前後で負けてます。
しかも 「ひなた 」とか「あいか」って小学生ですからね。93年生まれで体重34キロの小学生に羽交い絞め（フルネルソン）されて、ギブアップする17歳。やばい絵だなー。
まあ最近は、逆水平チョップからのフォールを（一度だけ）返したりできるようになってるみたいですからね。そんな成長ドキュメント、見た過ぎる。ブログ読んでても
腹筋では体を起こすどころかみのむしのようにもぞもぞ動くだけだった真琴、今はV字腹筋ができます！
とか書いてありますしね。
僕はレスラーとかボクサーとかのデビューまでのドキュメントが好きだし、RPGでも序盤の何も出来ない頃が一番楽しかったりするんですが、真琴を見てたらそれを長く味わえるんでは、という気はしますね。まあ平均並の体力になったら売りが消えるんでそっから先は不安ですけど･･･。
ブログもおもしろいんで、とりあえずしばらく追っかけますけどね。
この日とかすごい 。
真琴は実家暮らしのため、プロレスの練習を始めたときに「ご飯は自分で作ろう」と約束しました。かれこれ半年？
毎日メールで送られてきます。
今日のご飯は？ ？
「 御飯( お茶漬けです … ) の写真を送らせて下さい！
では、失礼しまし た
真琴 」
お茶漬けはないなー。もっと食べるのも頑張れよ。
そんな真琴ですが、この間ある事件に巻き込まれました。ユニオンという団体でセコンド業務をやっていたら、メカマミーっていう選手に追いかけられたんだそうです。
コイツがメカマミー 。
メカマミーというのはその名の通り、機械仕掛けのミイラ。得意技はロケットパンチとドリル攻撃です。（ここからいけるメカマミー動画は名作！）
対人恐怖症の17歳女子がこれに追いかけられたらキツいなー。
で、その日の真琴ブログ。
「 通路にしゃがみ込んだ真琴」の写真がいいなあ。夢とか与えられなさ過ぎる。
さらには10月15日、メカマミーVS真琴のシングルマッチが決定！
まー、格闘技に比べて弱い人や負けた人、さらにそこからの這い上がり方に注目が集まるのもプロレスです。
あとぶっちゃけていえばメカマミーには中の人がいるんですが（たぶん）、真琴の弱さは本物なわけで、この虚実入り混じってるカオス感がいかにもプロレスで素晴らしいです。そもそもこの試合までの顛末も、たまたまメカマミーが思いつきで真琴をいじったのを試合に繋げたのか、試合が決まってたからこそ前フリとしていじったのかも全然分かりませんし。
なんにせよ、 “ 現代科学とエジプト4000年の神秘の結晶”と戦うというのは引きこもり人生最大の壁でしょうね。ていうか普通の人でもそんな壁にブチ当たることなんかないけど。
最後の 「 真琴！」がかわいい。

Queueing Theory Basics
We have seen that as a system gets congested , the service delay in the system increases .
A good understanding of the relationship between congestion and delay is essential for designing effective congestion control algorithms .
Queuing
Theory provides all the tools needed for this analysis .
This article will focus on understanding the basics of this topic .
Communication Delays
Before we proceed further , lets understand the different components of delay in a messaging system .
The total delay experienced by messages can be classified into the following categories :
Processing Delay
This is the delay between the time of receipt of a packet for transmission to the point of putting it into the transmission queue .
On the receive end , it is the delay between the time of reception of a packet in the receive queue to the point of actual processing of the message .
This delay depends on the CPU speed and CPU load in the system .
Queuing Delay
This is the delay between the point of entry of a packet in the transmit queue to the actual point of transmission of the message .
This delay depends on the load on the communication link .
Transmission Delay
This is the delay between the transmission of first bit of the packet to the transmission of the last bit .
This delay depends on the speed of the communication link .
Propagation Delay
This is the delay between the point of transmission of the last bit of the packet to the point of reception of last bit of the packet at the other end .
This delay depends on the physical characteristics of the communication link .
Retransmission Delay
This is the delay that results when a packet is lost and has to be retransmitted .
This delay depends on the error rate on the link and the protocol used for retransmissions .
In this article we will be dealing primarily with queueing delay .
Little 's Theorem
We begin our analysis of queueing systems by understanding Little 's Theorem .
Little 's theorem states that :
The average number of customers ( N ) can be determined from the following equation :
N = λT
Here lambda is the average customer arrival rate and T is the average service time for a customer .
Proof of this theorem can be obtained from any standard textbook on queueing theory .
Here we will focus on an intuitive understanding of the result .
Consider the example of a restaurant where the customer arrival rate ( lambda ) doubles but the customers still spend the same amount of time in the restaurant ( T ) .
This will double the number of customers in the restaurant ( N ) .
By the same logic if the customer arrival rate remains the same but the customers service time doubles , this will also double the total number of customers in the restaurant .
Queueing System Classification
With Little 's Theorem , we have developed some basic understanding of a queueing system .
To further our understanding we will have to dig deeper into characteristics of a queueing system that impact its performance .
For example , queueing requirements of a restaurant will depend upon factors like :
How do customers arrive in the restaurant ?
Are customer arrivals more during lunch and dinner time ( a regular restaurant ) ?
Or is the customer traffic more uniformly distributed ( a cafe ) ?
How much time do customers spend in the restaurant ?
Do customers typically leave the restaurant in a fixed amount of time ?
Does the customer service time vary with the type of customer ?
How many tables does the restaurant have for servicing customers ?
The above three points correspond to the most important characteristics of a queueing system .
They are explained below :
Arrival Process
The probability density distribution that determines the customer arrivals in the system .
In a messaging system , this refers to the message arrival probability distribution .
Service Process
The probability density distribution that determines the customer service times in the system .
In a messaging system , this refers to the message transmission time distribution .
Since message transmission is directly proportional to the length of the message , this parameter indirectly refers to the message length distribution .
Number of Servers Number of servers available to service the customers .
In a messaging system , this refers to the number of links between the source and destination nodes .
Based on the above characteristics , queueing systems can be classified by the following convention :
A/S/n
Where A is the arrival process , S is the service process and n is the number of servers .
A and S are can be any of the following :
M ( Markov ) Exponential probability density D ( Deterministic )
All customers have the same value G ( General )
Any arbitrary probability distribution
Examples of queueing systems that can be defined with this convention are :

Its me , your soon to be ex-girlfriend .
We have n’t been dating very long bf , and for the most part things are going great .
But I have to tell you , your weekly freak outs are getting on my nerves .
I realize that ALL of your girlfriends in the past have cheated on you .
You have only mentioned this a hundred times .
Maybe it ’s because you ’ve only dated 21 year olds .
Huh ??
Ever think of that ??
You ’re 30 ; of course they are going to cheat on you .
I ’m not 21 , FUCK I ’m barely in my 20 ’s anymore .
STOP ACCUSING ME OF CHEATING ON YOU .
You have no fucking idea how annoying it is .
Every single week it ’s something new that I ’ve done to make that little head of yours go into overdrive and start thinking I ’m up to something .
I ’m not up to anything .
I ’m at home , not at a bar ( although I used to be ) .
I ’m sitting my sweet little ass in my little apartment , so I ’m not making you crazy thinking I ’m out gallivanting .
Here ’s the truth : I come into contact with about 50 men a day .
I work in an office , I ca n’t help it .
90 % of them are old and gross like I tell you .
But , the other 10 % are kinda hot .
Okay not really hot , but office hot .
( Office hot , is when he ’s the god of the office , but in the real world you would n’t blink twice at him ) .
Those 10 % I ’ve worked with for many years , let me tell you , if I have n’t fucked them already , I ’m not going to .
I have a certain goals for myself career wise and being the office bicycle is n’t one of them .
Before I met you , I was a single gal out in the city , in that time I made many acquaintances , some yes I have nailed , and some I have n’t .
The ones I fucked , I no longer talk to .
The ones I have n’t , still email me from time to time .
Again , if I have n’t fucked them , I ’m not going to .
My life ca n’t stop because you have suddenly appeared .
Stop questioning who ‘ HE ’ is .
‘ HE ’ is a friend .
( I ’ll note now , that many of the male ‘ friends ’ I had , suddenly stopped talking to me once you were the ‘ boyfriend ’ , so that already weeds out the good from the bad )
And when I tell you someone is gay .
I ’m not making it up .
HE ’S GAY .
And therefore has never had any interest in me , so fuck off .
I ’m sure there are few men that I have regular contact with me , that do indeed want to tear my clothes off and have their way with me .
Does n’t mean I am going to let it happen .
Hell the homeless guy on my corner tells me I ’m beautiful every day , this does n’t mean I ’m going to be sitting on his face tonight .
Get over it .
I ’m dating you , which would mean I ’m not interested in anyone else .
Take a step back , you think I ’m hot , that does n’t mean everyone else does .
Well , I must say I ’m pretty high on myself too , but it does not mean I ’m nailing every loser in sight .
I really like you BF , but you ’re incessant accusations are driving me up the fucking wall .
One day you might just push me to the brink I will nail someone just to know that I ’m getting accused of doing something I actually did .

Development Stopped ( November 27 th , 2011 )
Actually , MGMaps development stopped about two years ago ... but never was announced on this new page .
So here it is , I am no longer actively working on this project .
There is a ( tiny ) chance the project will be revived and ported , but unless that happens you can consider the MGMaps project closed .
I have thought of porting it to Android and / or iPhone , but the work and time needed for that outweigh possible benefits -- there are many apps that provide offline maps on both platforms ( including the official Google Maps on Android ) .

I started out in early 2004 as a blog skeptic .
But over the last four years , I 've become a born - again believer .
In that time , I 've written almost a thousand blog entries , and I 've read thousands upon thousands of blog entries .
As a result , I 've developed some rather strong opinions about what makes blogs work so well , and what makes blogs sometimes not work so well .
I 'd like to share some of the latter with you today , in a piece I call Thirteen Blog Cliches .
Before I start , realize that these are my opinions .
That should be a redundant statement on any blog , much less my own , but I 'm putting the disclaimer out there anyway .
Just because I run my blog a certain way does n't make it the right way – or even a very good way .
These are preferences , not beliefs .
Please do n't be offended if your blog , or a blog you enjoy , violates one of my so - called cliches .
I 'm not trying to single any one person or blog out here .
It 's your blog , and you do n't have to answer to me .
I 'm just some guy on the internet .
Run your blog as you see fit .
These are nothing more than broad observations formed over a period of four years where I 've been deeply immersed in blog culture .
You may not agree that these are cliches .
You might even feel very strongly that I 'm wrong about all of this .
That 's what comments and trackbacks are for .
Use them .
The Useless Calendar Widget
This list is n't in any particular order , with one exception .
There is nothing I dislike more than the redundant blog calendar widget .
It 's like a recurring canker sore we can't quite seem to rid ourselves of .
I can't think of a single time I have ever found the blog calendar widget helpful .
My computer already has a calendar function , so it 's not like I need another calendar displayed in my web browser .
Every post carries an obvious datestamp , so I can easily discern when it was published .
But knowing whether someone posted an entry on the third tuesday of the month ?
Utterly useless .
The calendar widget is the vestigial tail of blog engines , evidence of our primordial ancestors .
But we 've evolved ; it 's time to lose the tail .
Surely there 's something more useful we could put in that space .
Random Images Arbitrarily Inserted In Text
One of the cardinal rules of web writing is to avoid large blocks of text .
There are plenty of excellent web writing guides that exhort you to break up your text , using bullets , numbered lists , quotes , paragraph breaks , images – anything , anything to avoid creating an intimidating wall of dense , impenetrable text .
And they 're right .
That 's what you should do .
I do it all the time .
I 'm doing it right now .
But like all good advice , it can be taken too far .
For example , when you find yourself inserting random pictures into your writing for the sole purpose of breaking up the text .
In the above snippet , what does that image have to do with the text ?
As far as I can tell , absolutely nothing at all .
I see this on a disturbing number of blogs and feeds that I regularly read .
It 's probably due to the influence of Philip Greenspun and his seminal book , Philip and Alex 's Guide to Web Publishing , where the text is juxtaposed with random photographs that Philip has taken .
It 's one of the earliest and best references on web development , and the fact that it 's still relevant today despite its age speaks volumes about the quality of Mr. Greenspun 's writing .
But it 's the writing that makes the book a classic , not the amateur photography sprinkled throughout its pages .
As the old adage goes , a picture is worth a thousand words .
But you should no more insert a random image into your writing than you would insert a thousand random words into your writing .
I do n't care how beautiful your photographs are , it 's a terrible , irresponsible practice that distracts and harms readability .
And those of you sitting there smugly , with your stock photo library and your peripherally , tangentially , almost - but - not - quite related images that you use to break up your text , do n't think I 'm not talking about you , either .
Because I am .
Think about that the next time you read an article about a " web 2.0 bubble " accompanied by – you guessed it – a stock photo of a child blowing a bubble .
Images are not glorified paragraph breaks .
Images should contribute to the content and meaning of the article in a substantive way .
And if they do n't , they should be cut .
Mercilessly .
No Information on the Author When I find well - written articles on blogs that I want to cite , I take great pains to get the author 's name right in my citation .
If you 've written something worth reading on the internet , you 've joined a rare club indeed , and you deserve proper attribution .
It 's the least I can do .
That 's assuming I can find your name .
To be fair , this does n't happen often .
But it should n't ever happen .
The lack of an " About Me " page – or a simple name to attach to the author 's writing – is unforgivable .
But it 's still a problem today .
Every time a reader encounters a blog with no name in the byline , no background on the author , and no simple way to click through to find out anything about the author , it strains credulity to the breaking point .
It devalues not only the author 's writing , but the credibility of blogging in general .
Maintaining a blog of any kind takes quite a bit of effort .
It 's irrational to expend that kind of effort without putting your name on it so you can benefit from it .
And so we can too .
It 's a win - win scenario for you , Mr. Anonymous .
Excess Flair I 'd like to talk to you about your flair .
Blogs work because they 're simple .
When we clutter up our blogs with a zillion widgets , features , and add - ons , we 're destroying an essential part of what makes blogs worthwhile .
I 've lost track of all the times I 've clicked on an image in a blog and been hijacked by some crazy JavaScript image loading technique , when a simple link to the image would have sufficed – and probably would have been faster and more convenient .
Or when I 've moused over an unassuming hyperlink and had an annoying , superfluous image preview of the link pop up when I did n't want it to .
And do your readers really want to see pictures of the last 10 visitors to your blog ?
Before you add a new " feature " to your blog , consider whether this feature will be useful enough to your readers to overcome the additional complexity it adds to the page .
Hint : almost none of them are .
The Giant Blogroll I 'm all for linking generously to outside content .
We all stand on the shoulders of giants , after all .
Although if you look down in today 's world , you might find that you 're standing on lots and lots of midgets .
Large or small , we owe them a debt of gratitude .
Citing your references and influences is a great and necessary thing , but obsessively listing every single blog you read – the so - called " blogroll " – is just noise .
If you 're really reading this many blogs , you should be linking to them organically in your blog posts , in a sort of natural quid pro quo .
Wearing a giant blogroll on your sleeve is an empty gesture .
I 'm reminded of the distasteful way that blogs in giant ad networks ( such as Weblogs , Inc ) spam every page with a huge list of internal links to their other blogs .
It feels artificial and insincere .
Publish your OPML if you think organic links in your writing are n't telling the whole story , but avoid cluttering up your page with a huge , spammy blogroll .
The Nebulous Tag Cloud I 'm a big fan of tagging .
It 's far superior to the old method of placing everything in hierarchical folders .
Tag categories on blogs are moderately useful , particularly for bloggers who tend to bounce around among many different topics .
What I 've never found useful , however , is the stereotypical tag cloud visualization , where the size of the tag word varies with its frequency .
The perception is that tag cloud visualizations are cool , like badges of honor for the tagging club .
The reality is that tag cloud visualizations are chaotic , noisy , and unusable .
Keep the tagging , lose the cloud .
A simple sorted list of tags , along with the number of posts associated with each tag , is much more effective .
Excessive Advertisements
Advertising is a fact of life .
People need to feed their starving children .
I get it .
I 've even reluctantly entered the field myself .
But is it really necessary to make your blog look like Times Square ?
Does every square inch of whitespace have to be filled with paid links , Google AdSense , and ad banners ?
In the process of researching this article , I found a related article on blog usability that 's a perfect – even ironic – example of how you can hurt your usability with excessive , obnoxious advertising .
It 's everywhere .
It is almost never in the reader 's interest to see advertisements , so my advice is to tread very lightly , and be respectful of your audience .
Bad advertising is so prevalent that if you take the time to advertise responsibly , you may find that readers appreciate you for it .
Well , probably not , but it can't hurt to try .
This Ain't Your Diary I do n't begrudge anyone their right to post whatever it is they think they need to post on their blog .
But let 's be perfectly clear : your readers are n't coming to your blog to read about you .
They 're coming to your blog to find out what it can do for them .
If you find your blog turning into a diary of your daily activities , you 'll have a very limited audience unless you happen to be a real world celebrity .
Even my wife is n't particularly interested in the minutiae of what I do every day .
Why would I expect my readers to be ?
That said , blogs are a place for writers to find an interested audience , and a place for readers to find a helpful peer and a unique voice .
It 's OK to be yourself ; at some level , it is a cult of personality : people are reading not only because your content is useful to them , but because they like you .
It 's normal to inject a regular dose of yourself into the conversation .
But like Tabasco sauce and other powerful seasonings , a little YOU goes a long way .
A really long way .
Write accordingly .
Sorry I Have n't Written in a While
If you have n't posted anything new to your blog in a while , do n't waste our time with apologies .
Just write !
The best apology is new and improved content .
Maybe with a wee bit more consistency this time , though .
The most important piece of advice I give anyone who asks me about blogging is this : pick a schedule you can live with , and stick to it .
That does n't mean you should post substandard crap , of course , but I find that talent is far less important than enthusiasm .
And the best way to demonstrate your enthusiasm – and to improve – is to get out there and write .
Regularly .
And if you can't muster the enthusiasm for writing regularly , move on .
But do n't stop creating .
Blogging About Blogging I find meta - blogging – blogging about blogging – incredibly boring .
I said as much in a recent interview on a site that 's all about blogging ( hence the title , Daily Blog Tips ) .
I was n't trying to offend or shock ; I was just being honest .
Sites that contain nothing but tips on how to blog more effectively bore me to tears .
If you accept the premise that most of your readers are not bloggers , then it 's highly likely they wo n't be amused , entertained , or informed by a continual stream of blog entries on the art of blogging .
Even if they 're filled with extra bloggy goodness .
Meta - blogging is like masturbating .
Everyone does it , and there 's nothing wrong with it .
But writers who regularly get out a little to explore other topics will be healthier , happier , and ultimately more interesting to be around – regardless of audience .
Mindless Link Propagation
One of the most pernicious problems in blogging is the echo chamber effect .
Most blog entries merely regurgitate what other people have said or add vapid commentary on top of news articles and press releases .
Only the tiniest fraction of blog entries are original content , and only a tiny fraction of that fraction is worth your time .
One of my very favorite articles is Chris Pirillo 's piece on 10 Ways to Eliminate the Echo Chamber .
Chris has been blogging for a very , very long time and he has the battle scars to prove it .
This call to action should be required reading for every blogger .
With pop quizzes .
It 's always been deeply disappointing to me that we have the whole of human history to talk about , and most people can't get past what happened today .
If I wanted news , I 'd visit one of the hundreds of news sites that do nothing but news every day .
Putting yourself in the news business is a thankless , unending grind .
Do n't do it .
If everyone knows about it , what value does that information have ?
Three years from now , will anyone care that Apple released a new iPod on that particular day ?
My advice here is almost contrarian : if everyone else is talking about it , that means you should avoid talking about it .
Switch things up .
Seek out uncommon sites with unique information .
Dig down to original sources and read the material everyone is commenting ( comments on top of comments on top of comments ) endlessly on .
If all you can find to talk about is what 's already popular , you 're not trying hard enough .
Form your own opinion .
Do your own research .
Go out of your way to blaze a new trail and create something we have n't already seen hundreds of times before .
Top ( n ) Lists
Yes , exactly like this one .
The problem with Top ( n ) Lists is that they become a substitute for critical thinking , the classic , laziest possible use of Cliff 's Notes that every college professor and high school teacher fears .
You 're supposed to read the book , then read the Cliff 's Notes as a companion to the book – not use the Cliff 's notes as a substitute for reading the book .
Lists are a great convention .
They make sense , people understand them , and they 're a logical way to structure your writing .
But do n't let lists become a crutch .
I 'm always taken aback when I see the " most popular " posts on a blog dominated by Top ( n ) Lists .
Shortcuts are only meaningful if you know what it is , exactly , you 're cutting .
If all you read is whatever Top ( n ) Lists have managed to float to the top of today 's Reddit or Digg homepage , then you 've cheated yourself out of the deeper experience of reading a complete book .
If you find that the Top ( n ) List convention is a go - to tool in your writing toolkit , consider rebalancing your writing portfolio with longer , more in - depth pieces as well .
Not everything should be a sprint ; throw a few small marathons in there somewhere to complement your short distance skills .

Mother blames Great America park for death of her 4 - year - old son in 2 feet of water in wave pool 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Yolanda Flores sat in the garage of a family member 's home in south San Jose on Friday , swathed in black , hugging her remaining 2 - year - old son to her chest , and blamed the Great America amusement park in Santa Clara for the drowning of her 4 - year - old boy .
Flores disputed key elements of the park 's account of how the tragedy unfolded Thursday at the Great Barrier Reef wave pool , an expanse of churning water about half the size of a football field , where she had let the 4 - year - old boy , Carlos Alejandro Flores , play unattended .
Park officials said six lifeguards were on duty when one spotted Carlos around 2:30 p.m. near the middle of the pool , where the water is about 2 feet deep when waves are n't rolling through .
At its deepest point , the pool is 6 feet deep .
Flores , 27 , said there were only four lifeguards at the pool at the time and that her 8 - year - old daughter , Jasmine , was the one who spotted the boy underwater after he apparently had been there for several minutes .
" That 's a lie that there were six , " Flores said .
" There 's four lifeguards there .
How can they not see my son ?
There 's three walking and one sitting .
They were n't doing their job .
He was in 2 feet of water .
How could he drown ?
" I want this to be known , " Flores said between sobs .
" I want to warn all parents that they need to watch their kids at all times , because ( Great America ) does n't do their job . "
Great America officials insisted six lifeguards had been on duty at the wave pool .
Lifeguards and paramedics tried to resuscitate Carlos before he was taken to Kaiser Medical Center in Santa Clara , where he was pronounced dead .
" We expressed the deepest sympathies to her and her family and her family friends for what has happened , " park spokesman Gene Frugé said .
" She is mistaken .
There were certainly six lifeguards on duty . "
Frugé said company policy also requires six lifeguards to be present before the wave pool is opened .
" We just want to let her know that safety is our No. 1 priority , " Frugé said .
" We wo n't open any attraction unless we feel it 's safe . "
Flores said she had not been in the pool with her son at the time and does not know how he drowned .
The 4 - year - old had been in the water earlier , got out to eat some chips and went back in , she said .
When he did n't return within 10 minutes , she said , she became concerned and told her daughter to find him .
After Jasmine told her mother she could n't see the boy , both started toward the pool , where Jasmine ultimately found him underwater , Flores said .
The girl 's screams attracted the lifeguards ' attention , she said .
Great America has no age or height requirements for children at the wave pool .
" We do recommend that children under 4 feet tall use life vests , and we have them readily available , " Frugé said .
" There is no official rule that requires it . "
Carlos was 4 feet tall , his mother said .
He was not wearing a vest but might not have been required to if the recommended height rule were mandatory .
Mechanized wave pools at water parks are largely unregulated by the state beyond annual inspections , officials said Friday as police and state inspectors began investigations into the boy 's death .
There are no state requirements governing the number of lifeguards that must be on duty , nor are there age or height restrictions , said Kate McGuire , a spokeswoman for the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration .
There is no requirement that children wear personal flotation devices .
Safety recommendations are outlined by an individual attraction 's manufacturers , and state inspectors check to see if those guidelines are being followed , McGuire said .
Great America's wave pool passed an unannounced state inspection three days before Carlos drowned , McGuire said .
The Santa Clara County coroner 's office completed an autopsy on the boy Friday but refused to release the cause of death until the investigation is complete .
The Great Barrier Reef wave pool will remain closed indefinitely as the investigations continue , but the rest of Boomerang Bay water park at Great America reopened Friday , Frugé said .
Bill Avery , an aquatic safety consultant in Orlando , Fla. , who formerly worked for several amusement parks , said adult supervision is crucial during water play .
" It gets down to some basic personal responsibility , " Avery said .
" People have to remain cognizant when kids are involved , I do n't care what activity they 're involved in .
. . .
As a father and grandfather , a 4 - year - old with me in the water is not going to be more than a handgrip away from me at any time . "
Anne Crawford , a San Francisco mother of three who brought her family to Great America 's wave pool last month , described a crowded experience where swimmers were buffeted by the waves and people in rented inner tubes .
" It was amazingly crowded ; we had two parents looking after one 7 - year - old , " Crawford said .
" Once the waves started , it was hard to stay together .
. . .
The inner tubes are really a hazard to other guests because it is really easy to get trapped between several tubes as you bounce around in the waves . "
Crawford said she saw lifeguards on the side of the pool but no lifeguards in the shallow entry area .
" At a minimum , Great America should require all kids 6 and under wear life vests in the wave pool , and that an adult accompany them in the water , " Crawford said .
A park spokesman said Great America does recommend that parents accompany young children .
Requiring flotation devices at a pool would be rare , if not unprecedented , in the country and difficult to enforce , said Brett Petit , a spokesman for Palace Entertainment in Newport Beach ( Orange County ) , which owns nine water parks in several states including Raging Waters in San Jose .
" Where do you draw the line ? "
Petit said .
" If a kid is splashing around in the shallows , does the kid need to have a life jacket on ? "
Drowning is the leading cause of death for children 5 and under in California , according to the San Mateo County Health Department .
There have been no drowning deaths in water - park wave pools in the state in at least five years , McGuire said .
At least six people have drowned in wave pools around the world since 2000 , according to press accounts .
Parents have to " be vigilant all the time " with children in pools , said Sue Sherman , a spokeswoman for Lifesaving Society , a Canadian water safety group .
" That includes lifeguarded circumstances , " Sherman said .
" The lifeguard is your safety net .
The first person that 's responsible is the adult that takes those children to the pool . "
MAKE poverty history is a compelling slogan .
Halve it by 2015 , in contrast , is a measurable commitment .
That is the logic behind the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) , a host of targets in the struggle against global deprivation , disease and illiteracy , set by the world 's leaders at a United Nations jamboree in 2000 .
The goals claim to convert campaign slogans into bankable pledges , complete with a number and a date .
The world has , for example , resolved to cut the rate at which mothers die from child - birth by three - quarters from 1990 to 2015 .
The percentage of people without safe water will fall by half ; infant mortality by a third .
Quick to spot a resonant date in the calendar , the UN has declared Saturday July 7th as the official halfway point towards these 2015 deadlines .
The 2000 summit was unprecedented in its pulling power , attracting more bigwigs than ever before .
Although many of the targets were recycled for the second or third time — the 1980s were supposed to bring water and sanitation to the great unwashed ; the 1990s were supposed to provide “ education for all ” — they have remained surprisingly conspicuous , becoming a kind of secular scripture for the aid fraternity .
The UN family , of course , cherishes them .
The World Bank invoked the goals last month when pitching for an infusion of $ 32 billion from its richer members .
Pascal Lamy , head of the World Trade Organisation , followed suit in his plea this week to save the Doha round of global trade talks .
Even the IMF , which knows an inconvertible currency when it sees one , pays them solemn respect .
And it gives politicians in poor countries more motivation to pay attention to saving mothers from eclampsia or children from diarrhoea .
Sadly , however , they cannot do what they purport to do , which is to provide credible benchmarks against which governments can be judged .
Set for the world as a whole , the numerical targets do not fit any country in particular .
China had all but met the target of halving poverty from its 1990 levels by the time it was set a decade later .
That ( plus growth in India ) mostly explains why the world is making unprecedented progress against poverty .
Almost 32 % of people in the developing world lived on less than a dollar a day in 1990 .
In 2004 that figure was 19.2 % .
It should fall below 16 % by 2015 .
Sub -Saharan Africa , on the other hand , will fall short of all of the goals , even though its economy is growing quicker than it has for a generation and it is putting children in school faster than any other region .
The extreme - poverty rate in Africa has fallen from an estimated 46 % in 1999 to 41 % in 2004 , but that is still way off the 2015 target of 22 % .
Hunger and malnutrition still gnaw at the region : the proportion of under -fives who are underweight has declined only marginally , from 33 % in 1990 to 29 % in 2005 .
Africa lags partly because its population is growing so rapidly .
Thus , although millions more African children are going to school , there are still very many who are not .
According to the UN , in 1990 there were 237 m Africans under 14 ; today , that figure is 348 m , and by 2015 it is expected to top 400m .
Some goals cannot be met , others cannot even be measured .
Poor countries collect no reliable numbers on deaths from malaria or from childbirth — although the goals are helping to stir a welcome interest in generating better figures .
And sometimes what is measured ( number of children enrolled in school ) is not what counts ( the number who learn anything ) .
Foreign aid , of course , does not always produce results , although better targeted funds may produce better outcomes .
And some results do not require much money .
Brazil is four times richer than Sri Lanka , but its children are more than twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday .
Improving sanitation is about breaking habits as much as building latrines .
And although aid money can send a doctor to the boondocks , it can not make him show up to work .
The social progress envisaged in the 2015 targets requires the kind of nationwide nannying that only an accountable domestic government , not a distant foreign donor , can sustain .
A very long time ago , I wrote this speculative diary , on how I would go about setting up myself as absolute sovereign of the rich lands between Canada and Mexico , on the continent of North America .
Were I interested in upending the Republic and setting myself up as king , then I 'd have a lot of work cut out for me .
After all , the United States ' very existence is an explict eff you to monarchy .
Regardless , fascinations with power , with destiny , with imposing one 's superior vision on a restive and chaotic public for its own good fill American history .
An ancient example is Aaron Burr ; a more recent one ... well , you know the guy .
He 's the one claiming powers of legislation and judicial review lately .
Of course , this exercise stops being amusing very quickly : that 's the point .
You 're not supposed to be amused .
You 're supposed to wonder : Hmm ... someone could really do this someday .
In fact , someone is doing it right before your eyes .
Monarchies are invariably religious societies -- rather , they are societies in which an influential theocracy wields considerable influence over public opinion , monied and landed interests , the courts , the promulgation of law , and the very constitution itself .
In a country like the United States , the mission is manifold , and will likely take decades to implement the following interrelated goals :
Change Perceptions : Make Monarchism Cool .
Control the Conversation : Frames , Media Ownership , Participation .
Act Precipitately : To Conceal the Few Moves That Matter .
Demand Loyalty : Raise No Allies .
Make Vassals .
Gather Arms and Gold : Prepare for the Final Confrontation .
Fine - Grained Organization : Personal Involvement
Empower the Faithful : Define the Crusade
Enter the New Order : By Default , for the Old One Dies
Alrighty .
Let 's elaborate on that .
Implement a campaign to " protect " the Constitution -- by challenging the legitimacy of all competing efforts to interpret it , to declare oneself a strict constructionist , then from a position of unassailable dedication to the ' original intent ' of the Founding Fathers , interpret it however I / we / We please .
Not : I / we / We do not say ' Framers ' , but Founding Fathers ; we 're all about the patrimony in this exercise .
I mean , we 're setting up a monarchy , folks .
This one is easy : Signing statements have made a mockery of rule of law .
If that 's not conflation of both legislation and judicial review with the power of the executive , then nothing is .
Sure , presidents have added notes in the past ... but not accompanied same with staring contests vis a vis Congress ... and won , every time .
And now , even the few enforcement options allowed the Congress are being preempted .
Bush is flatly rejecting any repsonsibility to the American people through their elected representation in Congress .
Last I checked , that 's not impeachment - worthy .
That 's treason , wide open , in time of war , in front of more than two witnesses to the same act .
Demonize Congress as the source of corruption and confusion , waste and wrongness with Washington .
I mean , all those greedy , venal little men with little power , conniving at every turn , making ... compromises .
They are the problem ... so we need to throw them all out and get people in Congress who are godly , and place a higher power ( me ) first over their own self - advancement , and never , ever compromise their principles .
Then , once safely ensconced , such moral notables can do what such moral notables always do when given free rein -- exactly the same ( if not worse ) than the class before it .
And I / we / We will encourage them to ... indulge themselves .
Tht only discredits Congress as an institution further .
The Abramoff scandal attributed almost exclusively to the Congress -- sure , one can say the Republican Congress , but the Bushies and their friends in the media have made very certain that he remains above the fray .
As for the wholesale short - circuiting of justice with regards tot the Plame outing , where Bush officials dropped a dime on Americans on the line , in pursuit of terrorists who actually were seeking to obtain nuclear materials ?
Congress can do nothing , and Bush laughs .
Silly , little Congress .
And the People despair , and begin to look nervously at their King , fearing his wrath .
One thing that aids and abets the perception of Congress as weak is its bipartisan commitment to appearing on bended knee before the throne of the President , whenever His Sovereign Majesty beckons them , or worse -- whenever he sends the least of his cabinet to Congress , they bow in their own seat of power ( lessness ) to them , as well .
Having hearings , yet not compelling AG Gonzales and others to speak under oath , is an outrage .
It 's also a violation of the Equal Protection Clause .
Do you really think you'd have the option of not taking the oath , should you ever appear before Congress .
That would be a big .... no. Now officials , even mere friends of the President , flout Constitution and Law and Due Process in Bush 's name .
And nothing is done .
In other words , Congress is decadent and weak and feckless and feeble , and only the President can clean it up .
Watch for that narrative to roll on out .
Get in good with the landowners .
That means real estate developers , natural resource extractors , and farmers .
Land = commodities for consumption and export .
That means leverage .
We 'll promote subsidies and tax breaks and special access for these good , loyal friends of the Republic .
They will come to depend on such favors , and I will be the sole dispensary for same .
At first they will love Us , then come to fear losing Our love .
A few words and acronyms : ANWR .
Roadbuilding in national forests .
Clear - cutting national forests .
Mining in national parks .
Selling tracks of national parks to developers .
Have I missed anything ?
Oh , yeah .
Sometimes it 's not selling public lands , so much as selling permission for deals : case in point , the Dubai Ports fiasco .
But that outrage was used to conceal something else : obtaining the concession that it 's cool for the President to rule on any transfer of ownership that has the least impact on national security matters .
He might not own it , even indirectly via the American people , but he controls who gets what in many ways now .
And in our outrage , we kind of missed missing what was in fact taken from us .
Create a political climate of hostility toward institutions , parties and politicians , to ideas old and ideas new , a condition of agitation looking for release , any release .
In such a Hobbesian condition , he who is strongest prevails , and it is a naked contest of power and will , and being the king - in - waiting , who do you think shall win ?
It shall be Us .
By Us , of course , I mean the President .
At this very moment , Bush supporters are playing up that their man is strong and in charge and a good guy doing great deeds , as best as they can .
At the same time , the opposition is assessing both friends and rivals , checking off who is " good " and who is " bad " ( or at least more or less vulnerable , when rating the other team 's players ) .
Institutional affinity is at an all - time low ; people are not going to risk their jobs , their freedom , their physical safety and that of their families for rule of law , or Congress , or the Constitution , or the Supreme Court , or even the Presidency .
People are n't thinking like that anymore , and this plays right into the hands of demogogues .
Not even polls in the sub -30s ( range of polls of late ) appear to matter ; the ones who are reachable to Bush 's message revere him utterly .
The point is that Bush retains the high ground , intense loyalty of what might as well be called the King 's Men , the complete docility of both parties in both houses of Congress , the courts , the media and after successive purges what remains of both the intel services and the armed forces .
And that apparatus is increasingly being focused on keeping order not in Iraq but control inside the United States of America .
And now we see hints from both miiltary officers and government officials that any outcome other that Republican rule would be dangerous for America ... and that they just might have to do something about it .
Oh , no ... no one is spelling it out , that they intend rebellion rather than suffer a new President putting up blue instead of red drapes in the Oval Office .
Regardless , it is unsettling when not being Republican is contemplated as grounds to suspect treason , and blatant refusal to enforce the laws of the land when Republicans are inconvenienced by them is treated as admirable .
Now , perhaps you are hoping that come Janaury 2009 , Bush will quietly leave and all those lovely super - powers will belong to someone else , most likely a Democrat .
I just can't quite trust that the man who would be king , who has broken faith with every law , precedent , oath and principle of lawful , rightful , just governance under the United States Constitution , would simply vacate his throne because his term ran out .
Like I said : Support for institutions in this country , save for the military , is grossly down .
No one will oppose the president , not in any meaningful way , if he were to refuse to leave office , or acted in a unitary fashion , say , to start arresting opponents in Congress wholesale , or confiscate the property and restrict the movements of , say , online critics such as ourselves .
Maybe you are looking to Republican moderates to snap out their reverie on fairness and balance , and hand over the support for impeachment proceedings .
Perhaps you are waiting on deliverance from Arlen Specter .
I mean , he makes a lot of fine noises about holding the Bush administration accountable .
I 'm sure we can count on Republicans in Congress to save the Republic before it collapses entirely .
But if you hoping for Arlen Specter to defend your freedom , to take his vast expertise in the laws of the land and stand up for your Constitution , if you are counting on the gentleman from the great ( and embarrassed ) state of Pennsylvania to do more than regale the gallery with another faithless eulogy to the Constitution , then defend the President 's right to pare down the Constitution the very next day , well , you 're betting on the wrong pony .
And , so far , that goes for Snowe and the rest of them .
And no not even get me started on the closet monarchist , the Aaron Burr of our day , Joseph I. Lieberman .
Do all of the above cloaked in the guise of promoting morality and values , just shy of being in the name of God , which of course would be untrue .
We are doing this in the name of Ourselves .
However , one must honor the customs of the conquered , in order to rule them .
Bush has the rhetoric down .
Sometimes his delivery , even of lame - seeming lines , is frightfully good .
At other times , though , his delivery of solid prose is clumsy , and that 's being charitable .
What carries him more often than not is sticking to a simple language , rich in context , that evokes
" WTFs ? ! " from progressives , " Huh's ? " from moderates and " Thank you , Jesus - es ! " from conservatives , and he comes armed with a dedicated network of radio , television , cable and online vendors , happily creating a political context in which to supersaturate as many minds as possible with emotive associations to the words that the president uses .
Short form :
You watch FoxNews often enough , and regularly enough , you really will be brainwashed .
No , you wo n't go off and bomb something like , say , that staunch Republican Timothy McVeigh did , but it will become physically uncomfortable for you to think at variance to the ' soft - wiring ' that the combination of musical bursts and patriotic banners and slogan banners and intense emotional provocation instills in you .
Assert that the Founders never really meant Separation of Church and State -- Because this empowers the reactionary movement , and casts a wide range of liberties and customs contingent on that foundation into doubt .
Assert that America was founded as a ( Protestant ) Christian nation -- again , not because it is true , but because at the present time , most practicing faith - holders cleave to ( Protestant ) Christianity .
Taxpayer funding of faith - based movements , special access of religious extremists , even to the point of compelling gross breaches of the Constitution ( see : Terri Schiavo ) has become the rule under Bush rule .
The interplay of church and politics is both longstanding and in my opinion okay .
However , the comingling of agendas formed by clergy at events such as the Southern Baptist Convention with American public policy , including national security policy , is a threat to the very safety and existence of the Republic .
Some might say it would be simpler to simply end all religion .
To be honest , if this keeps up I think the conservatives in America will discredit Christianity utterly .
In my opinion no God worth believing in believes in the Republican Party .
Because somewhere along the way , religion went from being a vehicle for emancipation and civil rights , for empowering freedom , to becoming a yoke on the necks of the people , all for ostensibly for good and godly purposes .
That 's just the packaging , though .
It 's all about concentration of power , of establishing legitimacy in the idea that the godhead speaks only to people who are in on the fix .
And anyone else claims that God is second - guessing the king , well , you know what happens .
Do n't make me spell it out for you .
Reveal to the indulgent Congress -- especially those of the same party -- just how short their leash is : Punish a few to send a message to the others , that their power , even their very freedom , is at Our pleasure .
That those who do their King 's will shall enjoy their high offices , and those who displease Us will be tossed over the wall to the howling mob .
We have seen this all spring and summer long .
The Reublicans trying to distance themselves from Bush , and Bush laughingly calling them to his audience chamber , after which they scamper back to Capitol Hill and do his bidding , regardless .
Aggrandize the Executive Office with the powers that a dissolute Congress cannot stop Bush from taking , on account it is busy justifying dead - end investigations that are dead - ended by blatant , contempt - worthy refusal to obey the law .
Signing statements , flouting of existing Acts of Congress , refusal to provide information , spying on Americans .
You know ... the usual power - grab stuff .
Raise wealth from those persons who made much of their latter - day fortune from the Imperial patronage .
As with Congress , send a clear message to the rich and powerful that they , too , can be spared justice and spared nothing , as suits their Sovereign .
For those who are suitable to the forms of the order to be , no crime can not be forgiven .
For those who imagine themselves to be aloof , no refuge shall protect them from royal Justice and the wrath of their sovereign .
All to the forms and laws , of course ... and yet it is a wondrous thing , what command of the bench and of the office of the prosecutor can accomplish ... and what such powers can deny .
The Schrushys played ball , as did Scooter Libby ; they got a pass .
Ken Lay proved to be embarrassing ; ripping off California was cool .
But when he bilked Texans , he went over the line .
Generate a steady diet of little crises , as proving grounds for various strategies and tactics , to test the wits and resolve of enemies and provide training and experience to loyalists .
The particulars are unimportant , the more trivial and irrelevant to national interest the better , all the while insisting that the fate of the Republican depends on every outcome going the President 's way .
Establish an appetite for action by the King and the King 's Men , and even where no interest is raised , acting anyway .
The people must become acccustomed to a vigorous and assertive executive .
This is why Bush gets involved , no matter if its appropriate or even logical .
He must be part of the solution or the problem .
The public must become resigned to the fact that Bush is always there ... even come to depend on his presence in all matters of public importance .
Appear to compromise with other institutions , leaders , the opposition party , even the states ... but honor no promises that do not aggrandize central authority and the rise of new institutions , customs and persons who raise
Our imperium with every gesture , every uttered word .
Leave such persons explaining their unrewarded trust , having to choose between making justification and acknowledging incompetency .
It is the same to Us .
Thus , every gain in Bush 's power seemingly comes , freely offered up by those who lose as he gains .
It is for some a theater , as in when GOP Congressionals gut their own institutional power .
For others , it 's a crisis in courage or character ; they are simply stared down .
For others , there 's a trade - off of some sort .
Find a dire foe , first and foremost one that dwells within the Republic , enjoys the same liberties and privileges of the old order as loyalists .
Make the idea of equality with such persons unbearable to those who love the king ( easy ) , embarrassing to support to those who do not .. then move to gradually reduce the value of such liberties , first slowly , then aggressively .
The latter is happening as of this summer .
If done properly , by the time the last jot of freedom is removed from the Republic , the crowd that matters will carry Bush to his throne in the Capitol Rotunda .... and the rest will cower in fear and confusion , amazed that the 2008 election never happened .
Additional thoughts
You have media , academics , elected and appointed officials stating openly that Bush is a unitary executive and can well and truly tell both Congress and the Constitution to go to hell , and are actively egging Bush to do just that , openly and fearlessly .
People are choosing a very nasty side -- pro-torture , anti-people , pro-power , anti-law , pro-business , anti-environment , pro-war , anti-life , pro-corporate , anti-consumer -- in opposition to all others .
They are tight , they are in consensus , and they feel that they are fighting for a truly righteous cause .
There is no shortcut inexcusable , no crime that is not justified in the name of ... making George W. Bush their king and yours .
We 're now seeing degreed psychologists dispute in academic journals the propriety of torture .
We are discussing here at DKOs at what point that one affront too many will occur .... and despairing of any such trigger being pulled before the gun is to the head of the Republic itself .
The only free speech available -- online -- takes place with no meaningful anonymity at all and rest assured , like it or not , if the fur starts flying if you ever made a strong anti-Bush statement online you are going to either be in the fight , in a gulag , or in an unmarked mass grave somewhere out in the woods .
That is , if it gets that far .
My advice - it 's too late to be quiet now .
Use your tongue while you still have one .
Use your voice while it 's still yours .
Use your hands and hit the keys and post your thoughts while access to audiences friendly and foul is yet allowed you .
In my experience , every revelation or body thrown over the wall by the Bushies is either a diversion or a stopgap , concealment for far greater crimes .
These are not men and women who violate mere law , or process , or ethics .
Those who are caught are for one reason or the other too expensive to protect ... or too valuable as cannon fodder .
The real crimes though are treason and that visceral hatred of freedom and American civilization as it exists -- progressive , egalitarian , prosperous , peace - loving , principled and tolerant -- that they ascribe to others , deny in themselves and demonstrate ( see : New Orleans ) every day they continue to hold power .
The Bushies have no allies , only vassals .
The DA outrage is the utmost example of a movement that places personal loyalty to a liege - lord -- explicit monarchism -- over all other considerations , even the chain of command in the military , even the integrity of our system of laws and justice .
I do not believe at this point that the removal of the Republicans from nominal control of the Executive branch is sufficient .
There will have to be a mass reinstatement , much of it for Republican officeholders who did not make the loyalty qualification , in the wake of removing the Bush administration .
Making this a bipartisan , principled project is essential .
It must be done , done swiftly , assertively , or else the entirety of the Bush administration must be defunded , and let the chips fall where they may .
It 's either a tough political fight , with recourse to laws and the courts ... or a fight in the streets , no rules , no limits on what weapons are used and what is targeted .
And think : Oklahoma City bombing , before you wonder what the conservatives , the Bush loyalists , rather , are willing to do from the word go , once the balloon goes up .
Gather Arms and Gold .
I think the Bushies have been ripping off the public treasury for at least hundreds of billions , perhaps trillions of dollars , using the ultimate money - laundry service -- the Iraq War -- as cover for the relocation of vast amounts of not only funds but weapons into the hands of loyalists .
I think exhausting the national guard has been part of this ; the states , even if they were of a mind to balk , have no means to defend themselves at this point .
It 's Bush , and it 's Bush 's army , and then a ridiculous notion that private citizens can defend their liberty .
And , perhaps the military might balk as an institution at being turned into a partisan war machine .
Problem is , the military is mostly overseas now .
What units are in place here in the country , and what is their current operational status ?
Who are their commanders ?
Are they recent fast - trackers , beneficiaries of Bush largesse ?
Who remains , of the officer cadre , that can be counted on to say ' no ' , to orders to , say , reduce an American city to Fallujah - like status ?
I think many would say no ; I think just as many would champ at the bit to lay waste to a Dem stronghold , and consider that action righteous , even personally enjoyable .
After all , their sovereign approves .
I think Bush is in on everything .
This is a man who has two compelling appetites , and we 've been misled , pleasingly misled , to forget both : one , his utmost contempt for rules , that he alone is above command and reproach and , two , his appetite for absolute control .
He can't be everywhere , but he can take the measure of those in his service , and reward and punish loyalty .
The one saving grace is he can be outsmarted by loyalists who know how to tell him what he wishes to hear , whose interests are very much aligned with those of the president , and quite frankly most yes - men are by definition inefficient thinkers and doers on their very best days , and absurdly foolish and incompetent as a class .
Follow the tractable and the stupid -- you 'll identify 90 % of the Bush loyalists .
The adherence of the Bushies on religious authority is reaching terrifying levels .
I had long suspected the politicization not only of the pulpit , but of Sunday school class curricula , to introduce via bible study ( this being an overwhelmingly Christian phenomenon ) talking points and receptivity of same to classes .
Long ago , in 2003 , class themes seemed to have a crusader bent to them .
Lately , it 's readings from the Book of Hebrews , which is very much a questioning of the ultimate source of moral and legal authority -- that secular laws are weak , impermanent and ineffectual , yet God 's Law is all - powerful , everlasting and righteous .
The subtext is explicit : Revolutionary deliverance .
I do n't know what sort of congregation or any you attend or have any familiarity with , but if what I 'm wondering about is happening in an Episcopal church you 've got to ask yourself what 's going on across the street at the Baptist church .
And lastly , we come to outright calls for replacing the old order , or more precisely , of declaring all of Bush 's super - aggrandizement of power ni the One True Unitary Executive to be fait accompli , and legitimate by right of superior force and media acclaim .
Funny , how that 's only now happening that the Pubs are out of power in Congress .
My message - We are this close to losing everything .
All that separates The Republic now from becoming The Republican Republic is one flinch , one blink , one hesitation .
We are either brave , now , with law and justice and the people at our back , or we can be cowards when not one of the three is with us , and it is all swiftly taken away .
Much of what I say is heated , but much of what can be said , I leave for other voices .
For either
We the People speak , in defense of our liberty and , yes , that means Democrats and Republicans alike , or we will be no people at all .
I think these people in power are willing to bet everything , have the country lose everything , rather than be removed in disgrace , be exposed as disgraceful .
I think we are going to have to confront them .
That can either take place in the halls of power or out in the forests and the fields , the streets and the subdivisions .
I 'm guessing most people still like the notion that we remain a republic of laws that is rightly in the hands of lawgivers , where justice means fairness , not favoritism , where law means rules , not abuse , where power over others is a trust that is swiftly and rightly removed , when betrayed .
This last has not occurred in timely fashion .
The deferment now imperils the very existence of the Republic .
Many would prefer not to fight , today .
Many would prefer to do the right thing , tomorrow .
I know the feeling .
Believe you me , I do .
And I can assure you , there are worse things by far than staking your happiness , your liberty , your very life on being free .
Just ask the next slave you run into .
You 'll know him or her on sight ; they 'll be the ones who are afraid to look you in the eye .
And they 're everywhere these days .
Please ... please be free with me .
When planners devised the Baghdad security plan late last year , they had assumed most Baghdad neighborhoods would be under control around July , according to a senior American military officer , so the emphasis could shift into restoring services and rebuilding the neighborhoods as the summer progressed .
“ We were way too optimistic , ” said the officer , adding that September is now the goal for establishing basic security in most neighborhoods , the same month that Bush administration officials have said they plan to review the progress of the plan .
Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , the senior American ground commander in Iraq , said in a brief interview that he never believed that a midsummer timetable for establishing security in Baghdad was realistic .
“ This was always going to be conditions - driven , ” he said , noting that he always had expected it would take until fall to establish security across much of the city .
But in order to meet that timetable , he added , the Iraqi Security Forces would have to make strides in coming months at maintaining security .
“ Ultimately the I.S.F. , and specifically the police , are the key to holding an area , ” he said .
“ We have to within the next four months move them more toward holding the areas we have cleared . ”
The last of the five combat brigades ordered to Iraq as reinforcements as part of the security plan will increase the number of American troops in the city to around 30,000 , up from 21,000 before the operation , an American officer said .
In addition , around 30,000 Iraqi Army and national police forces and another 21,000 policemen have been deployed in Baghdad .
Many of the Iraqi units have turned up at less than full strength and other units have been redeployed from the capital , General Brooks said , leaving fewer than expected .
Image Neighborhoods like Ameel , Baya , Jihad and Furat remain violent .
American commanders have also had to send troops outside the capital , to deal with a sharp rise in violence in Diyala Province and to search for American soldiers kidnapped south of the capital .

The classic spiral : M51 , also known as the whirlpool galaxy
The hope is that about 30,000 people might take part in a project that could help reveal whether our existing models of the Universe are correct .
Computer users undergo a three - minute online tutorial and are then allocated a series of images and asked to decide whether each one shows a spiral or an elliptical galaxy .
If it 's a spiral galaxy , they 're asked to decide which way it appears to be rotating .
The images come from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope in New Mexico , US .
Kevin Schawinski , an astrophysicist at Oxford University , UK , is one of the team who devised the project .
" I classified about 50,000 galaxies myself in a week , " he said .
" It was mind - numbing . "
He 's hoping that involving the public will speed the work up .
" It 's not just for fun , " he added .
" The human brain is actually better than a computer at pattern recognition tasks like this .
Whether you spend five minutes , 15 minutes or five hours using the site , your contribution will be invaluable . "
The project was inspired by others , such as stardust@home , in which the US space agency invited the public to help sort through dust grains obtained by a mission to a comet .
Amateur skills
Dr Chris Lintott , another member of the Oxford team , said : " What the Stardust team achieved was incredible , but our galaxies are much more interesting to look at than their dust grains .
" We hope that participants in Galaxy Zoo will not only contribute to science , but have a lot of fun along the way . "
He added : " One advantage is that you get to see parts of space that have never been seen before .
These images were taken by a robotic telescope and processed automatically , so the odds are that when you log on , that first galaxy you see will be one that no human has seen before .
" It 's not often you get to see something unique . "
The hope is to have 20,000 - 30,000 people take part and to have some results in a matter of months .
Cosmologist Kate Land , another member of the team , is expecting amateurs to make a better job of it than the experts : " We get hung up on the details .
I got stuck myself !
I 've found that members of public are much better ; they just go with it , on first instinct .
" They do n't get too stressed about the images .
Astronomers are n't the best people to do this . "
She is hoping to test theories about the rotation of galaxies .
She added : " Some people have argued that galaxies are rotating all in agreement with each other , not randomly as we'd expect .
" We want people to classify the galaxies according to which way they 're rotating and I 'll be able to go and see if there 's anything bizarre going on .
If there are any patterns that we 're not expecting , it could really turn up some surprises . "
The Associated Press
WESTERVILLE , Ohio- A high school lunch period was disrupted by a greased , naked student prankster who ran around screaming and flailing his arms until police twice used a stun gun on him , authorities said .
Taylor Killian , 18 , had rubbed his body with oil to keep from being caught , and got up after the first time he was shocked to continue running toward a group of frightened students huddled in a corner at Westerville North High School , Lt. Jeff Gaylor said Monday .
" That prank went a little farther than he intended , I guess , " Gaylor said .
Officer Doug Staysniak was monitoring the lunch period when Killian , with long hair and a full beard , ran in the room toward students , who screamed and ran away .
The officer is normally assigned to a middle school and did not recognize Killian as a student , Gaylor said .
Police said that an administrator ordered Killian to stop , but that the student made a sexual gesture and kept running .
Killian is charged with inducing panic , public indecency , resisting arrest and disorderly conduct .
He was being held at the county jail Monday , and it was not known whether he had a lawyer .
School officials reported that Killian was a good student , Gaylor said .
There was no indication of substance abuse or a medical problem .
Taxpayers pick up Bush 's bill
Democratic lawmakers in Washington say they 're drafting a health care reform bill that would expand coverage for low - income kids .
President Bush says he 'll veto any such legislation , warning that it would lead the nation " down the path to government - run health care for every American . "
Like that would be a bad thing .
What 's particularly galling about Bush 's position is that it 's coming from a man who just underwent a colonoscopy performed at the taxpayer - funded , state - of - the - art medical facility at Camp David by an elite team of doctors from the taxpayer - funded National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Md .
If anyone understands the benefits of government - run health care , it 's the president .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
But let 's not get sidetracked .
Bush was n't being entirely accurate when he derided the notion of government - run health care for every American .
That might make for a fine little sound bite , especially among those who fear the specter of " socialized medicine , " but it 's not really what 's at stake .
Rather , advocates of health care reform are seeking government - run insurance for every American , leaving the health care part to those who know best - doctors and nurses .
This is a crucial distinction at a time when 47 million Americans lack medical coverage and , according to researchers at Harvard University , about a third of the $ 2 trillion spent annually on health care in this country is squandered on bureaucratic overhead .
" Cuba is socialized medicine , " observed Dr. Kevin Grumbach , who heads the Department of Family and Community Medicine at UCSF .
" The government employs all the physicians and owns all the hospitals .
That 's not what anyone is talking about for this country . "
Rather , the focus here is on two indisputable facts : that the United States spends about twice as much per person on health care as most other industrialized democracies , and that Americans on average do not live as long as people in countries that guarantee medical coverage to their citizens .
" Why have all other countries figured out a way to do this ? "
Grumbach asked .
" Why are we the only ones that are so uncivilized ? "
The United States spent an average of $ 6,102 per person on health care in 2004 ( the latest year for which figures are available ) , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Canada spent $ 3,165 per person , France $ 3,159 , Australia $ 3,120 and Britain a mere $ 2,508 .
Life expectancy in the United States was lower than in each of these other countries and infant mortality was higher .
Looking at the numbers another way , the Kaiser Family Foundation determined earlier this year that health care spending accounts for 15.2 percent of the U.S. economy .
By contrast , health care spending represents 9.9 percent of Canada 's gross domestic product , 10.4 percent of France 's , 9.2 percent of Australia 's and just 7.8 percent of Britain's .
And again , the citizens of these countries on average live longer than we do .
In Washington , Democratic lawmakers are crafting legislation to expand the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , which subsidizes insurance for low - income kids .
The Senate Finance Committee last week approved a five - year plan to increase funding for the program through a 61 - cents - per - pack increase in the federal cigarette tax .
This would maintain coverage for 6.6 million recipients while adding 3.2 million uninsured kids to the system .
Bush told an audience in Nashville last week that the Senate bill is " the beginning salvo of the encroachment of the federal government on the health care system . "
He said he'd veto any such legislation making its way to his desk .
That 's a fine how - do - you - do for a guy who had five growths removed from his colon on Saturday largely at the government 's expense and had them promptly examined by government experts at the government - run National Naval Medical Center .
Happily , the tests showed no sign of cancer .
So Bush can rest easy for another few years , thanks to all that government health care .
No one at the White House could be reached to discuss how much the president paid out of his own pocket for the colonoscopy and subsequent testing .
Presidents typically have their own health insurance , although the first - class treatment they receive is largely defrayed by taxpayer funds .
In other words , they 're prime beneficiaries of government - run health care - just like in Cuba .
In a paper found on the Web site of the Defense Department 's Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ( www.afip.org ) , former White House physician George Fuller outlines the mission of the taxpayer - funded White House Medical Unit .
He writes that a primary purpose of the group is to provide " confidential , immediate and private access to preventive , routine and urgent care for the principals . "
This , Fuller adds , " is a 24 - hour , seven - days - a - week commitment with no exceptions . "
The quality of health care is so exacting , he observes , " that the president cannot even ride an elevator in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building without a physician escort . "
According to Fuller , the president enjoys the benefits of medical and dental clinics in the White House , as well as " a fully equipped and supplied outpatient clinic " at Camp David , where Bush 's colon was explored .
He says the White House Medical Unit also " keeps a unique and extensive library of medical facilities throughout the world " to provide for the president 's health care needs during overseas travel .
All in all , Bush is the last person with a right to complain about government - run health care for every American .
We should all be so lucky .

At this moment in boardrooms across the globe , captains of industry are leafing through sheet after sheet of typefaces .
There are hundreds of choices , but many of these movers and shakers do n't take a lot of leafing before plumping for Helvetica .
We live in a world where we are surrounded 24 hours a day by adverts and corporate communications , many in typefaces chosen to subliminally complement the message .
COMPARE MAJOR FONTS Helvetica and its rivals
Helvetica 's message is this : you are going to get to your destination on time ; your plane will not crash ; your money is safe in our vault ; we will not break the package ; the paperwork has been filled in ; everything is going to be OK .
It is sans serif .
There are no wiggly bits at the end of the letters .
It has smooth , clean lines , and an unobtrusive geometry that almost suggests it was designed not to stand out .
Lars Mueller is a Helvetica devotee .
He has published a book , Helvetica : Homage to a Typeface , and recently donated an original set of lead lettering to a Helvetica exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
" It has a modern attitude which lines up with the aesthetic premises of the 1950s and 60s .
Helvetica is a corporate typeface , but on the other hand it 's the favourite of hairdressers and kebab shops .
It is the butter on the bread . "
It also says bland , unadventurous , unambitious
Neville Brody , designer
Gap , Orange , Currys , Hoover , Lufthansa , Panasonic , Royal Bank of Scotland , Tupperware , Zanussi .
The list of brands that use the Swiss typeface - celebrating its 50th anniversary this year - would fill this page .
" It 's durable .
It comes from natural design forms .
It does n't have an expression of fashion .
It has very clear lines and characters , it looks like a very serious typeface , " says Frank Wildenberg , managing director of Linotype , the German firm that owns the font .
The typeface , inspired by the 1896 font Akzidenz Grotesk , was designed by Max Miedinger in 1957 in conjunction with Eduard Hoffmann for the Haas Type Foundry , in Muenchenstein , Switzerland .
As Wildenberg notes , its Swissness is part of the appeal .
The land where clocks run meticulously and the streets are spotless carries the kind of cultural resonance that the logo makers and brand masters of the major corporations might like a bit of .
For others , its neutrality is a platform for daring design .
The typeface 's dominance over the past half - century , cemented by the release of Neue Helvetica in the 1980s , has now inspired a documentary , Helvetica , and exhibitions on both sides of the Atlantic .
Bland uniformity
But not everyone is a Helvetica lover .
Type " I hate Helvetica " into Google and there are forums for people who rage at the mindless " corporate chic " of this dominant font .
They see it as a vehicle for social conformity through consumerism , shifting product with a great big steam - roller of neutrality .
Clear and simple
" When people choose Helvetica they want to fit in and look normal .
They use Helvetica because they want to be a member of the efficiency club .
They want to be a member of modernism .
They want to be a member of no personality .
It also says bland , unadventurous , unambitious .
" Typefaces control the message .
Choice of font dictates what you think about something before you even read the first word .
Imagine Shakespeare in large capital drop shadow .
Our response would be quite different towards the content . "
It 's perhaps understandable that corporations do n't want to take any typographic risks , bound as they are by the bottom line .
Choose a wacky typeface in your logos or advertising , and turnover may suffer .
Helvetica , on the other hand , offers clarity and neutrality .
When used in adverts , it is a platform for other parts of the message .
Nadine Chahine , who works in sales and marketing for Linotype , advises companies on what font to use .
" If you take a script typeface [ with a handwriting - like appearance ] and use it as the logo for a bank , there 's a problem .
You need something reliable - it's where you keep your money .
It is not about a fun , personal message .
" It uses subliminal messages so that you get a feeling .
All of these different meanings are implied within typefaces . "
Hence the font Frutiger is used for airports and European motorway signs , New Johnston is the choice of London Underground , Cooper Black for Easyjet , and Dunkin Donuts bears the unmistakable Frankfurter font .
Default setting
But away from the boardroom , many ordinary computer users follow the same path of choosing fonts that say something about themselves when they send an e-mail or write a letter or CV .
You 've probably endorsed Helvetica yourself by using one of its digital clones , the Arial typeface , to write e-mails - perhaps because it 's easy to read , because it looks reassuring familiar or because it may be the default font on your system .
Others might use a Courier or a Times New Roman to impart their authority , or choose the cartoonish Comic Sans to go with their Mickey Mouse tie .
It speaks of reliability
And just as with the hegemonic Helvetica , these choices arouse strong feelings .
There is a " ban Comic Sans " campaign , which has attempted to get legislation enacted in Canada .
In Germany , the battle between typefaces ran alongside the country 's turbulent history and struggle for national identity in the 19th and 20th Century .
Black letter Gothic typefaces like Fraktur were alternately endorsed and then banned by the Nazis .
Now , despite being most associated outside Germany with footballers ' tattoos and covers of heavy metal albums , there is still a group dedicated to its return to common usage .
Helvetica may be the most dominant of the fonts , but it has not squashed the opposition in either advertising or the e-mail .
And whether you use it , or choose not to , you are sending out a message .
Studies of reading speed and comprehension ( Paterson and Tinker 1940 ) strongly suggest that all ' normal ' typefaces are equally legible and that differences are perceived or learned .
But try writing maths in a sans serif font and see what happens ...

Coolvetica for me please , helvetica's know - it - all sister expanded to about 150 % width .
Serifs have gone the way of the nehru jacket .
rb korbet - wootton , brighton UK
I 'm sure I read once that serif fonts are supposed to be easier to read on the page because the little tails and strokes help guide the eye from letter to letter .
That 's what the serifs are for apparently .
Seems to be contrary to what people think here so is that theory total bunkum ?
Paul , London
I can not believe that I am joining a debate on fonts .
However , Beddoes of London blaming the prolilfic use of Comic Sans on women ?
Please !
As a woman , I am offended by this .
I am all up for freedom of speech , but please do not use Comic Sans to express it .
Sorry , was this a discussion on Helvetica ?
Oh yes , sorry .
Well , it 's a bit ' new gastro pub ' do n't you think ?

Two fonts walk into the bar , and the barman says , " sorry lads , we do n't serve your type " .

Helvetica is a very large type family , not just one face .
Proper Helvetica is OK , clean and simple and well formed - but the digital so called clone Arial is horrid as are all such faces in my view , they lack the subtlety and elegance of the originals .
But give me Gill Sans anyday , designed by stone cutter Eric Gill as a tribute to Johnston 's competition ( to design it ) winning London Underground face .
Both are based on straight lines and circles .
The BBC uses Gill and it always looks cool to me .
The digital clones do n't look as good as the original in the case of Gill too .
Like I say , proper Helvetica is OK .
But do n't get me started on Comic Sans ..... I said do n't ....

Typefaces can reflect cultural trends too- thinking - man 's musician Max Tundra has a track named " The Gradual Disappearance From Food Packaging Of The Lettres Ornées Typeface Since The Nineteen Sixties " .
Once you recognise the font you 'll see what he means !
Brother Wetlands , Bristol , UK
Helvetica , Like Comic sans , is a font that is easy to read and decipher becuase of its flowing , even curves and lack of serifs .
They are ideal fonts for children learning to read and adults with reading / learning difficulties .
Surely we should encourage and welcome the use of these fonts rather than ban them as boring and unstylish .

I 'm a bit of fence - sitter when it comes to the relative pros and cons of Helvetica ( I guess I get out quite a bit ) , but I do find it odd the Microsoft have decided to exclude it from Word 2007 .
I 'm still allowed to write in ' Wingdings ' ( why ? ) , ' Baby Kruffy ' ( I'm 31 years old ) and Croobie ( What a hoot ! ) but not bog- standard Helvetica .
What 's with that , Bill ?
Andy Jackson , London
It 's Verdana for me .
It has Helvetica 's clean lines , but with a modern sleekness .
I like to think of it as Helvetica 's sexier sister .
And yes , I really should get out more ...
Michael S , Lancaster
I am visually - impaired and find Arial or Verdana easier to read on screen but Helvetica is easy enough to read for print - Anything with fancy or with serifs makes life very difficult .
I think the same applies to people with literacy difficulties as well

Much more important than the 50th anniversary of Helvetica , it 's the 50th anniversary of Univers ¿ the thinking man 's Helvetica .
The former is just an amalgam of designs developing through the 19th century , while Univers is a truly groundbreaking design and the first real ' rational ' type system .
Thing is , you probably see Univers every day too !

Being an American graphic artist , I prefer Morris Benton 's News Gothic over Miedinger 's Helvetica , which is perfectly appropriate for contintental Europe , in the same way that Gill 's Gill Sans belongs to the UK .
But it sure is impossible to deny that Helvetica is the cream that has risen to the top .
It is universal .
It says us .

Anyone who uses ' Comic Sans ' ( what ' so comic about it ? ) needs to be taken outside and shot !
- espcially in serious work - related emails .
Similarly , those using Times New Roman are compelling readers to squint and struggle to read the document .
I support Helvetica for anything that requires clarity and ease of reading .
The white space it creates on a page is also easy on the eye ( I have written and maintained an 380 page NHS Trust formulary for years and have listened to what readers prefer ... )
John , Altrincham UK
You 're only really creative if you can be creative with Helvetica -
This type face is perfect -
It 's all you need .
Rick , London
I went through a period when I was big into typefaces , and would go to the St. Brides printing library off Fleet Street .
It 's nice to be reminded of that period , and a dormant interest .
I read then that " there is no such thing as a bad typeface " , although I share a dislike for Comic Sans !
Helvetica is clearly an excellent typeface , but seems to be getting blamed for sentiments aimed at the organisations using it .
It 's also worth noting that Serif typefaces are designed to help the eye read a large body of text ( which is why Time New Roman was used by The Times newspaper ) , whilst Sans Serif is good for section titles etc. - it provides a useful contrast to the Serif font .
Turkeybellyboy , Newcastle upon Tyne
While it is important to chart the success and use of this typeface by companies such as Orange and Gap , it is also worth mentioning that the Helvetica that they use is not always the same one that you will find installed by default on your home computer .
The more ' designed ' version of Helvetica bears more resemblance with the original Haas Grotesque and is generally better known as Helvetica Neue , or even it 's predecessor Akzidenz Grotesque .
These come in a much wider array of weights and have a cleaner look than the standard installer fonts you get for free .
Karl Randay , Lichfield
Beddoes , you have nailed it .
Comic
Sans has to be the most inappropriately used font on the globe .
If I receive an official memo or form by email created using this ghastly , on might say flippant typeface , I immediately have to change it all into a more sober and reflective one ( such as our good friend Helvetica or even the much maligned Courier New - after all , we used typewriters for decades with no ill effects . )
But , yes , Comic Sans - fine if you 're doing a worksheet for kids , but in the adult workplace ?
On a C.V.?
On an information panel or sign ?
Nein danke !
Gareth Davies , Manchester
Helvetica is a marvellous font .
It looks clean and efficient , the epitome of good modernist design .
Compare that with the fussy , stuffy , excessive formality of Times New Roman .
It 's the sort of thing Telegraph readers would send emails in .
If they were n't still using typewriters .
Patrick , Leicester
Helvetica is a solid , plain and structured font that is incredibly easy to read .
That is part of what makes it so useful for logos .
It does n't overshadown the name itself or the logo / colours that accompany it .
I prefer fonts that are a little more decorative , and my faviourite is Garamond , which is more interesting than Helvetica and more round than Times New Roman , so it seems more friendly and less rigid than most other fonts .
Heather , Wolverhampton
Aaaaaggghhh - Helvetica !
I hate this typeface , are people really that lacking in creativity that they have to slump for a font that is used on every other thing that you see !
I would start a petition against it 's use but it would probably be printed in helvetica or it's PC based twin Arial ...
Do n't start me on Times Roman ....
Chris Brown , Thame Oxfordshire
I think the more pressing issue here is to drum up support for the " Ban Comic Sans " campaign .
I hate comic sans , it 's everywhere .
I 'm looking at you girls !
I also hate small business / pubs advertising local events using " Word Art " in Microsoft Word , which has not changed since 1997 .
Sort it out !

The MOD have many policies regarding documents , and the usage of fonts is included in that .
Arial ( strikingly similar to Helvetica ) is encouraged to be used to ensure the legibility and clarity of a document , as well as to be as easy as possible for those with reading difficulties to absorb .
Clarity over the zeitgeist is certainly preferable .... I'm talking to you , " trendy " website designers !
KR , Cheltenham , UK
It all depends on use .
Sans - serif fonts are simply ugly when seen on the printed page , whilst having the benefit of clarity on a screen ( and it is about time we recognised that the two are very different media , working together , rather the replacing each other ) .
Fortunately most of my work is still in print , so I can continue to use the far more elegant Old - Style Latin fonts ( complete with Old - Style numbers , which most generic fonts ignore , spoiling the line of any text ) .
Indeed my fiancee has just decided they look so much better as to have our wedding invitations etc printed in Old - Style .
The early humanist printers ( both French and Italian ) had far more appreciation of the book as a thing , as well as a mode of communication , and that aesthetic feel is lacking in the modern typefaces .

Singapore was among the nations ranked higher than the US
The US is now ranked seventh in the body 's league table measuring the impact of technology on the development of nations .
A deterioration of the political and regulatory environment in the US prompted the fall , the report said .
The top spot went for the first time to Denmark , followed by Sweden .
Innovation
Countries were judged on the integration of technology in business , the infrastructure available , government policy favourable for fostering a culture of innovation and progress and leadership in promoting the usage of the latest information technology tools .
The Networked Readiness Index , the sixth of its kind published by the World Economic Forum with Insead , the Paris - based business school , scrutinised progress in 122 economies worldwide .
Despite losing its top position , the US still maintained a strong focus on innovation , driven by one of the world 's best tertiary education systems and its high degree of co-operation with industry , the report said .
NETWORKED READINESS INDEX RANKINGS 2006 ( 2005 ) 1 : Denmark ( 3 ) 2 : Sweden ( 8 ) 3 : Singapore ( 2 ) 4 : Finland ( 5 ) 5 : Switzerland ( 9 ) 6 : Netherlands ( 12 ) 7 : US ( 1 ) 8 : Iceland ( 4 ) 9 : UK ( 10 ) 10 : Norway ( 13 ) Source : WEF
The country 's efficient market environment , conducive to the availability of venture capital , and the sophistication of financial markets , was also given recognition .
Nordic crown
Denmark is now regarded as the world leader in technological advancement , with its Nordic neighbours Sweden , Finland and Norway claiming second , fourth and 10th place respectively .
" Denmark , in particular , has benefited from the very effective government e-leadership , reflected in early liberalisation of the telecommunications sector , a first - rate regulatory environment and large availability of e-government services , " said Irene Mia , senior economist at World Economic Forum .
European countries to make the top 20 included Switzerland in fifth place , the Netherlands , one of the most improved in sixth , the UK ( nine ) , Germany ( 16 ) , Austria ( 17 ) and Estonia ( 20 ) .
While countries from Asia and the Pacific continued to progress , the powerhouse economies of China and India both showed a downward trend .
India was four positions down on last year to 44th , suffering from weak infrastructure and a very low level of individual usage of personal computers and the internet .
China was knocked to 59th place , nine positions down , with information technology uptake in Chinese firms lagging .
Free Diff Tool : SourceGear DiffMerge
In the midst of the new products we have just released there is one item which deserves to have a brighter light shown on it : SourceGear DiffMerge is our new application for comparing files and directories .
And it's FREE !!!
Sorry , the word " free " is another one of those words that is mostly useless , so I 'll explain more :
DiffMerge is " free of charge " , or as some folks say , " free as in beer " .
DiffMerge is not open source nor is it " free " in the Richard Stallman sense of the word .
DiffMerge is a no-cost application that anyone can download and use .
It is not a trial , a demo or an eval .
It is fully functional and fully featured .
Why does the world need another diff tool ?
We admit that there are a heckuva lot of diff and merge tools out there already .
Some of them are darn good .
So why did we create another one ?
Because we thought ours could be one of the best .
A lot of the diff and merge tools out there are just very basic in their feature set .
Even among the good ones , most of the file comparison tools I 've seen involve some kind of compromise .
I lost track of how many times I 've said one of the following :
Yep , that 's a great diff tool , but it does n't do merging .
Yep , that 's a great diff tool , but it only runs on Windows .
Yep , that 's a great diff tool , but it 's really expensive .
Yep , that 's a great diff tool , but it has little or no editing capabilities .
Yep , that 's a great diff tool , but you can't customize it much .
Yep , that 's a great diff tool , but coughs up a furball if you give it a Unicode file .
So , we 're unveiling SourceDiffMerge 3.0 as our attempt to be the best of the breed .
I 'm not sure we 've hit the target , but we 've come very close .
Highlights include :
Compare two text files
Lots of supported character encodings
Intra-line highlighting of the changed portion of a line
Three - way merge , including automatic merge whenever possible
Compare folders
Cross-platform : Runs on Windows and Mac OS X. Oh , and Linux too .
Full support for editing
Fully customizable
If you 're using our newly - released Vault 4.0 or Fortress 1.0 , then you 've already got this app .
For everybody else , regardless of whether you are a SourceGear customer or not , I invite you to download DiffMerge and give it a try .
Did we create the best diff and merge tool in the world ?
Let me know .
You may remember Tim from the sad tale of Hung , The Incidental Expert .
Today , he brings us a story of the " Not Invented Here " philosophy and its ramifications .
In 1996 preperations were underway for the Olympics in Atlanta .
And despite plans for Celine Dion to open the ceromony with " The Power of the Dream , " people still managed to be excited .
America was proud , and many profoundly American companies ( e.g. those that sell apple pie , SUVs , beer , or guns ) were happy to sponsor the games .
At the time , Tim was working at a large oil company in Houston .
The Olympic Fever was spreading faster than the flu , and with more enthusiasm .
The corporate offices were filled with Olympic - themed frizbees , coffee cups , desk toys , shirts , and posters .
The promotional materials featured Ollie the Olympic Ooglyboo , whose name I just made up but I swear he 's real .
He was the 1996 Summer Olympics mascot ; an anthropomorphic racquetball .
With the promotional materials , the company had received several pictures of Ollie playing different Olympic sports .
To keep everyone in the Olympic mood , the company asked Tim to build a screensaver that would scroll through the images and deploy it to all of their computers .
Tim reasoned that it'd make more sense to buy a screen saver , as it'd be cheaper than his time developing and testing , though the American NIH spirit prevailed .
Tim would build the screen saver .
It did n't take long .
Tim hacked together a .SCR app with its own configuration screen .
It could be pointed to any directory with pictures , the order that pictures were displayed was configurable , it could go randomly , etc .
He was satisfied with his testing , so he sent it off to Atlanta with deployment instructions .
Tim had n't heard back for a few days , so he assumed all was well with the screensaver .
He moved back to other projects , but after a few days , he was n't able to connect to Atlanta 's network .
He later overheard coworkers saying " Yeah , it 's weird , they 're still trying to figure it out .
Around 12:30 PM the network started running slower and slower , which is weird because everyone should be at lunch around then .
The CEO 's presentation to the board ended when his PowerPoint presentation was running too slow to continue .
They 've been rebooting the servers all day . "
So the network problems started shortly after the screen saver deployment , and things would get really bad around lunchtime or the end of the day .
In an " oh crap " moment , Tim figured out what had gone wrong — rather than copy the images to each workstation , they 'd pointed everybody 's screensaver to a single directory on a single file server .
Each JPG was about 3MB , and there were at least a thousand workstations in the Atlanta HQ on a 16MB token ring connection .
Once people started leaving for lunch or going home for the evening , their screen saver would come on .
Tim 's screensaver had effectively crippled the network .
The second message : Be yourself .
Have fun .
Do n’t work too hard .
And , for all their accomplishments and ambitions , the amazing girls , as their teachers and classmates call them , are not immune to the third message :
While it is now cool to be smart , it is not enough to be smart .
You still have to be pretty , thin and , as one of Esther ’s classmates , Kat Jiang , a go - to stage manager for student theater who has a perfect 2400 score on her SATs , wrote in an e-mail message , “ It ’s out of style to admit it , but it is more important to be hot than smart . ”
“ Effortlessly hot , ” Kat added .
If you are free to be everything , you are also expected to be everything .
What it comes down to , in this place and time , is that the eternal adolescent search for self is going on at the same time as the quest for the perfect résumé .
For Esther , as for high school seniors everywhere , this is a big weekend for finding out how your résumé measured up :
The college acceptances , and rejections , are rolling in .
“ You want to achieve , ” Esther said .
“ But how do you achieve and still be genuine ? ”
If it all seems overwhelming at times , then the multitasking adults in Newton have the answer : Balance .
Strive for balance .
But balance is out the window when you ’re a high - achieving senior in the home stretch of the race for which all the years of achieving and the disciplined focusing on the future have been preparing you .
These students are aware that because more girls apply to college than boys , amid concerns about gender balance , boys may have an edge at some small selective colleges .
“ You ’re supposed to have all these extracurriculars , to play sports and do theater , ” said another of Esther ’s 17 - year - old classmates , Julie Mhlaba , who aspires to medical school and juggles three Advanced Placement classes , gospel choir and a part - time job as a waitress .
“ You ’re supposed to do well in your classes and still have time to go out . ”
“ You ’re supposed to do all these things , ” Julie said , “ and not go insane . ”
Stress Trumps Relaxation
Newton , which has a population of almost 84,000 , is known for a liberal sensibility and a high concentration of professionals like doctors , lawyers and academics .
Six miles west of Boston , with its heavily settled neighborhoods , bustling downtowns and high numbers of immigrants , Newton is a suburb with an urban feel .
BEIJING ( AP ) 
Beijing couples intent on stealing a kiss in public are being warned they could be caught on closed - circuit television — and suspected of committing a crime , a state news agency reported Wednesday .
Xinhua News Agency said " intimate acts of lovers may be initially categorized as ' kidnapping ' or ' robbery ' by the computers , which are programmed to be sensitive to violations of safe distances . "
But police officers monitoring the cameras will decide if the situation really is dangerous .
But there will be some warning for amorous couples , Xinhua said .
Signs will go up next month in areas covered by the cameras , saying in Chinese and English " you are entering a camera - monitored zone . "
Public displays of affection , and more , are common for young urban Chinese couples , who often have nowhere else to go because they share small apartments with their parents .
Closed - circuit cameras are becoming more common in Beijing , and Xinhua said that before next year 's Summer Olympics the city plans to unify the monitoring of the cameras .
There are currently networks monitored separately by the police , and transport , public utilities and maintenance departments .

M ullah Muhammad Anas is the unofficial ruler of Afghanistan 's Andore district .
The small but tough Taliban commander -- one of the 30 most wanted fugitives in Afghanistan -- has made it impossible for US and NATO forces to move freely in the district , the biggest in Ghazni province .
I managed to get his mobile number from a Taliban sympathiser who stood in front of Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi 's tomb in the heart of Ghazni city .
Anas only understood my Assalam - o- Alliekum , because the Taliban commander could n't speak Urdu .
I tried communicating in English , but failed .
Then , I used my broken Persian , and the deadlock was broken .
He was surprised that a Pakistani journalist was looking for the Taliban in Ghazni .
When I expressed my desire to meet him , he said I was late because he was deep in the mountains of Andore and it would be difficult for him to come to the city by evening .
' Taliban is now a more organised force '
So I decided to risk visiting him instead .
He was happy , but made just two small conditions :
One , I would not travel in my Prado jeep with a driver from Kabul .
Two , I would have to take a taxi from Ghazni with any local Pashtun driver .
Needless to say , I accepted both .
I asked my driver to stay in the city and went to a taxi stand .
Most drivers were reluctant to go to Andore , saying it was late and it would be difficult to return before sunset .
One asked for double charges , and I agreed .
We settled on 1,000 Afghanis -- approximately $ 20 .
We started travelling on the muddy Kabul - Kandahar road to Andore .
After a few kilometres , we were stopped by three armed Taliban near a village .
When they learnt I was a guest of their commander , they called Mullah Anas to reconfirm , then welcomed us to the 'land of Taliban . '
One of them joined us as a guide .
An hour and a half later , I was sitting with Mullah Anas -- not in a cave , but in a large muddy compound of a village teeming with armed fighters .
The first thing I asked him was :
How could he trust an unknown Pashtun taxi driver ?
He smiled and looked towards the driver sitting next to me .
" Local Pashtuns do n't betray us , " he said .
" We will note down his name and taxi number .
If he creates any problem for us , we will take care of him .
But I am sure he is a real Pashtun and will not commit treason . "
' We do n't want the Taliban to re-emerge '
I commented on the Taliban movement becoming more nationalist than Islamic , considering it was now limited only to the Pashtun dominated areas of Afghanistan .
I mentioned Afghan Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali , who belonged to the Andore district but had not visited his home for a year since Anas had taken over .
Jalali had repeatedly accused Pakistan of secretly providing training facilities to the Taliban .
( Jalali resigned on Tuesday due to the increasing violence ) .
Anas responded to the allegation by saying , simply , " You are sitting with me in an Afghan village , not a Pakistani one .
Ask Jalali to come here if he can .
Yes , we have the support of some Pakistani brothers , but Pakistani rulers are our enemies .
Musharraf is not different from Karzai .
Both are fighting on behalf of the Americans against us .
How can a Pakistani Karzai support us ?
This allegation is an insult . "
One angry Taliban fighter shouted at me in broken English : " Frontier Province ( the North West Frontier Province ) is not Pakistan .
It is a Pashtun area that was occupied by Farangis ( England ) one hundred years ago .
If we go to the Pashtun areas of Peshawar , it is not Pakistan , it is Afghanistan . "
His comments were like a bombshell for me .
Because just four years ago , it was the Taliban that confronted nationalist Pashtuns who opposed the Durand line that divided Afghanistan from united India more than a century ago .
This was a new face of the Taliban , but Anas tried to hide it .
" Do n't say these things in the presence of a Pakistani guest , " he told his colleague .
US Marines kill 21 Taliban
Anas tried to explain his colleague 's anger , saying " We were betrayed by Pakistani rulers after 9/11 , which is why a lot of Taliban have developed bad feelings against the Punjabis of Pakistan . "
I tried correcting him by saying that Musharraf is not a Punjabi , but Anas said , " ( Lieutenant General ) Safdar Hussein is a Punjabi responsible for fighting against our Mahsud and Wazir brothers in South and North Wazirastan , on the orders of Musharraf . "
After serving us Afghani tea , Anas then invited us to film his attack on a US military convoy after two hours .
We declined politely .
I was aware that US convoys did n't move in that area without air cover .
The Taliban would kill three or four US soldiers , but would lose more of their own men to the air bombing that would ensue .
The commander then made me another offer .
He said , " You can choose a CD of our previous attacks on Americans then . "
I accepted .
Taliban leader slams al Qaeda
Within minutes , he loaded a CD to a small laptop , showing me how they destroyed a US Humvee with a roadside bomb a few days ago .
He pointed his finger towards a young boy standing behind him saying , " Brother Qadir filmed that ambush with his Sony movie camera . "
The Taliban banned cameras when they were in power .
Now , they appear to have amended their ideology .
In Islamic Shariah , this amendment is called Ijtahad .
Today , the Taliban are waging their Jihad with Ijtahad .
They banned photography and television sets in Afghanistan after taking over Kabul in 1996 .
Now , they want to use cameras and television as a new weapon in a propaganda war against their enemy .
Tackle Taliban , or we will , US to Pakistan
When I asked why the Taliban were fighting against Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai on one hand and talking to him on the other , Anas grinned .
" Talk to Mufti Hakimisahib about it .
I am not entitled to speak on such a big issue . "
He gave me Hakimi 's satellite phone number .
He picked it up after 12 rings .
Hakimi was shocked to hear I was sitting with Mullah Anas .
He asked me to leave immediately because he was aware of the planned attack on the Americans .
" They will make this area hell in a few hours , " he screamed .
" Go away , go away . "
We fled in panic .
An hour later , Hakimi called to check if I was back in Ghazni .
I told him I would reach in half an hour .
Warning me against visiting ' independent ' areas without informing him in advance , he said : " The Americans can kill you and throw the responsibility on our shoulders . "
After a few minutes , we were stopped by a big group of Afghan National Army soldiers near the city .
The Pashtun taxi driver explained that he had some Pakistani journalists who were visiting some election candidates in nearby villages .
The soldiers checked our IDs and let us go .
But not before warning that " this area is not safe .
You should n't come here again without a police escort . "
I thanked the driver , who replied , " I lie to both Taliban and the security forces every day just in the interest of a safe drive . "
In broken Urdu , he explained that he liked neither the Taliban , nor Karzai or the Americans .
But he could n't fight them as both parties were very strong .
It was only the common Afghans who were suffering , he said .
I returned to Kabul late that night and had dinner at Delhi Darbar , a restaurant owned by an Indian .
There , I met a local Newsweek reporter called Sami Yousafzai , who had also met a Taliban commander in Zabul earlier that day .
He suggested I visit Kunar , where Al Qaeda had recently downed a US helicopter .
Apparently , CDs of the operation were available at shops in Asadabad city .
India to help Afghanistan deal with terror
Over the next eight days , I visited at least a dozen provinces in East and South Afghanistan .
I realized that Hamid Karzai ruled only the big cities .
The rest of the rural and mountainous areas were controlled by Taliban , Al Qaeda and , in some places , by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar 's Hizb - e - Islami .
Karzai has tried to engage the Taliban through many people , but they are not interested in talks .
They are exploiting the wave of anti-Americanism that mushroomed after reports of the desecration of a Quran by American troops .
NATO chopper crash kills 17 in Afghanistan
There are just 18,000 US troops deployed in Afghanistan , compared to more than 150,000 in Iraq .
It is just not enough for establishing Karzai's writ in the 2,000 - kilometre long Pashtun belt , bordering Pakistan .
Anti-Taliban forces like the Northern Alliance are also against the presence of US troops in Afghanistan .
Fearing that the presence of US troops will come under fire in Afghanistan 's new parliament , Karzai has urged foreign troops to avoid house - to - house search operations without his permission .
The most disturbing thing for Karzai is the beginning of suicide attacks by the Taliban against the security forces .
According to Interior Ministry official Lutafullah Mashal , some Arabs from Iraq are providing training to Taliban fighters in Kunar and Nuristan for bomb making .
The Taliban have killed more than 325 Afghan police officers in the last six months .
The number of foreign troop causalities is limited because they do n't go after the Taliban in remote areas .
Mashal said the Taliban dumped a lot of weapons when they were in power , and were now buying weapons from local warlords and also across the border from Pakistani tribes .
He also claimed that the Taliban were in possession of SAM missiles of Russian and Chinese origin , which they are getting from Iraqi Kurdistan at $ 2,500 each .
Mashal recently arrested some smugglers in Nimroz who smuggled weapons from Iraqi Kurdistan through Iran .
Why Afghanistan is important to India
Where is the money coming from ?
Mashal smiled intriguingly .
" They have some sympathisers in Pakistan , " he said , " but it is mainly Al Qaeda using them against us because they want to make Afghanistan another Iraq . "
I asked him how Taliban spokesman Mufti Hakimi was speaking to the Associated Press daily and yet avoided capture by the Americans .
Mashal responded saying that Hakimi was clever .
He was using at least eight different numbers , ten local mobile numbers and some Pakistani mobile numbers .
He used one number for 10 to 15 minutes before switching to another , foiling all attempts to track him .
" We will get him very soon though , " he claimed .
Exposed : Pak army links with Taliban
Most diplomats in Kabul believe the Taliban are getting stronger by the day , and returning with a vengeance .
More than 1,300 people have died in insurgent violence already , making 2005 by far the bloodiest year since the overthrow of the Taliban government in November 2001 .
Afghanistan is a new Iraq in the making .
Taliban experts like Ahmad Rashid say Karzai has failed to control corruption and the warlords , and these two problems have forced common Afghanis to think that at least the Taliban gave them peace , which has now becoming a dream .
Ahmad Rashid is a close friend of Karzai , and this was the first time I heard him criticise the Afghan president .
" Karzai is missing a great chance to stabilise Afghanistan , " he said .
" He is not informing the outside world that the West is not hunting Al Qaeda here in Afghanistan .
There has been no Osama hunting for a long time either .
They are only increasing their influence in border areas close to Iran . "
Afghan journalist Sami Yousafzai noted that the former Communists and Taliban were the poor people , while the rest of the politicians are former Mujahideen who minted money during the war against the Soviet Union .
These Mujahideen are said to be Karzai 's biggest allies .
In reality , however , they are warlords .
They were not debarred from the elections despite running large armed militias .
The new ruling elite of Afghanistan are rich .
The people are poor , and have no love for the elite .
In some areas like Khost , the Taliban did n't created problems for ex-Communist candidates , but threatened ex-Mujahideen from the richer class .
We trim the fat so you do n't have to !
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The British doctor who sparked a health scare by suggesting a childhood vaccine against measles , mumps and rubella is linked to autism faces a hearing on Monday into charges of professional misconduct during his research .
The General Medical Council hearing , expected to last 15 weeks , centers on research published in the Lancet medical journal in 1998 in which Andrew Wakefield and colleagues posited a link between the MMR vaccine and autism .
The claim led to fierce worldwide debate among researchers and caused a decline in MMR vaccinations that health experts in the United Kingdom say has not yet recovered to the level seen before Wakefield ’s study .
Scientific evidence suggests that vaccines are not linked to autism but a vocal group of people remain unconvinced .
Vaccine experts say parents often link vaccines with their children ’s symptoms because getting a shot can be upsetting , and children are vaccinated at an age when autism and related disorders are often first diagnosed .
The council will not look into the scientific claims but whether Wakefield and two colleagues -- John Walker - Smith and Simon Murch -- violated a number of ethical practices during the study involving young children .
“ The panel will inquire into allegations of serious professional misconduct by Dr. Wakefield , Professor Walker - Smith and Professor Murch , in relation to the conduct of a research study involving young children from 1996 - 1998 , ” the group said .
The council regulates doctors in Britain and could bar the three from practice .
It said it would also look into charges Wakefield was involved in advising solicitors representing children claiming to have suffered harm due to the MMR vaccine .
Wakefield also faces a charge that he acted unethically by taking blood from children at a birthday party after offering them money and without proper ethical approval .
During the time of the study the three were employed at the Royal Free Hospital in London .
Wakefield now works in the United States and said in a recent interview with the Observer newspaper he plans to defend himself vigorously .
“ My concern is that it ’s biologically plausible that the MMR vaccine causes or contributes to the disease in many children , and that nothing in the science so far dissuades me from the continued need to pursue that question , ” Wakefield said .
Before Wakefield ’s study , more than 90 percent of children in the United Kingdom received the vaccination , according to government figures .
After his warning that figure fell to around 80 percent before rising to 85 percent in 2007 .
The World Health Organisation target is 95 percent , a level that protects the wider population from potential outbreaks and epidemics .

Street icon ' Mr. Butch ' dies at 56 Scooter crash claims popular homeless man
Mr. Butch , shown above on Harvard Avenue in November , had lived on the streets in Boston for about 30 years .
( Globe File Photo / Mark Wilson )
Dreadlocked , homeless , and usually cheerful , Mr. Butch was an iconic presence in Kenmore Square for years before moving his base of operations to Harvard Avenue in Allston a decade ago .
Ranting in rhyme with a beer in hand -- a tall boy , preferably -- he would panhandle one minute and offer to share his take with a friend the next .
" Mr. Butch , " whose name was Harold Madison Jr. , died yesterday of injuries from an early morning crash when the motor scooter he was driving hit a pole , friends and family said .
The subject of YouTube videos , a MySpace tribute page , and a Wikipedia entry , Mr. Butch may have been the most famous street person in Boston .
He was so popular that The Boston Phoenix wrote in April that it was considering changing the criteria of the " Readers ' Pick : Neighborhood Character " category because Mr. Butch won so regularly .
At 56 , he had lived on Boston 's streets for about 30 years .
In Kenmore Square and his Allston neighborhood -- areas rife with college students and people who prefer less traditional approaches to life -- some saw in Mr. Butch a latter - day Thoreau , a man who chose a path that did n't involve taxes , rent , or office cubicles .
Instead , he helped the elderly cross streets , joyously played air guitar , philosophized , and sang .
" He 's been in so many local movies , videos , in the Phoenix -- he 's like an icon of the neighborhood , " said Erin Scott , manager of New England Comics on Harvard Avenue in Allston .
" He was just the sweetest , nicest homeless person -- he looked out for people , " said Toni Fanning , who owns the Ritual Arts store nearby .
" I 'll tell you , this whole street is just miserable right now .
Everybody just does n't want to believe it .
It 's so hard to talk about Butch in any kind of past tense . "
In a YouTube video posted on Mr. Butch 's MySpace page , he offered a buoyant view on how to live : " You got to be articulate every day and keep going on strong and straight and use your heart and all your might and all your weight and all your power .
Do what you can , make it last for many hour , ' cause once you 're dead , you 're done , you do n't come back , " he rapped , pausing before adding , " Yeah . "
Fanning 's favorite encounter with Mr. Butch was on Easter a few years ago .
When she left home to visit a friend who was in bad straits , she was depressed about her friend , the day -- just everything .
" And I walked outside and there was Butch standing on the corner of Harvard and Comm .
Ave. with a big sandwich board that said , ' I need weed , ' " Fanning said .
" I started laughing so hard that it got me through that entire day . "
Mr. Butch was not timid about his pastimes : drinking beer and smoking marijuana .
And he could be irascible .
He was a tall and slender man , and the stoop of his shoulders signaled his level of intoxication .
Unwelcome as Kenmore Square began tidying up its act , Mr. Butch left , telling friends that encounters with police officers had become too frequent .
Allston proved more tolerant .
" I 'm just devastated , " said Jerry Katz , a lawyer whose offices are along Harvard Avenue .
" Everyone loved Mr. Butch .
I loved Mr. Butch . "
Though thousands of passersby made his acquaintance through the years , few knew much about Mr. Butch 's background .
Born in Worcester , he grew up in a large family .
His father , Harold Sr. , dubbed him Butch .
A talented drummer , he sat in with bands and played with a mentor in the local music scene , picking up the guitar in his midteens and filling a closet with percussion instruments he made from items he found .
He did not finish high school and moved to Kenmore Square in the 1970s when Worcester became inhospitable to his frequent drinking .
" I think he was just looking for someplace to be accepted , " said his sister Jeannette Madison of Worcester .
" He told us that this was the life that he chose -- a street person , happy - go - lucky , panhandler .
I guess for him that was easier , and it did n't take very long for people to understand what he was doing and just take it with a grain of salt .
" People are who they choose to be . "
In addition to Jeannette , he has four siblings in Worcester -- Russell , Phillip , Jeffrey , and Sheila -- and a brother , Alphonso Moore , of Henderson , Nev . His mother , Virginia , died in December ; his father died in 1974 .
Mr. Butch played on the fringe of Boston 's music scene for years .
Friends tried to get him into subsidized housing , but he refused to go through the required detoxification treatments .
Recently , he lived in a van friends helped him acquire .
Trusted friends became his " banks , " holding onto his money and storing his belongings .
Mr. Butch 's thee - quarter - length leather coat , with his name in white and red letters on the back , was displayed last night in the window of Regeneration tattoo on Harvard Avenue as a tribute .
" It kind of blows my mind that he is n't here , " Scott said .
" I have his guitar in my back room .
I have a buck in his bank . "
Friends plan to meet Monday at 8 p.m. at Regeneration tattoo and Ritual Arts for a memorial , said Sue Jeiven , owner of Regeneration tattoo .
" He always wanted a big blowout for his funeral .
He said : ' Blow a lot of money .
I want a big party , ' " she said .
A favorite among many students and professors , Mr. Butch was once asked to speak at Boston College .
Proud of the moment , he sent his siblings a photo of himself lecturing in front of the classroom .
" I feel like he had a lot to say and there were a lot of people who actually wanted to listen , " his sister said .
" And I thank the Lord for that .
And I thank the Lord that Butch is in his hands now . "

Kucinich takes steps to impeach Cheney Kucinich has formally introduced articles of impeachment against Vice President Cheney
" The vice president is beating the same drums of war against Iran that he beat against Iraq under false pretenses , and he 's doing it all over again , against Iran , " Kucinich said .
" And I say that it 's time to stand up to that .
Our country could n't afford this last war .
We can't afford to go into another one .
And somebody has to challenge the conduct of this Vice President . "
Kucinich introduced three articles of impeachment before giving a press conference on Capitol Hill .
He said Cheney fabricated the threat of weapons of mass destruction to justify going to war with Iraq , made up a connection between the Iraqi government and Al Qaeda and that he is threatening war against Iran , which he said violates the Constitution .
The Democratic presidential candidate said he decided to go after the vice president first for practical reasons .
He said if Congress impeaches the president , then Cheney would take his place .
He said he did n't think the country could handle two consecutive impeachments .
Currently , no other House members have signed on as cosponsors of his action .
Kucinich denied that this is a political stunt and said he thinks Congress needs to stand up to the administration .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich introduced articles to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney Tuesday , basing his decision on Cheney 's initial push to send the United States into war with Iraq .
" The vice president is beating the same drums of war against Iran that he beat against Iraq under false pretenses , and he 's doing it all over again , against Iran , " Kucinich said .
" And I say that it 's time to stand up to that .

In case you were wondering :
Mr Shepherd - Barron came up with the idea when he realised that he could remember his six - figure army number .
But he decided to check that with his wife , Caroline .
“ Over the kitchen table , she said she could only remember four figures , so because of her , four figures became the world standard , ” he laughs .
Michael Moore has a new ally – nurses across Canada .
Following the release of his latest documentary , Sicko , they 've become his biggest cheerleaders , sending him emails and promoting the film to friends and family .
The film attacks health care in the U.S. , comparing it to countries with universal health care .
It lauds Canada for a system that never denies care , has wait times of less than 45 minutes and whose superior service helps Canadians to live an average of three years longer than Americans .
Nurses love the message .
At the American debut of the film on June 12 , 1,000 nurses gave the film an eight - minute standing ovation .
Last week , Moore arranged to let nurses in the GTA see his film for free .
Many took advantage of his offer – and we thought it the perfect chance to find out what those on the front lines think of the movie .
Does the film accurately portray the Canadian system ?
" I think it was fairly accurate .
I think , personally , we probably have a little longer of a wait time than he showed .
He talked about doctors ' office wait times being 20 to 40 minutes , which may be accurate , but he did n't go into MRI wait times . . .
" I came back from the U.S. to Canada partly because of the health care system .
I realized that if I want to have kids and do things , I do n't want to be in the U.S. health system .
But I also think you have to be honest about it .
I love the ( Canadian ) system and I want to be here and I would n't trade it in for anything .
But you need to give viewers the good and the bad .
It 's not a free system here ; you pay larger taxes than in the U.S. "
Stacey Stenson , a pediatric oncology nurse at Sick Kids hospital
What in the film moved you ?
" I was really moved by the interview he did with the older British gentleman ( former Labour MP Tony Benn ) talking about the war and the pictures of how everything was just in desolation and how even though they were really poor , they made a choice to take care of everybody and of their most vulnerable . "
Lynn Anne Mulrooney , policy analyst and former community nurse
How does the American system differ from the Canadian system at the front line ?
" I 've cared for critically ill people with catastrophic life - threatening illnesses ( for 25 years ) .
. . .
The common theme ( is ) that people get what they need , for the most part , regardless of their ability to pay .
. . .
I 've never talked to a patient about hospital bills ; I 've only talked about what they need and how I can help them . "
Tilda Shalof , critical care nurse , Toronto General Hospital
Why has this movie resonated so strongly with nurses ?
" I'm a union activist and the union , we try so hard , we do so much work on public education about the benefit of universal health care .
Nothing compares with the impact this movie has .
Everyday I go to work , I hear my colleagues talk about what they think . "
Betty Wu-Lawrence , public health nurse for more than 30 years
Was there anything unrealistic in how Moore portrayed the Canadian system ?
" I think the only one piece was when he talked to people who had waited for only 20 minutes ( in the doctor 's office ) .
If he had talked to patients in an emergency room here in Toronto , they 're not going to say they waited 20 minutes before they got taken care of .
So I thought that was a bit of a , perhaps , positive spin on it and not necessarily quite as accurate but for the most part ... ( the film ) really was . "
Gurjit Sangha , pediatric oncology nurse at Sick Kids
What did you learn from his portrayal of the health care systems in Britain and France ?
" That there is an important and critical place for prevention .
He ( Moore ) talked about that and how some of the other health care systems really work towards that and provide incentives to their practitioners to keep people healthy as opposed to just taking care of them when they 're sick . "
Allie Starr , pediatric oncology nurse at Sick Kids
I often encounter code like this :
if ( rowCount > rowIdx ) { if ( drc[rowIdx ] .Table.Columns.Contains ( " avalId " ) ) { do { if ( Attributes [ attrVal.AttributeClassId ] == null ) { // do stuff } else { if (!( Attributes[attrVal.AttributeClassId ] is ArrayList ) ) { // do stuff } else { if ( ! isChecking ) { // do stuff } else { // do stuff } } } rowIdx ++ ; } while ( rowIdx < rowCount && GetIdAsInt32 ( drc[rowIdx ] ) == Id ) ; } else rowIdx ++ ; } return rowIdx ; }
The excessive nesting of conditional clauses pushes the code out into an arrow formation :
if if if if do something endif endif endif endif
And you know you 're definitely in trouble when the code you 're reading is regularly exceeding the right margin on a typical 1280x1024 display .
This is the Arrow Anti-Pattern in action .
One of my primary refactoring tasks is " flattening " arrow code like this .
Those sharp , pointy barbs are dangerous !
Arrow code has a high cyclomatic complexity value – a measure of how many distinct paths there are through code :
Studies show a correlation between a program 's cyclomatic complexity and its error frequency .
A low cyclomatic complexity contributes to a program 's understandability and indicates it is amenable to modification at lower risk than a more complex program .
A module 's cyclomatic complexity is also a strong indicator of its testability .
Where appropriate , I flatten that arrow code by doing the following :
Replace conditions with guard clauses .
This code .. if ( SomeNecessaryCondition ) { // function body code } .. works better as a guard clause : if ( ! SomeNecessaryCondition ) { throw new RequiredConditionMissingException ; } // function body code Decompose conditional blocks into seperate functions .
In the above example , we 're in a do .. while loop which could be decomposed : do { ValidateRowAttribute ( drc[rowIdx ] ) ; rowIdx ++ ; } while ( rowIdx < rowCount && GetIdAsInt32( drc[rowIdx ] ) == Id ) ; Convert negative checks into positive checks .
As a broad rule , I prefer to put the positive comparison first and let the negative comparison fall out naturally into the else clause .
I think this reads a lot better and , more importantly , avoids the " I ain't not never doing that " syndrome : if ( Attributes[attrVal.AttributeClassId ] is ArrayList ) { // do stuff } else { // do stuff } Always opportunistically return as soon as possible from the function .
Once your work is done , get the heck out of there !
This is n't always possible – you might have resources you need to clean up .
But whatever you do , you have to abandon the ill - conceived idea that there should only be one exit point at the bottom of the function .
The goal is to have code that scrolls vertically a lot … but not so much horizontally .
One of Internet trends that has started to irritate people over the last few years is dropping vowels from company names - Flickr , Tumblr , Pluggd , Talkr , Anothr .
As diehard members of the spelling Nazis , we decided to see what had become of the correctly spelled domains , which are still racking up pageviews from visitors who can actually spell .
Flickr.com - Flicker.com
Flicker.com does n't really contain anything of value , except a big " For Sale " sign .
If we 're to believe the traffic numbers cited on the page , Flicker.com averages some 150,000 monthly uniques , which is nice enough but nothing to get rich with .
The page also cites several offers the owners have supposedly received , with the biggest being $ 350,000 , and all of them being declined .
While we do agree that domain names based on single English words have a certain value , with the traffic the domain is generating , and given the fact that Flickr is already a hugely successful service , $ 350,000 might have been a good deal .
Tumblr.com - Tumbler.com
While Tumblr is a neat service which enables you to create TumbleLogs , which are basically simplified and easy to use blogs , Tumbler.com unsurprisingly sells - tumblers .
If you believe the PR , they 're shatterproof , and easy to wash , too .
We 're unaware of just how big the tumbler market is , but these folks have the right domain for the job .
digg.com - dig.com
If dig.com were available at the time , I 'm sure that Kevin Rose and co would have bought that one instead for their social content site .
Luckily , it was n't - Digg turned out to be a fantastic brand , and the extra " g " makes it instantly recognizable .
Dig.com , on the other hand , leads to a Walt Disney Internet Group ( WDIG ) corporate website .
Bo-ring !
Profilactic.com - Prophylactic.com
Honestly , we 've expected something nastier from this one , but it 's just a placeholder domain with a boring list of birth - control related links .
And a popup , thank you very much .
Profilactic , if you have n't heard of it , is a " lifestyle aggregator " , which collects data from your profiles at various social sites , creating a stream of life style mashup .
Plazes.com - Places.com
The " correctly " spelled counterpart domain of the popular location detection service is , once more , nothing more than a placeholder with a bunch of travel - related links .
You'd think that whoever is holding a strong domain like places.com would try to capitalize on it in some other way than just nickeling and diming from affiliate links clicked by people who have no clue where they are , but hey , if that 's what 's keeping them happy , so be it .
Pluggd.com - Plugged.com
This is one of those rare instances when the " correct " domain name is actually being used for something useful .
In this case , Pluggd.com is a podcast aggregator , while Plugged is another Web 2.0 project , currently in invite - only beta stage .
The text present on the site does n't explain much about the service except that it 's going to be about ' knowledge sharing ' .
They also promise to give out three iPod nanos with special engraving to three lucky beta testers ; the signup form is right there , what are you waiting for ?
Talkr.com - Talker.com
Talkr is a service that converts text - only blogs to podcasts .
Talker.com , on the other hand is a web hosting company specialized in hosting MUDs ( Multi User Dungeon ) and Talkers .
Being a huge MUD addict back in the days when World of Warcraft was n't even on the horizon , I salute these folks ; but having in mind that MUDs and Talkers are n't really the in - thing in the last couple of years , I do have to wonder if a fantastic domain name like talker .com is worth more than their entire business .
Anothr.com - Another.com
Here 's another rare case of correct spelling actually being put to some use .
Anothr.com is an RSS aggregator which sends you news right to your Skype or IM client .
Another.com , on the other hand , offers customizable e-mail addresses , enabling users to choose between 6000 different domains .
Unfortunately , Another.com is currently undergoing an overhaul , and invites are closed .
reddit.com - readit.com
Well , the difference does n't get any more obvious than this : while reddit.com is a highly successful social content site , readit.com does n't even have a placeholder page on the domain ; not even a link - nothing , nada , zilch .
It 's just an " Under Construction " page , and it 's outdated even at that .
One more piece of evidence that today , a solid domain name does n't even guarantee you coffee money .
stikkit.com - stickit.com
While Stikkit is a nifty service that helps you organize your life with the help of little yellow notes , Stickit.com sports an oldschool image of an atomic bomb explosion , and a run -of - the - mill under construction notice - all in all , nothing to write home about .
One more win for incorrect spelling .
Of course , this list does n't exhaust all the " incorrectly " spelled services out there , but most are n't worth mentioning .
Here 's a quick recap of several others :
icebrrg.com - iceberg.com - the first does web forms , the second gives you a Flash - induced headache aggreg8.
net - aggregate .net - which do you prefer - feed aggregation , or heavy machinery ?
zpeech.com - speech.com - the website annotation service had to settle for the " z " version since Philips grabbed the speech.com domain topix .
net - topics.net -
One would say that topics .
net is quite a strong domain name , but at the moment it 's dead : does n't even return a 404 error page .
The correctly spelled .com version leads to the Indianapolis Star .
phixr.com - fixer.com -
Phixr fixes your photos online .
Fixer helps you fix your VCR .
Yes , that VCR which you 've thrown into the garage 7 years ago .
The lesson is learned .
If you have a good product , the domain name does n't matter .
If you have a crappy product , a great domain name wo n't save you .
Your Cheating Heart : Why Pols Don't Practice What They Preach David Vitter and others like him preach family values while philandering .
July 11 , 2007  --
Once again , a public figure known for his staunch position on family values has been caught philandering , and once again , the public is left wondering how these guys keep getting themselves into these messes .
After admitting to using escort services provided by Deborah Jeane Palfrey , known as the D.C. Madam , Sen. David Vitter , R- La. , became the latest public figure to get caught preaching one thing and practicing quite another .
It is a combination of hubris and denial that allows politicians and other public figures to say one thing and do the opposite , psychologists told ABCNEWS.com .
Vitter made a name for himself as a vocal social conservative and champion of family values .
Speaking last year in favor of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage , Vitter said , " It 's often said , but it 's very , very true , and it is worth repeating -- marriage is truly the most fundamental social institution in human history . "
But in a statement released Monday , Vitter issued an apology that made those previous remarks seem farcical .
" This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am , of course , completely responsible , " Vitter said in a written statement .
" Several years ago , I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling .
Out of respect for my family , I will keep my discussion of the matter there with God and them .
But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way . "
Vitter is certainly not the first politician to get caught in a sex scandal , nor is he the first public figure to proclaim the sanctity of the family while cheating on his wife .
Liberals and conservatives are equally adept at talking out of both sides of their mouths .
Former President Bill Clinton was perhaps the nation 's most well - known philanderer , but even his most vocal critic , Newt Gingrich , later admitted to cheating on not one but two of his wives .
Psychologists offer several reasons why politicians and other public figures , such as ministers , say one thing and do the opposite .
" People can believe in two opposing things .
Humans are ingenious in how they can make exceptions for themselves .
' Practice what you preach ' is an old saw , but there are plenty of charismatic figures who are known to be mean and nasty in their home life , " said Paul Ekman , an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of California Medical School in San Francisco .
" These people make an exception for themselves .
The very fact of their own misbehavior is the reason they preach to others , " he said .
These men , and most are men , sometimes believe their high station in life makes them exempt from the rules , and in other cases are trying to work out their own inner demons by admonishing bad behavior in others , psychologists said .
According to Judy Kuriansky , a psychologist and professor at Columbia University 's Teachers College , men in positions of power often believe they are above the rules that they impose on their followers .
" Often the people who speak loudest about something are trying to protect themselves from their own urges .
They act out one way on the public stage , but inside they have this urge .
They feel it 's wrong , and outwardly , they 're telling themselves it 's wrong .
It 's as if they 're having a conversation with themselves , " she said .
Kuriansky said preachers and clergy who succumb to temptation similarly try to work out their own issues when admonishing their congregants for the things they do themselves .
As with elected officials , a preacher 's politics has little to do with his capacity for cheating .
The Rev. Al Sharpton from New York City and Ted Haggard from Colorado Springs , Colo. , both have admitted to cheating on their wives .
Haggard confessed in November 2006 to using methamphetamines and paying a male prostitute for sex .
Haggard had made a name for himself by condemning homosexuality and opposing gay marriage legislation .
" As with politicians , it 's the same psychological phenomenon when preachers do the same thing .
They have to appeal to the public , but it is not necessarily what they really believe , " Kuriansky said .
As for how Vitter moves on from here , John J. Pitney , a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in California , said he has already taken the best first step by admitting his mistake and asking for forgiveness .
" His best bet is to acknowledge responsibility and ask forgiveness . …
A lot of people are going over things he 's said in the past .
One good piece of advice is when you 're in a hole , stop digging .
I 'd advise him not talk about any issues of sexual morality for a while , " he said .
with Joanna Gilbertson
Ziad Sabah Jasim , a detainee who confessed to being a member of the Islamic Army in Iraq and to killing American soldiers , waits outside an American Joint Security Station in the Ghazaliya neighborhood of Baghdad .
Baghdad , March 2007
I did n’t want to go back .
When I began reporting from Iraq in 2002 , I was still a wild and somewhat naïve twenty - four - year - old kid .
Five years later , I was battle - weary .
I had been there longer than the American military and had kept returning long after most members of the “ coalition of the willing ” had pulled out .
Iraq had become my initiation , my rite of passage , but instead of granting me a new sense of myself and a new identity , Iraq had become my identity .
Without Iraq , I was nothing .
Just another photographer hanging around New York .
In Iraq , I had a purpose , a mission ; I felt important .
I did n’t want to go back , but I needed to — and for the worst possible reason : I was n’t ready for it to end .
After twelve months away , I had a craving that only Iraq could satisfy .
My wife did n’t like the idea .
Neither did my shrink .
“ If you go back to Iraq now , ” he warned , “ you ’ll probably keep going back . ”
To be completely honest — and I was n’t being honest with myself then — part of me knew they were right .
Still , I could easily rationalize my desire to anyone who asked .
I told them that I wanted to have one last look , that I needed to shoot the place differently , outside the constraints of daily coverage ; I said I wanted to photograph Iraq emotionally , to react to my feelings on the spot instead of bottling them up as I ’d done in the past ; I said I wanted to be sure that my book of war photographs was indeed finished , that the story had irrevocably turned .
The only people who bought my justifications were my editors at the New York Times .
They thought another rotation was a great idea .
I felt pretty confident , and a little champagne - drunk , when I fell asleep in the plane on the runway a few weeks later .
An ice storm had crept up on the city , and there was no way to know when my flight would clear for takeoff from Kennedy .
When I awoke eight hours later , I was still in New York .
My buzz was gone , and so was my confidence .
Other passengers were demanding to know when we were going to leave , but I had bigger , equally unanswerable questions .
We took off for Amman , and I spent the twelve hours sleepless , wondering what I was doing , what exactly the story was I thought I was chasing , and how much luck I had left — if it had n’t already run out completely .
* * * *
I ’d been out of the country for over a year , so I could n’t go on any embeds without getting a new Combined Press Information Center ( CPIC ) ID .
These military press cards ( which , incidentally , nine out of ten New York City bartenders prefer to my Australian driver ’s license ) are only attainable in person at the center in the Green Zone .
When I arrived at the checkpoint , the Iraqi and Peruvian thugs guarding the door told me that there was no press conference that day , so I could come in , but my cameras could not .
Walking the corridors to the bunker office , I wondered why on earth they ’d be worried about a Western photographer in such a perfectly boring place .
Minutes later , I understood : two soldiers sat behind the desk , one of them manning the telephone and the other the computer .
Hunting and pecking with his two index fingers , Specialist Computer entered hacks ’ names as Specialist Telephone shouted them out to him .
The protocol seemed even more ridiculous because Specialist Computer ’s mouth was stuffed with an ice - cream sandwich .
He paused long enough to hand me a sheet of ground rules , which every reporter has to sign in order to embed with the troops .
Though mostly the same as agreements I ’d signed many times before , I was asked this time to initial every single one of the forty - six paragraphs on the form .
Clause number eleven had the biggest changes .
It was a lot more specific : “ Names , video , identifiable written / oral descriptions or identifiable photographs of wounded service members will not be released without the service member ’s prior written consent .
If the service member becomes KIA , Rule 11 ( b ) applies . ”
Soldiers are extremely reluctant to sign any documents not issued by the military .
Actually , they wo n’t .
Period .
Not that it matters .
Who would have the balls to stand in front of a unit before a mission and ask them to sign a release giving permission for photographs to be taken in the event they ’re wounded ?
As if they did n’t distrust the press enough already , as if such a form would n’t be seen as the ultimate tempting of their unit ’s fate .
If you ’ve ever wondered why photographers do n’t take many pictures of death and horrible injuries — the ugly facts of war — now you know .

My first few days I was in western Baghdad , stuck at one of the small outposts called Joint Security Stations ( JSSs ) — “ joint ” because they ’re manned by American and Iraqi soldiers .
JSSs were popping up everywhere as part of President Bush ’s so - called troop surge , which aims to stabilize the capital .
My time at the JSS was quiet , dull .
Most people forget that the major part of war is tedium , fending off the oppressive boredom between life - threatening moments .
For hours each day , I walked from the roof to the parking lot and back , trying , without luck , to find a photograph , any photograph .
So when the opportunity to go on patrol presented itself , I took it .
Specialist Loren Brinson , 21 , of the HHC 1 - 5 , First Cavalry Division , sits guard at a small JSS setup in a Sunni district in western Baghdad .
The dummy ( left ) , once used to draw sniper fire , was discarded after insurgents realized the ruse .
A Sunni man is detained by a Shiite - dominated army force at a JSS in the Mansour district of Baghdad .
He was suspected of detonating an IED that killed a member of the unit .
An infantry unit was heading to the nearby neighborhood of Ameriya , a 100 percent no - go zone for unembedded press , which runs parallel with the infamous airport road .
They were escorting a handful of engineers from the Stryker Brigade who had been ordered to collect trash .
The “ sanitization mission ” would eliminate insurgents ’
IED hiding spots among the garbage and , as a bonus , place the trash - collecting Americans in the community ’s good graces .
The engineers were told unconditionally that they should remain in their vehicles .
The area was full of snipers , and the roads were lined with bombs .
But the minute we rolled up to the street , a few engineers exited the heavily armored vehicles and started directing their bulldozers .
Some of the infantry guys watched the scene in disbelief ; others were livid .
By bulldozing the rubbish , they said , the engineers made it even easier for insurgents to hide their lethal bombs in the torn - up ground .
I did n’t have a picture from this embed yet , and out of sheer desperation I asked permission to walk around with the engineers .
The GIs told me that I was an idiot ; I could get killed out there , but it was my life .
I hopped out , ran over to one of soldiers , and started taking pictures , dancing around him the whole time so snipers would n’t consider me an easy target .
I got his unit — “ 18th engineers , 3rd ( Stryker ) brigade , 2nd I.D. , ” my notebook reads — his surname ( Gardner ) from his flak jacket , his rank ( sergeant ) from a patch on his chest , and ran back to the truck .
I just wanted to be back behind the armor of the Humvee .
Another engineer was shouting at him , “ Get off the sidewalk . ”
They were frightened of bombs buried beneath it .
Ten minutes before he was killed , Sergeant Freeman L. Gardner Jr. was assigned to watch this street as bulldozers cleared debris feared to conceal IEDs .
I was back inside the Humvee lighting a cigarette to calm my nerves when a massive concussion shook our truck .
It was an IED .
All I could see was a huge cloud of dust .
The gunner made the only sound , a ratchet - click of the spinning turret , while he searched for the man who triggered the bomb .
Then the radio squawked , “ Gardner is fucked up !
Get a CASEVAC !
Gardner is fucked up ! ” Gardner had been split in two by the bomb .
The next time I saw him , he was under a camouflage poncho .
Only his feet were visible , sticking out .
If I had taken the photo , I would have been lynched by his comrades .
When corpses are around , every eye in the zone , teary or angered , is on me , ensuring I do n’t get too close and take a picture .
I ’m the outsider , but they do n’t know that deaths like Gardner ’s overwhelm me for days , months , sometimes years .
It never gets easier .
It does n’t matter if I did n’t know the person or did n’t even have much contact with him : just being there when it happened is enough .
With Gardner , though , I ended up being the guy who engaged him in his last conversation .
I took the last photograph of him alive .
A few hours later , I was having lunch at the huge chow hall on Camp Liberty .
The tent holds five hundred soldiers or more , and sitting there chewing on a gristly hamburger , I looked at their faces : some laughing , some engaged in intense conversation , others sitting silently , or chewing their food .
I felt like crying , or screaming , or punching someone .
Instead , I finished my burger and swallowed all that anger .
Gardner was the empty seat at lunch that day .
The next day it would be somebody else .
Later I found his full name — Sergeant Freeman L. Gardner Jr.— at the Department of Defense ’s website , in a press release about his death .
He was from Little Rock , went to the movies every Saturday with his wife , and loved video games and college football .
The DOD release begins , “ The Department of Defense announced today the death of a soldier who was supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom . ”
He was twenty - six years old .

My next embed was with the Kurds .
For the first time in recent history , the peshmerga were patrolling Baghdad , ostensibly because the Kurds ’ neutrality to the sectarian rifts that divide the capital made them a particularly effective fighting force .
But I knew better : Kurds and Arabs are enemies , and have been for many , many years .
I was winning a card game in the Kurdish headquarters when Times reporter Edward Wong rushed in to say a call had just come in from a Sunni woman in the process of being illegally evicted from her home .
With no time to get our flak jackets and helmets , we jumped into the back of a Kurdish armored truck .
At the scene , two men stood against a wall , arguing with a woman in a blue headscarf .
One of the men was armed with a pistol , the other with eviction papers .
The men would listen to the woman for a moment , then shout at her .
Even after soldiers had arrived at the scene , the men spoke and acted with conviction .
The woman in the blue headscarf was Suaada Saadoun , a widowed Sunni mother of seven .
After a year spent in Syria to escape sectarian violence , she and her family had returned home to one of only four remaining Sunni households in the Shiite Ali Salah section of Khadamiya .
Suaada explained that the two men claiming to be from the Ministry of Finance carried fraudulent eviction papers , and that this was the second time since her return that they had attempted to forcibly evict her and her family .
Exasperated and with nowhere else to turn , Suaada had called the Kurds .
Suaada Saadoun tells American and Kurdish soldiers that the two Shiite men outside her house were trying to evict her from Khadamiya , a neighborhood in Baghdad .
A Kurdish soldier questions Shiite Abbas Radhi in front of Suaada ’s family .
The soldiers eventually concluded that the men were probably Mahdi Army fighters .
Working hand in hand with the Iraqi police , the Mahdi militia , under orders from renegade Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , was trying to ensure that no Sunnis or other “ undesirables ” entered their neighborhoods .
Captain Morales , the US officer in charge of the Kurdish soldiers , sent the suspects back to base for questioning .
Suaada sat down in her courtyard , smiling warmly at her family and the crowd of soldiers .
She looked genuinely happy , elated even .
I took a picture of the pleasant , unusual moment , and walked out to the street with the Kurdish troops , who were heralded with clapping and cheers from Sunnis living in the neighborhood .
Many of them also had been threatened , and celebrated Suaada ’s small victory as though it were their own .
Later , Captain Morales told
Ed that helping Suaada had been the most successful mission of the company ’s tour .
Suaada smiles after Shiite militia were stopped from evicting her from her house .
The next morning , Suaada was shot dead in an alley near her home .
A distraught Captain Morales and his platoon drove to Suaada ’s house where her hysterical daughters and grandchildren lined the driveway .
While they interviewed her calmer family members , I stayed outside with the funeral party .
It was heartbreaking .
The day before , her grandchildren were playing pranks on me , joking around while Suaada defended their home ; her smiling daughters had held my gaze for longer than usual for Iraqi women , to the point of actually making me uncomfortable .
I felt like a bastard taking photographs of them now , framing their pain , but I had to tell their story .
Suaada had been walking home from the market when she was shot eight times .
Some neighboring bakers said they ’d heard the pistol fire , but saw nothing .
By the time we arrived , Suaada ’s body had been taken to the morgue , and all that remained was a pool of blood sinking into the soil around a tree ’s roots , one brass shell casing , and Suaada ’s upper denture plate .
The dentures were disturbing .
I could n’t take my eyes off them , and standing there , it occurred to me that once again I ’d made the final photographs of a murdered human being .
Reporters began telling me I was bad luck .
I was starting to believe them .
Suaada ’s dentures lie on the ground after she was assassinated .
Suaada ’s daughter wails after hearing her mother had been executed .
This murder troubled me on many levels .
Suaada ’s story contained a simple truth about Iraq today : the Americans , regardless of how hard they try , are powerless in combating sectarian violence .
And the soldiers know it .
Throughout my entire rotation I ’d hear a variation of the same bleak outlook from officers , noncoms , and enlisted men .
With few exceptions , American soldiers I came across felt their mission to quell the ethnic cleansing of Baghdad was pointless .
“ What can you do ? ” Captain Morales ’s first sergeant said after Suaada ’s murder .
“ It ’s their problem .
This is their country , and they need to work it out among themselves .
There ’s nothing we can do about it . ”
The soldiers do n’t dwell on this , but after Suaada ’s death , after all the deaths , I do .
My photographs of Suaada ’s last hours and death might make a poignant point , but they ca n’t bring her back to life .
* * * *
When I return from a rotation in Iraq , the thing people ask without fail is whether the country is more dangerous or less dangerous than it used to be .
It ’s more complicated than that .
The streets of Baghdad are constantly metamorphosing , and you never know what they will look like , what ’s going to happen , or how afraid you will or should be .
There ’s always some threat — driving down a sniper - infested alley , getting caught in a car - bomb explosion , encountering trigger - happy Americans on patrol , or ( my worst fear ) being taken by kidnappers .
There are neighborhoods that are more dangerous , others that are less .
And then there ’s Ghazaliya .
Ghazaliya was one of the first neighborhoods in Baghdad deemed too dangerous for the press to cover .
High - ranking army officers from Saddam ’s rule called Ghazaliya home , as did al Qaeda in Mesopotamia and the Islamic Army in Iraq .
It makes perfect sense , then , that Ghazaliya also became home to Baghdad ’s first JSS , somewhat ironically named Casino .
The opening of Casino did a fine job of quelling violence in its immediate area , but just six blocks south of the outpost , insurgents still controlled the streets .
Command decided to build a JSS there too , and in March 2007 , Delta Company , 2/12 CAV was sent in to open JSS Thrasher .
“ It ’s twenty times quieter than when we first arrived , ” a machine gunner told me from his perch in a guard tower .
Our conversation was interrupted by a sniper taking pot shots at us , but I believed him .
Just trying to get to the objective buildings back in February , Delta had been ambushed and hit by seven IEDs .
It was quieter now , but far from quiet .
The week before I arrived , four Americans were killed by an enormous IED while driving on nearby Route Alpha , and another IED disabled a tank .
In the two days that I had been there , the violence was so constant — ambushes , IEDs , the unrelenting threat of snipers — that I could n’t imagine how bad it had been back then .
Delta shared Thrasher with the Iraqis of the Third Battalion , Fourth Brigade , Tenth Division , a Shiite outfit from southern Iraq .
In their year down south , they had n’t seen a single loss of life , but shortly after arriving in Ghazaliya , their two commanding officers were killed .
As a result , they were scared to leave the base without the Americans .
That drove the Americans mad .
At the best of times , I do n’t have much faith in the Iraqi Army , but in this case , I felt as though I understood their unwillingness to go it alone .
The Americans drove around in the newest and safest Humvees , Bradley fighting vehicles , and the terrifying M1 Abrams tanks .
The Iraqis only had old Humvees and small armored personnel carriers .
Fear turns into a fact of life in Iraq , and the threat of being killed or wounded is simply part of the territory .
There ’s really nothing you can do about it , so you learn to live with it .
That said , Ghazaliya was scary .
There was such a strong chance of being blown up or shot that even the American soldiers were n’t comfortable in their own JSS .
Generally speaking , if the troops are cool , I ’m cool — but when they worry , I freak out .
The soldiers patrolling Ghazaliya acted as if every foot of road was going to detonate underneath them and every house was filled with insurgents waiting to attack .
I was out — and freaking out — when the patrol came upon a dumped corpse .
It was the first and only body I ’d seen in Ghazaliya , which was strange because seeing dumped corpses had become such a common occurrence in Iraq that part of my justification for returning was to photograph this seemingly irreversible part of the war .
The body , partly eaten by dogs , lay in a trash - strewn clearing .
I was told that in the nine days this single anonymous corpse had been there , two Iraqi soldiers had died trying to collect it and a tank had been blown up .
A rotting corpse is devoured by dogs after having lain there for at least nine days .
The Iraqi unit accepted its mission to collect the body , but only with heavy support — an American tank , a Bradley , an anti-IED truck , an American bomb - squad team , and an entire infantry platoon .
Even then , the Iraqis left , rather than try to recover the body .
Eventually , another Iraqi unit arrived and the two soldiers who went in to retrieve the corpse vomited almost immediately after reaching it .
The lieutenant later explained his unwillingness to send in US troops .
“ There ’s no reason to die over a body that ’s already dead , ” he told me .
“ Especially , an American life .
We just got too much stuff to go back to . ”
Two soldiers , a man and a woman , try to extinguish the flames engulfing a Buffalo truck .
After the body was finally collected , the unit spent the afternoon putting out fires .
A car bomb had ignited an anti-IED truck , and the unit was charged with quashing an insurgent ambush while firefighters extinguished the flames .
Once the fire was out , American and Iraqi troops started searching for insurgents ; soon , an Iraqi unit found some .
The Iraqi soldiers were pointing their Kalashnikovs over a fence , screaming ferociously .
After they disappeared into the house ’s courtyard , the American ’s interpreter ran over to see what the commotion was about .
“ Lieutenant , come over here , ” he shouted ; “ they ’re abusing the man , ” but I was the only one who heard him .
I sprinted through some heavy bushes and found the Iraqis dragging a barefooted man out of the house .
Like every Sunni I ’ve ever seen being detained by Shiites , he look deathly frightened .
Iraqi army soldiers detain Ziad Sabah Jasim , after finding him in a house near the scene of a car bombing .
Iraqi Army soldiers detain Ziad Sabah Jasim .
* * * *
The detainee was Ziad Sabah Jasim , and he tested positive for recent exposure to gunpowder .
Back at JSS
Thrasher a second man , Mustafa Subhi Jassam , had been detained and had also come up positive for explosives .
The Iraqi captain conducted his interrogation behind closed doors , interrupted only once by American soldiers who recorded the suspects ’ retinas and fingerprints with their new high - tech biometric scanner .
The Americans used to just take down detainees ’ names and photograph them , which Ziad and Mustafa had surely experienced before .
This new contraption seemed to make them even more nervous .
American soldiers take a biometric scan of Ziad .
The next day , Ziad and Mustafa were blindfolded , handcuffed , and put under guard on a cot outside the JSS .
Ziad , the heavier of the two , was rocking back and forth .
He looked as though he was in pain .
Mustafa hunched next to him , with bright red lash marks clearly visible at the top of his back .
Through an interpreter , I asked an Iraqi what had happened .
“ He has sensitive skin , ” the Iraqi soldier said through a mischievous smile , “ and he got a rash . ” I lifted Mustafa ’s jacket to get a better look .
I ’m no doctor , but it seemed pretty clear : Mustafa was allergic to being whipped by electric cables .
When I tried to photograph Mustafa ’s welts , the Iraqi soldier grew angry and stepped in front of my camera .
Mustafa blindfolded and awaiting interrogation .
Mustafa ’s back shows signs of abuse .
I offered the two men cigarettes .
Ziad accepted .
I knew they were bad guys , but they were also human beings .
They did n’t deserve abuse — or did they ?
As usual , Iraq was shredding my logic and my sense of right and wrong .
Al Qaeda members are bad guys , but so are the Shiites .
The Kurds certainly are n’t angels , and even the Americans with the best intentions are n’t helping .
Sometimes they ’re actually inflaming the situation .
There are no good guys in Iraq , and while I was there witnessing the disaster as it further unraveled , my emotions kept swinging between sympathy and hatred .
A soldier walked by and expressed his disgust , “ Why give those motherfuckers a cigarette ? ”
At least his venom was directed at me .
One of the guards explained to me that a member of the American tactical human intelligence team had walked by and called the men “ murderers . ”
Usually , the guard explained , American interrogators say that suspects brought in by Iraqis are innocent , so he asked the intel officer if he got any information from him .
“ You kidding ? ” the officer replied , referring to Ziad .
“ This guy killed us . ”
Ziad ( center ) confessed to being a member of the Islamic Army in Iraq , and Mustafa Subhi Jassam ( right ) said he was a driver and IED placer for al Qaeda in Iraq .
The man on the left was declared innocent by American and Iraqi forces and was soon released .
Mustafa confessed , too .
He told the Americans he had worked as a driver and IED placer for al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
Like Ziad , he had talked to the American interrogators after the Iraqis had prepared him .
Between them they gave up locations in Ghazaliya where roadside bombs were planted , the names of other insurgents , and an al Qaeda safe - house location .
A large contingent of Americans suited up for a raid , and Mustafa was brought along to positively identify the house .
They made almost no attempt to conceal his identity .
If ever released , Mustafa was a dead man .
Before the bomb squad was called in to safely remove a huge cache of weapons , an Iraqi flicked a lit cigarette next to a pile of highly unstable TNT and the house was evacuated .
Still , the raid was a success .
I crossed the street and relaxed in the afternoon sun on a patio swing between Captain Bassim Hassan , the commanding officer of the Iraqi battalion , and the interpreter who had alerted his lieutenant that Ziad and Mustafa were being abused .
Captain Hassan was thrilled by how events had unfolded since his men dragged Ziad and Mustafa from the house .
He boasted about the raid and relished what he viewed as his own success as an interrogator .
“ When I was beating the hell out of Mustafa , I let Ziad watch .
I asked Ziad if he wanted this too and he started talking , ” he said , laughing .
“ Ziad , we only spoke to with slaps .
He talked after he saw what we did to Mustafa . ”
The swing kept rocking back and forth , but my world stopped .
I asked the interpreter to remind Bassim that I was working for the New York Times , that I was writing down everything he said .
Bassim did n’t care .
“ I prepared him for the Americans , ” he said , “ and let them take his confession . ”
He was chomping on nabook while his soldiers were gathering more of the small , sour fruit from a nearby tree .
As they threw axes , chairs , and shovels to knock down fruit from the branches beyond their reach , Bassim reflected on his line of work .
“ It ’s a good job , ” he said .
I left the courtyard stunned , intensely conflicted .
By breaking up this al Qaeda cell , the raid had saved lives .
No question about it .
And the information could n’t have been gathered in a timely manner if the Geneva Conventions had been followed .
Again , no question .
But I hate torture and will never condone it .
Still , the Iraqis themselves see it as necessary .
They say they must instill more fear than al Qaeda does or they will never get a suspect to talk .
“ We know how to make them talk .
We know their back streets .
We beat them .
I do n’t beat them that much , but enough so he feels the pain and it makes him desperate . ”
That one moment crystallized the whole war for me .
No matter what strategy America tries , no matter whom we choose to ally ourselves with , cruelty would always be Iraq ’s currency .
Ziad waits to be processed .
The last time I saw Mustafa and Ziad was right before they entered the Iraqi justice system .
Should they even make it to trial ( insurgents are said to be routinely tortured inside Iraqi detention facilities ) , they will certainly face the death penalty .
And as I took their pictures , I could n’t help wondering whether these would become the last images of them alive .
* * * *
My shrink warned that one more trip to Iraq would n’t satisfy me .
As much as I hate to admit it , he ’s probably right .
Feeding my craving only left me wanting more .
There ’s something about the story that I ca n’t turn away from — even now that I ’m safely back in New York .
I still lose sleep .
I lie in bed , listening to sounds outside our apartment , and my mind races , going over and over what happened , imagining what must be happening now .
I see all the people , the places , all the photographs I ’ve taken .
Sometimes I wish they were someone else ’s , or at least that I had another person ’s pictures to go with them , another person ’s perspective on all the things I ’ve seen .
Sometimes , I lie there hating what I do , even as I ’m longing for it .
It ’s something I need , but for different reasons now .
Covering the war used to make me feel like I was doing something important , but I have grown to accept that Americans will not stop dying because I take their pictures ; sectarian violence wo n’t end because I photographed one woman ’s death ; and abuse wo n’t stop because I witnessed the aftermath of one interrogation .
I ’m just recording history now , documenting the decline , in the hope that the people who do n’t recognize it now may one day look back at my pictures and see the war for the mistake - riddled quagmire it was — and is .
In the meantime , I ’ll continue to struggle with how to define the conflict in Iraq without letting it define me .
George W. Bush is the imperial president that James Madison and other founders of this great republic warned us about .
He lied the nation into precisely the " foreign entanglements " that George Washington feared would destroy our experiment in representative government , and he has championed a spurious notion of security over individual liberty , thus eschewing the alarms of Thomas Jefferson as to the deprivation of the inalienable rights of free citizens .
But most important , he has used the sledgehammer of war to obliterate the separation of powers that James Madison enshrined in the U.S. Constitution .
With the " war on terror , " Bush has asserted the right of the president to wage war anywhere and for any length of time , at his whim , because the " terrorists " will always provide a convenient shadowy target .
That 's just the " continual warfare " that Madison warned of in justifying the primary role of Congress in initiating and continuing to finance a war — the very issue now at stake in Bush 's battle with Congress .
In his " Political Observations , " written years before he had served as fourth president of the United States , Madison went on to underscore the dangers of an imperial presidency bloated by war fever .
" In war , " Madison wrote in 1795 , at a time when the young republic still faced its share of dangerous enemies , " the discretionary power of the executive is extended ... and all the means of seducing the minds , are added to those of subduing the force , of the people . "
How remarkably prescient of Madison to anticipate the specter of our current King George , imperiously undermining Congress ' attempts to end the Iraq war .
When the prime author of the U.S. Constitution explained why that document grants Congress — not the president — the exclusive power to declare and fund wars , Madison wrote , " The delegation of such powers ( to the president ) would have struck , not only at the fabric of our Constitution , but at the foundation of all well organized and well checked governments . "
Because " no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare , " Madison urged that the constitutional separation of powers he had codified be respected .
" The Constitution expressly and exclusively vests in the Legislature the power of declaring a state of war ... the power of raising armies , " he wrote .
" The separation of the power of raising armies from the power of commanding them is intended to prevent the raising of armies for the sake of commanding them . "
That last sentence perfectly describes the threat of what President Dwight Eisenhower would describe 165 years later as the " military - industrial complex , " a permanent war economy feeding off a permanent state of insecurity .
The collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the military profiteers and their cheerleaders in the government of a raison d'etre for the enormous war economy supposedly created in response to it .
Fortunately for them , Bush found in the 9 - 11 attack an excuse to make war even more profitable and longer lasting .
The Iraq war , which the president 's 9 - 11 commission concluded never had anything to do with the terrorist assault , nonetheless has transferred many hundreds of billions in taxpayer dollars into the military economy .
And when Congress seeks to exercise its power to control the budget , this president asserts that this will not govern his conduct of the war .
There never was a congressional declaration of war to cover the invasion of Iraq .
Instead , President Bush acted under his claimed power as commander in chief , which the Supreme Court has held does allow him to respond to a " state of war " against the United States .
That proviso was clearly a reference to surprise attacks or sudden emergencies .
The problem is that the " state of war " in question here was an al - Qaida attack on the United States that had nothing whatsoever to do with Saddam Hussein 's Iraq .
Perhaps , to spare Congress the embarrassment of formally declaring war against a nation that had not attacked America , Bush settled for a loosely worded resolution supporting his use of military power if Iraq failed to comply with U.N. mandates .
This was justified by the White House as a means of strengthening the United Nations in holding Iraq accountable for its weapons of mass destruction arsenal , but as most of the world looked on in dismay , Bush invaded Iraq after U.N. inspectors on the ground discovered that Iraq had no WMD .
Bush betrayed Congress , which in turn betrayed the American people — just as Madison feared when he wrote , " Of all the enemies of public liberty , war is , perhaps , the most to be dreaded , because it comprises and develops the germ of every other . "

DIGG THIS
This past weekend found me in Natchitoches , Louisiana , the oldest permanent settlement in the Louisiana Purchase and the home of Lasyone 's , the restaurant which makes the world 's greatest meat pies .
The residents of Natchitoches were having yet another music festival ( there are more festivals than work days in Natchitoches ) and revelers had arrived from all over .
Lined up along one side of the ancient , brick street was an immense gathering of motorcycles and their owners .
Nearer to Cane River
Lake were several horses accompanied by riders .
Looking from the motorcyclists covered in leather , fringe , appropriately logo -ed tee shirts and bandanas , to the horsemen wearing hats , boots , buckles and spurs , it suddenly dawned on me why both motorcycling and horseback riding are so popular : both activities allow grown men to play dress -up .
When I was young , Harley riders were a hard lot .
Tattooed , dirty , often possessing a criminal record a mile long , they were people to be avoided at all costs .
Today , most Harley riders you see are professionals with a career , a mortgage and 2.6 kids .
Riding a Harley and wearing the officially licensed merchandise allows them to pretend to be something they are not ; a gang member , feared by decent folk .
A desperado of the open road ; an easy rider .
Weekend cowboys are no different .
If a person honestly loved to be on the back of a horse and that was all there was to it , there would be no reason to spend $ 100 on a Stetson and a giant belt buckle .
Those accoutrements allow the rider to escape reality and assume a new identity ; a lone cowboy riding the trail , looking for doggies lost from the herd .
Weathered , grizzled .
A dangerous hombre .
See ?
Playing dress-up .
I imagine that many a modern day Heck 's Angel would throw his palm pilot down in complete disgust were he to hear me say such a thing .
" Just wait until I finish the Davidson account , " he would roar , " and then we 'll see who 's playing dress - up ! " Vroom !
Vroom !
There is nothing wrong with playing dress - up .
If you want to dress like a Confederate soldier and march around a field all weekend , go ahead .
There is absolutely no harm in doing so .
My great fear is that there is another group playing dress - up today , and their actions do cause harm .

The militarization of the police
How many of you remember the TV show SWAT from the mid 70's ?
Robert Urich and his team would roll into a dangerous situation in their big , blue van with the best theme music this side of Peter Gunn blaring in the background .
As a child , I loved it .
It appears that many other people my age also loved it .
Since the early 80's , the number of SWAT team deployments have increased from approximately 3,000 per year to more than 40,000 every year .
40,000 .
Really .
A 13 - fold increase in 25 years .
Why ?
SWAT teams are now used by police departments to perform jobs that normal , uniformed officers once handled .
Illegal gambling ?
People voluntarily coming together and playing Texas Hold -em ?
Send in SWAT !
( see the video here )
Suspect that a high school student might have marijuana in his locker ?
Send in SWAT and terrorize all of the students !
[ The school 's ] surveillance cameras and a police camera … show students as young as 14 forced to the ground in handcuffs as officers in SWAT team uniforms and bulletproof vests aim guns at their heads and lead a drug dog to tear through their book bags …
No drugs or weapons were found during the raid and no charges were filed .

Elderly women in their homes minding their own business ?
Send in SWAT !
Ms. [ Kathryn ]
Johnston , who was at least 88 years old , was killed in a barrage of gunfire after narcotics officers burst through the front door of her home without warning last Nov. 21 .
Apparently fearing for her life , Ms. Johnston , who lived in a high - crime neighborhood , met the officers with a gun .

Heck , let 's just send in SWAT now and ask questions later !
The CATO Institute maintains an interactive map tracking and documenting dozens of botched paramilitary raids throughout the U.S .
But it does n't stop there .
Once a police department forms a SWAT team , the military attitude is adopted by the other members of the force .
Today , we see not just SWAT members , but patrolmen moving about our towns wearing jump boots and flak jackets … just like the military .
Unfortunately , once a person adopts the military mindset , the focus is no longer to assist , to help and to be the peacemaker , but rather to intimidate , to force and to destroy .
Look at what happened in MacArthur Park this past Monday .
Police in riot gear ( read : military garb ) decided to disperse an overwhelmingly peaceful demonstration and assaulted with batons and rubber bullets everyone who did not cower and flee at their coming , including the female reporters attempting to film the despicable scene .
Watch this video until the end and you will be reminded of China 's Tiananmen Square as paramilitary - police batter a man attempting to support an American flag while another policeman uses his baton on a woman splayed in the dirt .
I fear things will become even worse in the future .
The paramilitary - police are now being glamorized on TV once again .
But this time the shows are not fiction as they were in the 70's but real life episodes .
Dallas SWAT on A&E TV follows the ( surprise ) Dallas SWAT team as they carry out no - knock warrants on unsuspecting bad guys .
The videos provided in the preceding link allow the viewer to watch the SWAT team pump themselves up , destroy private property and drag dangerous perps from their homes .
I 'm still trying to understand why the police have a tank … probably to protect us from drug - dealing Soviets .
Nothing good can come of having the military patrolling our streets , and make no mistake , the police are becoming militarized , and doing so with the help of the Federal Government .
How long before our towns are nothing more than caricatures of old Nazi movies where citizens rush home lest they be approached by soldiers asking for identification ?
( " Papers please ! "
But it must be spoken with a German accent .
Also , any movie with " papers please , " must also have the line , " You are veak , Fader , Veeeak ! " )
Maybe I 'm overreacting .
But I do n't think so .
Since the Supreme Court threw out the " knock and announce " rule concerning police who serve warrants , there is nothing to stop SWAT teams from tearing off the side of your home , dragging you and your family out of your beds , seizing your belongings and shooting your pets while giving you little or no notice as to these invaders ' identity .
Amusingly ( or not ) , several newspaper investigations have shown that less than half of all no - knock warrants have resulted in contraband or arrests .
I 'm sure that fact is comforting to people who have watched helplessly as their small children were seized and handcuffed by armed men wearing black hoods .
Until we , the honest citizens , say " no more ! " to an armed military in our streets , things will only get worse .
How long before we are the occupied territory ?
How long before we are the ones trapped behind the " blue " curtain ?
How long before our neighbors are " disappeared " in the night ?
Maybe I 'm overreacting .
But I do n't think so .

The Best of Rob Blackstock
The Noble Red Man
by Mark Twain
First published in The Galaxy 1870
In books he is tall and tawny , muscular , straight and of kingly presence ; he has a beaked nose and an eagle eye .
His hair is glossy , and as black as the raven 's wing ; out of its massed richness springs a sheaf of brilliant feathers ; in his ears and nose are silver ornaments ; on his arms and wrists and ankles are broad silver bands and bracelets ; his buckskin hunting suit is gallantly fringed , and the belt and the moccasins wonderfully flowered with colored beads ; and when , rainbowed with his war - paint , he stands at full height , with his crimson blanket wrapped about him , his quiver at his back , his bow and tomahawk projecting upward from his folded arms , and his eagle eye gazing at specks against the far horizon which even the paleface 's field - glass could scarcely reach , he is a being to fall down and worship .
His language is intensely figurative .
He never speaks of the moon , but always of " the eye of the night ; " nor of the wind as the wind , but as " the whisper of the Great Spirit ; " and so forth and so on .
His power of condensation is marvelous .
In some publications he seldom says anything but " Waugh ! " and this , with a page of explanation by the author , reveals a whole world of thought and wisdom that before lay concealed in that one little word .
He is noble .
He is true and loyal ; not even imminent death can shake his peerless faithfulness .
His heart is a well - spring of truth , and of generous impulses , and of knightly magnanimity .
With him , gratitude is religion ; do him a kindness , and at the end of a lifetime he has not forgotten it .
Eat of his bread , or offer him yours , and the bond of hospitality is sealed - - a bond which is forever inviolable with him .
He loves the dark - eyed daughter of the forest , the dusky maiden of faultless form and rich attire , the pride of the tribe , the all - beautiful .
He talks to her in a low voice , at twilight of his deeds on the war - path and in the chase , and of the grand achievements of his ancestors ; and she listens with downcast eyes , " while a richer hue mantles her dusky cheek . "
Such is the Noble Red Man in print .
But out on the plains and in the mountains , not being on dress parade , not being gotten up to see company , he is under no obligation to be other than his natural self , and therefore :
He is little , and scrawny , and black , and dirty ; and , judged by even the most charitable of our canons of human excellence , is thoroughly pitiful and contemptible .
There is nothing in his eye or his nose that is attractive , and if there is anything in his hair that -- however , that is a feature which will not bear too close examination . . .
He wears no bracelets on his arms or ankles ; his hunting suit is gallantly fringed , but not intentionally ; when he does not wear his disgusting rabbit - skin robe , his hunting suit consists wholly of the half of a horse blanket brought over in the Pinta or the Mayflower , and frayed out and fringed by inveterate use .
He is not rich enough to possess a belt ; he never owned a moccasin or wore a shoe in his life ; and truly he is nothing but a poor , filthy , naked scurvy vagabond , whom to exterminate were a charity to the Creator 's worthier insects and reptiles which he oppresses .
Still , when contact with the white man has given to the Noble Son of the Forest certain cloudy impressions of civilization , and aspirations after a nobler life , he presently appears in public with one boot on and one shoe -- shirtless , and wearing ripped and patched and buttonless pants which he holds up with his left hand -- his execrable rabbit - skin robe flowing from his shoulder -- an old hoop - skirt on , outside of it -- a necklace of battered sardine - boxes and oyster - cans reposing on his bare breast -- a venerable flint - lock musket in his right hand - - a weather - beaten stove - pipe hat on , canted " gallusly " to starboard , and the lid off and hanging by a thread or two ; and when he thus appears , and waits patiently around a saloon till he gets a chance to strike a " swell " attitude before a looking - glass , he is a good , fair , desirable subject for extermination if ever there was one .
There is nothing figurative , or moonshiny , or sentimental about his language .
It is very simple and unostentatious , and consists of plain , straightforward lies .
His " wisdom " conferred upon an idiot would leave that idiot helpless indeed .
He is ignoble -- base and treacherous , and hateful in every way .
Not even imminent death can startle him into a spasm of virtue .
The ruling trait of all savages is a greedy and consuming selfishness , and in our Noble Red Man it is found in its amplest development .
His heart is a cesspool of falsehood , of treachery , and of low and devilish instincts .
With him , gratitude is an unknown emotion ; and when one does him a kindness , it is safest to keep the face toward him , lest the reward be an arrow in the back .
To accept of a favor from him is to assume a debt which you can never repay to his satisfaction , though you bankrupt yourself trying .
To give him a dinner when he is starving , is to precipitate the whole hungry tribe upon your hospitality , for he will go straight and fetch them , men , women , children , and dogs , and these they will huddle patiently around your door , or flatten their noses against your window , day aft er day , gazing beseechingly upon every mouthful you take , and unconsciously swallowing when you swallow !
The scum of the earth !
And the Noble Son of the Plains becomes a mighty hunter in the due and proper season .
That season is the summer , and the prey that a number of the tribes hunt is crickets and grasshoppers !
The warriors , old men , women , and children , spread themselves abroad in the plain and drive the hopping creatures before them into a ring of fire .
I could describe the feast that then follows , without missing a detail , if I thought the reader would stand it .
All history and honest observation will show that the Red Man is a skulking coward and a windy braggart , who strikes without warning -- usually from an ambush or under cover of night , and nearly always bringing a force of about five or six to one against his enemy ; kills helpless women and little children , and massacres th e men in their beds ; and then brags about it as long as he lives , and his son and his grandson and great - grandson after him glorify it among the " heroic deeds of their ancestors . "
A regiment of Fenians will fill the whole world with the noise of it when they are getting ready invade Canada ; but when the Red Man declares war , the first intimation his friend the white man whom he supped with at twilight has of it , is when the war - whoop rings in his ears and tomahawk sinks into his brain .
. ..
The Noble Red Man seldom goes prating loving foolishness to a splendidly caparisoned blushing maid at twilight .
No ; he trades a crippled horse , or a damaged musket , or a dog , or a gallon of grasshoppers , and an inefficient old mother for her , and makes her work like an abject slave all the rest of her life to compensate him for the outlay .
He never works himself .
She builds the habitation , when they use one ( it consists in hanging half a dozen rags over the weather side of a sage - brush bush to roost under ) ; gathers and brings home the fuel ; takes care of the raw - boned pony when they possess such grandeur ; she walks and carries her nursing cubs while he rides .
She wears no clothing save the fragrant rabbit - skin robe which her great - grandmother before her wore , and all the " blushing " she does can be removed with soap and a towel , provided it is only four or five weeks old and not caked .
Such is the genuine Noble Aborigine .
I did not get him from books , but from personal observation .

Either he was a perfect fit to begin with , or over the years he has taken on many of the characteristics of his workplace , for he now closely resembles his own magazine .
He is quite youthful looking , on one hand ( probably because he is one of those people who mature early and then never change ) , and a little old - fashioned on the other .
He speaks in perfectly turned paragraphs and may be the last person left in New York to unself - consciously use “ indeed ” as an exclamation .
Image Richard F. Snow at the offices of American Heritage , where he started in the mailroom in 1965 .
He is now the magazines editor .
 We dont play to a history buff in any narrow sense ,  he said .

He favors gray suits and sweater vests , his telephone manners are impeccable , and he has a bubbling , high - pitched voice that turns a simple “ hello ” into something that resembles the opening bar of a Broadway show tune .
Like his magazine he has an almost insatiable curiosity and is particularly expert on the Revolutionary and Civil Wars , not to mention Coney Island amusement rides at the turn of the last century .
Mr. Snow has been at American Heritage long enough that he can remember when it was an empire in the mid-’60s , employing 400 people , with the magazine as a flagship for what was in effect a publishing company selling books , many of them by some of America ’s best - known popular historians , by direct mail .
He was managing editor in 1980 , when the magazine ceased publishing in hardback ( except for subscribers who wanted to shell out extra for what Mr. Snow now calls a “ padded , leatheroid edition ” ) , and in 1982 when , bowing to economic necessity , it began soliciting ads .
“ We all felt very bad about taking advertising , ” Mr. Snow recalled .
“ But it had the odd effect of making us feel we were in touch with the world .
There was a sense of a living connection to a process that was actually sort of fun — or at least it was fun while we were getting ads . ”
American Heritage remained more driven by circulation than by ads , however .
According to Scott Masterson , a senior vice president at Forbes and president of American Heritage , the magazine was losing money when Forbes bought it in 1986 and then bounced back for a while .
But in the late ’90s , Mr. Masterson said , it failed to reap the kind of profits that many magazines did , and after 2001 it experienced the same downturn that afflicted the magazine business in general and had trouble recovering .
Part of the problem was the Internet , Mr. Snow said .
“ We ’re really a general interest magazine , ” he said .
“ We do n’t play to a history buff in any narrow sense — like the Civil War re-enactors , for example .
They can go on the Web and get thousands and thousands of hits . ”

Facebook DENVER 
A rash of squirrel deaths from plague in the middle of Colorado 's largest city has heightened surveillance for the deadly but curable disease .
No humans here have been infected with plague , the " Black Death " disease that killed millions in 14th - century Europe .
A state hotline gets 50 - 75 calls daily about dead rodents .
Chris Urbina , Denver 's health director , says the risk of catching it " is extremely low . "
ON DEADLINE :
What it does to the body and how you can protect yourself
One human case has been reported in the USA this year , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
A 49 - year - old man in San Juan County , N.M. , was hospitalized last week and is recovering .
A flu - like illness that occurs most often in lymph nodes or the blood , plague is treatable with antibiotics .
Denver 's last outbreak in rodents was nearly 40 years ago .
So far , 13 squirrels have been found dead in or near City Park , an urban playground 2 miles from the state Capitol .
Two infected squirrels and an infected rabbit were found dead in Denver suburbs .
Plague bacteria are carried by fleas that infect wild rodents , rabbits and cats , usually in rural areas .
Plague reached the USA in the 19th century in rats on ships .
It exists today only in the West , mainly in four states : New Mexico , Colorado , Arizona and California .
Infected fleas can jump onto animals or humans .
Coyotes , foxes and birds that feed on an infected carcass can transport the fleas but are resistant to plague .
John Pape , an epidemiologist for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment , suspects that is how it got into town .
He says the Denver occurrence is not an " outbreak " but warrants tracking .
City workers this week caught 17 squirrels for testing .
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases reports 10 - 20 people a year catch plague in the USA .
On average , one in seven dies .
" We 're always on watch , " says Deborah Busemeyer of the New Mexico Department of Health .
The state had an above - normal year in 2006 : Eight cases and three deaths .
Pape says plague is more common in New Mexico than Colorado , where the last death was in 2004 , one of three infections that year .
Plague season runs from April to November during periods of moisture and moderate temperature .
Among pets , dogs are resistant but cats are highly susceptible .
" Right now is a good time to keep cats inside , " says Diane Milholin , a Denver health inspector .
" Your dog is not going to get sick from a flea , but if the flea stays on the dog and decides to bite you , you could get sick . "

Gaza City
THE events in Gaza over the last few days have been described in the West as a coup .
In essence , they have been the opposite .
Eighteen months ago , our Hamas Party won the Palestinian parliamentary elections and entered office under Prime Minister Ismail Haniya but never received the handover of real power from Fatah , the losing party .
The Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , has now tried to replace the winning Hamas government with one of his own , returning Fatah to power while many of our elected members of Parliament languish in Israeli jails .
That is the real coup .
From the day Hamas won the general elections in 2006 it offered Fatah the chance of joining forces and forming a unity government .
It tried to engage the international community to explain its platform for peace .
It has consistently offered a 10 - year cease - fire with the Israelis to try to create an atmosphere of calm in which we resolve our differences .
Hamas even adhered to a unilateral cease - fire for 18 months in an effort to normalize the situation on the ground .
None of these points appear to have been recognized in the press coverage of the last few days .
Nor has it been evident to many people in the West that the civil unrest in Gaza and the West Bank has been precipitated by the American and Israeli policy of arming elements of the Fatah opposition who want to attack Hamas and force us from office .
For 18 months we have tried to find ways to coexist with Fatah , entering into a unity government , even conceding key positions in the cabinet to their and international demands , negotiating up until the last moment to try to provide security for all of our people on the streets of Gaza .
Sadly , it became apparent that not all officials from Fatah were negotiating in good faith .
There were attempts on Mr. Haniya ’s life last week , and eventually we were forced into trying to take control of a very dangerous situation in order to provide political stability and establish law and order .
Speculation has run rampant over how Apple might bring iPhone technologies to its iPod line .
Will the next generation of iPods look like the iPhone and run the same software ?
It turns out I stumbled upon the answers six months ago .
Now I 've discovered additional proof .
You ’ll be surprised to find that much of what we all thought we knew about the iPod was wrong .

The iPod ’s ARMs
Back in January , John Gruber of the Daring Fireball posted an article “ At ARM ’s Length , ” which pointed out that Apple was distinguishing between Mac OS X and the iPhone 's OS X .
He also suggested that the iPhone 's ARM processor was something Apple had n't dealt with since the 1994 - 1998 Newton Message Pads .
In the article “ Inside the iPhone : Mac OS X , ARM , and iPod OS X , ” I pointed out that the Apple has been using ARM processors since 2001 , wrapped up inside the iPod .
In fact , most iPods have two ARMs , which I coyly referenced in the headline of an article about iPod games , “ Apple ’s New Dual Processor Game Console . ”
I thought it was weird that Apple was distinguishing between Mac OS X and OS X on the iPhone ; they are really the same thing , just running on different processor architectures .
Stumbling on to Something .
I then suggested that OS X had been the secret iPod OS all along :
“ It is actually possible that iPods have used a subset of Mac OS X code for some time already , in secret .
Apple has never made any comment on what operating system existing iPods run , ever since the company moved from Pixo , the operating system that ran the very first iPods . ”
I drew a parallel between Apple 's secret maintenance of Mac OS X for Intel , which was n’t revealed until WWDC in the summer of 2005 , just six months ahead of the release of new Intel Macs in January 2006 .
“ Now , six months ahead of the iPhone ’s release , ” I wrote back in January , “ Apple may similarly be ready to reveal a parallel secret : that Mac OS X software , ported to the ARM processor architecture , has actually powered iPods for years . ”
It turns out the only thing I was really wrong about was the iPod ’s “ Pixo operating system , ” a key part of the story of the iPod and widely assumed to be a well known fact .
The problem is that it is n’t .
Pixo : Just The Icing .
Apple never officially made any announcements about the iPod ’s operating system architecture , and provides no developer documentation on how it works internally .
The idea that the iPod runs an operating system called Pixo was assembled from a variety of sources :
• Early iPods credited Pixo software in their About iPod menu .
• Pixo , Inc was founded by Paul Mercer and other developers from Apple 's Newton project .
• In 2004 , the San Francisco Chronicle reported “ Pixo was on board to help Apple create an operating system that would run the user interface of the iPod . ”
• The Connectix corporate bio of VP of Engineering Mike Neil called him the “ lead architect on the Pixo OS that is used in ... the Apple iPod . ”
It seemed well established that Apple had outsourced the iPod ’s operating system to Pixo back in 2001 in order to deliver the new device as rapidly as possible .
What had happened since was unclear , because nobody seemed to know anything about Pixo or anything else inside the iPod , apart from its headline generating batteries .
Was the iPod Even an Apple Product ?
Apple critics liked giving the credit for the iPod ’s success to anyone else apart from Apple , resulting in the legend that iPod was carried by Pixo .
As one blogger wrote , “ The more that is divulged about the history of the iPod , the more we understand that Apple merely aggregated various pieces of technology . ”
The Chronicle article about Pixo cited Paul Saffo , director of Menlo Park 's Institute for the Future as proclaiming that “ the fact that Apple went to Pixo suggests ‘ that they tried it inside and failed . ’ ”
If the iPod ’s success hinged upon Pixo , why has n’t the company or its other clients done anything interesting ?
Pixo ended up getting bought up by Sun , which certainly has n’t shipped anything like the iPod.
Sun acquired Pixo for its mobile Java download server .
Mercer went on to develop the interface for Samsung ’s Z5 , which went nowhere before becoming a casualty of the Zune after Microsoft abruptly abandoned its PlaysForSure partners .
This March , Mercer was hired as part of Palm Inc. ’s iPhone defense panic .
Perhaps the iPod ’s success did have something to do with Apple after all .
It turns out that Pixo is n't really an operating system ; it ’s a graphics and user input layer for mobile devices , similar to the X Window System for Unix or the Mac 's Quartz graphics and window management layer , although obviously Pixo is much simpler .
i Pod Digging .
If Pixo is n’t running the whole show inside the iPod , is is possible that Apple actually contributed some work toward the device ’s success itself ?
[ Update : reader Gavin Lynch found this diagram of the Pixo architecture hiding in the Internet Archive ’s Wayback Machine :]
[ Update : This passage was regarded by many readers as being poorly written , and “ incomprehensibly obtuse in its intermingling of serious points and irony . ”
To rescue the message from its presentation , I have struck out everything that alluded to Tim Monroe ’s spoof .
What remains is intended as a serious article .
I apologize to anyone who received the original article as confusing or misleading .
It was not intended as such . ]

Oh dear , it turns out the iPod is running Mac OS X -- with a Mach kernel and a Unix userland -- and has been for years .
Add another +100 million iPods to the list of Mac OS X powered devices on the planet .
The Windows Enthusiasts are not going to like this !
After years of spoofs about running Mac OS X on the iPod , from a macoshints.com April Fools Joke in 2005 , to the fake YouTube video regularly unearthed to titillate the readers of Digg , it turns out that truth was that iPods have been running OS X all along .
Or at least that makes for a good story .
The OS X iPod .
Of course , the iPod is n't a high powered device ; various models only have 32 - 64 MB of RAM .
That means the iPod can't handle Quartz graphics , which is why it ’s running Pixo ’s graphics layer instead .
In contrast , the iPhone can run Quartz and the rest of Mac OS X within its 128 MB of system RAM and its 700 MB of consumed Flash .
That helps explain why Steve Jobs keeps calling the iPhone “ the best iPod we 've ever made . ”
It is n't just marketing fluff about the iPhone having some music playback features ; the iPhone actually is an iPod , built using the same ARM processor architecture as the iPod and the Mach and Unix based OS derived from Mac OS X .
Tim Monroe , a member of Apple 's QuickTime engineering team , outed this secret years ago in an issue of MacTech .
That article was forwarded to me by Layne Lee , a reader in Korea .
It was indeed an April Fools joke .
Monroe [ update : in his April Fools joke ] pointed out that the original iPods 's applications were built using a scripting language called SNOJOB , a version of the SNOBOL language with bindings to the Pixo imaging system .
He went on to explain how users can write their own iPod applications .
The OS X iPhone .
Over the last several years , that potential for custom iPod applications went untapped , despite the deployment of over 100,000,000 iPods .
Either that , or SNOJOB was too difficult .
That may have played a factor in Apple 's decision to leave the iPhone closed for custom development , but more likely , Apple never intended custom development for the iPod or the iPhone .
Seeing the success of the iPod as an appliance , Apple moved ahead its plans to deploy the iPhone in the same way .
Since it incorporates a rich interface with WiFi access and mobile voice and data connectivity , the iPhone has found a lot more interest among developers .
A number of developers targeting the Enterprise are deploying web - based applications for it , and hackers are trying to find their way inside to install their own apps .
There has even been considerable interest in spoofing the activation process in order to use the iPhone as a full featured wireless web browsing iPod .
The Future of OS X .
Apple is n't just ahead of the game in mobile phones with the iPhone .
It has a complete mobile and embedded software platform that is turning heads in a number of industries .
Just as Mac OS X delivered -- years ahead of schedule -- what Microsoft promised to ship with Vista , Apple ’s OS X is actually doing what Microsoft promised but failed to do over a decade of WinCE development .
Looking at the range of specific applications Microsoft has promised for WinCE in automotive and handheld devices gives some inkling of the market Apple can grab with OS X .
Given how much attention the iPhone has already captured , and how badly Windows Mobile and its WinCE foundation have performed in the market , it would appear Apple has a lot of potential for new growth in 2008 .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Fewer companies ' stock prices are as affected by product news as Apple Inc.'s , and the initial iPhone activation numbers from AT&T Inc. were enough to send Apple 's stock down more than 6 % in Tuesday trading .
Apple Inc. shares took a hit after AT&T issued what many saw as disappointing activation numbers for Apple 's iPhone for the last two days of the second quarter , when the device first went on sale .
In its second - quarter earnings report Tuesday morning , AT&T said it activated about 146,000 customers who bought the iPhone during those two days .
In addition , a telecommunications analyst issued a report before the opening bell that said demand for the device at retail outlets has seen a " significant decline " in recent days .
The news took some wind out of Apple 's AAPL , - 0.75 % shares , which set a fresh all - time high of $ 144.18 on Friday .
By the time the market closed Tuesday , Apple 's stock had fallen $ 8.81 a share to close at $ 134.89 .
See a video analysis of Apple 's stock fall .
Anticipation over the iPhone was so intense that Apple 's stock surged more than 40 % since the company first announced the device at a trade show in early January .
The stock has even risen 16 % since June 18 , when Apple announced better battery performance for the iPhone nearly two weeks before it made its debut .
The iPhone went on sale at retail outlets operated by Apple and AT&T on June 29 , leaving less than two full days of sales before the end of the second quarter .
Numbers underwhelm projections
On a conference call to discuss AT&T 's results , Chief Financial Officer Rick Lindner said iPhone sales expectations " were certainly high , " but that demand for the device continues to be strong .
" The much - anticipated iPhone launch went very well , " Lindner said .
" We continue to see traffic levels in our stores above historical levels . "
AT&T 's 146,000 activation number would not include buyers who purchased the device with the hopes to re-sell it through venues such as Craigslist and eBay .
However , the figure seemed to worry investors who had been primed to expect much larger numbers .
See full story .
Before Tuesday , analysts had been projecting opening - weekend sales for the iPhone of between 200,000 and 400,000 units .
A few projections reached as high as 500,000 units , with analysts citing long lines at stores and initial inventory figures for the device .

Andy Hargreaves , of Pacific Crest Securities , said in an interview that the AT&T report was " a reality check on what was realistic to expect " from the initial release of iPhone .
Demand was seen as strong due to months of Apple 's building up anticipation for the iPhone and long lines outside of Apple and AT&T stores , in front of which some people camped out for days to ensure they would get one of the $ 499 or $ 599 devices as soon as they went on sale .
But Hargreaves said the AT&T numbers " still have a little bit of confusion in them , " and may not completely give a full picture of how iPhone sales did over that first weekend .
Many consumers said they were buying iPhones in order to re-sell them , which would n't be reflected in AT&T 's activation numbers , and Hargreaves reiterated that there were barely one - and - a - half days of iPhone sales to be included in the quarterly results .
Hargreaves holds an outperform rating on Apple 's stock .
" It still does n't change my perception of the launch of the iPhone , " said Hargreaves , who anticipates Apple will report iPhone sales of above 200,000 units and give a fuller picture of its results when the company delivers its third - quarter earnings report on Wednesday .

Analyst notes ' thin demand '
" We have noticed decent inventories [ of the iPhone ] at stores , and thin demand at best , " analyst Ittai Kidron of CIBC World Markets wrote in a report Tuesday .
" In fact , most Apple store visitors were not looking at the device and only a very small subset bought it . "
Kidron based his findings on " store checks . "
He also noted a recent survey of buyers of the device found that its key drawback is " poor data connectivity " that affects how quickly users can access and use the Internet over the device .
The iPhone works over AT&T's T , - 0.28 % EDGE network for data , which is slower than other so - called 3G networks that are coming online in markets around the world .
Because of his findings , Kidron expects Apple to release a 3G version of the iPhone before this year 's holiday season .
Apple has given no indications of when or if it will update the device .
" With the weakness , we would n't be surprised to see AT&T and Apple step up their marketing efforts , " he wrote .
In addition to the iPhone numbers from AT&T , the iPhone was clouded by reports that it could be hacked into in Wi-Fi hotspots or at some Web sites , due to security glitches in the device .

Starting as a series of crudely drawn shorts on " The Tracy Ullman Show , " " The Simpsons " debuted as its own series on Dec. 17 , 1989 .
It has since reached iconic status both in American culture and around the world .
With 18 seasons under its belt , the show has produced more than 400 episodes .
It 's the longest - running sitcom in history , earning 23 Emmy awards during its time on the air [ Source : MSNBC ] .
" The Simpsons " has generated more than $ 2.5 billion in revenue , from advertising to merchandise , and Time Magazine named the show the best TV series of the 20th century [ Source : TIME ] .
So , with all the popularity , it makes you wonder , " Why is the movie just coming out now instead of years ago ? "
The answer is as simple as Homer Simpson 's character ; the timing was never right and the script just was n't good enough .

The folks behind " The Simpsons " started thinking about doing a movie back in 1990 , but they never could seem to move beyond the idea stage .
Over the years , " The Simpsons " creators tossed around many concepts .
The story behind an episode titled " Kamp Krusty " was originally going to be the premise of the film , but the team could n't get a full - length script together .
Ultimately , " Kamp Krusty " turned into the season four premiere .
After the " Kamp Krusty " movie idea fell through , one of the more interesting concepts " Simpsons " creator Matt Groening considered was " Simpstasia , " a parody of Walt Disney 's " Fantasia . "
Again , the script proved to be too unwieldy to make into a full - length feature .
There just was n't enough time to get it done .
The crew works on the series full - time , year - round .
In 2001 , Groening finally got serious about putting a film together .
The cast signed on to do the movie and in 2003 , the writers began working on the script .
For the next two years , the writers created at least 100 drafts , making innumerable tweaks .
In fact , the producers made a deal with FOX Studios stating they could abandon the script , and the project altogether , if they did n't achieve the results they wanted [ Source : The New York Times ] .
To the delight of Simpsons fans everywhere , they did n't abandon the script , and in 2005 , the cast conducted the first table reading .
But what was in the scripts they read ?
What 's the movie about ?
Very few people know the answer to that question .
The secrecy behind the film is the stuff of legend .
Mike Scully , one of the co-writers , told Variety , " We 've taken the script to the point of lunacy , " [ Source : Variety ] .
After each table reading , the producers personally shredded every copy of the script .
And to throw the press off track , the writers themselves are leaking false information .
If you hear that Marge takes the kids and leaves Homer , or Homer decimates the entire town of Springfield in an accident at the nuclear plant , you may want to take those rumors with a grain of salt .
One rumor currently making rounds has to do with Bart 's virginity and another has Homer housing an obscene amount of pig waste in his backyard [ Source : MSNBC ] .
While one rumor is utterly outrageous , the other is fairly plausible .
With stories like these , the plot will be anything but boring .
To fill theater seats , most movies need some kind of marketing push .
" The Simpsons Movie " is no different .
But how do you promote a film without giving away clues ?
In the next section , we 'll look at how the producers worked to make this movie " the least hyped and the most anticipated " of the summer [ Source : MSNBC ] .

If you had n’t heard , the Nisshin Maru ( a Japanese whaling vessel ) had a serious fire on Thursday ( one sailor was killed ) and it appears that the ship may now be immobile .
A Greenpeace ship ( the Esper - anza ) was in the neighborhood specifically because of the whaling activities of the Nisshin Maru ; they are now offering to help ( evacuating the crew , and towing the Nisshin Maru to a dock ) , and may indeed be the closest ship in a position to do so .
Japanese officials ( and presumably at least some of the crew ) have serious misgivings about accepting aid from sworn enemies , and so the Nisshin Maru sits there while people argue over the next step .
Given that the Nisshin Maru is very close to , e.g. , a major penguin colony , it would almost certainly be a Bad Thing , however , if something nasty like a major oil leak happened while people debated the matter .
One advantage , I suppose , of very publicly doing something pretty unpleasant ( i.e. , killing whales ) is that there will always be people watching , which means that help is never far off if something goes wrong :-) .
Now they just need to stop their whining and accept the help that ’s there .

The most common substance in the universe is called dark matter .
It does n’t shine or reflect light .
We ca n’t even see it .
Image right :
This Hubble Space Telescope composite image shows a ghostly " ring " of dark matter in the galaxy cluster Cl 0024+17 .
The ring - like structure is evident in the blue map of the cluster 's dark matter distribution .
The map is superimposed on a Hubble image of the cluster .
The ring is one of the strongest pieces of evidence to date for the existence of dark matter , an unknown substance that pervades the universe .

It is an invisible substance composed of atoms that are far different from those that make up the universe ’s normal matter , such as stars and galaxies .
In fact , if you drove into a wall made of dark matter , you would n’t crack a headlight or inflate an airbag .
You would n’t even know it happened .
But what happens to dark matter during a collision ?
Astronomers using NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope got a first - hand view of how dark matter behaves during a titanic collision between two galaxy clusters .
The wreck created a ripple of dark matter , which is somewhat similar to a ripple formed in a pond when a rock hits the water .
The ring 's discovery is among the strongest evidence yet that dark matter exists .
Astronomers have long suspected the existence of the invisible substance as the source of additional gravity that holds together galaxy clusters .
Such clusters would fly apart if they relied only on the gravity from their visible stars .
Although astronomers do n't know what dark matter is made of , they hypothesize that it is a type of elementary particle that pervades the universe .
The ring - like structure is evident in a composite image of the cluster made from Hubble observations .
The ring can be seen in the blue map of the cluster ’s dark matter distribution , which is superimposed on an image of the cluster .
The Hubble astronomers say it is the first time they have detected dark matter as having a unique structure that is different from the gas and galaxies in the cluster .
The researchers spotted the ring unexpectedly while they were mapping the distribution of dark matter within the galaxy cluster Cl 0024+17 ( ZwCl 0024+1652 ) , located 5 billion light - years from Earth .
The ring measures 2.6 million light - years across .
Image left :
This rich galaxy cluster , catalogued as Cl 0024+17 , is allowing astronomers to probe the distribution of dark matter in space .
The blue streaks near the center of the image are the smeared images of very distant galaxies that are not part of the cluster .
The distant galaxies appear distorted because their light is being bent and magnified by the powerful gravity of Cl 0024+17 , an effect called gravitational lensing .

Although astronomers cannot see dark matter , they can infer its existence in galaxy clusters by observing how its gravity bends the light of more distant background galaxies , a powerful effect called gravitational lensing .
The blue streaks near the center of another Hubble image of the cluster are the distorted shapes of more distant galaxies , whose light was bent and magnified by the powerful gravity of Cl 0024+17 .
The collision between the two galaxy clusters , the astronomers explained , created a ripple of dark matter that left distinct footprints in the shapes of the background galaxies .
It 's like looking at the pebbles on the bottom of a pond with ripples on the surface .
The pebbles ' shapes appear to change as the ripples pass over them .
So , too , the background galaxies behind the ring show coherent changes in their shapes due to the presence of the dense ring .
Although the invisible matter has been found before in other galaxy clusters , astronomers say it has never been detected to be so largely separated from the hot gas and the galaxies that make up galaxy clusters .
The astronomers found previous research that suggested the cluster had collided with another cluster 1 to 2 billion years ago .
They then created computer simulations of galaxy cluster collisions .
The simulations show that when the two clusters smash together , the dark matter falls to the center of the combined cluster and sloshes back out .
As the dark matter moves outward , it begins to slow down under the pull of gravity and pile up , like cars bunched up on a freeway .
For some time I had been looking for a mutual exclusion algorithm that satisfied my complete list of desirable properties .
I finally found one -- the N ! - bit algorithm described in this paper .
The algorithm is wildly impractical , requiring N! bits of storage for N processors , but practicality was not one of my requirements .
So , I decided to publish a compendium of everything I knew about the theory of mutual exclusion .
The 3 - bit algorithm described in this paper came about because of a visit by Michael Rabin .
He is an advocate of probabilistic algorithms , and he claimed that a probabilistic solution to the mutual exclusion problem would be better than a deterministic one .
I believe that it was during his brief visit that we came up with a probabilistic algorithm requiring just three bits of storage per processor .
Probabilistic algorithms do n't appeal to me .
( This is a question of aesthetics , not practicality . )
So later , I figured out how to remove the probability and turn it into a deterministic algorithm .
-- Lamport
3N vs. N !
Some folks just are n't comfortable with probablistic algorithms .
Lamport here clearly knows what he is doing , but still has aesthetic problems with them .
In some people 's minds , algorithms should be proveably correct at all times and for all inputs ( as with defect - free programming and formal methods ) .
Probabilistic algorithms give up this property .
There is always a chance that the algorithm will produce a false result .
But this chance can be made as small as desired .
If the chance of the software failing is made smaller than the chance of the hardware failing ( or of the user spontaneously combusting , or whatever ) , there 's little to worry about .
-- Bruce Schneier in Dr. Dobb's Journal
The common practical case I run into with coders is that they 're unfamiliar with figuring how how big a hash they need to " not worry about " collisions .
Here 's the rule of thumb .
MD5 Quickie Tutorial
Suppose you 're using something like MD5 ( the GOD of HASH ) .
MD5 takes any length string of input bytes and outputs 128 bits .
The bits are consistently random , based on the input string .
If you send the same string in twice , you 'll get the exact same random 16 bytes coming out .
But if you make even a tiny change to the input string -- even a single bit change -- you 'll get a completely different output hash .
So when do you need to worry about collisions ?
The working rule - of - thumb here comes from the birthday paradox .
Basically you can expect to see the first collision after hashing 2n / 2 items , or 2^64 for MD5 .
2^64 is a big number .
If there are 100 billion urls on the web , and we MD5'd them all , would we see a collision ?
Well no , since 100,000,000,000 is way less than 2^64 :
18,446,744,073,709,551,616 2^64 100,000,000,000 < 2^37
( Another way of putting this is that the expected number of collisions from hasing a set of size 2^k bit strings hashed to m bit strings will be 22 k - m collisions . [ 1 ] )
Other MD5 tips & tricks
Unique ID generation
Say you want to create a set of fixed - sized IDs based on chunks of text -- urls , for example .
Urls can be long , with 100 + bytes common .
They 're varying sizes too .
But md5 ( url ) is 16 bytes , consistently , and you 're unlikely to ever have a collision , so it 's safe to use the md5 as an ID for the URL .
Checksums
Do n't trust your disk or your OS to properly detect errors for you .
The CRC and protocol checksums they use are weak and bad data can get delivered .
Instead , bring out an industrial strength checksum and protect your own data .
MD5 your data before you stuff it onto the disk , check the MD5 when you read it .
save_to_disk ( data , md5 ( data ) ) ... ( data , md5 ) = read_from_disk ( ) if ( md5 ( data ) != md5 ) read_error
This kind of paranoia is healthy for code -- your module does n't have to trust the teetering stack of plates if it 's doing it 's own end - to - end consistency check .
Password security Suppose you 're writing a web app and you 're going to have users login .
They sign up with an account name and a password .
How do you store the password ?
You could store the password in your database , " in the clear " .
But this should be avoided .
If your site is hacked , someone could get a giant list of usernames and passwords .
So instead , store md5 ( password ) in the database .
When a user tries to login , take the password they entered , md5 it , and then check it against what is in the database .
The process can then forget the cleartext password they entered .
If the site is hacked , no one can recover the list of passwords .
Even employees are protected from casually seeing other people 's passwords while debugging .
If you do n't store the password , how can you email it to someone if they forget it ?
Instead of emailing the user their forgotten password , instead invent a new , random password , store the md5 of it in the database , and email the new random password to the user .
If a site can email you your original password , it 's storing it in the clear in its database .
Tisk , tisk .
Hash table addressing
There are whole chapters of textbooks devoted to the pitfalls and difficulties of writing hash addressing algorithms .
Because most of these algorithms are weak , they require you to rejigger your hash table size to be relatively prime to your original hash table size when you expand it .
Forget that nonsense .
MD5 is n't a weak hash function and you do n't need to worry about that stuff .
MD5 your key and have your table size be a power of 2 .
As an engineer , your table sizes should be powers of 2 anyway .
Leave the primes to the academics .
Random number generation
The typical library RNG available is n't generally very good .
For the same reason that you want your hashes to be randomly distributed , you want your random numbers to actually be random , and not to have some underlying mathematical structure showing through .
Having random numbers that can't be guessed or predicted can be surprisingly useful .
MD5 based sequence numbers were a solution for the TCP sequence number guessing attacks .
I also recall some players of an old online game who broke the game 's RNG , and could predict the outcome of upcoming battles .
The library RNG was known , the entire seed state was 32 bits , which was easy to plow throuh to find the seed the game was using .
Solution : a stronger RNG , with more internal state , that can't be predicted .
Here is an md5 - based RNG that I wrote some time ago .
What if you need more than 16 bytes ?
You can use SHA1 or SHA256 , which generate 160 and 256 bits of output , respectively .
Or you can chain hashes together to get an arbitrary amount of output material : a = md5 (s . ' 0 ' ) b = md5(s . ' 1 ' )
Because md5 is cryptographically secure , this is safe .
You can make as many unique 16 byte hashes from an input string as you want .
md5(' Rich Skrenta ' ) = 15ddc636 023977a2 22c3423d a5e8 fbee md5(' Rich Skrenta0 ' ) = 4343e346 b4036f80 7015847d cf983010 md5(' Rich Skrenta1 ' ) = da79412d c52c47b4 fa7848e4 54f89614
I heard MD5 was broken and you should use SHA For cryptographic purposes , MD5 and SHA have both been broken such that a sophisticated attacker can create multiple documents that intentionally hash to the same value .
But for practical uses like hash tables , decent RNGs , and unique ID generation , these algorithms maintain their full utility .
The alternatives considered are often non-secure CRCs or hashes anyway , so a cryptographic hash weakness is not a concern .
If you 're concerned about some nefarious actor leaving data around designed to deliberately cause hash collisions in your algorithm , throw a secret salt onto the end beginning of the material that you 're hashing : hash = md5 (s . ' xyzzy ' ) [ good point ] hash = md5 ( ' xyzzy ' . s)
Is n't MD5 overkill ?
Folks sometimes say MD5 is " overkill " for a lot of these applications .
But it 's good , cheap , strong , and it works .
It 's not going to cause you problems if you use it .
You 're not going to ever have to debug it or second guess it .
If you have perf problems , and suspect MD5 , and then go profile your code , it 's not going to be MD5 that 's causing your problems .
You 're going to find that it was something else .
But if you feel you absolutely must leave the path and look for some faster hashes , check out Bob Jenkins ' site .
[ Also see the Hsieh hash , it looks very good . ]
How fast is MD5 ?
About as fast as your disk or network transfer rate .
Algorithm Size MB/s MD4 128 165.0 MD5 128 98.8 SHA - 1 160 58.9
These are 2004 numbers from the perl Digest implementation .
Be happy and love the MD5 .

Surgery
This human skull was discovered in 1995 among the relics of the Dawenkou culture which lasted for 1,500 years some 6,100 years ago .
A hole which is 3.1 by 2.5 cm wide can be seen at the back of the skull .
It is believed that this skull belongs to an adult male .
The circular arc on the edge of the hole appears to have grown naturally after some modifications and bone tissue repair was done .
Experts believe that the owner of this skull managed to survive the operation and live for quite a while after that .
This proves that the operation was a success .
The fact that this surgical operation was performed successfully during such an un-technological age is just incredible .
It might just be the earliest successful brain operation performed on a human .

From an ocean of 165 submissions , five fish clambered onto the terra firma of victory – and one may get to reproduce
Listen up .
Loads and loads of people ( Who knew our readers were such a talented and witty bunch ? ) wanted to add their own descendants to the Darwin Fish Car Emblem family , and they kicked their creativity into fifth gear to secure a spot on the tree .
Getting submissions ( see them here : Your Chance to Be an Intelligent Designer ) for this contest has been the single most entertaining part of my day for the past two weeks .
Some were as pointed as BBQ skewers ( Dave Becker ’s # 5 Fish Massage , # 12 Another Pooping Fish , # 97 Kiss My Evolved Ass Fish ) .
Others came out of left field ( # 29 Jump the Shark Fish , # 91 The Dancing Fish , # 125 The Magic Fish or # 159 The Visa Fish ) .
A handful were educational ( # 37 Tiktaalik Fish , # 61 Relativity Fish , # 74 Toxic Fish ) .
An entire school of play - on - words fish made it our way ( # 7 Fish Oil , # 9 Fish Tank ) .
Some were cultish ( # 57 Witch Fish , # 89 Answer to Everything Fish ) and a large number of them gave kudos to other non-Darwin scientists ( # 21 Wallace Fish , # 22 Russell Teapot Fish , # 39 Huxley Fish , # 41 Lamarckian Fish , # 42 Uncertainty Fish ) .
( By the way , if you ’re late to the party , these numbers refer to fish designs in the original story .
Check ’em out . )
Competition – that age - old driver of evolution – was tough .
But whatever mysterious force guided our judges ’ hands was hard at work .
We ’re very proud to announce that the winner is the very yummy Fish Food by Godfrey Temple ( # 78 ) .
Next up is Pekka Strandroth ’s Skepfish ( # 84 ) .
In third place is Amy Prostko ’s “ Opposable Thumbs Up for Evolution ” Fish ( #150 ) .
Tied for fourth are the Ribbon Fish by Tom E. ( # 81 ) and Dean Macaulay ’s Evolution Fish ( #86 and # 87 ) .
Judges , you did a wonderful job and we ’re very grateful that joined in the fun .
“ Yummy ! ” says Nona Williams from Ring of Fire designs .
“ We ’re interested in manufacturing the fish food emblem and we ’d like to discuss that possibility with the designer . ”
So here ’s to us sticking that scrumptious little fishie on bumpers across the nation .
Eat it up and make it happen readers !!
Let ’s move this debate out of the Bible and onto our plates .
Nona ’s also very interested in developing the DNA Fish ( which got the popular vote and garnered comments like “ DNA Fish kicks ass ! " ) , which did n’t make it into the winner ’s circle .
Finally , a large and hearty thank you to everyone who sent us their talented artwork .
It was a delight from start to finish and we stand wholly impressed .
Your fans ,

The UN has faced a string of abuse allegations against peacekeepers
The UN said a unit of its contingent in Bouake , a northern rebel stronghold , had been confined to base .
It has confirmed that some Moroccan troops are under investigation .
Claims of sexual abuse have been made against UN troops on various missions , prompting ex-UN chief Kofi Annan to declare a " zero tolerance " policy .
' Utterly immoral '
" There have been crimes such as rape , paedophilia and human trafficking , " he said in December 2006 , shortly before leaving office .
He said sexual exploitation and abuse were " utterly immoral " and at odds with the UN mission , and would be punished .
Sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeeping personnel hit the headlines in 2004 after a UN report detailed widespread abuse in the DR Congo involving UN troops .
More than 300 members of UN peacekeeping missions around the world have been investigated for sexual exploitation and abuse since 2004 , including some stationed in Congo , Cambodia and Haiti .
A UN statement said the latest allegations had been uncovered by an internal inquiry , and a full investigation was now under way .
" But due to the serious nature of the allegations , the United Nations has taken the decision to suspend all activities of the contingent and has cantoned the unit within its base , " it said .
UN SEXUAL ABUSE SCANDALS 2003 - Nepalese troops accused of sexual abuse while serving in DR Congo .
Six are later jailed 2004 - Two UN peacekeepers repatriated after being accused of abuse in Burundi 2005 - UN troops accused of rape and sexual abuse in Sudan 2006 - UN personnel accused of rape and exploitation on missions is Haiti and Liberia 2007 - UN launches probe into sexual abuse claims in Ivory Coast
The exact nature of the alleged offences has not been officially disclosed , but they are believed to involve sex with underage girls .
About 9,000 troops serve under the UN in Ivory Coast , which has been split between areas controlled by government and rebel forces .
The UN Security Council this week voted to extend the mission until January , in the hope that it can help create the conditions for elections , that have repeatedly been delayed .
According to the UN website , troops in Bouake come from Morocco , Pakistan , Bangladesh and Ghana .
The UN has confined its entire force in the town to barracks .
It is a sign of how seriously the UN is taking these latest accusations , says the BBC's Peter Miles .
At first this might not sound like the most ideal task , but in reality it absolutely is .
If you think about it , every single festivity in a wedding revolves around the exchange of these sacred rings .
Not only can you make this task fun , but you will come out a hero in he eyes of your “ bride to be ” and all her family .
If executed properly , you will also have a romantic story to share with loved ones for decades to come .
This task involves the purchase of both the diamond engagement ring and the subsequent wedding bands .
You do n’t buy them all at once , so this task is really a two part process .
Certain steps in the process might seem a little extravagant or bazaar to some people .
But just remember , I ’ve been there , done that , and I ’m extremely content with the end result .
So while everyone is entitled to their opinion , my advice is from firsthand experience .
Your first step is the worst step , but you have to handle it .
You must do some simple research on Blue Nile .
All of the info you will need in order to make an educated engagement ring purchase is on this site , including solid price points that can be used when you shop .
A NY Times editorial on Blue Nile can be found here .
Do n’t waste your time on all the flashy female driven wedding ring sites … most of them are a complete piss in the wind .
You want the facts and Blue Nile delivers these facts .
You can also read this , this or this for a little extra credit research only if you feel like being diligent .
Take a trip to New York City with a couple of your buddies or male family members .
You are going to buy her engagement ring from the shops in the New York City diamond exchange district on West 47th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan .
Just inform your lady that you are going on a business trip or attending to some form of family business affair .
If you plan ahead and set things up in advance , she ’ll never suspect a thing .
If you ’re worried about lying to her , get over it .
Believe me that when the time comes , not only will she understand , she will be ecstatic with your romantic efforts .
Here ’s why the NYC idea makes sense :
You can wheel and deal with the diamond exchange merchants using the price points and education you gained from Blue Nile .
The merchants are used to bargaining and they will come down in price when they realize that you are serious about the purchase .
The process of bargaining alone can be a crap - load of fun and rather hilarious at times .
It certainly beats the heck out of talking to an old boring saleswoman at the local jeweler .
There are an abundance of shops and a plethora of ring choices which guarantees that you are going to find something you really like at the price you want to spend .
Matching different settings with different diamonds can actually be pretty interesting , and you will begin to realize that the four C’s ( cut / color / clarity / carat ) ratings that you read about on Blue Nile were n’t a bunch of bullshit after all .
The ring you build in NYC wo n’t be sitting in the case at your local jewelry store either .
Even if there is a particular style that your beloved has already mentioned she likes , the diamond exchange merchants will have four thousand variations of that style from which you can choose .
The ring will be unique , and all her female family members and friends will notice it as such .
Not to mention , she will love the fact that you went to such great lengths to customize her ring .
Look around , you ’re in freakin’ New York City !
Picking out the engagement ring will take a total of a few hours of bargaining over the course two or three days .
The remainder of the time is a “ vacation with the boys ” in one of the coolest cities in the world .
It will be the only vacation you ever take with your male counterparts that can be flipped around and told as a romantic story to loved ones .
And if you really think about it , it is actually romantic .
You ventured out on a lengthy voyage to pick out the perfect engagement ring for the woman you love .
Once you have popped the question and revealed to your beloved the great journey that you embarked on in order to build the precious diamond ring she has already fallen in love with , suggest another trip to NYC .
This time the two of you will take a romantic weekend getaway to the city and choose your wedding bands together .
It will be fun for the both of you and the trip will double as a vacation .
You already know the ropes so you ’ll look like the expert .
And if you ’re really smart , you can even head back to the same merchant that you purchased her engagement ring from .
Because you are a loyal repeat customer , they might be inclined to give out a little discount on the wedding bands .
I strongly recommend this wedding ring purchasing process to every “ groom to be ” that is about to embark on the journey of marriage .
I know it sounds a little pricey , but just remember that even though you will be dropping extra cash on travel arrangements , you will be getting way more ring for your money .
The diamond merchants will even FedEX the rings to you via insured air shipping which allows you to avoid paying sales tax on your purchase .
( F.Y.I. – I found the engagement ring I liked at Allure Diamond , which is where I ended up making my purchases . )
Good luck out there …
Next week I ’ll continue the series by posting some more heroic wedding tasks for the groom that he will actually enjoy .

リンク許諾制やディープリンク禁止方針の汚染源はWebデザイナーではないかという、これまで憶測で語られてきたことの傍証が発掘されたと言えよう。
と書いているのですが、私は別の印象を持ったというお話。高木氏のエントリに対する感想を書くときにははこういうのばかりなので、粘着君みたいに思われているかもしれませんが、日ごろはいろいろと勉強させていただいている恩返しのつもりで、書いてみます。
まず、ひとつ誤解されていると思われるのは、WebデザイナーやWebページの制作会社が行っている仕事は、基本的にはWebページの体裁のデザインや、前もって準備されたテキストの埋め込み作業であって、テキストの中身を書くということはまずありません。というか、書けないでしょう。サイトポリシーとかは顧客にとっても書きにくいものなので、委託先にお任せというパターンが多いであろうという推測が働いている、もしくはそういう言い訳をする会社が多いということなのかもしれませんが、受託先の立場からすると、ポリシーや規約の部分は下手をすれば法的なリスクを抱え込む箇所なので、むしろ絶対に請け負いたくないし、自分たちではやりたくない部分です。少なくとも私がやるとしたら。
しかしながら、それでもやってくれと顧客から依頼された場合に出来ませんと言って毅然とした態度をとるのは、フィクションの中だけの話で、その先に待っているのは契約解除という会社にとっては最悪のシナリオです。それを避けつつ受託側が抱えるリスクを最小限に抑えようとした時に、どういう行動をとるのかというのを、お金が無い場合とある場合に分けて考えてみます。
まず、お金が無い場合。ひとつの選択肢として、高木氏が指摘したように、適当な他のサイトのポリシーをコピーしてしまうという方法が考えれますが、これは2つの理由で可能性が低いと思っています。1つは、曲がりなりにも著作物を扱う個人や会社が他のサイトからのパクリを行うということは極力避けるだろうという倫理的な理由。もう1つは、もしそれをやって何か問題が生じ、追求されたときに「あれは、どこそこのサイトに書いてあったものをそのまま使ったんです」ということになると、言い訳が立たないというリスクマネジメント的な理由です。こうした、お金が無いケースで通常とりそうな次善の策として私が真っ先に思いつくのは、それなりに信頼のおけそうな文例を探すという方法です。こういう発想に至るはずだという感覚は、ひょっとすると理解しがたいかもしれませんが、会社組織であれば、ごく自然な流れだと考えています。例えば、そういうのと最も縁遠そうに思える零細企業の場合（うちの会社とか）でも、会社設立時の定款、各種契約書、果ては業務メールの書き方に至るまで、少しでも注意が必要な文章を作成する際には、日常的に文例のお世話になります。定款や契約書の作成は すべからく すべての企業がこなしている作業なので、ほとんどの企業でそうした習慣が身についているはずであり、そうした企業がサイトポリシーの作成を行わなければならなくなった場合にはまず文例を探すはずだ、というわけです。逆に企業の規模が大きい場合で、サイトポリシーの作成ということになれば、会社の法務部なり、事務なりの普段そうした文書を書きなれている部署に相談するでしょう。この手の例文集は、法律系の方々が公開して下さっていたり、○○弁護士監修といったうたい文句があるので、パクリとは雲泥の差ですし、こうした手法をとれば、何か問題が生じても「どこそこの例文集をベースにしてたんですが…」と言い訳が立ちます。というか、普通は確認ないし検収時にこれこれを参考にしました、と言って了承を得るでしょう。この説の根拠として、手元の文例集(有料)にあるちょっと特徴的な言い回しであるところの、「本サイトがリンク先として設定されているホームページ」で検索をかけた結果を挙げておきます。高木氏が示した検索結果と非常に良く似た検索結果が現れるのが分かると思います。ちなみに、私の手元の文例集には高木氏の示した文章そのものというのは見つからなかったということは付記しておきます。
次に、お金がある、または出る場合ですが、これはもっと単純で、基本的には司法書士（かな？）なりなんなりの専門家に外注してしまうでしょう。発注元は、Webページ制作の受託会社かもしれませんし、委託側がポリシーの制作だけ別途専門家に外注するかもしれません。
以上のような考えを元に、私が高木氏のページを読んで想像したもうひとつのシナリオは以下のようなものです。
東芝テクノネットワークは、法律の専門家にサイトポリシーの制作を依頼した 専門家は「※御社の規定によって下記の２つよりお選びください」付きの文書を納品した
東芝テクノネットワークは、その文書をそのままWebページ制作会社に渡した
Webページ制作会社は、そのまま掲載した
あくまで想像に過ぎませんが、ありそうだと思いませんか？これならば、掲載された文章が「御社の規定によって…」となっていることにも説明がつきます。Webページ制作会社が発注したとすると、注意書きが「依頼主（東芝テクノネットワーク）の規定によって…」となるはずなので、その可能性は除外しました。もうひとつ、このシナリオでは、依頼主が「ポリシーの記載内容については、委託先にお任せしていた」と言ったとしても、「委託先」の指す対象がWebページの制作会社ではなく専門家だったというだけで、嘘にはならないというトリックが成立します。
で、まあ何が書きたかったかというと、決め付けちゃうのはまずいんじゃないでしょうかというのが一点と、あと、高木氏の想像どおり、仮に「
Webデザイナー」の仕業だったとしても、いつもなら「リンク許諾制やディープリンク禁止方針といったばかげたポリシーを受け入れてしまうサイト管理者はそもそもけしからん」とか書きそうなのに、らしくないなあと思いました。という所です。
（ここから先の文章には妄想注意報が発令されております）
もうひとつ、コピペについてですが、私は後者の場合の外注先である専門家の間に、高木氏の示したサイトポリシーの文章がテンプレートとして出回っているのではないかとにらんでいます。そう思う根拠のひとつは、高木氏の示した検索結果と、私が先ほど示した検索結果の間にあるギャップです。私が示した方の結果に並んでいるサイトは、失礼ながら、Webページの制作にそんなに費用をかけられそうも無い所ばかりである（本当に失礼だな）のに対し、高木氏の示した検索結果の先に並んでいるサイトは、そうそうたるメンバーで、それらがサイトポリシーの作成を法律の素人であることが分かりきっている「
Webデザイナー」に頼むとは思えないようなところばかりだからです。私も検索してみるまで、こうもはっきりとした傾向のようなものが浮き出てくるとは思ってもみませんでしたが、こうして並べてみると、そこには偶然以上の何かがあるように思えてなりません。もうひとつは根拠と言えるほどのものではないのですが、ごく限られた専門家の間にだけ広まっているようなノウハウ集の存在に心当たりがあるという点です。うちの会社は確認会社なんですが、会社設立後しばらくすると、法律関係の団体から、確認会社を狙い打った内容の加除式の本の案内が届くようになりました。で、加除式の本についてはリンクをたどっていってもらえればどういうものか分かってもらえると思いますが、その中に、いかにも今回のようなサイトポリシーのサンプルが載っていそうな本もあるので、この辺が汚染源なんじゃないかと個人的には疑っています。
Last newspaper reporter fired
Posted Monday , May 28 , 2007 11:30 am
" I refuse to believe the headlines that the future of news organizations is bleak .
We face a dim future only if we refuse to change and do something about it . "
- Los Angeles Times editor Jim O'Shea , in a recent memo announcing the elimination of 57 more newsroom jobs .
A DAY in the very near future .
In what Wall Street cheered as a long - overdue and welcome cost - cutting measure , the very last newspaper reporter in America was fired yesterday , capping years of newsroom cuts and officially eliminating basic newsgathering as a journalistic function .
The reporter , Ted " Inky Fingers " Mandersoll , worked for a west - coast metropolitan paper where recent staff cuts and battles between editors and corporate honchos have repeatedly made headlines .
" Well , I held on for as long as I could , " a dejected Mandersoll said as he stood on a street corner holding a sign , " Will collect facts , investigate wrongdoing , and protect the public interest  for food . "
That the very last newspaper reporter in America stayed on the job as long as he did is widely considered to be remarkable .
For the last three months , Mandersoll was paid no salary , instead earning a dollar for each " qualified lead " produced via dating - service and mortgage - refinancing ads that accompanied the online version of his news stories .
He averaged just $ 17 per month .
Lars von Weilsch , president and CEO of MegaInfoNews , thanked Mandersoll for his 24 years of service .
" Ted Mandersoll 's award - winning stories about corporate malfeasance , government corruption , and non-celebrity - related matters are no longer relevant , but we do wish him well in his pension - less future , " von Weilsch said , noting that retirement security for working people is now far less important than achieving ever - increasing profits .
Article Continues After Advertisement
He said that Mandersoll will receive valuable " outplacement assistance , " including role - playing games where unemployed reporters learn to ask , " So , you gonna finish that ? "
Mandersoll will also receive tips about how to negotiate with creditors and then , when all hope is lost and bankruptcy inevitable , how to " slip out of town under cover of darkness . "
With no reporters to pay , America 's media organizations are likely to invest even more resources in upbeat , news - free , advertiser - friendly features .
An informal canvass of senior media executives revealed a wide variety of ideas for The New American Newspaper , including :
A syndicated " MySpace Profile of the Day . "
Article Continues After These Ads
A colorful " American Idol " daily feature , with online tie-ins and contests .
Puzzles .
Lots and lots of puzzles .
Dramatically expanded auto - trader sections , some of which may approach 1,000 advertising - heavy pages a day .
Page after page of " advertorials " promoting the products and services offered by the subsidiaries and " marketing partners " of the giant conglomerates that control America 's major media outlets .
Article Continues After Advertisement
Lots of full - page advertisements touting the latest " scientific breakthroughs " in weight loss , air filtration , arch support , hair removal , hair growth , collectible coins , porcelain dolls , and those commemorative plates that are sure to increase in value by several tenths of a percent in the coming centuries .
A new , glitzy " Global Celebrity Wire " to replace in - depth coverage of irrelevant matters like foreign affairs , war , genocide , and other downers that do n't put readers in a consuming mood .
Editorial pages replaced entirely by a daily version of the " Ask the White House " feature now seen only on the White House Web site .
Reaction to the firing of the last newspaper reporter in America was swift .
While media reformers used phrases like " we 're doomed " and " so long , democracy ! " to describe the development , others were more upbeat .
" We 're excited about the opportunity to provide America 's newspaper readers with the unfiltered truth  directly from the mouths of administration spokespeople , " said Tony Snow , the White House spokesman .
Snow joked that President Bush " might even start reading the newspaper " now that it will feature nothing but " bias - free , fact - free , content - free , wholly irrelevant material . "
Ironically , the White House reporters who normally laugh at Snow 's jokes did n't make a sound , because , well , there are n't any reporters left .
The nation 's top anti-drug official said people need to overcome their " reefer blindness " and see that illicit marijuana gardens are a terrorist threat to the public 's health and safety , as well as to the environment .
John P. Walters , President Bush 's drug czar , said the people who plant and tend the gardens are terrorists who would n't hesitate to help other terrorists get into the country with the aim of causing mass casualties .
Walters made the comments at a Thursday press conference that provided an update on the " Operation Alesia " marijuana - eradication effort .
" Do n't buy drugs .
They fund violence and terror , " he said .
After touring gardens raided this week in Shasta County , Walters said the officers who are destroying the gardens are performing hard , dangerous work in rough terrain .
He said growers have been known to have weapons , including assault rifles .
" These people are armed ; they 're dangerous , " he said .
He called them " violent criminal terrorists . "
Walters , whose official title is director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , said too many people write off marijuana as harmless .
" We have kind of a reefer blindness , ' " he said .
No arrests have been made so far in the four days of raids , the opening leg of what Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko has promised will be at least two straight weeks of daily raids .
He said suspects have been hard to find because their familiarity with their terrain makes it easy for them to flee quickly .
Although crews doing the raids are using Black Hawk and other helicopters to drop in on some of the gardens , Bosenko said they do n't want to give the growers any warning of a raid .
" We try to move in under stealth , " he said .
As of Thursday morning , Operation Alesia raids had resulted in the yanking of 68,237 young marijuana plants from public lands in Shasta County .
Raids already have been conducted in Whiskeytown National Recreation Area , as well as on land managed by the U.S. Forest Service north of Lake Shasta and other public land near Manton .
The operation is being led by the sheriff 's office and has involved 17 agencies , including the California National Guard and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
It 's believed to be the largest campaign of its kind in the state , Bosenko said .
The operation is named after the last major battle between the Roman Empire and the Gauls in 52 B.C.
That battle was won by the Romans .
With the blitz of marijuana gardens around Shasta County , Bosenko said officials hope to not only get rid of the pot , but also win back the land for the public that owns it .
" These organizations are destroying our lands and wildlife , " he said .
Bernie Weingardt , regional forester for the Forest Service 's Pacific Southwest Region , said the 28,000 acres believed to house illegal marijuana grows on national forest land throughout the state would cost more than $ 300 million to revive .
" These lands must be cleaned and restored , " he said .
His estimate is based on a National Park Service study that found it costs $ 11,000 per acre to pull the plants , clear irrigation systems , reshape any terracing and replant native vegetation , said Mike Odle , Forest Service spokesman .
While Walters did n't give specific goals for Operation Alesia , he said anti-drug agencies aim to cripple the organized crime groups that he said are behind the marijuana cultivation .
" This business we intend to put into recession , depression and put its leaders into jail , " Walters said .

Deaths , What Deaths ?
China ' Forced World Bank ' to Doctor Pollution Report
China forced the World Bank to remove damning statistics from a pollution report , the Financial Times has revealed .
Among the information cut was the figure that around 750,000 people die in China each year because of pollution .
Les Sprason was cycling along the road where the tank fell
A military investigation is now under way following the incident , which happened when the aircraft was on a routine training flight .
The empty , 10 ft - long metal tank landed on a grass verge near the A3124 road at Winkleigh , police said .
The RAF Cottesmore aircraft made a safe emergency landing at RNAS Yeovilton .
I thought , well I am going to die
Les Sprason
" I thought , well I am going to die because it is going to explode , and this is me finished , " he said .
" I was aware of a jet coming from my right - hand side at a very low altitude .
" I was aware something broke away from the aircraft and was spinning and somersaulting through the air , " he said .
He said the tank then impacted in a field with a " dull thud " .
Farmer Anthony Parkhouse thinks he also had a lucky escape .
The tank has now been recovered
" There was a strong smell of aviation fuel . "
Mr Sprason said locals had repeatedly called on the RAF to halt low flying in the area .
A Yeovilton spokesman said the auxiliary tank " came away " from the aircraft .
" The pilot was surprised the tank came off , " said the spokesman , adding that it was not jettisoned .
" We will have to investigate what happened .
" It is not the first time it has happened , but it is unusual . "
Cordoned off
Following the loss of the tank the Harrier made a safe emergency landing at Yeovilton , with a second auxiliary tank still attached to the aircraft .
An RAF spokesman said the pilot would be interviewed about the incident .
The Harrier was undamaged and no -one was hurt in the incident .
The area was cordoned off and the road was closed after advice that the tank was potentially dangerous and could explode .
Devon Fire and Rescue examined the tank and ascertained it was empty , but because of the danger of fire from vapours the road remained closed .
Police said military units had recovered the tank .
Google is hoping to lure in more business users
The search engine giant said the deal would allow it to provide more companies with web - based services similar to its Google Apps package .
Postini sells encryption and archiving software to more than 35,000 businesses and 10 m users across the globe .
The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter .
' Wider appeal '
" With this transaction , we 're reinforcing our commitment to delivering compelling hosted applications to businesses of all sizes , " said Google chairman and chief executive Eric Schmidt .
" With the addition of Postini , our apps are not just simple and appealing to users - they can also streamline the complex information security mandates within these organisations . "
The acquisition is the third biggest announced by Google after it snapped up DoubleClick for $ 3.1bn in April and its $ 1.65 bn takeover of YouTube .
Google has been moving closer to directly taking on Microsoft 's Office package of applications with the launch of a number of popular business web services including e-mail , calendars , spreadsheets and word processing .
So far its Google Apps service has been adopted by 100,000 business , the firm said .
Thinking lowsrc â€ “ how to make sites appear to be available a lot faster Monday , July 9th , 2007 at 10:33 pm
* ZOMG Update !*:
We put our heads together and came up with a client side solution without a PHP component that does the same as this one explained in detail here .
Those of you who ’ve been around some years may remember an otherwise forgotten non-standardized HTML attribute called lowsrc .
It was supported by Netscape browsers and allowed you to define a black and white preview picture of the real picture .
The browser would load the “ diet ” black and white shot first and then load the “ full fat ” colour shot and overlay the preview picture line by line .
Alongside progressive JPGs ( which load in lower quality first and then progressively get clearer ) and interlaced GIFs ( which loaded every second line first and then subsequently filled up the rest ) this was a killer trick to speed up your web site in the times when 56 K Modems were luxury items .
How come that we have fast connections but sites are still slow ?
Most of us are on faster connections these days and yet we constantly get annoyed at how long it takes for some pages to finish loading .
The reason is that we embed too many resources ( videos , images , scripts ) in the page .
Browsers in general seem to download two resources in parallel and stall the rest of the dependencies from loading until these are done .
When you use a lot of images , especially from different servers this leads to a long delay , as for each of these images the browser needs to initiate an HTTP request , convert the URL to a DNS and IP and pull the image .
Furthermore the browser shows us an endless spinning wheel or progress bar and informs us that “ 10 of 73 resources ” have been loaded .
While this does not necessarily mean that we cannot use the current document ( browsers these days at least do n’t stop rendering halfway through â€ “ unless you use inline scripting that fails ) it still gives us an impression that things still happen and the document is not ready for us yet .
The most common example where this happens is when you use avatars on your site – the small images depicting the user that contributed the content adjacent to it .
Using a lot of these can make the page appear very slow , as the following example which loads and display fifty results from Yahoo !
Answers with avatars shows .
Load fifty answers with avatars ( opens in a new window ) avatars .
php
During testing on this connection using Firebugâ€™s network monitor this loaded 30 resources with 125 kb in overall 14.92 seconds .
This delay also means that scripts that get fired via the onload handler of the window will get delayed until all the images were loaded , which is why libraries have to use methods like onAvailable , onDOMReady or onContentReady to run our scripts .
However , if you are in control of the middle tier of your server than there is a solution to make this delay less painful for the end user and seemingly deliver your pages quicker .
Load fifty answers with avatars delayed ( opens in a new window ) avatarsdelay .
php
During testing on this connection using Firebugâ€™s network monitor this loaded 30 resources with 125 kb in overall 12.7 seconds , however the wheel of the browser stopped spinning after 3 seconds and I got the impression all is done .
What was the difference ?
The avatars . php example uses CURL and PHP to load information from the Yahoo !
Answers API .
We serialize the return value and spit out the HTML :
$url = ‘ http://answers.yahooapis.com/AnswersService/V1/questionSearch?appid=YahooDemo&query=sport&results=50&output=php’;
$ ch = curl_init ( ) ;
curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT _URL , $url ) ;
curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT _RETURNTRANSFER , 1 ) ;
$ result = curl_exec ( $ch ) ;
curl_close ( $ch ) ;
$ output = unserialize ( $ result ) ;
foreach ( $ output [ ‘ Questions ’] as $ key= > $p ) {
echo ‘ ‘;
echo ‘ ‘.$ p[ ‘ Subject ’ ] . ’ ‘;
echo ‘ ‘; echo ‘‘; echo ‘ ‘.$ p[ ‘ Content ’ ] . ’
} ?>
This results in all of the HTTP requests that delay the user - felt availability of the site .
A simple trick and small change to the script makes this delay obsolete .
Shifting the HTTP overhead further down the timeline
Using JavaScript we have the option to delay the loading of extra content that is “ not really needed ” for the enjoyment and availability of your site .
As the avatars are not really necessary to get the gist of the answers page , we can alter the backend script to harvest the image URLs and replace all the images with different URLs with a placeholder â€ “ say a “ grey man ” picture .
In order to allow us to identify the pictures later and link them to the harvested URL , we add a dynamic ID .
$url = ‘ http://answers.yahooapis.com/AnswersService/V1/questionSearch?appid=YahooDemo&query=sport&results=50&output=php’;
$ ch = curl_init ( ) ;
curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT _URL , $url ) ;
curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT _RETURNTRANSFER , 1 ) ;
$ result = curl_exec ( $ch ) ;
curl_close ( $ch ) ;
$ output = unserialize ( $ result ) ;
foreach ( $ output [ ‘ Questions ’] as $ key= > $p ) {
echo ‘ id = ” i-’.$ key . ’ ” src= ”
http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/sch/gr2/nophoto3_48×48.gif” width = ” 48 ” height = ” 48 ” alt= ” ’.$ p[ UserNick ] . ’ ” >‘;
echo ‘ ‘.$ p[ ‘ Subject ’ ] . ’ ‘;
echo ‘ id = ” i-’.$ key . ’ ” src= ”
http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/sch/gr2/nophoto3_48×48.gif” width = ” 48 ” height = ” 48 ” alt= ” ’.$ p[ UserNick ] . ’ ” >‘; echo ‘‘; echo ‘ ‘.$ p[ ‘ Content ’ ] . ’
$ out [ $key ] = ’‘’. $ p[‘ UserPhotoURL ’ ] .’‘’;
} ?>
When the page and all the other assets have finished loading we load the rest of the pictures by replacing the src attribute of all the placeholders with the real URLs .
This script should go to the end of the document .
Yes , this makes your avatars dependent on JavaScript , but it has no real impact on accessibility or SEO as the alternative text of each avatar is still available .
The only impact it has is that visitors will see a transition from a “ grey man ” to the user ’s avatar and as most of the time avatars are outside the initial viewport or at its boundaries the majority of users wo n’t be the wiser about our little trick â€ “ but they get page that seems to have loaded a lot faster .
Delaying the delivery of heavy screen furniture
While this trick is most efficient with third party images , we could also go further in our optimization and take another leaf out of the book of tricks of the days of slow connections .
When Netscape 4 and other older browsers still made up a substantial part of the overall visitor numbers , the main trick to cater for these browsers and newer ones was to use the @import directive to add a style sheet for newer browsers and have a simple LINK to add the one for these oldies :
( The single quotes also blocked out MSIE 5 / Mac )
We can do something like that easily for the document , too .
Simply create a more basic style sheet that for example uses background - colours instead of fancy gradients , massive bevels or pretty but very large nature shots .
Then create an extra style sheet that adds all of these background - images .
As URLs in CSS are as much an HTTP request as embedded images are , thisâ€™ll give us the same gain .
In the document ’s onload handler , all you ’ll need to do is create a new LINK element pointing to the style sheet with the images and add it to the head of the document .
[...]
This ’ll add all the fancy imagery after the main document was loaded and replace background colours that did the job until the page was ready and we can go and make it prettier .

Further Polish Adventures : Academic Computer Science Festival
Thanks to Jan Szumiec ( whom I mentioned in the previous entry ) is a student at the Technical University of Cracow .
He is organising this year 's Academic Computer Science Festival from the 8th to the 10th of March .
I 've been asked to speak there on IronPython .
I was his second choice to speak , but I 'm not too insulted as I 'm really looking forward to the opportunity to see Cracow which is said to be a very beautiful city .
As the only Polish folk I know both program natively in Ruby , it 's a little daunting .
I 'll be presenting to people who natively both speak and program in a different language .
Interesting Things
Here are three interesting things I 've stumbled across recently .
They 've all been linked to elsewhere , so my apologies .
Compile C# From IronPython
Some example code from a gentleman allegedly called drifter 46and2 .
It shows how to compile C# code from IronPython and get a reference to the assembly .
I have n't played with this yet , so I do n't know how slow it is .
It also appears to save the generated assemblies to disk , keeping them in memory would be more interesting to me .
The reason this looks interesting to me is that there are two limitations with IronPython that this technique potentially overcomes .
IronPython is a Python compiler - this means it compiles Python source code to assemblies .
However the .NET garbage collector does n't collect class definitions , so IronPython reuses a single class for all user defined classes .
This means you can't create an assembly that can be consumed from C#. Instead you have to create a stub C# class yourself , and hook up the methods .
By generating and compiling C# dynamically you could automate this .
The second limitation this causes is that you can't use .NET attributes , and again have to use stub C# classes .
IronPython now Included in Mono 1.2.3
As well as several fixes to the Windows Forms implementation , this version of Mono now includes the IronPython Community Edition .
W00t !
The Problem With Ruby I have two Polish friends who are Ruby developers .
One of them ( Jan rather than Andrzej ) was of the opinion that Ruby was more object oriented than Python because you are able tack methods onto the built - in classes .
Of course the ' Python Philosophy ' ( tm ) is that allowing this is a crazy recipe for disaster .
Generally the opinion in the Ruby world is that disaster does n't happen very often and it is a technique that can be very useful .
Well , disaster can happen , and the article on method_missing is a tale of how one Ruby programmer came at least temporarily unstuck .
I like Simon Willison 's comment :
My least favourite thing about Ruby is the cultural tendency towards introducing weird new bugs in other peopleâ€™s code .
Do I sound smug ?
Wing at Resolver
We 've finally browbeaten Giles sufficiently and he 's bought three of us at Resolver shiny new Wing IDE licenses .
One of us is using Eclipse with the free PyDev extensions and two of the developers here still use Textpad .
Eclipse has some really nice features , but also some annoying ones , and the ease with which you can script
Wing was a big win for me .
A gentleman called Brandon Corfman has published an interesting few blog entries on scripting the Komodo IDE , mainly using Bicycle Repair Man which is a refactoring tool for Python .
Refactoring is something that Eclipse is particularly good at ( coming from the Java world ) and the couple of times I 've used its Extract Method it behaved very intelligently .
There are two of Brandon 's Komodo scripts that I 'd like to port ( or see ported ) to Wing :
Rename Occurrences allows you to rename all occurrences of a variable or method name wherever it appears in your code .
Extract Method allows you to highlight a section of existing Python code in Komodo and refactor it into its own separate method .
Porting both should be well possible .
We also have a custom PyLint setup that checks our whole codebase , we run this before checking in ( it checks for unused imports and unused variables amongst other things ) .
Being able to run this on a single file from the IDE will be very handy .
Programming Language Metrics
Ok , so programming language metrics are n't worth the paper they 're printed on , but they 're still fun .
I 've just stumbled across a metric I 'd not seen before :
It charts various languages by the number of sourceforge projects , and goes from 2001 to the end of 2006 when sourceforge stopped providing this information .
The results ( unsurprisingly ) show Java , C++ and C way out front , followed by PHP ( a rising but flattening curve ) and a gracefully declining Perl .
Python comes next , at 4.88 % , and is a full point and a half above C# and then Javascript .
As this charts Open Source projects it is most closely a metric of language popularity rather than ' industrial ' usage .
It reflects what programmers like to do in their spare time .
The fact that Python leads C# probably also reflects the fact that Python is much more prominent in the open source world .
There is a surprise , Ruby is shown as a relatively flat 0.44 % .
This is possibly because Ruby developers tend to use the popular RubyForge rather than sourceforge ( which seems to be declining in importance itself ) .
The results are not dissimilar from the TIOBE Programming Community Index .
By gathering data from search engines it is also a metric of language popularity .
It too shows Python ahead of C# , but puts Visual basic much higher than the sourceforge figures .
TIOBE shows Ruby having grown significantly since mid 2006 , and catching up on Python , but there are signs that the growth is slowing .
The growth curve for Ruby on TIOBE has turned into a ' knee ' , the curve is flattening off .
There is a third metric .
The Jobtrends by Indeed.com .
I 've only compared a few of the languages and it only shows comparisons going back around two years , but it tells a different story .
By gathering data from job postings it is much more a metric of industrial usage than popularity .
It shows C# as rising , now reaching around the same point as the declining Perl , and well ahead of Python .
It shows a gentle rise for Python , which is well above Ruby .
If you 're obsessed with metrics like this , then you might want to look at google search trends .
This shows a similar picture to TIOBE ( although it allows a maximum of five terms ) , except it puts C# ahead of Python .
Interesting .

Firedrop2 : Blog Statistics
Davy Mitchell has made a nice addition to the Firedrop2 blogging tool I use .
It generates a page of statistics about your blog entries , number of words per post , number of posts per category and the like .
Formatting aside , it 's a nifty little addition .
Unsurprisingly 455 of my 606 blog entries are in the Python category .
The code has n't yet been checked in , but you can download the changes as a zip file : BlogStats.zip
PyCamp UK ?
Jeff Rush has just announced that the Dallas and Houston Python User Groups are looking to arrange a regional Python ' unconference ' : PyCamp .
This sounds like a great idea , and Michael Sparks has picked up on the idea for the UK .
Anyone up for a PyCamp UK ?
I certainly am .
Michael is suggesting a venue in Manchester and looking for volunteers to see if anyone is interested ...
Book Progress
I 've just finished the first draft of chapter two , the Python tutorial .
I 've wanted to write a Python tutorial for a long time , but that thirst is pretty much quenched right now .
It will still need a fair amount of polishing I guess , but the basic content is pretty good .
I 'd love to share it , and although I 'm enjoying having my work assessed by a professional editor I would prefer to be able to make it available to everyone .
Surprisingly ( to me ) the hardest parts are the introductions and the summaries .
At some point in the long distant future I 'll write another Python tutorial which I 'll publish on my site .
As you might expect , writing is pretty much taking up all my spare time at the moment .
It will be a while after the book is out before I do much more writing , first I 'll be taking a good break ...
Speaking of breaks , Andrzej and I now have our flights and hotel booked for PyCon .
I 'm really looking forward to it .
We 're also working on the presentation and a simple example app .
to go along with it .
Before we leave for the US we 'll put the talk notes and the app online .
The Event Pattern
Since I started work at Resolver Systems nearly a year ago , Resolver the application has grown quite considerably .
It is now just under twenty thousand lines of production Python code , plus a few hundred lines of C# ( some of which is autogenerated by the Visual Studio designer ) .
There are also around seventy thousand lines of test code , this is our test framework plus unit and functional tests .
The amazing thing is that we have created a highly functional application in only twenty thousand lines of code .
Resolver is structured using a fairly straightforward Model - View - Controller structure .
The view is our main form class , we have several controllers managing the interaction of the model and the view .
The model are our various classes that represent the data - set being edited .
We use various other patterns to good effect in Resolver : the observer pattern and the command pattern amongst others .
Some of our classes , like the controllers and the commands are data - set observers .
When the data - set is changed ( like a new one is loaded ) they need to be informed .
As the main form is responsible for loading new data - sets it sets the new ones onto all the observers .
The whole point of the MVC structure ( and this post has a point too , I promise ) is to decouple the model classes from the view and controller classes .
The model does n't need to know anything about these classes .
Changes to the view and controllers do n't ( in theory anyway ) affect the model at all , and vice versa .
Note Thanks to Jonathan for a correction .
This should read " the View - Controller pairs are allowed to know about the model , though not vice - versa .
This means changes to the model can impact the View - Controller pair . " .
This is why you need to define a clear public API on your model , your View - Controllers need to know how to access the model in order to present a view on the data .
The difficulty is that the controllers often need to be informed when the data - set changes , but we still want to maintain the separation .
That means the data - set should n't need to have a reference to the controllers .
At Resolver we use a solution I have n't seen before .
It may in fact be a part of the classic observer pattern , but it is certainly a natural extension of it .
IronPython has a nice way of interacting with .NET events .
You add and remove event handlers to events using add and remove in place syntax .
button = Button ( Text = " Button Text " )
def onClick ( sender , event ) :
print ' You clicked me '
button .
Click += onClick
button .
Click -= onClick
At Resolver we have created our own event hook class which is used in the same way .
I actually introduced this class in my Background Worker Threads article on IronPython .
I 'd like to briefly show how it can be used to communicate between model and controllers , in concert with the observer pattern .
class EventHook ( object ) :
def __init__ ( self ) :
self .
__handlers = [ ]
def __iadd__ ( self , handler ) :
self .
handlers .
append ( handler )
return self
def __isub__ ( self , handler ) :
self .
handlers .
remove ( handler )
return self
def fire ( self , * args , ** keywargs ) :
for handler in self .
__handlers :
handler ( * args , ** keywargs )
Small and cute do n't you think ?
Lets imagine we have a DataSet class that needs to inform ( some of ) its observers when it has changed , perhaps to show a modified flag on the GUI to give a trivial example .
We have a MainForm class which manages the observers .
When a new data - set is loaded it sets the ' dataset ' property on all the observers .
class MainForm ( Form ) :
def __init__ ( self ) :
self .
_controller = Controller ( )
self .
observers = [ self .
_controller ]
def loadDataset ( self ) :
dataset = self .
magicallyGetNewDataset ( )
for observer in self .
observers :
observer .
dataset = dataset
We also have a Controller class ( initialised in MainForm above ) .
In its handler for the ' dataset ' property it registers itself to listen to the ' modified ' event on the new dataset .
If necessary it unregisters itself from any previous events it may have been listening to .
class Controller ( object ) :
def __init__ ( self ) :
self .
__dataset = None
def setDataSet ( self , dataset ) :
if self .
__dataset is not None :
self .
__dataset .
modified -= self .
onModified
self .
__dataset = dataset
self .
__dataset .
modified += self .
onModified
dataset = property ( lambda self : self .
__dataset , setDataSet )
def onModified ( self ) :
When the MainForm sets the dataset on the controller , setDataSet is called .
And so the final piece of the jigsaw , the DataSet class .
class DataSet ( object ) :
def __init__ ( self ) :
self .
modified = EventHook ( )
def doSomething ( self ) :
if something HasChanged :
self .
modified . fire ( )
In the initialiser it creates an event hook ; the ' modified ' attribute .
When the dataset is set on the observers , any that are interested in the modified flag can register with the modified event .
When the data - set is modified , it calls self.modified.fire ( ) and all interested parties are notified .
The observers can then use the public API of the dataset ( which they hold a reference to ) to work out how they need to respond .
The dataset itself does n't need to hold a reference to any of the observers .
The advantage of this kind of approach ( and I 'm sure there are many alternatives ) is that you can then re-use your core classes in another situation , hopefully without having to rewrite a line .
It does require careful managing of dependencies , and a sensible public API .
In the example above you could take DataSet and use it in a tool that does n't have a front - end at all ( like a data converter ) or embed it in a web application .

" When the first human being began to write , he or she set the world upon a new evolution .
Similarly , if a few individuals have the strength and the power to walk way from the restrictions of the world and to stand fearlessly beyond it , eventually in some distant millennium , all mankind will also come to that same liberation .
It will be a special pleasure for you to look back , poised in some place in eternity , and know that you were there at the beginning of the movement .
Your gift was that you realized at an early stage that you were indeed eternal , immortal , and infinite , and that you had the courage to walk with that idea in your heart while the rest of mankind said that such a limitless overview was n't true or even possible . "
- Stuart Wilde Some will read that quote and assume that Wilde was encouraging people to do the impossible .
That which is most certainly impossible to accomplish is what we believe is impossible .
We are all abundantly familiar with impossible things that were accomplished in the past .
Look what was accomplished once the wheel was invented .
Indeed , look at the magnificent structures that were built before the wheel , including the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the awe - inspiring structures that were built in South and Central America .
Transporation without the assistance of animal power was unthinkable .
Flying through the air was out of the question except in the imaginations of visionaries such as da Vinci and a few others .
Travel into airless space could n't be considered except in fairy tales or the minds of science fiction writers .
Cures and preventives for all sorts of diseases and genetic defects were n't seriously considered a century ago .
Now we want peace in the world , peace in our communities , peace in our families and peace within our hearts .
Impossible ?
No .
The biggest obstacle to overcome is the belief that these are inevitable consequences of our modern technological world .
They are not , no matter how often ultra conservatives try to make us believe they are .
Is terrorism necessary ?
No more essential than the anarchist movements of a century ago where its participants committed many of the same acts as today 's terrorists .
Yet how often do we hear about the " terrorist " period at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th ?
It 's lost to most students of history , even today .
Such movements as today 's brand of terrorism have causes and perpetrators .
These can be addressed .
Not with weapons , which obviously only makes the perpetrators work harder and their causes more attractive .
With education , so that the large majority of good people will collectively come together to silence the violent ones .
Drugs , murders , home invasions , road rage ( implicated in as much as 80 percent of road accidents today according to the Ontario Provincial Police ) and abuse of women and children , each of which is increasing at an alarming rate , have causes that may be addressed .
Building more prisons and hiring more police is n't working because they do not address the causes of these social ills .
Trying to solve them when the perpetrators are already involved with their offences is like trying to solve the high rate of divorce by training more family counselors .
It 's too late then .

Guido is wrong :
“ Each jazz musician when he takes a horn in his hand - trumpet , bass , saxophone , drums - whatever instrument he plays - each soloist , that is , when he begins to ad lib on a given composition with a title and improvise a new creative melody , this man is taking the place of a composer .
He is saying , “ listen , I am going to give you a new complete idea with a new set of chord changes .
I am going to give you a new melodic conception on a tune you are familiar with .
I am a composer . ”
That ’s what he is saying .
I have noticed that there are many kinds of composers in this so - called jazz .
For instance , there are musicians who simply take rhythmic patterns and very spare notes - very limited invention melodically - and play in a soulful swinging way . [… ]
I , myself , came to enjoy the players who did n’t only just swing but who invented new rhythmic patterns , along with new melodic concepts .
And those people are : Art Tatum , Bud Powell , Max Roach , Sonny Rollins , Lester Young , Dizzy Gillespie and Charles Parker , who is the greatest genius of all to me because he changed the whole era around . [… ]
I admire anyone who can come up with something original .
But not originality alone , because there can be originality in stupidity , with no musical description of any emotion or any beauty the man has seen , or any kind of life he has lived .
For instance , a man says he played with feeling .
Now he can play with feeling and have no melodic concept at all .
That ’s often what happens in jazz : I have found very little value left after the average guy takes his first eight bars - not to mention two or three choruses , because then it just becomes repetition , riffs and patterns , instead of spontaneous creativity , I could never get Bird to play over two choruses .
Now , kids play fifty thousand if you let them .
Who is that good ?
Today , things are at the other extreme .
Everything is supposed to be invented , the guys never repeat anything at all and probably could n’t .
They do n’t even write down their own tunes , they just make them up as they sit on the bandstand .
It ’s all right , I do n’t question it .
I know and hear what they are doing .
But the validity remains to be seen - what comes , what is left , after you hear the melody and after you hear the solo .
Unless you just want to hear the feeling , as they say . [ … ]
The music on this record is involved with my trying to say what the hell I am here for .
And similar ideas .
Another one is : let my children hear music - for God ’s sake - they have had enough noise . [… ]
I think the music on this record is serious in every sense .
I say , let my children have music .
I said it earlier .
For God ’s sake , rid this society of some of the noise so that those who have ears will be able to use them some place listening to good music .
When I say good I do n’t mean that today ’s music is bad because it is loud .
I mean the structures have paid no attention to the past history of music .
Nothing is simple .
It ’s as if people came to Manhattan and acted like it was still full of trees and grass and Indians instead of concrete and tall buildings .
It ’s like a tailor cutting clothes without knowing the design , It ’s like living in a vacuum and not paying attention to anything that came before you . [..]
Let my children have music !
Let them hear live music .
Not noise .
My children !
You do what you want with your own ” – Charles Mingus Liner notes by Charles Mingus for the album “ Let My Children Hear Music ”
on Columbia Records , 1971 .
My main “ profession ” is econometrician ; I ’m a programmer by calling , by hobby and by obsession .
As many working econometricians nowadays ( I ’m actually a graduate student and do n’t have a real job ) , I find myself doing a lot of programming in GNU R. Econometrics , like much of “ general ” numerics , tries to fit in as much algorithmics as possible in the form of matrix multiplications .
This is mainly a strategy to be able to understand the computability of stuff — since we do n’t know much CS theory — but it also helps minimizing the godamn programming ; after you ’ve proven stuff on chalkboard , you can just type out the matrix operations in the order you want them executed .
Unfortunately , a few of recent simulation - based methods — Monte Carlo / bootstrapping stuff — does n’t quite fit in that mold .
Thus , a good part of graduate - level econometrics courses now are ersatz programming lessons taken in front of a computer with GNU R. Now , R ’s for is really a foreach : it ’s not FOR counter = start TO end STEP increment or FOR { counter=start ; counter < =constraint ; counter + =increment} but simply FOR counter IN array .
As seen in the diagram above , foreach is a “ brainier ” , less “ computery ” construct than plain for ; a lot of loops that would go
for i = 1 to length ( X )
{a<- X[i ] ;
do_stuff_with(a ) ;
}
become simply
for a in X do_stuff_with ( a )
which is probably what R ’s designers thought when making for a foreach .
This is , nevertheless , less of a boon than what it seems : when you foreach directly into the array , you lose track of an index variable — that is , you can do stuff with the array but it ’s really hard to return another array or even handle its structure some more .
Frankly , the only use I can see for this direct construct is show - type procedures or simple folds .
So what do we do if we want to return another array ?
One way to go about this is to write a snoc — a function that appends an element to the end of the array .
An implementation of map would go like
map <- function ( f , x ) {
y < - rep ( NA , length ( x ) )
for ( a in x ) snoc(y , f a )
return(y ) ;}
Of course , no one does this , for two basic reasons .
First of all , it ’s untrustworthy : if one of the computations fails , you end up with an Y array that ’s shorter than the X array , where we ’d like it to remain N/A .
The second reason is shared with list - based map s : not all work in econometric is done with cross-section data !
Very often we want observations to depend on the past which mainly indicates we need another data structure for time - series data .
R has one , but it ’s involved enough that most people still write code for vectors and matrices , not time - series ; time - series reasoning is inherently recursive , and somehow R ’s lexical model can’t handle that .
In the end , we end up using precious foreach as a simple for :
map <- function ( f , x ) {
y < - rep ( NA , length ( x ) )
for ( a in 1:length ( x ) ) y[ i ] < f( x [ i ] )
return(y ) ;}
Clearly , foreach is almost useless in my field .
The foreach construct is nevertheless a step forward in the process of liberating the coder from bean - counting .
First , you have spaghetti programming :
i=0 ;
A :
y[i]=dance_around_and_do_stuff( X[ i ] ) ;
i=i+1 ;
if ( i < 10 ) goto A
keep_on_chugging
Then you have while , which attempts to emulate constraint reasoning even though it ’s really not :
i=0 ;
while i< 10 { y[ i ]=dance_around_and_do_stuff( X[i ] ) ; i=i+1 ; }
The next step is abstracting the iteration pattern
for ( i=1:10 ) { y[ i ]=dance_around_and_do_stuff( X[ i ] ) ;}
keep_on_going_about
Finally , foreach does away with the useless counter variable
foreach ( a in X ) { y[i ]=dance_around_and_do_stuff(a);}
keep_on_going_about
Of course , the logical next step is to do away with the useless intermediate - storage variable
y = map dance_around_and_do_stuff X
Ahhh .
Much better .
Why are people complaining about this ?
A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down :
y = [ dance_around_and_do_stuff a | a < X ]
is alternate syntax for the previous expression involving map .
It ’s more verbose — basically because it eschews the currying and reintroduces the intermediate variable .
This form is quite fun , though , because it allows you to introduce some filters as well
y = [ dance_around_and_do_stuff a | a < X , even a ]
Yay !
This is almost constraint programming !
Well , it is n’t , really , but it ’s much better pseudoconstraint programming than while loops .
You can use this template to bruteforce your number theory and discrete math exercises right now in GHC .
Not all for - loops map ( tee hee ) directly into map constructs , though this is clearly the most common pattern .
What can we do to keep the bean - counting down when it does n’t ?
Please complete the following sequences : 1,2,3,4,5 , … 1,2,4,8,16 … 1,1,2,3,5,8 … 1 , 4 , 3 , 12 , 11 , … How are you supposed to know what goes next ?
You basically assume that the rules that have been holding … continue to hold .
That ’s how we come about most of the knowledge we possess : induction .
Induction is unreliable , unscientific and yet is what we do all the time .
Induction is responsible for great beauty , like a Charlie Mingus album , and great horrors , like becoming a racist after having been mugged a couple of times in the Bronx .
I mean , go ask a cognitive scientist or seven whether this is more or less basic than for loops .
Now , to be able to reason clearly about induction , you need to make explicit what ’s the rule you assume that will continue to hold .
Functional languages often force you to reverse your thought process , in this sense , by having you define the new case in terms of the old cases — for example
bignum n = 2 * bignum ( n - 1 )
bignum 0 = 1
In languages with ( n+k ) patterns , we do n’t even need this :
bignum 0 = 1
bignum ( n+1 ) = 2 * bignum n
The for - loop version of this is
bignum = 1 ;
for ( i = 0 ; i≤ n ; i++ ) {
bignum = 2 * bignum
}
Go ask a cognitive scientist or seven which of these is a “ natural ” thought process .
Feh .
Now , recursion and induction are concepts that can express each other .
Recursion is interesting because you do away with useless bean counting ; optimizing compilers should turn this into whatever your computer can grok anyway .
The fun starts when you start abstracting away the recursion patterns :
iterate 0 base f = base
iterate n base f = xs ++ f ( last xs ) where xs = iterate ( n - 1 ) base f
Like map , this does away with a lot of repetitive loop coding :
bignum n = iterate n 0 ( * 2 )
smallernum n = iterate n 1 ( \x - > x + ( x / 2 ) )
I really do n’t understand your brain if you do n’t find this a lot more productive than chugging away for loops
Now , get this : good compilers know theorems about recursion patterns .
Take map fusion :
Say that , in this sad world where you write for loops by hand , you might want functions that double and square a bunch of numbers .
function double ( list ) {
newlist = list.new
for ( i in 1:length ( list ) {
newlist.append(2*list [i ] ) ;}
return ( newlist )
} function square ( list ) {
newlist = list.new
for ( i in 1:length ( list ) {
newlist.append(list[i ] ^2 ) ;}
return ( newlist )
}
Can you compose these babies ?
Of course you can .
x = double ( square ( list ) )
This is what your computer does : newlist = list.new
for ( i in 1:length ( list ) {
newlist.append(list[i ] ^2 ) ;}
newnewlist = list.new
for ( i in 1:length ( list ) {
newnewlist.append(2*newlist [ i ] ) ;}
But wait .
It should know that this is equivalent to function doublesquare ( list ) {
newlist = list.new
for ( i in 1:length ( list ) {
newlist.append(2*list[i ] ^2 ) ;}
}
Well , with map fusion it does !
Microsoft Live Labs is currently developing what could be the next Google Earth - style hit - Photosynth .
Photosynth takes a large collection of photos of a place or object , analyzes them for similarities , and displays them in a reconstructed 3 - Dimensional space .
This means you can Walk or fly through a scene to see photos from any angle , seamlessly zoom in or out of a photograph whether it ’s megapixels or gigapixels in size , and see where pictures were taken in relation to one another .
The technology works by scanning collections of photographs , which can be taken from different cameras at different times .
It picks out distinctive features in each image and cross-references them against the other photographs , checking for similarities .
This allows it to pinpoint a feature 's 3D position and to also calculate where the position of the camera would have been when the picture was taken .
For a full explanation click here , and for a video click here .
It looks very cool , and should be ready very soon .
Billboard advertising has been around for decades .
It is safe to say that they are no longer as effective as they used to be .
Watching some new advertising techniques appear has made me realize that the memorable ads are the ones that really interact with life itself and are connecting to us in an emotional way .
I ’ve a compiled a small list of the most striking ads of the last 6 months .
1. HUNGER AND THIRST : Magazine on a bottle
This could be how we get drinks for free in the future .
Have a coke .
Have a smile .
2. SUPRISE !
Peephole Pizza Guy
Nice alternative to the stacks of flyers we all have
3. PATIENCE & CURIOSITY – Conveyor belt ads
I ’m sure you ’ll want to see the entire belt before you leave the store
4. PLAYFULNESS – Wonderbra magazine ad
Have a feel of what a wonderbra would look like
5. CLEVERNESS – Fun shopping bags
There are tons like these .
All of them play on either ( 1 ) how they interact with the person
or ( 2 ) how the bag interacts with the print

Ninjas were assassins or spies in 14th Century Japan
The man , camouflaged in an all black suit , had robbed several farmers and their families at knife point , police say .
Police had been searching for him for several weeks .
Ninjas were trained for stealth .
They first appeared in 14th Century Japan and were famed as assassins and spies .
Outwitted
For several weeks the police had been scouring the countryside looking for shadows .
The " ninja " was known to have struck several times - his head wrapped in a black bandana , a powerful bow in one hand and a knife strapped to his leg .
He targeted isolated farms late at night forcing farmers to hand over cash and valuables at arrow point .
His victims were usually so afraid they did n't report the attacks until some days later .
But on Monday night the " ninja " was outwitted .
As he smashed through the door of a farmhouse , a feisty old pensioner was waiting for him .
Former soldier
The old man came down the stairs but tripped on the last step letting off his rifle .
Startled , the " ninja " made his escape , hopping onto a bicycle and racing off into the nearby cornfields - followed by police who were quickly on the scene .
Police eventually trailed him to an abandoned farmhouse where he was arrested .
He was later identified as Igor Vaclavic , a former soldier from the Russian army .
He was caught carrying night scopes and a head torch .
When asked about his chosen disguise , he told police he had been inspired by his boyhood idol - Robin Hood .

Apple TV is dead , long live the Mac Nano .
Sort of .
Just two weeks after Apple released its streaming media box to the public , hackers successfully installed OS X , Apple 's desktop operating system , on the $ 300 device , making it the cheapest PC Cupertino has ever sold .
" The breakthrough is done , OS X runs on Apple TV ! " wrote " Semthex , " the anonymous hacker responsible for the mod , at his website .
" Now we got ( the ) low - budget Mac we ever wanted . "
The add - on may be of limited appeal to everyday users .
It involves a laborious 13 - step procedure , and the resulting installation is unable to take advantage of all the Apple TV 's hardware .
Without video acceleration , games can't floor the graphic chip 's throttle .
There 's no audio or ethernet support either , making the box useless for its original purpose as a media hub .
Over the past week , however , enthusiasts worked to solve these problems , exchanging ideas over IRC and testing new versions of specially tailored system software Semthex created , which is necessary to bypass built - in restrictions on installing the full version of OS X .
" This hack seriously opens up the doors with what the Apple TV could be used for , " said Tom Anthony , administrator of Apple TV Hacks , in an e-mail .
Released March 21 , Apple TV won praise for its compact design and usable interface , and criticism for its limited utility and poor - quality video content .
Early hacks included adding the popular Xvid video codec and installing a larger hard drive .
Some hackers enabled SSH to permit secure command - line access to the box , and USB keyboards and mice soon followed .
Other unauthorized add - ons include the Apache web server , early attempts at a Linux port and the VNC remote desktop system .
The hacks are not for the faint - hearted .
Gaining the system access required to accomplish these modifications usually requires owners to get their hands dirty , opening the box and following complex instructions that might deter the casual user .
With OS X on board , however , almost anything might soon be running on Apple TV , even the Media Center edition of Microsoft Windows .
The reasons behind this assault are found in the box itself : Despite being fitted with a Pentium M processor , as much RAM as Sony 's PlayStation 3 and a faster graphics chip than a Nintendo Wii , Apple TV does n't replace other devices under the TV set .
While some people are happy to stream media from iTunes libraries to their televisions , many want to put that hardware to other uses .
More , perhaps , than anyone suspected .
Anthony 's site was briefly unavailable earlier this week , battered by hordes of visitors .
" I was n't quite prepared for how big it would be ; in the first week I had half a million visitors , and I had to purchase additional bandwidth to the site , " Anthony said .
" The biggest problem with the site has been ( that ) I have been receiving so many e-mails ... I have n't been able to keep up with my day job . "
If Apple objects to this kind of interference , it has yet to say so openly , though unlikely sounding ( and unconfirmed ) rumors circulated late last week that Apple was remotely disabling add - ons through a remote internet connection .

Researchers at the University of Copenhagen 's Dark Cosmology Centre at the Niels Bohr Institute have brought us one step closer to understanding what the universe is made of .
As part of the international collaboration ESSENCE they have observed distant supernovae ( exploding stars ) , some of which emitted the light we now see more than half the age of the universe ago .
Using these supernovae they have traced the expansion history of the universe with unprecedented accuracy and sharpened our knowledge of what it might be that is causing the mysterious acceleration of the expansion of the universe .
Background and outline
At the end of last century astronomers discovered the startling fact that the expansion of our universe is not slowing down , as all our previous understanding of gravity had predicted .
Rather the expansion is speeding up .
Nothing in conventional physics can explain such a result .
It means that either the universe is made up of around 70 % ' dark energy ' ( something that has a sort of anti-gravity ) or our theory of gravity is flawed .
Now , as part of the international collaboration " ESSENCE " , researchers at the Danish Dark Cosmology Centre have added a new piece to the puzzle .
In two papers recently released they detail observations of supernovae ( exploding stars ) that allow them to trace the expansion history of the universe in unprecedented detail .
ESSENCE is an extension of the original team that discovered the acceleration of the universe and these results push the limits of technology and knowledge , observing light from dying stars that was emitted almost half the age of the universe ago .
In a third paper , led by the Danish team and released this week , the many new theories that have been proposed to explain the acceleration of the universe are critically assessed in the face of this new data .
Dr. Jesper Sollerman and Dr. Tamara
Davis lead the team who show that despite the increased sophistication in cosmological models over the last century the best model to explain the acceleration remains one that was proposed by Einstein back in 1917 .
Although Einstein 's reasoning at the time was flawed ( he proposed the modification to his theory so it could support a static universe , because in those days everyone ' knew ' the universe was not expanding , it may be that he was right all along .
Scientific details :
The results include 60 new type Ia supernovae discovered on the Cerro - Tololo Interamerican Observatory 4 m telescope in an ongoing survey that so far has lasted four years .
In order to follow up these discoveries the team uses some of the biggest telescopes in the world : the 8.2 m VLT ( Very Large Telescope ) run by the European Southern Observatory and the 6 m Magellan telescope ( both in Chile ) , the 8 m Keck telescope and the 10 m Gemini telescope ( both in Hawaii ) .
The ESSENCE team includes 38 top researchers from many different countries on four continents .
The primary aim of the experiment is to measure the ' dark energy ' - the thing that is causing the acceleration of the universe - to better than 10 % .
The feature of this dark energy that we measure is its ' equation of state ' .
This also allows us to check whether our theory of gravity needs modification .
So far it looks like our theory is correct and that the strange acceleration of the expansion of the universe can be explained by Einstein 's ' cosmological constant ' .
In modern terms the cosmological constant is viewed as a quantum mechanical phenomenon called the ' energy of the vacuum ' .
In other words , the energy of empty space .
It is this energy that is causing the universe to accelerate .
The new data shows that none of the fancy new theories that have been proposed in the last decade are necessary to explain the acceleration .
Rather , vacuum energy is the most likely cause and the expansion history of the universe can be explained by simply adding this constant background of acceleration into the normal theory of gravity .

Vampire sea spiders suck on prey
ABC Science Online
Weird spider - like creatures that live at the bottom of the ocean and use a ' straw ' to suck on their prey are baffling scientists .
These sea spiders , some of which are blind , are defying scientific classification .
Marine zoologist Dr Claudia Arango of the Australian Museum in Sydney agrees they are arthropods , but which type ?
She presented her research on these unusual and poorly understood animals recently at the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research meeting in Hobart .
" They are very weird looking animals , " says Arango .
For over 100 years , scientists have been puzzling over how exactly to classify sea spiders or pycnogonids .
They crawl along the bottom of the sea floor , sometimes more than 6000 to 7000 metres down , where they live in the dark , feeding on slow - moving soft - bodied sponges and sea slugs .
The creatures are segmented and have an exoskeleton , which makes them an arthropod , the same grouping as crustaceans , insects , centipedes and spiders .
But they also have a very strange collection of features , including a unique feeding structure .
" They have a proboscis that 's like a straw that they insert into the animals and suck out the juices , " says Arango .
Such features make it difficult to fit them into any of the known groups of arthropods .
" They look like spiders , but they are not real spiders , " says Arango .
" It 's been very hard to place them in a position within the tree of life . "
Arango has been studying the diversity and evolution of sea spiders .
She has been using DNA and morphology to construct a family tree , using 60 species of sea spiders from all over the world .

Everyone knows that vegetables pack an important nutritional punch and their low - fat content leaves greasy snack foods “ green with envy ” , which is why we as parents are strongly motivated to try to convince our children to eat up all their veggies .
Many parents face a frustrating and common issue though : their children flat out refuse to eat vegetables !
Unfortunately , the days of lying to your kids about the “ magical ” properties of vegetables are long gone .
Nowadays , a simple search on Google reveals that onions do not in fact cause an abundance of chest hair and that eating your carrots will not in fact make you see in the dark .
Therefore , if you are a parent and your kids are reluctant to “ Go Green ” , here are some new age techniques you can employ … before your kitchen turns into a full - fledged war zone !
1 . Try new things .
When dinner is served , all members at the table should be encouraged to sample all the foods that are available .
In other words , Jr. may be reluctant to try the cold slaw salad , but he should at least be encouraged to sample it ( tell him he can even spit it out if he does n’t like it ! ) .
Hopefully , he ’ll like it , but even if he does n’t , he has gotten into the commendable habit of sampling different flavors and textures .
2. Involve them .
Encourage your children to participate in the preparation of the family dinner or at least one particular dish , which contains vegetables .
It ’s more fun to eat your own creation !
As an added bonus , the children who participate in the recipe have familiarity with the ingredients , which makes the dish “ less strange ” .
3 . Be creative .
If a child refuses to eat certain vegetables , then it ’s best not to serve them again right ?
Wrong .
If your children do not like a vegetable served in a particular manner , try preparing it with a completely different recipe .
For example , my 6 - year - old daughter refused to eat zucchini that was sautéed with butter .
However , when I fried it lightly and topped it with spaghetti sauce , she ate it all up .
Granted , the nutritional value is stunted when the zucchini is fried , however , it ’s a start …
4. Employ “ sneaky tactics ” .
My sister ’s 5 - year - old son flatly refuses to eat vegetables however he will eat pasta with a light sauce .
She adds to the sauce some mashed sweet potato , and he never complains !
A friend of mine also tricks her 9 year old into eating more vegetables by adding a bit of V8 juice to his mashed potatoes instead of butter .
He likes the red color it makes them !
Note : Some juices contain juiced vegetables and although do n’t offer the full benefit of a raw vegetable , they do offer a healthy alternative , when used in moderation .
5. Bribe your child .
Yes , you read that correctly !
Try offering your child some incentive to munch on that salad or finish that broccoli .
For example , you might promise your child that when he finishes that salad , you will take some time out of your busy schedule to help him complete his birdhouse or take him to the park .
Note :
Be sure to make good on your promise though or it ’ll be a one - time deal !
6 . Make vegetables fun !
For example , prepare a variety of dipping sauces and line them up next to the vegetables ( Hint : Ranch dressing is usually a popular choice with young children , although not the healthiest .
Try substituting yogurt mixed with flavorful herbs instead ) .
Also try preparing works of art on your child ’s plate using colorful vegetables ; the carrot can be a nose , the potatoes can be eyes , corn on the cob for a mouth and so on .
Also , let your kids know that it ’s okay with you if they sometimes eat their veggies with their fingers .
What better way to make it fun !
7 . Plan your attack .
Prepare vegetables ahead of time , so that when your kids need a snack in a rush , they are readily available .
For example , peel and slice some carrots and keep them in your fridge so that the following day , you can throw them on a plate , in a hurry .
Crackers , mozzarella and baby carrots make for a delicious and healthy after - school snack !
Also try washing , drying and then rolling your lettuce up in damp paper towel for storing in the fridge .
This way fresh lettuce is always waiting for sandwiches , wraps etc .
Getting kids to eat all of their vegetables would certainly be ideal but even if you can get them to eat some , you ’re one step ahead of most parents .
Best of success to you !

DIGG THIS
Anyone who has done even a little reading about the theory and practice of war , whether in political theory , international relations , theology , history , or common journalistic commentary , has encountered a sentence of the form “ war is horrible , but . . . . ”
In this construction , the phrase that follows the conjunction explains why a certain war was ( or now is or someday will be ) an action that ought to have been ( or ought to be ) undertaken notwithstanding its admitted horrors .
The frequent , virtually formulaic use of this expression attests that nobody cares to argue , say , that war is a beautiful , humane , uplifting , or altogether splendid course of action and therefore the more often people fight , the better .
Some time ago ―in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century , for example ―one might encounter a writer , such as Theodore Roosevelt , who forthrightly affirmed that war is manly and invigorating for the nation and the soldiers that engage in it : war keeps a nation from “ getting soft . ”
Although this opinion is no longer expressed openly with great frequency , something akin to it may yet survive , as Chris Hedges argues in War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning ( 2002 ) .
Nowadays , however , even those who find meaning for their lives by involvement in war , perhaps only marginal or symbolic involvement , do not often extol war as such .
Instead , they are apt to justify a nation ’s engagement in war by calling attention to alternative , even more horrible outcomes that , retrospectively , would have occurred if the nation had not gone to war or , prospectively , will occur if it does not go to war .
This seemingly reasonable “ balancing ” form of argument often sounds stronger than it really is , especially when it is made more or less in passing .
People may easily be swayed by a weak argument , however , if they fail to appreciate the defects of the typically expressed “ horrible , but ” apology for war .
Rather than plow through various sources on my bookshelves to compile examples , I have availed myself of modern technology .
A Google search for the exact term “ war is horrible but ” on September 11 , 2006 , identified 1,450 instances .
Rest assured that this sample is smaller than the entire universe of such usage ―some texts have yet to be captured electronically .
Among the examples I drew from the World Wide Web are the following fourteen statements .
I identify the person who made the statement only when he is well - known .
(1) “ War is horrible .
But no one wants to see a world in which a regime with no regard whatsoever for international law ―for the welfare of its own people―or for the will of the United Nations ―has weapons of mass destruction . ” [ U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage ]
This statement was part of a speech Armitage gave on January 21 , 2003 , shortly before the U.S. government unleashed its armed forces to wreak “ shock and awe ” on the nearly defenseless people of Iraq .
The speech repeated the Bush administration ’s standard prewar litany of accusations , including several claims later revealed to be false , and so it cannot be viewed as anything but bellicose propaganda .
Yet it does not differ much from what many others were saying at the time .
On its own terms , the statement scarcely serves to justify a war .
A regime ’s disregard of international law , its own people ’s wellbeing , and the will of the United Nations , combined with possession of weapons of mass destruction ―these conditions apply to several nations .
They no more justify a military attack on Iraq than they justify an attack on Pakistan , France , India , Russia , China , the United Kingdom , Israel or , for that matter , the United States itself .
(2) “ War is terrible , war is horrible , but war is also at times necessary and the only means of stopping evil . ”
The only means of stopping evil ?
How can such an exclusivity exist ?
Has evil conduct never been stopped except by war ?
For example , has shunning ―exclusion from commerce , financial systems , communications , transportation systems , and other means of international cooperation ―never served to discipline an evil nation - state ?
Might it do so if seriously tried ?
Why must we leap to the conclusion that only war will serve , when other measures have scarcely even been considered , much less been seriously attempted ?
If war is really as horrible as everyone says , then it would seem that we have a moral obligation to try very hard to achieve the desired suppression of evil - doing by means other than resort to warfare , which is itself always a manifest evil , even when it is the lesser one .
(3) “ No news shows [ during World War II ] were showing German civilians getting fried and saying how sad it was .
It was war against butchers and war is horrible , but it ’s war , and to defend human decency , sometimes war is necessary . ”
[ Ben Stein ]
Stein is a knowledgeable man .
He surely knows that the U.S. government imposed draconian censorship of war news during World War II .
Perhaps the censors had their reasons for keeping scenes of incinerated German civilians away from the U.S. public .
After all , even if Americans in general had extraordinarily cruel and callous attitudes toward German civilians during the war , many Americans had relatives and friends in Germany .
Stein appears to lump all Germans into the class of “ butchers ” against whom he claims the war was being waged .
He certainly must understand , however , that many persons in Germany ―children , for example ―were not butchers and bore absolutely no responsibility for the actions of government officials who were .
Yet these innocents , too , suffered the dire effects of , among other things , the terror bombing the U.S. and British air forces inflicted on many German cities .
To say , as Stein and many others have said , that “ war is war ” gets us nowhere ; in a moral sense , this tautology warrants nothing .
Evidently , however , many people consider all moral questions about the conduct of war to have been settled simply by their having labeled or by their having accepted someone else ’s labeling of certain actions as a “ war . ”
Having uttered this exculpatory incantation over the state ’s organized violence , they believe that all transgressions associated with it are automatically absolved ―as they say , “ all ’s fair in love and war . ”
It does not help matters that regimes treat some of the most egregious transgressors as heroes .
Finally , Stein ’s claim that “ to defend human decency , sometimes war is necessary ” is , at best , paradoxical , because it says in effect that sometimes human indecency , which war itself surely exemplifies , is necessary to defend human decency .
Perhaps he had in mind the backfires that fire fighters sometimes set to help them extinguish fires .
This metaphor , however , seems farfetched in connection with war .
It is difficult to think of anything that consists of so many different forms of indecency as war does .
Not only is its essence the large - scale wreaking of death and destruction , but its side effects and its consequences in the aftermath run a wide range of evils as well .
Whatever else war may be , it surely qualifies as the most indecent type of action people can take : it reduces them to the level of the most ferocious beasts and often accomplishes little more than setting the stage for the next , reactive round of savagery .
In any event , considered strictly as a way of sustaining human decency , it gets a failing grade every time , because it invariably magnifies the malignity that it purports to resist .
(4) “ War is horrible , but slavery is worse . ” [ Winston Churchill ]
Maybe slavery is worse , but maybe it ’s not ; it depends on the conditions of the war and the conditions of the slavery .
Moreover , if one seeks to justify a war on the strength of this statement , he had best be completely certain that but for war , slavery will be the outcome .
In many wars , however , slavery was never a possibility , because neither side sought to enslave its enemy .
Many wars have been fought for limited objectives , if only because more ambitious objectives appeared unattainable or not worth the cost .
No war in U.S. history may be accurately seen as having been waged to prevent the enslavement of the American people .
Some people talk that way about World War II or , if it be counted as a war , the Cold War , but such talk has no firm foundation in facts .
(5) “ You may think that the Iraq war is horrible , but there may be some times when you can justify [ going to war ] . ”
Perhaps war can be justified at “ some times , ” but that statement itself in no way shows that the Iraq war can be justified , and it seems all too obvious that it can not be .
If it could have been justified , the government that launched it would not have had to resort to a succession of lame excuses for waging it , each such excuse being manifestly inadequate or simply false .
The obvious insufficiency of any of the grounds put forward explains why so many of us have been struggling to divine exactly what did impel the Bush administration ’s rush to war .
(6) “ War is horrible , but sometimes we need to fight . ”
Need to fight for what ?
The objective dictates whether war is a necessary means for its attainment .
Certainly , if the objective was to preserve Americans ’ freedoms and “ way of life , ” the U.S. government did not need to fight most of the enemies against whom it waged war historically .
Remarkably , the only time the enemy actually posed such a threat , which was during the Cold War , the United States did not go to war against that enemy directly , although it did fight ( unnecessarily ) the enemy ’s less - menacing allies , North Korea , China , and North Vietnam .
In the other wars , the United States might well have remained at peace had U.S. leaders been interested in peace rather than committed to warfare .
(7) “ Of course war is horrible , but it will always exist , and I ’m sick of these pacifist [ expletive deleted ] ruining any shred of political decency that they can manage . ”
Many people have observed that wars have recurred for thousands of years and therefore will probably continue to occur from time to time .
The unstated insinuation seems to be that in view of war ’s long - running recurrence , nothing can be done about it , so we should all grow up and admit that war is as natural , and hence as unobjectionable , as the sun ’s rising in the east each morning .
It ’s “ how the world works . ”
This outlook contains at least two difficulties .
First , many other conditions also have had long - running histories : for example , reliance on astrologers as experts in foretelling the future ; affliction with cancers ; submission to rulers who claim to dominate their subjects by virtue of divine descent or appointment ; and many others .
Eventually , people overcame each of these long - established conditions .
Science revealed that astrology is nothing more than an elaborate body of superstition ; scientists and doctors discovered how to control or cure certain forms of cancer ; and citizens learned to laugh at the pretensions of rulers who claim divine descent or appointment ( at least , they had learned until George W. Bush successfully revived the doctrine among the benighted rubes who form the Republican base ) .
Because wars spring in large part from people ’s stupidity , ignorance , and gullibility , it is conceivable that alleviation of these conditions might have the effect of diminishing warfare , if not of eliminating it altogether .
Second , even if nothing can be done about the periodic outbreak of war , it does not follow that we ought to shut up and accept it without complaint .
No serious person expects , say , that evil can be eliminated from the human condition , yet we condemn it and struggle against its expression in human affairs .
We strive to divert potential evildoers from their malevolent course of action .
Scientists and doctors continue to seek cures for cancers that have afflicted humanity for millennia .
Even conditions that cannot be wholly eliminated can sometimes be mitigated , but only if someone tries to mitigate them .
Finally , whatever else one might say about the pacifists , one may surely say that if everyone were a pacifist , no wars would occur .
Pacifism may be criticized on various grounds , as it always has been and still is , but to say that pacifists “ lack any shred of political decency ” seems itself to be indecent .
Remember : war is horrible , as everybody now concedes but many immediately put out of mind .
(8) “ Every war is horrible , but freedom and justice cannot be allowed to be defeated by tyranny and injustice .
As hideous as war is it is not as hideous as the things it can stop and prevent . ”
This statement assumes that war amounts to a contest between freedom and justice on one side and tyranny and injustice on the other .
One scarcely commits the dreaded sin of moral equivalence , however , by observing that few wars present such a stark contrast , in which only the children of God fight on one side and only the children of Satan fight on the other .
One reason why war is so horrible is that it invariably drags into its charnel house many ―again , the children are the most undeniable examples ―who must be held blameless for any actions or threats that might have incited the war .
Even if we set aside such clear - cut innocents and consider only persons in the upper echelons of the conflicting sides , it is rare to find all angels on one side and all demons on the other .
In World War II , for example , the Allied states were led by such angels as Winston Churchill , who relished the horrific terror bombing of German cities ; Josef Stalin , one of the greatest mass murderers of all time ; Franklin D. Roosevelt , of whose moral uprightness the less said the better ; and Harry S Truman , who took pleasure in annihilating hundreds of thousands of defenseless Japanese noncombatants first with incendiary bombs and ultimately with nuclear weapons .
Yes , the other side had Adolf Hitler , whose fiendishness I have no desire to deny , but the overall character of the leadership on both sides sufficiently attests that there was enough evil to go around .
As for the ordinary soldiers , of course , everyone who knows anything about actual combat appreciates that once engaged , the men on both sides quickly become brutalized and routinely commit atrocities of every imaginable size and shape .
So , it is far from clear that war is always or even typically “ not as hideous as the things it can stop and prevent . ”
On many occasions , refusal to resort to war , even in the face of undeniable evils , may still be the better course .
When World War II ended , leaving more than 62 million dead , most of them civilians , and hundreds of millions displaced , homeless , wounded , sick , or impoverished , the survivors might well have doubted whether conditions would have been even more terrible had the war not taken place .
( The dead were unavailable for comment . )
To make matters worse , owing to the war , the monster Stalin had gained control of an enormous area stretching from Czechoslovakia to Korea ; and soon , because of the defeat of the Japanese Empire , the monster Mao Zedong would take complete control of China and impose a murderous reign of terror on the world ’s most populous country that cost the lives of perhaps another 60 million persons ( as many as 77 million , according to one plausible estimate ) .
It is difficult to believe that the situation in China would have been so awful even if the Japanese had succeeded in incorporating the Chinese into the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere .
( 9 ) “ I grant you the war is horrible , but it is a war , after all .
You have to compare apples to apples , and when I do that , I see this war is going well . ”
This statement about the current war in Iraq exemplifies what some call the not - as - bad - as - Hamburg - Dresden - Tokyo - Hiroshima - Nagasaki defense of brutal warfare .
If we make such pinnacles of savagery our standard , then sure enough , everything else pales by comparison .
But why should anyone adopt such a grotesque standard ?
To do so is to concede that anything less horrible than the very worst cases is “ not so bad . ”
In truth , warfare ’s effects are sufficiently hideous at every level .
What the Israelis have been doing in Lebanon recently bears no comparison with the February 1945 Allied attack on Dresden , of course , but the sight of even one little Lebanese child , dead , her bloody body gruesomely mangled by an explosion , ought to be enough to give pause to any proponent of resort to war .
Try putting yourself in the place of that child ’s mother .
( 10 ) “ [ Certain writers ] all agreed that war is horrible but said the Bible gives government the authority to wage war to save innocent lives . ”
Biblical scholars have been disputing what Christians may and may not do with regard to war for almost two thousand years .
The dispute continues today , so the matter is certainly not resolved among devout Christians .
Even if Christians may go to war to save innocent lives , however , a big question remains : is the government going to war for this purpose or for one of the countless other purposes that lead governments to make war ?
Saving the innocent makes an appealing excuse , but often , if not always , it is only a pretext .
“ Just war ” writers from Augustine to Thomas Aquinas to Grotius to the latest contributors have agonized over the ready availability of such pretexts and warned against the wickedness of advancing them when the real motives are less justifiable or even plainly immoral .
For centuries , European combatants on all sides invoked God ’s blessing for their wars against one another .
As recently as World War II , the Germans had “ Gott Mit Uns , ” a declaration that adorned the belt buckles of Wehrmacht soldiers in both world wars .
Strange to say , in 1917 and 1918 , Christian ministers of the gospel in pulpits across the United States were assuring the congregations that their nation - state was engaged in a “ war for righteousness ” ( the title of Richard M. Gamble ’s splendid book about this repellent episode ) .
So invoking Biblical authority really does n’t get us very far : the enemy may be invoking the same authority .
Nowadays , of course , one side invokes the Jewish and Christian God , whereas the other calls upon the blessing of Allah .
Whether this bifurcated manner of gaining divine sanction for the commission of mass murder and mayhem represents progress or not , I leave to the learned theologians .
( 11 ) “ War is horrible but thank God we have men and women who are willing and able to protect our people and our freedom . ”
These men and women may be willing and able to supply such protection , but do they ?
Our leaders constantly proclaim that their wars are aimed at protecting us and our freedoms ―” we go forward , ” declares George W. Bush , “ to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world ” ―but one has to wonder , considering that in the entire history of warfare in the United States , each war ( with the possible exception of the War for Independence ) has left the general run of the American people with fewer freedoms after the war than they enjoyed before the war .
Every time the rulers set out to protect the village , they decide that the best way to do so is to destroy it in the process .
Call me a cynic , but I ca n’t help wondering whether protection of the people and their freedoms was really the state ’s objective , and after forty - five years of thinking about the matter , I ’ve come up with some pretty attractive alternative hypotheses .
One of them , as Marine General Smedley Butler famously expressed it , is that war is a racket , but I have others , too .
( 12 ) “ War is horrible but some economic good came out of World War II .
It brought the United States out of one of the greatest slumps in history , the Great Depression . ”
This venerable broken - window fallacy refuses to die , no matter how many times a stake is driven through its heart .
Most Americans believe it .
Worse , because less excusable , nearly all historians and even a large majority of economists do so as well .
I ’ve been whacking this nonsense for several decades , but so far as I can tell , I ’ve scarcely made a dent in it .
Should anyone care to see a complete counterargument , I recommend the first five chapters of my book Depression , War , and Cold War ( 2006 ) .
( 13 ) “ War is horrible , but whining about it is worse .
Either put up or shut up . ”
Some people always reject the denunciation of any familiar social institution or conduct unless the denouncer offers a “ constructive criticism , ” that is , unless he puts forward a promising plan to eliminate the evil he denounces .
I admit at once that I have discovered no cure for the human tendency to resort to war when much more intelligent and humane alternatives are available .
I ’m trying to convince people that on nearly all occasions , they are allowing their rulers to bamboozle them and to turn them into cannon fodder for purposes that serve the rulers ’ interests , not the people ’s .
I ’m getting nowhere in this effort , but I ’m going to keep trying .
I ’m also going to continue to denounce stupidity , ignorance , ugliness , bullying , bad breath , and rap music , even though I do n’t expect to succeed in those quests , either .
( 14 ) “ Of course , war is horrible , but at present , it ’s still the only guarantee to maintain peace . ”
The statement as it stands is self - contradictory because it affirms that the only way to make sure that we will have peace is to go to war .
Perhaps , if we are feeling generous , we may interpret the statement as the time - honored exhortation that to maintain the peace , we should prepare for war , hoping that by dissuading any aggressor from moving against us , our preparation will preserve the peace .
Although this policy is not self - contradictory , it is dangerous , because the preparation we make for war may itself move us toward actually going to war .
For example , preparation for war may entail increasing the number of military officers and allowing the top brass to exert greater influence in policy making .
Those officers may see that without war , their careers will go nowhere , and hence they may tilt their advice to civilian authorities toward risking or actually making war , even when peace might easily be preserved .
Likewise , military suppliers may use their political influence to foster international suspicions and fears that otherwise might be allayed .
Wars are not good for business in general , but they are good for the munitions contractors .
Certain legislators may develop an interest in militarism ; perhaps it helps them to attract campaign contributions from arms contractors , veterans ’ groups , and members of the national guard and military reserve organizations .
Pretty soon we may find ourselves dealing , as President Dwight D. Eisenhower did , with a military - industrial - congressional complex , and we may find that it packs a great deal of political punch and acts in a way that , all things considered , diminishes the chances of keeping the country at peace .
From the foregoing commentary , a recurrent theme may be extracted : those who argue that “ war is horrible , but . . . ” nearly always use this rhetorical construction not to frame a genuinely serious and honest balancing of reasons for and against war , but only to acknowledge what cannot be hidden ―that war is horrible ―and then to pass on immediately to an affirmation that notwithstanding the horrors , whose actual forms and dimensions they neither specify nor examine in detail , a certain war ought to be fought .
The reasons given to justify its being fought , however , generally amount to claims that cannot support a strong case .
Often they are not even bona fide reasons , but mere propaganda , especially when they emanate from official sources .
Sometimes they rest on historical errors , such as the claim that the armed forces in past wars have somehow kept foreigners from depriving us of our liberties .
Often the case for war rests on ill - founded speculation about what will happen if we do not go to war .
People need to recognize , however , that government officials and their running dogs in the media , among others , are not soothsayers .
None of us knows the future , but these interested parties lack a disinterested motive for making a careful , well - informed forecast .
They have , as the saying goes , an agenda of their own .
“ The best and the brightest ” of our leaders and their kept experts generally amount to little more than what C. Wright Mills called “ crackpot realists , ” and on occasion , such as the present one , they do n’t meet even that standard .
Hence , lately , these geniuses , equipped with all that secret information they constantly emphasize their critics do n’t possess , have put forward forecasts of a “ cake walk ” through Iraq , a “ slam dunk ” on finding lots of weapons of mass destruction there , and liberal - democratic dominoes falling across the Middle East ―forecasts that fit more comfortably in a lunatic asylum than in a discussion among rational , well - informed people .
The government generally relies on marshalling patriotic emotion and reflexive loyalty rather than on making a sensible case for going to war .
Much of the discussion that does take place is a sham , because the government officials who pretend to listen to other opinions , as U.S. leaders did most recently during 2002 and early 2003 , have already decided what they are going to do , no matter what other people may say .
The rulers know that once the war starts , nearly everybody will fall into line and “ support the troops . ”
If someone demands that the skeptic about war offer constructive criticism , here is my proposal : always insist that the burden of proof rest heavily on the warmonger .
This protocol , which is now anything but standard operating procedure , is eminently judicious because , as we all recognize , war is horrible .
Given its horrors , which in reality are much greater than most people appreciate , it only makes sense that those who propose to enter into those horrors make a very , very strong case for doing so .
If they cannot ―and I submit that they almost never can ―then people will serve their interests best by declining an invitation to war .
As a rule , the most rational , humane , and auspicious course of action is indeed to give peace a chance .
The Best of Robert Higgs
Up to 300 oilmen at the GO - EXPO in Calgary , Canada witnessed an unusual presentation about turning human flesh into fuel by ' representatives of Exxon and the National Petroleum Council ( NPC ) . '
The two ' representatives ' turned out to be pranksters from the civil disobedience group The Yes Men .
Conference organisers billed the speech by a ' NPC rep ' as a major highlight .
The real NPC , which is headed by former ExxonMobil CEO Lee Raymond , regularly consults with the White House on energy policy .
The ' NPC rep ' was expected to present findings from a long - awaited study chaired by Mr Raymond in conjunction with the US Department of Energy .
The fake speech , delivered by ' Shepard Wolff ' ( aka Andy Bichlbaum of the Yes Men ) , unveiled a new Exxon oil product called Vivoleum .
' We need something like whales , but infinitely more abundant ' , said ' Mr Wolff ' as he showed 3D animations of human flesh being rendered into the fuel .
' Vivoleum works in perfect synergy with the continued expansion of fossil fuel production ' , noted ' Exxon rep Florian Osenberg ' ( aka Yes Man Mike Bonanno ) .
He added : ' With more fossil fuels comes a greater chance of
disaster , but that means more feedstock for Vivoleum .
Fuel will
continue to flow for those of us left . '
The Yes men also lit ' commemorative candles ' in honour of an ' Exxon janitor ' who died as a result of cleaning up a
toxic spill .
The audience started to realise the prank when the janitor , in a video tribute , announced that he wished to be transformed into candles after his death .
The two Yes Men were then removed from the stage , but stayed in character when interviewed by journalists outside .
They were not charged by police after officers determined no major infractions had been committed .
Exploiting interactions between food and drugs could dramatically lower the rapidly rising costs of several anticancer drugs , and perhaps many other medications , two cancer - pharmacology specialists suggest in a commentary in the July 16 , 2007 , issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology .
University of Chicago oncologists Mark Ratain , MD , and Ezra Cohen , MD , call attention to the flip side of recent studies showing how certain foods can alter absorption or delay breakdown of precisely targeted anti-cancer drugs .
Instead of seeing such studies as highlighting a dosing problem , Ratain and Cohen argue that results like this one should point researchers toward a partial solution , a novel way to decrease medication costs while increasing benefits from these effective but expensive drugs .
The commentary was inspired by a study presented in June at the American Society for Clinical Oncology .
Researchers from Dartmouth showed that taking the breast cancer drug lapatinib ( TYKERB ) with food -- instead of on an empty stomach as suggested on the label - - resulted in more of the drug being absorbed and available to treat the cancer .
Patients currently take five 250 mg lapatinib tablets on an empty stomach .
The study found that taking the drug with a meal increased the bioavailability of the drug by 167 percent .
Taking the drug with a high - fat meal boosted levels by 325 percent .
" Simply by changing the timing , taking this medication with a meal instead of on an empty stomach , we could potentially use 40 percent ( or even less ) of the drug , " said Ratain .
" Since lapatinib costs about $ 2,900 a month , this could save each patient $ 1,740 or more a month . "
Topping off that meal with grapefruit juice , " which may also increase plasma concentrations " according to the package insert , could increase the savings to 80 percent , the authors suggest , " minus the cost of the food and juice . "

" We expect the one 250 mg lapatinib pill accompanied by food and washed down with a glass of grapefruit juice may yield plasma concentrations comparable to five 250 mg pills on an empty stomach , " Ratain said .
Such a " value meal , " the authors add , may have other benefits .
The major toxicity associated with lapatinib is diarrhea , probably caused by unabsorbed drug .
So taking a lower dose with food should " reduce the amount of unabsorbed drug , and therefore theoretically also reduce the frequency and severity of diarrhea . "
Patients should NEVER launch such experiments on their own , the authors caution .
Such food - drug combinations should be studied to assess the effects , note person - to - person variations , and enable physicians to predict how individual patients will take up and metabolize specific drugs in the presence of certain foods .
" The one thing that should not be anticipated is an efficacy study by lapatinib's sponsor , " the authors write .
Such studies could be mounted by other entities , however , such as the Federal government , other payers or advocacy groups .
Ratain and Cohen are currently conducting such a study , a phase I trial of the combination of oral sirolimus ( rapamycin ) taken with grapefruit juice , which contains substances that delay the breakdown of many drugs .
Dozens , perhaps hundreds , of drugs ought to be studied in this way , the authors said .
" If we understood the relationship between , say , grapefruit juice and common drugs , such as the statins , which taken daily by millions of people to prevent heart disease , we could save a fortune in drug costs , " Cohen said .
" And patients would get a little vitamin C to boot . "
" The rapidly escalating price of medications ( especially for cancer and other life - threatening diseases ) has provided incentives to explore pharmacological approaches to lower the costs of drugs , " Ratain and Cohen conclude .
" As we enter an era of ' targeted ' anticancer agents with a monthly cost measured in thousands of dollars , we should view drug - drug or drug - food interactions as opportunities to lower costs . "
There is a great discussion about profiling going on in the comments to the previous post .
To help , here is what I wrote on the subject in Beyond Fear ( pp. 133-7 ) :
Good security has people in charge .
People are resilient .
People can improvise .
People can be creative .
People can develop on - the - spot solutions .
People can detect attackers who cheat , and can attempt to maintain security despite the cheating .
People can detect passive failures and attempt to recover .
People are the strongest point in a security process .
When a security system succeeds in the face of a new or coordinated or devastating attack , it ’s usually due to the efforts of people .
On 14 December 1999 , Ahmed Ressam tried to enter the U.S. by ferryboat from Victoria Island , British Columbia .
In the trunk of his car , he had a suitcase bomb .
His plan was to drive to Los Angeles International Airport , put his suitcase on a luggage cart in the terminal , set the timer , and then leave .
The plan would have worked had someone not been vigilant .
Ressam had to clear customs before boarding the ferry .
He had fake ID , in the name of Benni Antoine Noris , and the computer cleared him based on this ID .
He was allowed to go through after a routine check of his car ’s trunk , even though he was wanted by the Canadian police .
On the other side of the Strait of Juan de Fuca , at Port Angeles , Washington , Ressam was approached by U.S. customs agent Diana Dean , who asked some routine questions and then decided that he looked suspicious .
He was fidgeting , sweaty , and jittery .
He avoided eye contact .
In Dean ’s own words , he was acting “ hinky . ”
More questioning — there was no one else crossing the border , so two other agents got involved — and more hinky behavior .
Ressam ’s car was eventually searched , and he was finally discovered and captured .
It was n’t any one thing that tipped Dean off ; it was everything encompassed in the slang term “ hinky . ”
But the system worked .
The reason there was n’t a bombing at LAX around Christmas in 1999 was because a knowledgeable person was in charge of security and paying attention .
There ’s a dirty word for what Dean did that chilly afternoon in December , and it ’s profiling .
Everyone does it all the time .
When you see someone lurking in a dark alley and change your direction to avoid him , you ’re profiling .
When a storeowner sees someone furtively looking around as she fiddles inside her jacket , that storeowner is profiling .
People profile based on someone ’s dress , mannerisms , tone of voice … and yes , also on their race and ethnicity .
When you see someone running toward you on the street with a bloody ax , you do n’t know for sure that he ’s a crazed ax murderer .
Perhaps he ’s a butcher who ’s actually running after the person next to you to give her the change she forgot .
But you ’re going to make a guess one way or another .
That guess is an example of profiling .
To profile is to generalize .
It ’s taking characteristics of a population and applying them to an individual .
People naturally have an intuition about other people based on different characteristics .
Sometimes that intuition is right and sometimes it ’s wrong , but it ’s still a person ’s first reaction .
How good this intuition is as a countermeasure depends on two things : how accurate the intuition is and how effective it is when it becomes institutionalized or when the profile characteristics become commonplace .
One of the ways profiling becomes institutionalized is through computerization .
Instead of Diana Dean looking someone over , a computer looks the profile over and gives it some sort of rating .
Generally profiles with high ratings are further evaluated by people , although sometimes countermeasures kick in based on the computerized profile alone .
This is , of course , more brittle .
The computer can profile based only on simple , easy - to - assign characteristics : age , race , credit history , job history , et cetera .
Computers do n’t get hinky feelings .
Computers also can’t adapt the way people can .
Profiling works better if the characteristics profiled are accurate .
If erratic driving is a good indication that the driver is intoxicated , then that ’s a good characteristic for a police officer to use to determine who he ’s going to pull over .
If furtively looking around a store or wearing a coat on a hot day is a good indication that the person is a shoplifter , then those are good characteristics for a store owner to pay attention to .
But if wearing baggy trousers is n’t a good indication that the person is a shoplifter , then the store owner is going to spend a lot of time paying undue attention to honest people with lousy fashion sense .
In common parlance , the term “ profiling ” does n’t refer to these characteristics .
It refers to profiling based on characteristics like race and ethnicity , and institutionalized profiling based on those characteristics alone .
During World War II , the U.S. rounded up over 100,000 people of Japanese origin who lived on the West Coast and locked them in camps ( prisons , really ) .
That was an example of profiling .
Israeli border guards spend a lot more time scrutinizing Arab men than Israeli women ; that ’s another example of profiling .
In many U.S. communities , police have been known to stop and question people of color driving around in wealthy white neighborhoods ( commonly referred to as “ DWB ” — Driving While Black ) .
In all of these cases you might possibly be able to argue some security benefit , but the trade - offs are enormous :
Honest people who fit the profile can get annoyed , or harassed , or arrested , when they ’re assumed to be attackers .
For democratic governments , this is a major problem .
It ’s just wrong to segregate people into “ more likely to be attackers ” and “ less likely to be attackers ” based on race or ethnicity .
It ’s wrong for the police to pull a car over just because its black occupants are driving in a rich white neighborhood .
It ’s discrimination .
But people make bad security trade - offs when they ’re scared , which is why we saw Japanese internment camps during World War II , and why there is so much discrimination against Arabs in the U.S. going on today .
That does n’t make it right , and it does n’t make it effective security .
Writing about the Japanese internment , for example , a 1983 commission reported that the causes of the incarceration were rooted in “ race prejudice , war hysteria , and a failure of political leadership . ”
But just because something is wrong does n’t mean that people wo n’t continue to do it .
Ethics aside , institutionalized profiling fails because real attackers are so rare : Active failures will be much more common than passive failures .
The great majority of people who fit the profile will be innocent .
At the same time , some real attackers are going to deliberately try to sneak past the profile .
During World War II , a Japanese American saboteur could try to evade imprisonment by pretending to be Chinese .
Similarly , an Arab terrorist could dye his hair blond , practice an American accent , and so on .
Profiling can also blind you to threats outside the profile .
If U.S. border guards stop and search everyone who ’s young , Arab , and male , they ’re not going to have the time to stop and search all sorts of other people , no matter how hinky they might be acting .
On the other hand , if the attackers are of a single race or ethnicity , profiling is more likely to work ( although the ethics are still questionable ) .
It makes real security sense for El Al to spend more time investigating young Arab males than it does for them to investigate Israeli families .
In Vietnam , American soldiers never knew which local civilians were really combatants ; sometimes killing all of them was the security solution they chose .
If a lot of this discussion is abhorrent , as it probably should be , it ’s the trade - offs in your head talking .
It ’s perfectly reasonable to decide not to implement a countermeasure not because it does n’t work , but because the trade - offs are too great .
Locking up every Arab - looking person will reduce the potential for Muslim terrorism , but no reasonable person would suggest it .
( It ’s an example of “ winning the battle but losing the war . ” )
In the U.S. , there are laws that prohibit police profiling by characteristics like ethnicity , because we believe that such security measures are wrong ( and not simply because we believe them to be ineffective ) .
Still , no matter how much a government makes it illegal , profiling does occur .
It occurs at an individual level , at the level of Diana Dean deciding which cars to wave through and which ones to investigate further .
She profiled Ressam based on his mannerisms and his answers to her questions .
He was Algerian , and she certainly noticed that .
However , this was before 9/11 , and the reports of the incident clearly indicate that she thought he was a drug smuggler ; ethnicity probably was n’t a key profiling factor in this case .
In fact , this is one of the most interesting aspects of the story .
That intuitive sense that something was amiss worked beautifully , even though everybody made a wrong assumption about what was wrong .
Human intuition detected a completely unexpected kind of attack .
Humans will beat computers at hinkiness - detection for many decades to come .
And done correctly , this intuition - based sort of profiling can be an excellent security countermeasure .
Dean needed to have the training and the experience to profile accurately and properly , without stepping over the line and profiling illegally .
The trick here is to make sure perceptions of risk match the actual risks .
If those responsible for security profile based on superstition and wrong - headed intuition , or by blindly following a computerized profiling system , profiling wo n’t work at all .
And even worse , it actually can reduce security by blinding people to the real threats .
Institutionalized profiling can ossify a mind , and a person ’s mind is the most important security countermeasure we have .
The American people have been saying " please , please , please end this occupation . "
Congress has been saying " let 's start ending this occupation . "
Now , Iraq 's prime minister says " well , do n't stay on our account . "
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari warned earlier this week of civil war and the government 's collapse if the Americans leave .
But al - Maliki told reporters Saturday , " We say in full confidence that we are able , God willing , to take the responsibility completely in running the security file if the international forces withdraw at any time they want . "
- AP
Another member of the Iraqi government had stronger words about the problems of US involvement :
Al - Suneid , a Shiite lawmaker close to al - Maliki , bristled at the pressure .
He called Thursday 's report " objective , " but added , " this bothers us a lot that the situation looks as if it is an experiment in an American laboratory ( judging ) whether we succeed or fail . "
He also told The Associated Press that al - Maliki has problems with the top U.S. commander Gen. David Petraeus , who works along a " purely American vision . "
He criticized U.S. overtures to Sunni groups in Anbar and Diyala , encouraging former insurgents to join the fight against al - Qaida in Iraq .
" These are gangs of killers , " he said .
So to recap : The American people do n't want the US in Iraq .
The American Congress does n't want the US in Iraq .
The Iraqi government is saying feel free to go .
Bush , meanwhile , is still all about the surge .
Were the Anti-Federalists really paranoid ?
Sandy Levinson
Following World War
Ii , it became fashionable to dismiss the opponents of the Constitution as paranoid or , at least , " men of little faith , " to quote the title of Caroline Robbins 's extremely influential essay .
[ Update : Jack Rakove has reminded me that it was actually Cecilia Kenyon who wrote the essay in question . ]
Instead , the Constitution , if not perfect -- there was the collaboration with slavery , after all - - was far better than its anti-Federalist critics suggested , and the imperfections re slavery were " cured , " or so it has been claimed , by a war that killed 2 % of the American population and added the 13th , 14th , and 15th Amendments to the Constitution .
One of the things that some of the critics were exceedingly suspicious about was the pardoning power .
George Mason , a distinguished Virginian who refused to sign the Constitution because of its lack of a bill of rights , noted that " the President of the United States has the unrestrained Power of granting Pardon for Treason ; which may be sometimes exercised to screen from Punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the Crime , and thereby prevent a Discovery of his own guilt . "
Luther Martin , a somewhat less distinguished but extremely interesting non-signatory from Maryland ( who also raised questions about the collaboration with slavery ) , also objected to the potential " attempt [ of the President ] to assume to himself powers not given by the constitution , and establish himself in regal authority ; in which attempt a provision is made for him to secure from punishment the creatures of his ambition , the associates and abettors of his treasonable practices , by granting them pardons should they be defeated in their attempts to subvert the constitution . "
So how does one assess the pardon of I. Lewis ( " Scooter " ) Libby against these fears expressed by Mason and Martin ( and other anti-federalists ) .
If one could be confident that Bush were being truly " compassionate " in not wishing to take Libby from his family , that might be one thing , but , of course , there 's not a scintilla of evidence that Bush possesses a compassionate disposition in general .
Consider his conduct both as Governor and as President with regard to his use of the pardoning or commutation power , especially in capital cases ; this is not a man who cares one whit about the consequences for actual human beings and their families caught up in the Texas or US legal systems .
More plausible is the view that Libby was indeed part of a cabal engaged , not in " treason , " but in " attempts to subvert the constitution " in a number of insidious ways , including character assassination of anyone so bold to suggest that the Administration was less than trustworthy in its arguments for going to war .
What " Scotter " knows , and is most certainly not talking about , is who were his confederates in this cabal besides the Vice President of the United States .
We have good reason to believe that Karl Rove was also involved , and by that point we 're getting very , very close to the Oval Office .
I really do n't advocate doing away with the pardoning power , because it is important to retain the ability to temper justice with mercy .
But the Libby pardon is ample proof that nothing comes for free , and that we might be well advised to listen to those like Mason and Martin , who did indeed have little faith that our leaders would necessarily exemplify the kind of civic virtue necessary to maintaining a constitutional republic .
For Bush , the " Republican Form of Government " is equivalent to " Government by the Republican Party . "
I do n't think the Framers would have agreed .
Career Sample requirements to break into the game industry
Original image by Toni Blay
For those interested to overcome video game programmer requirements , I previously wrote on working while still in school .
Though game development is a tough field , and it takes more than just computer programming skills , even for student level jobs .
Positions that will contribute to your “ two years of experience ” , and especially “ one shipped title ” are difficult to come by .
For a better perspective , out of 950 Computer Science related jobs advertised at my University , only 3 have to do with game programming ( although , not many students have applied ) .
One , I have mentioned before already .
Clearly , student opportunities for a career in game programming are scarce .
To succeed , one needs to prepare to meet what is looked for .
So I am going to reflect on another video game job posting , and highlight the trends .
Once again , the actual company name is omitted .
Our company has an opening for a bright , talented and passionate co-op student that has always dreamt of a career in the video game industry .
Here is your opportunity !
We offer a competitive salary and benefits package as well as the opportunity to work on the cutting edge of software graphic and interactive program development .
As a programmer on one of the most highly anticipated next - gen console games , you will take on tasks that apply to your interests and skill set .
These can range from engine programming to graphics to gameplay programming , networking to Playstation 3 or Xbox 360 specific coding .
We are looking for individuals near or at the top of their class who are dedicated , enjoy video games and would love to be part of an elite programming team where your efforts will have substantial impact on the outcome of this product .
Sounds demanding , but the game title is indeed highly anticipated .
This gem of a position would look amazing on a resume of anyone looking for a video game developer job .
Lets take a look at the technical requirements :
Working towards BS in Computer Science , Engineering , Mathematics or a related discipline .
A burning desire to write code you can be proud of .
Strong communication skills , work ethic and motivation .
Expertise in C ++.
Previous experience working in a fast paced team environment .
A strong interest in video games .
Must be comfortable working on projects with a large code base and long development cycles .
With bonus points for :
Having worked on personal projects in the domain of game development .
Knowledge of PERL .
Once again C++ is shown to be essential .
It ’s simply fast , so it is still in demand .
Personally I would recommend to stay away from C++ , if you are relativly new to programming – save it for later .
It is much easier to gain your required “ expertise ” once you know what to look for in a language .
Obviously strong interest and passion are required for the field .
For computer programming in general , but especially in the game industry .
Show why you want this job so much !
I am especially excited over the inclusion of the last point : Having worked on personal projects in the domain of game development .
Incidently , this term I have joined University of Waterloo ’s Game Development club .
More info to come .
So the observation remains the same : continue building up your programming experience .
The concepts are language independent , but experience is still required .
C# is good , but C++ is still more common in the industry ( for now ) .
Have something to show for yourself – a complete personal game project will demonstrate many of your traits .
And , of course , passion for what you do !
Good luck .

Here 's an eight - minute video that shows you a grandiose idea somebody dreamed up : building a 3000 - foot - tall pyramid in Tokyo Bay .
This megacity would be so tall , and would have such tremendous volume that 24 80 - story skyscrapers could be suspended within , and people would travel inside it via the tubes that are also supporting the enormous structure .
It 's extreme engineering , indeed .

You gotta feel sorry for those people living in Tokyo , all crammed together like sardines in a can , so maybe this wild idea could give them some elbow room .
To rent the amount of space made by this huge structure , it would cost $ 10 billion a year within the city of Tokyo .
If built , it will be the largest structure in the world .
Go for it !
Living in a Pyramid Random Good Stuff
Kansas ' Rev. Jerry Johnston has a problem .
The pastor of First Family Church in Overland Park , one of the fastest growing megachurches in the country , has been playing fast and loose with the congregation 's money , according to a story in this morning 's Kansas City Star .
There 's evidence that Jerry and Christie Johnston 's Overland Park house , originally purchased as a parsonage by the ministry , was sold and a lavish new house in upscale Hallbrook Farms was put into the couple 's names .
A number of other financial irregularities -- all of which amount to treating the ministry 's money as his own -- are being investigated by the attorney general 's office .
A previous Kansas City Star article reports the Johnston 's live lavishly -- the couple live in a $ 586,400 house , with an in - ground swimming pool and high - tech security system , take expensive vacations several times a year , and drive expensive sport utility vehicles -- despite demanding that church members sacrifice financially for the ministry .
“ Maybe we ’re going to decide to wear the same pair of pants for a year because we ’re going to honor God with our finances and we ’re going to get it right , ” Johnston says in a sermon titled “ God ’s Way to Financial Success .
” “ Lordship means I seize the moment regardless of the inconvenience , ” says Johnston in calling on church members to give 10 percent of their incomes to the church .
The Rev. Johnston is a staunch creationist because he thinks that evolution corrupts morals .
His website features a series of " sermonars " with titles such as " Reasons the Bible is Authoritative , " " The Truth About Evolution , " and " Missing Evidence for Evolution .
" Johnston , who used to place the title of " Dr. " in front of his name , is well qualified to evaluate the evidence for and against evolution .
While he does n't exactly have the Ph.D. he once used on church stationary -- he never went to college -- he does have a GED and is reportedly working on a BA at a Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary .
Jerry Falwell gave him an honorary doctorate from Liberty University .
We do n't doubt the good reverend when he says that evolution corrupts morals .
We just wonder about his excuse .
There have been calls for the impeachment of President Bush from certain left - wing groups for years .
For the most part , those calls have been correctly ignored .
Some of the " Impeach Bush " crowd are still stinging from Bill Clinton 's impeachment and yearn to see a Republican president impeached .
Others have major policy differences with the President , and some are still angry at the possibility that Bush was prematurely granted the presidency by the Supreme Court in that " photo - finish " race with Al Gore .
However , a sitting president must never be the target of impeachment proceedings because certain groups disagree with his policies .
Neither can we allow impeachment to be used as a means to overturn an election .
And by all means , we must never allow impeachment to be used for purposes of enacting political revenge .
The U.S. Constitution rightly makes the impeachment process a difficult and arduous one reserved strictly for " Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors . "
( Article . II .
Section .
4 . ) When considering impeachment , the American people , and their representatives in Congress , must answer one question :
Does the conduct , or misconduct , of a sitting president meet constitutional criteria ?
Specifically , is President Bush guilty of treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors ?
The guilty verdict of Vice President Dick Cheney 's Chief of Staff Lewis " Scooter " Libby begs for answers to that question .
As most of us know , Libby was convicted on four counts of perjury and obstruction of justice .
But as one juror put it , Libby was the White House 's " fall guy . "
Remember , Libby was the ultimate White House insider .
He was the Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , assistant to the Vice President for national security affairs , and an assistant to President George W. Bush .
Now it appears that Libby has taken the fall for his two bosses .
But just what does that mean ?
For one thing , it means that the jurors , while judging him guilty of the crimes with which he was charged , saw his higher - ups as equally or more culpable .
One juror , Denis Collins , asked , " What is he [ Libby ] doing here ?
Where 's [ Karl ] Rove ?
Where are these other guys ? "
Several jurors publicly questioned why Vice President Cheney or President Bush were not in the courtroom .
At issue is whether President Bush and Vice President Cheney deliberately manipulated evidence regarding Iraq 's Weapons of Mass Destruction ( WMD ) and whether they deliberately lied to and deceived the American people and Congress in order to invade Iraq .
Of course , all this was brought to light when the White House made the decision to " out " CIA operative Valerie Plame after her husband , Ambassador Joe Wilson , publicly suggested that Bush and Cheney had lied and manipulated evidence in order to launch the Iraq invasion .
To date , no one has been charged with leaking Plame 's identity , but the Libby trial has clearly implicated Bush and Cheney in the whole affair .
The jurors seemed convinced of that much , that is for sure .
It has been reported that George W. Bush began planning an invasion of Iraq almost immediately after being elected president in 2000 , which was long before the 9/11 attacks .
Furthermore , President Bush has since acknowledged that Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks and that it had no WMD capable of threatening the United States .
However , he has constantly blamed " bad intelligence " for the decision to launch the preemptive invasion of Iraq .
The American people and history may forgive a leader for an erroneous decision predicated upon bad intelligence .
However , neither the American people nor history will forgive a leader for deliberately manipulating evidence and lying to Congress in order to satisfy a personal bloodlust .
Therefore , Congress should immediately commission an independent counsel to investigate whether President Bush and Vice President Cheney did indeed manipulate evidence and deliberately lie to the American people .
If that investigation proves that President Bush acted in good faith and with no ulterior motives , his decision to invade Iraq will go down in history as a colossal lapse in judgment .
If , on the other hand , the investigation proves that he manipulated evidence and lied to the American people , his actions most definitely rise to the constitutional standard for impeachment .
We need a thorough investigation to find the truth .

doing what I love ; loving what I do
This is the third part in my series on the “ travelling salesman problem ” ( TSP ) .
Part one covered defining the TSP and utility code that will be used for the various optimisation algorithms I shall discuss .
Part two covered “ hill - climbing ” ( the simplest stochastic optimisation method ) .
getting stuck , because you ’re greedy
As I discussed in the article about hill - climbing it is possible for an algorithm to find a solution that is “ locally optimal ” , but not necessarily “ globally optimal ” .
That is to say we may find ourselves with a solution that is at the top of a local maximum – it ’s the best thing nearby , but it might not be the best thing .
This happens with hill - climbing , because when we are offered the choice between two solutions we always take the best solution .
The algorithm is “ greedy ” .
It ’s also short sighted .
simulated annealing
So instead we could try occasionally choosing something that ’s worse .
By doing that the algorithm can go “ downhill ” sometimes and hopefully reach new areas of the solution landscape .
Taking it ’s name from a metallurgic process , simulated annealing is essentially hill - climbing , but with the ability to go downhill ( sometimes ) .
It introduces a “ temperature ” variable .
When the “ temperature ” is high a worse solution will have a higher chance of being chosen .
It work ’s like this :
pick an initial solution set an initial temperature choose the next neighbour of the current solution : if the neighbour is “ better ” make that neighbour the current solution
if the neighbour is “ worse ” , probabilistically make this neighbour the current solution , based on the current temperature and how much “ worse ” the neighbour is decrease the temperature slightly go to 3 .
By slowly cooling the temperature we become less likely to choose worse solutions over time .
Initially we are able to make some pretty big jumps around the solution landscape .
By the end of a run we ’ll be jumping around less and less .
In fact if we lower the temperature enough we end up with plain old hill - climbing .
probabilistically choosing a neighbour
Below is the Python code to decide if what probability we will assign to moving from a solution with a score of prev_score to a solution with a value of next_score at the current temperature .
def P( prev_score , next_score , temperature ) : if next_score > prev_score : return 1.0 else : return math.exp ( - abs( next_score - prev_score ) / temperature )
To keep later logic simpler I ’m returning 1.0 if next_score is better – so we ’ll always choose better solutions .
When the prev_score is worse we create a probability based on the difference between prev_score and next_score scaled by the current temperature .
If we chart the probabilities versus the difference in scores we get ( with a temperature of 1.0 ) :
As can be seen , for small differences ( relative to the current temperature ) we will have a high probability .
This then tails off very quickly , so solutions that are much worse are increasingly less likely to be chosen .
The net - effect being that solutions that are only a little bit worse are still fairly likely to be chosen .
Much worse solutions may still be chosen , but it ’s much less likely .
the cooling schedule
Temperature is a key part of simulated annealing .
How we lower the temperature over time is therefore very important .
There are a couple of possible approaches , but I ’ll show the one outlined by Kirkpatrick et al :
def kirkpatrick_cooling ( start_temp , alpha ) : T=start_temp while True : yield T T=alpha*T
This is a generator function that takes an initial start temperature ( start_temp ) and returns a series of temperatures that are alpha times the size , where alpha is less than one .
So we end up with a temperature that drops off quite quickly and then slowly decreases to practically nothing .
remembering the best solution
One other minor , but key , implementation detail is saving the best solution we find during the annealing process .
During hill - climbing the current solution was always the best solution found , but simulated annealing will deliberately accept worse solutions at times .
So we need to make sure we do n’t just throw away the best we see .
To avoid complicating the algorithm itself with extra checks of scores etc .
I am going to use a class to wrap the objective function .
I ’ll override the __call__ method of the class , so that I can use the instance of the class like a function – in place of the normal objective function :
class ObjectiveFunction : '' ' class to wrap an objective function and keep track of the best solution evaluated ''' def __init__( self , objective_function ) : self.objective_function=objective_function self.best=None self.best_score=None def __call__(self , solution ) : score=self.objective_function( solution ) if self .
best is None or score > self .
best_score : self.best_score=score self.best=solution return score
We can then access then best and best_score fields when we have finished our annealing .
simulated annealing itself
The code below represents the simulated annealing algorithm .
In many respects it is pretty similar to hill - climbing , but we are also concerned with a current temperature and we have introduced a probabilistic element to choosing the next solution .
def anneal ( init_function , move_operator , objective_function , max_evaluations , start_temp , alpha ) : # wrap the objective function ( so we record the best ) objective_function=ObjectiveFunction( objective_function ) current=init_function ( ) current_score=objective_function(current ) num_evaluations=1 cooling_schedule=kirkpatrick_cooling(start_temp, alpha ) for temperature in cooling_schedule : done = False # examine moves around our current position for next in move_operator ( current ) : if num_evaluations >= max_evaluations : done= True break next_score=objective_function ( next ) num_evaluations +=1 # probablistically accept this solution # always accepting better solutions p=P(current_score , next_score , temperature ) if random.random ( ) < p : current=next current_score=next_score break # see if completely finished if done : break best_score=objective_function.best_score best=objective_function.best return ( num_evaluations , best_score , best )
The parameters are much the same as hill - climbing , but there are two extra specific to simulated annealing :
init_function - the function used to create our initial solution
- the function used to create our initial solution move_operator - the function we use to iterate over all possible " moves " for a given solution
- the function we use to iterate over all possible " moves " for a given solution objective_function - used to assign a numerical score to a solution - how " good " the solution is
- used to assign a numerical score to a solution - how " good " the solution is max_evaluations - used to limit how much search we will perform ( how many times we 'll call the objective_function )
- used to limit how much search we will perform ( how many times we 'll call the ) start_temp - the initial starting temperature for annealing
- the initial starting temperature for annealing alpha - should be less than one .
controls how quickly the temperature reduces
I am also only reducing the temperature after either accepting a new solution or evaluating all neighbours without choosing any of them .
This is done so that temperature will only decrease as we start accepting moves .
As that will be less frequent than just evaluating moves we cooling will happen at a slower pace .
If we are accepting lots of moves then this will drop the temperature quite quickly .
If we are not accepting many moves the temperature will stay steadier - maintaining the likelihood of accepting other " worse " moves .
That latter point is useful , as if we are starting to get stuck on a local maximum the temperature wo n't decrease - hopefully helping us get unstuck .
results
It made sense to compare simulated annealing with hill - climbing , to see whether simulated annealing really helps us to stop getting stuck on local maximums .
I performed 100 runs of each algorithm on my randomly generated 100 city tour , once with 50000 and once with 100000 evaluations .
Both algorithms used the reversed_sections move operator .
For simulated annealing I chose an initial temperature and alpha that seemed to perform well .
evaluations algorithm average s.d. worst best 50000 hill - climbing -4228.50 126.45 -4627.07 -3942.03 50000 annealing ( start_temp=10 , alpha=0.9999 ) - 4145.69 96.56 -4422.04 -3924.34 100000 hill - climbing -4154.25 90.60 -4513.11 -3946.65 100000 annealing ( start_temp=10 , alpha=0.99995 ) -4077.40 71.72 -4294.97 -3907.19
These results seem to show that simulated annealing performed better than hill - climbing .
In fact it can be seen that with just 50000 evaluations , simulated annealing was able to do a slightly better job than hill - climbing with 100000 evaluations !
This makes sense , as when running hill - climbing with logging turned on I could see that after about 50000 evaluations hill - climbing was getting stuck and restarting .
With more evaluations available it was possible to push simulated annealing further still .
However in both cases I had to perform several test runs to find reasonable starting temperatures and alpha values to get these kind of results .
It was quite easy to set these parameters wrong and get much worse results than with hill - climbing .
conclusion
Simulated annealing is a pretty reasonable improvement over hill - climbing .
For a modest amount of extra code ( in this cases 10's of lines ) we are able to address hill - climbing 's fundamental weakness ( getting stuck ) and yield much better results .
However by introducing two extra parameters we have shifted some of the burden in finding good solutions to ourselves .
We have to tune these parameters carefully .
Values that are good for one problem may not work so well for another .
We end up with more " switches to flick " in the hope of making something work .
Next time around I will be discussing evolutionary algorithms , which pursue other ways to avoid getting stuck on local maximums and are also able to combine several solutions to explore new areas of the solution landscape .

“ In the beginning ” .
These words open the text of what 80 % of Americans believe is the true account of the creation of all things .
During a time many people consider a scientific awakening , a theory was offered that denied the biblical account of origin .
Slowly at first , then more rapidly , the scientific community subscribed to this theory as the basis for most schools of thought .
For the past three decades evolutionists have attempted to suppress the creationist viewpoint .
Separation of church and state has become a motto of sorts , albeit taken out of context from its original usage .
This weekend is significant for creationists .
Ken Ham , founder of Answers in Genesis , opens the Creation Museum in Petersburg , KY , near Cincinatti , Ohio .
High production values and factual evidence help to raise the bar on the education of creation .
As expected , the museum , which opened on Memorial Day , has generated much interest for those of us who believe its message .
The evolutionists have been mounting a united front to discourage people , specifically children and young adults who are still developing their beliefs , from visiting this amazing place .
Eugenie Scott has been quoted as saying her fear is that after viewing the exhibits at the museum , young people will say “ Gee , Mrs. Brown , I went to this spiffy museum last summer and they say that everything you ’re teaching me is a lie . ”
Gee , that ’s terrible .
This museum will challenge the thinking of millions of young Americans .
For shame !
How can we stand idly by while young people are presented with more then one viewpoint and are given the opportunity to choose what they think is truth ?
How can we sleep at night whilst something other than the majority opinion is lurking about to give our children something else to consider ?
This , my friends , is what intelligent people call a double standard .
The Czech love - affair with beer goes beyond just drinking it - they bathe in it , have festivals in its honour , and then find new ways of drinking it .
Evan Rail toasts the finest ways to appreciate a Czech brew
The Czech Republic is the home of the first Pilsner , the first Budweiser , and - somewhat unsurprisingly - takes first place for the world 's per-capita beer consumption : more than 281 pints annually for every man , woman and child in the country .
After seven years of sipping his way around , Evan Rail offers his tips on the best of Czech beer culture .
1. Beer baths
There are a few things for which the Czech region of West Bohemia is particularly famous : great lagers , for one , and a storied spa culture , particularly in the gingerbread spa towns of Karlovy Vary ( formerly Carlsbad ) and Marianske lazne ( aka Marienbad ) .
Combine the two and you get the beer bath : a therapeutic dip in a special bathing brew supervised by a licensed balneologist .
To create the Czech Republic 's first beer spa , the Chodovar family brewery installed a half - dozen large tubs in the cellar in early 2006 .
Though there is a hotel on site , if you set out early enough , you can enjoy your relaxing , semi- sticky beer dip , eat a beery lunch at the brewery restaurant and easily make it back to Prague in time for happy hour .
chodovar.cz
2 . Beer festivals
Though largely under - promoted , scores of beer festivals - called pivni slavnosti - light up weekend nights around the country .
The majority are annual Friday - Saturday rock festivals on brewery grounds , so - called " open door " days that usually come just once a year .
As such , only that particular brewery 's beer is usually available .
But other festivals from Prague to the far corners of the country invite multiple breweries , often smaller producers , to show off their wares , and include entertainment ranging from mechanical bull rides to puppet shows .
My favorite : the Krkonosske pivni slavnosti , a festival of independent brewers from the Krkonose mountain region , taking place every year on the second weekend in August .

3. Brewery hotels
Eliminating the need for a designated driver , the Czech lands are home to 16 brewpubs with guest rooms on the premises .
Though it actually lies near the Polish and Slovak borders , the hilltop citadel town of Stramberk is so lovely it seems like it should be in Tuscany .
However , the coffee - like , astonishingly good Troobacz - one of the country 's best dark lagers - could only come from the Czech Republic .
With inexpensive , well - furnished guest rooms just steps from the cellar , this brewery - hotel offers an extra incentive to stick around and try one more .

4. Unpasteurised Urquell
With a name that means " original source , " Pilsner Urquell has staked its claim as the world 's first Pilsner , and it remains one of the country 's favourite producers .
However , even many locals do n't know that there are actually two varieties of Pilsner Urquell available on draught here : the regular kind sold throughout Europe , and a special , unpasteurised version sold only in the Czech Republic at special " tank " pubs which forego kegs for high - volume tanks .
Without pasteurisation , the rich malt body is far sweeter and the bitter Saaz hops are decidedly sharper and more fragrant .
Try it for yourself at a tank pub like Malostranska Pivnice ( Cihelna 3 , Prague 1 – Malá Strana ) , just down the hill from Prague Castle .
malostranskapivnice.cz
5. Between Buds
The Czech Republic town of Ceske Budejovice - Budweis in German - is celebrated as the home of the original Budweiser beer , though there are in fact two original breweries there ( Budweiser Budvar and Budweiser Burgerbrau ) , both of which are involved in legal battles with Anheuser - Busch over the rights to the name .
If the only criterion were the quality of the beer , the Czechs probably would have won years ago .
To decide for yourself who deserves the name , take an English - language tour through the modern Budweiser Budvar brewery , then relax with another cold one on the scenic South Bohemian town 's Baroque main square .
budvar.cz
6. Strong brews
Not content with the standard 5 % alcohol of the average lager , Czech brewers have begun branching out in new directions , creating the chest - pounding equivalents of bocks , double bocks and barley wines , albeit on their own terms .
The champion here is U Medvidku's X - 33 , a remarkably complex lager of 12.6 % alcohol , produced in numbered bottles and cellared for the best part of a year .
Cloudy , deep amber with a thick , mousse - like head and the taste of leather , honey , almond and oak in the mouth , it is less a beer than a unique dessert wine by another name .
umedvidku.cz
7. Tram pub
According to the Czech beer group Sdruzeni Pratel Piva , the best new pub for 2006 is the bizarre tram - theme Prvni Pivni Tramway or " First Beer Tramway " located at the end station of Prague 's 11 tram .
Smoky , dark , narrow and covered with semi-obscene frescoes , Prvni Pivni Tramway serves Primátor Hefeweizen , Gambrinus and Pilsner Urquell , with a fourth tap connected to an oddball keg from one of the country 's regional brewers .
There is no website , but it 's impossible to miss if you take the 11 tram from metro station I.P. Pavlova it to the end station at Sporilov ( approximately 17 minutes ) .
8 . Lots of bottle
Though the Czech lands are home to more than 100 breweries , only about 25 are available on draught in the capital .
To check out the remainder , look through the 200 - plus bottles at Prague 's first specialty beer shop : Pivni Galerie , or " Beer Gallery " , hidden in a quiet residential neighborhood just out of the center .
Owners Petr Vanek and Olga Vankova probably know more about Czech beers than any hundred beer journalists : if they do n't have it in stock , it probably does n't exist .

9. Glassworks brewery
In the ski-jumping , North Bohemian town of Harrachov , the Novosad Glassworks have housed a brewpub since 2002 , partly to satisfy employee demand .
Glass - blowers toil in year - round temperatures around 120 fahrenheit , and being Czechs , they consume a lot of low - alcohol beer during their shifts , and plenty more after work .
All brews here are unpasteurised and unfiltered , made with local spring water drawn from an exclusive forest well .
Beers have between one and three full months of lagering , and the result is absolutely delicious .
Tours of the glassworks are available , and you can watch glass - blowers work up a thirst from the brewpub 's mezzanine .

Beer gardens
To me , Prague is most beautiful on its long summer nights , when the scent of chestnut and linden trees fills the air and friendly groups gather in the city 's shady beer gardens .
On nights like this , my favorite destination is Letna , the verdant bluff overlooking the Old Town from the north .
There 's plenty of park - bench seating , and half - litres of Gambrinus beer from a kiosk cost the equivalent of 70 pence .
The sunset views over the city 's tile rooftops , the soaring spires of Prague castle and the flowing Vltava river , of course , are priceless .

Back when we were starting off with anabolic steroids after 6 - years of lifting natty , we were told to stick to a few compounds by our coach and to avoid a few others like the plague .
Among the most recommended ones were testosterone , Dianabol , Anavar and Deca Durabolin .
The ones that were to be avoided at all costs were Winstrol , NPP , Masteron and Anadrol .
We did n’t really understand the logic behind the trashing of these compounds .
But we were young and we had never done steroids .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
Thieves have stolen nearly $ 300 million from a bank in Baghdad , police and a bank official said Thursday , in what is probably one of the biggest thefts in Iraq since the 2003 war to topple Saddam Hussein .
Police said the thieves were three guards who worked at the private Dar Es Salaam bank in Baghdad ’s Karrada district .
They said that when bank employees arrived for work on Wednesday they found the front door open and the money gone .
The guards , who normally slept at the bank , had also disappeared , they said .
An official at the bank said about $ 300 million in U.S. dollars had been stolen , as well as 220 million Iraqi dinars ( $ 176,000 ) .
He declined to give further details .
Police said the Interior Ministry and the Finance Ministry had set up a committee to investigate the theft .
It was not immediately clear why the bank had so much cash on hand , but Karrada is a key commercial district in Baghdad .
Ever since the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq , most transactions have been conducted in cash because of limited facilities to transfer money through banks or other financial institutions .
Huge amounts of money were looted from Iraq ’s banks during the invasion .
Ridiculous USA Ballot Access Laws designed to discriminate against third parties
Georgia : Georgia in 1943 required new party and independent candidates to submit a petition signed by 5 % of the number of registered voters in order to get on the ballot for any office !
Previously , any party could get on the ballot just by requesting it .
( And all petition signers are subject to subpoena to determine if they actually signed . )
Result : since 1943 , zero third - party candidates have ever managed even to get on the ballot for a Georgia U.S. House of Representatives seat ( in about 800 races total ) .
Florida :
The ballot access laws for third parties and independent candidates have been very severe since 1931 .
Since then only two third party candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives and only one for the U.S. Senate have managed to get on the ballot .
( And there has been no third party or independent candidate on the ballot for Governor of Florida since 1920 . )
As of 2005 , a filing fee of 7 % of the annual salary of the office is also required unless the candidate is a pauper , while a third party or independent candidate for any statewide office ( other than US president ) needs 196,255 valid signatures – beyond what any independent candidate in any state in the USA has ever obtained .
Texas :
To run for Texas Governor as an Independent in 2006 , Richard S. " Kinky " Friedman had to acquire 45000 signatures in a short time , all of them notarized .
He accomplished that , but found it almost impossible and claims it had never been done before .
Arkansas : New parties , to get on ballot , require by 1971 law a petition signed by a number of voters exceeding 7 % of the last vote cast .
A court held that unconstitutional in 1977 , so they changed it to 3 % .
Also , the petition must be completed in four months during the odd year before an election year .
No political party has ever succeeded in getting on the Arkansas ballot , under either rule .
West Virginia :
This one is an elegant " catch - 22 . "
Third party and independent candidates for office ( other than US president ) must circulate their petition before the primary .
It is a crime for any petition circulator to approach anyone without saying " If you sign my petition , you can not vote in the primary . "
Furthermore , it is impossible for third party or independent candidates ( not running for US president ) to ever know in advance if they have enough valid signatures because if anyone who signs a candidate 's petition then votes in a primary , the signature of that person is invalid .
For candidates , it is impossible to know who will actually vote in the primary , and it is too late to get signatures after the primary .
Also : petition circulators cannot leave their home precinct .
Minnesota : 1961 law requires petition to be completed within a 2 - week period .
Maryland : 1941 law requires all petition signers to be published in one newspaper in each county in the state , by the collector of the petitions .
Massachusetts : Richard Winger of Ballot Access
News says , " Massachusetts ballot access procedures for members of small qualified parties to get on their own party 's primary ballot are a disgrace , the worst in the nation .
They are so bad , they even injure Republicans in MA .
In 2008 , out of the 10 U.S. House races in MA , there was no Republican in six of them . "
" Sore loser laws " designed to foster major - party rule and prevent dissent
In 2006 , nationwide attention was focused on the Democratic Party primary for the Connecticut senate race .
Newcomer Ned Lamont beat out incumbent senator Joe Lieberman .
Lieberman then decided to continue to run as an independent , leading to a 3 - way race between Lamont ( D ) , Lieberman ( I ) and Alan Schlesinger ( R ) .
This made it a " spoiler " scenario likely in which Lieberman and Lamont would split the vote allowing the Republican Schlesinger ( who was less popular than either and had been involved in big money gambling under the fake name " Alan Gold , " causing State GOP Chair George Gallo to moan – quoted in the Hartford Courant – " Our mistake is that we only vetted candidates using their real names , not aliases " ; the Courant further reported that Schlesinger had been sued twice by casinos to collect unpaid gambling debt ) to win .
Actually , after all the top Republicans in sight endorsed Lieberman and abandoned Schlesinger , it became pretty much a 2 - man race between L & L .
Lost in the furor surrounding this – which the US press kept remarkably silent about – was the fact that in most of America Lieberman would not even have had the option of pressing on as an independent .
According to Richard Winger in Ballot Access news , 46 states have either explicit " sore loser laws " or simultaneous filing deadlines making a post - primary shift impossible for any candidate other than a presidential one .
Only Connecticut , Iowa , New York and Vermont allow such a loophole for " sore losers . "
The previous 2 sentences were quoted from Troy Schneider 's New York Times op - ed 16 July 2006 .
And in 11 states it is not permitted for anybody who is ( or recently was ) a member of a political party , to run independent for any seat !
These laws are of course specifically designed to safeguard the two major parties from those annoying " spoiler scenarios " of precisely this sort .
But – is that fair and democratic ?
Lieberman , according to polls conducted in the very same week as his primary defeat , actually had more support Connecticut - wide , than either Lamont or Schlesinger !
Later note : and he won the election !
( But did he then propose liberalization of ballot - access laws ?
Not quite . )
But under this sort of law , just because it was convenient for party leaders to brand Lieberman a " sore loser , " the most popular choice of the voters would actually be prevented from running !
This is the most undemocratic possible outrage !
Now there is a simple way that Connecticut could now solve this " problem " while in fact increasing democracy – adopt range voting , in which the " spoiler " phenomenon and " vote - splitting " both do not exist .
Would the " Democratic " party ( which controlled both CT state houses , although not the governorship ) try to do that , or would they try to abolish democracy by ramming through a " sore loser law " for Connecticut ?
The answer soon came .
( Elected Democratic ) Connecticut Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz swam into this cesspit by proposing to the CT legislature a new law which would make it illegal for anybody who lost a primary , from then being an independent candidate .
Read more about Susan Bysiewicz as a member of the club of the US states ' maximally biased election supervisors , such as Katherine Harris in Florida 2000 and J.Kenneth Blackwell in Ohio 2004 .
One - party domination via Ballot Access restrictions
Suppose one of the two major parties in a state gets weak .
The other party then passes a highly restrictive ballot access law .
That means the weak party will be able to get on ballot in comparatively few races .
That means it will get weaker and the strong party stronger .
Pretty soon we have pretty complete one - party domination .
Think it can't happen ?
Florida 1936 : The Republican party failed to get 30 % of the vote for a statewide office ( this was the era of Democratic one - party domination of the South ) therefore by Florida law was no longer a " political party . "
Furthermore , the only way a political party could get on the Florida ballot at that point was to get at least 30 % of the vote – which was always still theoretically possible because Florida permitted " write in " candidates on ballots so that any voter could vote for anybody in any race .
This of course was too ridiculous even for Florida so they in 1937 lowered the 30 % bar to 15 % .
In Louisiana , nearly all voters were registered Democrat ( it was pointless to be anything else since the Democrats always won , therefore to have any voting power whatever you needed to register Democrat so you could vote in their primary , which effectively was the real election ) .
That prevented La Follette from getting on ballot in 1924 because by law the signers of his petition had to be entirely nonmembers of any other party .
Today , approximately one third of all state - house elections are unopposed one - candidate races .
Q. Would anything horrible happen if we just let anybody get on any ballot just by asking ?
A 1 . Not necessarily .
Arkansas had exactly that policy up to 1997 .
The most US Presidential candidates Arkansas ever had on ballot was 13 ( in 1996 ) .
A 2 . But possibly .
The 2003 California Governor - recall race won by Schwarzennegger had minimal requirements to get on ballot – and 135 people ran .
So we conclude that some requirements are necessary to stop there from being ridiculously high numbers of contenders .
But not much .
In all US history since the age of preprinted ballots began ( about 1890 ) up to 2005 , there have only been two cases where a ballot for some statewide office ( or US presidential race ) has ever had more than 10 candidates on it , provided at least 2500 signatures were required to get on ballot ( and even in those cases , there were ≤ 12 candidates ) .
See Richard Winger 's paper for details .
These ballot access facts mainly are extracted from issues of Ballot Access news .

Hyphenate .py implements Frank Liang ’s hyphenation algorithm ( the one used in TeX ) in Python .
This module provides a single function to hyphenate words .
hyphenate_word takes a string ( the word ) , and returns a list of parts that can be separated by hyphens :
>>> hyphenate_word ( " hyphenation " )
[ 'hy ' , ' phen ' , ' ation ' ]
>>> hyphenate_word ( " supercalifragilisticexpialidocious " )
[ 'su ' , ' per ' , ' cal ' , ' ifrag ' , ' ilis ' , ' tic ' , 'ex ' , ' pi ' , ' ali ' , ' do ' , ' cious ' ]
>>> hyphenate_word ( " project " )
[ ' project ' ]
This Python code is in the public domain .
The module as provided only hyphenates English words , but if you can find TeX hyphenation patterns for another language ( and can deal with the character encoding issues you ’ll encounter in them ) , the same algorithm will work for other languages .
The Liang algorithm does not provide all possible hyphenation points .
It merely tries to provide some of them , without providing any wrong ones .
So the set of breaks from hyphenate .py will be a subset of the full set of break points .

" There are sacred sites , there are burial sites and there are other special places out there which are my responsibility to look after , " Mr Lee told the Herald .
" I 'm not interested in white people offering me this or that … it does n't mean a thing .
" I 'm not interested in money .
I 've got a job ; I can buy tucker ; I can go fishing and hunting .
That 's all that matters to me . "
Mr Lee said he thought long and hard about speaking publicly for the first time about why he wants to see the land incorporated into the World Heritage - listed national park , where , he said , " it will be protected and safe forever " .
The Koongarra deposit is only three kilometres from Nourlangie Rock , one of the most visited attractions in Kakadu .
" There 's been a lot of pressure on me , and for a very long time I did n't want to talk or think about Koongarra , " Mr Lee said .
" But now I want to talk about what I have decided to do because I fear for my country .
" I was taken all through here on the shoulder of my grandmother … I heard all the stories and learnt everything about this land , and I want to pass it all on to my kids . "
This week Mr Lee took the Herald to a rocky outcrop overlooking the Koongarra deposit , a sacred place where , according to his clan 's beliefs , a giant blue - tongue lizard still lurks and should not be disturbed .
Here it is , painted on a rock hundreds , perhaps even thousands , of years ago , its jaw apparently bitten off in a mystical fight .
This is what Mr Lee calls a djang , or place of spiritual essence , which he has closed to the 230,000 tourists who visit Kakadu each year .
" My father and grandfather said they would agree to opening the land to mining , but I have learnt as I have grown up that there 's poison in the ground , " he said .
" My father and grandfather were offered cars , houses and many other things , but nobody told them about uranium and what it can do .
" It 's my belief that if you disturb that land bad things will happen … there will be a big flood , there will be an earthquake and people will have a big accident . "
Mr Lee said there were places on his land where the rainbow serpent had entered the ground that were so sacred , " I can't even go to them or talk about them .
" I can't allow people to go around disturbing everything . "
Areva wants to extract the uranium on its 12.5 square kilometre mineral lease at Koongarra , as the price of the ore has soared as world demand has grown .
Mr Lee 's declaration that he will never allow the mine to go ahead will put pressure on the Federal Government to formally incorporate the land into Kakadu National Park .
In August 2005 the Federal Government took control of uranium mining from the Northern Territory , declaring the territory open for new mines .
Ranger , a mine with a history of environmental leaks owned by Energy Resources of Australia , has been extracting uranium in Kakadu since 1981 .
The Howard Government has always maintained that no new mine would be approved in the territory without the approval of the traditional owners .
The Government has told the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation , the body under which Kakadu is listed as a heritage site , that it would agree " in principle " for Koongarra to be incorporated into the park if the traditional owners requested it .
Mr Lee , who works as a ranger in Kakadu , said incorporating Koongarra into the park would allow him to see that the land was protected .
" Being part of the park will ensure that the traditional laws , customs , sites , bush tucker , trees , plants and water stay the same as when they were passed on to me by my father and great - grandfather , " he said .
As the sole surviving member of the Djok clan Mr Lee does not have any children to pass the land on to .
" I 'll have to see what I can do about that , " he said .
On last Sunday 's " Late Edition , " Condoleezza Rice categorically denied the notion that President Bush was intent on invading Iraq when he entered office in January 2001 :
RICE : Of course , the president came in concerned about Iraq .
President Clinton had used military force against Iraq in 1998 .
We 'd gone to war against Iraq in 1991 , but the idea that the president had made up his mind when he came to office that he was going to go to war against Iraq is just flat wrong .
Since taking the Bushies at their word has proven foolish in the past , let 's take a look back at the evidence that suggests otherwise .
Osama Siblani , publisher of " The Arab American " newspaper , says George W Bush told him in May 2000 that he is going to " take out " Iraq and Saddam Hussein .
In January 2004 , Former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill tells " 60 Minutes " that removing Saddam Hussein was topic " A " at the very first National Security meeting in January 2001 .
Richard Clarke , counterterror czar under Reagan , Bush 41 , Clinton and Bush 43 , writes in his book Against All Enemies : “ Since the beginning of the administration , indeed well before , they had been pressing for a war with Iraq , ” Immediately after 9/11 , Clarke recalls Secretary Rumsfeld pushing for retaliatory strikes against Iraq .
Indeed , immediately following the 9/11 attacks -- when there was ZERO evidence linking Saddam Hussein to al Qaeda -- , prominent neoncos behind the inevitable march to war were arguing in favor of attacking Iraq :
On September 16 , 2001 , Richard Perle went on CNN and explicitly linked Saddam Hussein to Osama bin Laden .
On September 20 , 2001 , The Project for a New American Century think - tank sent President Bush a letter urging him to respond to the attacks by retaliating against Iraq .
At 2:40 pm on September 11 , 2001 , Donald Rumsfeld ordered the military to draw up strike plans .
His notes are quoted as saying : " Best info fast .
Judge whether good enough hit S.H. " – meaning Saddam Hussein – " at same time .
Not only UBL " – the initials used to identify Osama bin Laden .
Taken together , there is ample documented evidence that the Bush administration had every intention of regime change in Iraq even before taking office .
Once 9/11 happened -- despite any evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the attacks -- the same people who argued for years that Saddam had to go ( and the same people who were now running the federal government ) began using the attacks as a justification to carry out their agenda .

Or at least , this is how the devil 's version of George Foreman 's BBQ must look like .
This is the first time the scramjet engine has been tested in a full flight propulsion configuration , simulating working conditions at Mach 5 air speed .

Apparently , the test has been a complete success , according to Charlie Brink , U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory X - 51A program manager : " It marks the first time that a scramjet engine was tested in its simulated ' full flight ' propulsion configuration — the Boeing - designed full vehicle fore - body inlet and nozzle . "

The X - 51A is a concept plane that will demonstrate the scalability of scramjets , engines that achieve speeds similar to rockets but that use air from the atmosphere to burn fuel .
In this kind of plane , the engine becomes part of the body of the plane itself ( or vice versa ) .
The X - 51A will reach Mach 6.5 thanks to new concepts introduced in its design , high temperature materials and airframe / engine integration .
In other words : screw the Mach 5 from Speed Racer .

America 's Growing Problem Americans are not as tall as they once were .
June 19 , 2007  --
It 's a small world , after all — especially in America .
New research shows that Americans are coming up short , but not in terms of money or lifestyle .
Our growing problem is with our height .
The study , conducted by the University of Munich and Princeton University , found that the United States had the shortest population in the industrialized world , and the reason may have to do with the way people live .
America 's first president , George Washington , stood a commanding 6 - foot - 2 .
In Washington 's day , our country 's residents were the tallest in the world .
" It 's well known that the Americans held the title for 200 years , " said University of Munich professor John Komlos .
" Ever since the colonial times , the Americans were the tallest . "
Today the Netherlands towers above the rest of the world as the tallest country , with an average height of 6 - foot 1 , without the wooden shoes .
In 1850 , Americans were two inches taller than the Dutch .
In Denmark , men average 6 feet in height , a couple of inches taller than the American male average of 5 - foot - 10 .
American men are n't responding well to their shrinking stature .
" There is no way I want the Dutch towering over the United States of America , " said one 6 - foot - 3 man .
Komlos said height revealed a lot about a country 's well - being , including how long its citizens lived and how healthy they were .
Researchers said that one reason for Denmark 's high ranking could be that the Danish health - care system provides better care to children when they are young , the time of life when most growing takes place .
Another reason for our lag might be the American diet , which is filled with fast food .
Overeating can cause kids to produce too many growth hormones too early , which halts growth at a younger age .
Outside a Manhattan McDonald's , young Jacob said the news would make him think twice about going to the Netherlands or Denmark .
" If men here are getting shorter , then I need to move to Denmark , " one 5 - foot - 9 woman said .
The report begins by Wolf Blizter introducing the story on his show The Situation Room :
Blizter intro :
But the movie is being criticized by some who accuse Mr. Moore of playing loose with the facts .
Michael Moore is standing by ... But first a reality check from our CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta .
Dr. Gupta : Sicko throws some hard punches at the American health care system and Mr. Moore presents a lot of facts throughout the movie , but do they all check out ?
Keeping them honest we did some digging ...
Dr. Gupta ’s report then seeks to identify errors in Sicko ’s reporting .
" Mr. Moore asserts that the American health care system spends $ 7,000 per person on health .
Cuba spends $ 25 dollars per person .
Not true .
But not too far off .
The United States spends $ 6,096 per person , versus $ 229 per person in Cuba . "
This is the only statement that Dr. Gupta explicitly claims is " not true " .
The graphic scribbles out $ 25 which Mr. Moore has never said .
CNN later acknowledged the reporting error when they admitted that Mr. Moore said in the movie Cubans pay " $ 251 per person per year " .
CNN cites numbers slightly different that Mr. Moore ’s when Dr. Gupta says " Not true .
But not too far off .
The United States spends $ 6,096 per person , versus $ 229 per person in Cuba . "
Mr. Moore and CNN use two different sources for their numbers .
Mr. Moore uses the United Nations Human Development Report and CNN uses the WHO 's World Health Statistics 2007 report .
Both are valid sources and proper citations make both statements factually correct .
To claim this is fudging facts is wrong .
CNN can argue all they want about what are the more accurate numbers or which citation is more reliable but upon submission of the source by Mr. Moore , Dr. Gupta should have retracted the claim that Mr. Moore " fudged facts " .
No other data is challenged in Dr. Gupta ’s report .
Instead , Dr. Gupta attempts to imply that Mr. Moore ’s overall contention , that government - provided healthcare is superior to privatized healthcare , is wrong under the guise of " fact checking " the movie ‘ Sicko ’ .
He does this by suggesting Mr. Moore has failed to be forthcoming with some information .
In other areas he suggests that Mr. Moore is saying something that he has not said .
Furthermore , Dr. Gupta attempts to provide information or data , without citing his source(s ) , that contradicts Mr. Moore ’s claims regarding healthcare inside and outside of the US .
This " data " that Dr. Gupta presents no longer challenges any facts presented by Mr. Moore but merely attempts to convince the viewer that errors are being identified .
This is most effectively accomplished by construction of the report as I demonstrate below :
Wolf Blitzer introduces the piece by Dr. Gupta saying that Mr. Moore is being " loose with the facts "
Dr. Gupta ’s report is called " ’ Sicko ’ reality check "
Dr. Gupta ’s introduction : Sicko throws some hard punches at the American health care system and Mr. Moore presents a lot of facts throughout the movie , but do they all check out ?
Keeping them honest we did some digging ...
Dr. Gupta and CNN use an incorrect quote from Sicko regarding what Cubans pay per person per year for healthcare .
They identify this as " not true " .
It is n’t .
And Mr. Moore never said it was .
The rest of the report is filled with opinions , misdirection , and vague statements .
But no more facts are challenged .
A few facts are listed but these facts do not contradict anything Mr. Moore has said and there are no citations provided .
Dr. Gupta concludes : " But no matter how much Mr. Moore fudged the facts , and he did fudge some facts ... "
What follows now is a logical analysis of the majority of Dr. Gupta ’s report .
Upon reading this you can see how not a single fact was challenged which should lead the viewer to question what Dr. Gupta and CNN are using as their reasoning to claim that " he did fudge some facts "
Dr. Gupta and CNN implicitly claim to catch an oversight by Mr. Moore when they identify Cuba ranked at 39 in overall healthcare quality as determined by the WHO ( two ranks lower than the US ) .
Whether Dr. Gupta is claiming to be " keeping them honest " here with pointing out Cuba ’s number 39 position is difficult to say since Dr. Gupta never claims that Mr. Moore was hiding this fact .
Nor does he admit that the fact is pointed out to the audience in the movie .
What we do know is that the CNN graphic covers up Cuba on the list in the clip from the movie and the phrase " Hold on ! " by Dr. Gupta in his report about " keeping them honest " certainly suggests the intention to show the viewer that an oversight is now coming to light .
If not intentional it is at the very least misleading by design .
Why ?
Because any report which claims to do a fact check and simply revelas information already present in the movie without acknowledging the presence of such information in the movie is misleading .
clip from Sicko shown by CNN during Dr. Gupta 's report :
Dr. Gupta ’s report suggests that although the overall quality ranks closely to Cuba , the increased cost likely translates to higher patient satisfaction .
The identification of short wait times for elective surgeries is then used as supporting data for the high " patient satisfaction " .
Although Dr. Gupta has not cited any evidence for his claim of " high patient satisfaction " both he and Mr. Moore point out that the ranking of 37 and 39 by the WHO include " patient satisfaction " in their analyses .
Dr. Gupta continues :
" So Americans DO pay more , but the United States also ranks highest in patient satisfaction " .
He cites no evidence for the patient satisfaction data but uses data on " elective procedure waiting times " in the same sentence in an apparent justification of " patient satisfaction " .
He says Americans wait times are shorter than every country except Germany for " non-emergency elective procedures like hip replacement , cataract surgery , or knee repair . "
" That ’s not something you ’ll see in Sicko as Americans tell their tales of lack of coverage , and suffocating red tape . "
With some fancy word play Dr. Gupta has suggested that Sicko falsely claims that Americans are dissatisfied with their quality of care .
But what he is in reality saying is Mr. Moore has failed to inform the audience that American wait times are shorter than every country except Germany for " non-emergency elective procedures like hip replacement , cataract surgery , or knee repair . "
If this is a rebuke of Sicko ’s claim about long wait times why did Dr. Gupta choose non-emergency elective procedures to prove his point ?
And do cataract surgery , hip replacement , and knee replacement represent a proper sampling group for gauging the average American ’s waiting time for treatment ?
Has he left out emergency room visits for a reason ?
What about treatments that are more evenly spread out over the entire demographic range of hospital patients instead of elective procedures common in the elderly ?
Are the individuals receiving hip replacements , cataract surgery , and knee surgery on government - subsidized programs like Medicare or Medicaid ?
Dr. Gupa :
" The film is filled with content Canadians and Brits sitting in waiting rooms confident care will come , but in Canada you can be waiting for a long time "
Dr. Gupta does n’t give a statistic on waiting times for Canadians , and to the best of my recollection , Mr. Moore did not either .
" A survey of six industrialized nations found that only Canada was worse when it came to waiting for a doctor ’s appointment for a medical problem "
No source is listed by Dr. Gupta .
In addition this survey at best offers an opposing view on the average wait time experienced by Canadians but once again does not find any facts " fudged " .
Mr. Moore ’s report of short wait times by Canadians is obtained from interviews with Candians themselves .
Although this " survey " certainly challenges the " content canadians " who speak to Mr. Moore ’s camera in the film read the quote again carefully .
Shortest waiting times for a doctor ’s appt ( of 6 total countries surveyed )
?
?
?
?
United States
Canada
I would just like to briefly mention here that the survey Dr. Gupta is using lists only 6 countries and the United States is next to last on the list .
But enough about that .
So Dr. Gupta uses this survey to challenge the viewers into questioning either the accuracy or the honesty of the " content Canadians " in the film .
Think about it , if this survey is a more accurate representation then one of 3 possiblities exist :
The Canadians were lying to Mr. Moore ’s camera
They represented a disproportionate sample of the average
The film was edited / created to filter out the negative feelings to carefully portray Canadian healthcare in a way that is consistent with the maker ’s intention ( propaganda )
Dr. Gupta mentions a survey that disputes Mr. Moore ’s claim .
This is not the identification of fact fudging .
At best this is data that points out that those interviewed by Mr. Moore do not represent the national average .
In order for it to be fact fudging there would have to be a numerical or statistical claim that was either changed or completely fabricated .
Mr. Moore has made no such claim .
An example of fact fudging would be claiming that Mr. Moore has said that ‘ Cubans pay $ 25 per person per year for healthcare ’ when he in fact never said that .
An example of fact fudging would be saying that ‘ Canadians wait an average of 45 minutes less than Americans for emergency room treatment ’ when there is no study that supports it .
Dr. Dr. Gupta has not identified the changing of scientific data or the fabrication of data by Mr. Moore .
More from Dr. Gupta 's report :
Expert : " The concept that care is free in France , in Canada , in Cuba ... and it ’s not , those citizens pay for health services out of taxes and as a proportion of their household income ... it ’s a significant number "
Mr. Moore identifies in the movie that healthcare is paid for in those three countries through taxes .
Dr. Gupta has not uncovered anything here that was not presented in the movie .
Dr. Gupta and CNN fail to take this to the next logical step and compare the financial impact on a family of paying higher taxes " proportionate to their incomce " as opposed to paying for private healthcare coverage .
Furthermore the statement " it ’s a significant number " is not explained and is open to complete speculation on the part of the viewer .
In a report that claims to be " fact checking " Mr. Moore ’s film such a statement should either be explained or removed .
Leaving that statement in the report results in a statement of " significance " in a report that claims Mr. Moore is " fudging the facts " without attributing anything to the " significance " .
This allows the journalist to provide the appearance of scientific credence to the overall claim of the piece without leaving himself open to a challenge of the facts that he ’s using to back up his story .
Why is it a significant number ?
Is it a significant proportion of their monthly income ?
Is it a significant increase in taxes as compared to Americans ’ taxes ?
What is the control group to which this significance is attributed ?
In the absence of any more information , and in the context of the sentence , it can only be assumed that the added amount to taxes as a result of government - provided healthcare is a significant increase as opposed to non-government provided healthcare costs .
But they did n’t exactly say that .
And if it were , significance literally means a low probability that the observed phenomenon happened by chance .
So a significant increase in their taxes simply means that , if compared to someone who did not have healthcare added to their taxes , a person ’s taxes would be noticeably higher and not likely the result of chance .
What it does not necessarily mean , is a large increase to their taxes .
The word ‘ significant ’ can sometimes be used as a synonym for ‘ large ’ and it sounds to me like the lack of definition of the term ‘ significant ’ with no elaboration of why it is significant was purposeful in order to once again let the viewer draw their own conclusions as to the meaning of it .
In a report that seeks to debunk claims put forth by Mr. Moore I would expect any such connection to be drilled into the audience until the point was beyond arguable .
They did no such thing here .
I question their motives for leaving such an ambigous statement in the report .
Dr. Gupta : " But even higher taxes do n’t give all the coverage everyone wants "
Expert :
" 15 - 20 percent of the population will purchase services outside of the system of care run by the government "
There ’s no elaboration on what the economic or demographic breakdown is of this " population " or what these " services " even are .
Under this same category of items listed as " services outside of the system of care " what are the statistics on those " purchases " in the United States currently ?
If the attempt is to compare and contrast US private healthcare with government - run foreign healthcare then certainly a claim that identifies " services " that obviously must be sought " outside of the system of care " in those countries should demonstrate how that differs from our private healthcare system .
Are collagen injections part of that 20 % ?
Laser hair removal ?
Botox injections ?
If so , suggesting that tax - paid universal health coverage is inferior to privatized healthcare coverage is both misleading and incorrect .
Misleading because no one in their right mind would consider collagen lip injections as essential to healthcare .
Incorrect because it ’s highly doubtful private healthcare pays for such services in the United States .
Of course , I ca n’t make such an argument since CNN and Dr. Gupta failed to elaborate on these " services " or what segment of the population that makes up the " 15 - 20 % " is purchasing them .
Additionally , this segment once again attempts to " fact check " Mr. Moore but simply does not do so .
Dr. Gupta : " But no matter how much Mr. Moore fudged the facts , and he did fudge some facts ... "
After careful analysis of Dr. Gupta ’s report and Mr. Moore ’s responses I believe any reasonable person should conclude that Dr. Gupta failed to perform any fact checking on Mr. Moore and is falsely accusing him of " fudging facts " .
I can assume that this journalistic piece was created by first forming a conclusion and then followed up with the best facts available to support that conclusion .
This is anti-science and Dr. Gupta and CNN should be ashamed of the piece .
The body of the report fails to accomplish what the introduction claimed it would do and the conclusion was not supported by the data presented .
The report presented by CNN and Dr. Gupta thus appears to be a ‘ hit - piece ’ on Mr. Moore and should bring into question the motives of Dr. Gupta and CNN in creating and presenting such a travesty of American journalism .
At best , Dr. Gupta is a poor scientists and a worse journalist ; at worst he is attacking a piece of investigative journalism at the defense of our corrupt , privatized healthcare system .
Device at women 's health clinic was an explosive , sources say
By Tony Plohetski
http://www.statesman.com/...
A package found Wednesday in the parking lot of a South Austin women 's clinic contained an explosive device , four sources familiar with the investigation said today .
Local and federal authorities are planning a news conference at 2 p.m. to discuss the investigation , which will be headed by federal officials .
The package was found about 2 p.m. Wednesday in the parking lot of the Austin Women 's Health Center at 1902 S. Interstate 35 , north of Oltorf Street .
The clinic provides services including abortion .
Officials from the city 's Homeland Defense Team , which includes police officers and firefighters , were called to the scene .
Other Austin officers , the department 's emergency ordinance disposal unit and officials from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives were also on the scene .
Note to all the people who use terror as their messenger , we , the people of Texas , will not be intimidated .
And whoever is responsible , citing their Holy War , might I remind you of the 10 Commandments , especially , " Thou Shall Not Kill . "
While I am sure the Bush Administration hopes this gets buried , like the guy from Iowa , we must not let this happen .
As a Christian , I am most appalled by Christian Terrorist , who are usually the first to rattle sabers at other religious terrorists .
This hypocrisy knows no bounds and reeks of fundamentalism of the most base kind .
If we are truly to fight a war on terrorism , that fight must begin at home .
These people must be found and made an example of .
We are not a nation of Christian Fundamentalists , we are a nation of Rule of Law .
I will update this after the 2 pm news conference .
This is Texas , we yield to no one , especially the misguided people who use violence in the name of Jesus , God and the Holy Spirit for their own jihads .
< Update I >
The news conference is still out there , but to assure everyone they did not recommend a hoax or overblown situation ( call it my Breaking !
Developing ! syndrome ) , here is a press release by the Austin Police Department :
http://www.statesman.com/...
On Wednesday , April 25th , at approximately 2:15 p.m. APD patrol officers responded to a suspicious package call at the Austin Women ’s Health Center parking lot located at 1902 South I - 35 .
The 9 - 1 - 1 call was placed by a clinic employee who also notified ATF and FBI per the clinic protocol .
The clinic and an insurance agency were evacuated , as well as one apartment building behind the incident location .
The Bomb Squad was notified and examined the package .
After reviewing the information collected , the decision was made to render the package safe .
All four southbound lanes of I - 35 were briefly closed while the package was rendered safe .
Closer examination of the package revealed an unknown powdery substance in the device .
The Homeland Defense Team and the Austin Fire Department responded with specialized equipment to conduct field analysis to determine the chemical makeup of the substance .
After the initial field analysis , it was determined that the powder was an explosive powder , not a biological health hazard .
It was determined that the package was an explosive device and would have caused serious bodily injury and / or death had it functioned .
A criminal investigation is being conducted by local and federal authorities .
The City of Austin has made great strides and continues to seek initiatives to ensure that the appropriate training and resources are available to guarantee a prepared and quick response to any critical incident .
City of Austin public safety entities work jointly with federal , state and local agencies during critical incidents , as well as long - term projects , to assure the safety of the Austin community .
I would like to take a moment to commend the Austin Police Department and Austin Fire Department for not causing public hysteria over the bomb .
The first responders reacted , and took care of the situation , as the complete professionals they are .
This also needs to be highlighted :
Austin police said the device could have caused serious injury or death had it detonated prior to a clinic employee discovering it and notifying authorities .
Thanks to vigilant workers at the clinic , the package was noticed .
Otherwise , this story might have been much , much worse .
I would also like to note that since 9 - 11 , this has not been an isolated case of domestic terrorism .
Thanks to Bustacap , we need to add these to the guy from Iowa :
William Krar , found in 2003 to have quite a tidy little stockpile of weapons , including cyanide gas .
In 2003 , Norman Somerville , loaded with weapons and seething with militant urgency , was prepared to make something happen in rural Northern Michigan .
I am still waiting for video or transcripts from the presser today , but until then , a good suggestion from Skulnick is to contact CNN and let them know this is an important story .
< Update 2 >
http://www.statesman.com/...
" The device was a dangerous device , " David Carter , an Austin assistant police chief , said at a press conference this afternoon .
" We believe it was capable of detonation . "
He declined to be more specific .
Officials have not commented on any possible suspects or motives and have not said what else was in the device .
Austin police said they are reviewing video from the clinic 's surveillance cameras .
So hopefully , they will get a face or license plate off the tape , and the person , or people , involved in this will be held accountable .
I am sure there will be more local news about this , but I do n't expect it to go national .
But I hope they catch this criminal , because there is nothing more dangerous than someone who thinks terrorism on the homeland soil is acceptable for their political causes .
We , as Americans , must stop throwing stones at the world from our glass house when it comes to extremist and terrorism .
And we must also all remember the words of one of the greatest Americans , " We have nothing to fear , but fear itself . "
If we bow down to their fear tactics , the terrorist have truly won , not matter where they plant their flags of despair .
" What we fear comes to pass more speedily than what we hope . "

The trains crossed on opposite sides of Korea
Historic crossing
The two trains - one travelling from the North and one from the South - each carried 150 invited passengers .
South Korea hailed it as a landmark in relations between the two countries .
But Thursday 's crossing remains largely symbolic , the BBC's Charles Scanlon says .
North Korea has so far only agreed to a one - off test - run .
For that , our correspondent adds , Pyongyang has demanded a high price .
South Korea has agreed to supply it with $ 80 million ( £ 41 m ) worth of economic aid for the development of light industry .
' New era '
Hundreds of people gathered at Munsan station in west South Korea to cheer the five - carriage train as it set off on the 25 km ( 16 miles ) trip to Kaesong , across the heavily - armed border .
Firecrackers and white balloons were set off and crowds waved white - and - blue " reunification flags " .
KOREAN BORDER
Heavily fortified border has separated the two Koreas since 1950 - 53 war 240 km long and 4 km wide , the DMZ takes up about 5 % of the Korean peninsula N Korea has 1.1 m man army , S Korea and US forces total more than 700,000
In pictures : Train crossing History of Korean War
On the eastern side , children bearing flowers welcomed the North Korean train as it arrived at Jejin station .
One carriage carried a banner reading : " The train once boarded by great president Kim Il - sung " .
Each train carried 150 passengers from both Koreas - and included celebrities and politicians .
Passengers on the South Korean train said they were warmly received in the North , while female cabin attendants in military uniforms on board the North train posed for pictures upon arrival at the station in the South .
One of those on board the North - bound train was a conductor who made one of the last railway crossings before they ended because of the 1950 - 53 Korean War .
" I wish I could operate this train myself , " Han Chun - ki , 80 , said .
" I never thought this day would come " .
South Korean Unification Minister Lee Jae - joung expressed his hope that the crossing could herald a new era in North - South relations .
" This will be a turning point for overcoming the legacy of the Cold War era , tearing down the wall of division and opening a new era for peace and reunification , " he said .
A North Korean official , Kwon Ho-ung , said both nations " should not be derailed from the tracks " towards unification .
However , not everyone welcomed the event .
A small number of protesters - mainly relatives of South Koreans allegedly abducted by the North following the war - gathered at Munsan .
" I wish the train would come back with my son if he is still alive , " a tearful Lee Kam - shim , 72 , told the Associated Press .
Border tension
The South has long pushed for a railway connection with the North - not only as a way of improving links with its neighbour , but also to establish better transportation links to China and beyond .
But the secretive Communist country has been less enthusiastic , and previous talks have collapsed as Pyongyang has sought to extract concessions on other issues , such as a disputed sea border .
The train from the North was welcomed by flag - waving onlookers
Thursday 's historic crossing was made possible after the North 's military agreed last week to provide security across what is the world 's most heavily fortified border .
The two sides are still technically at war - having never signed an official ceasefire at the end of the Korean War .
But there have been concerted efforts , particularly by the South , at reconciliation in recent years .
The railway tracks - which run alongside roads across the border - were built and maintained by South Korea part of recent reconciliation projects .
And landmines and tank traps were cleared from the narrow border strip two years ago when the lines were reconnected .
Dell currently only offers Windows software on its laptops
The second largest computer maker in the world said it had chosen to offer Linux in response to customer demand .
Earlier this year , 100,000 people took part in a Dell survey .
More than 70 % of respondents said they would use Linux .
Dell has not released details of which versions of Linux it will use or which computers it will run on , but promised an update in the coming weeks .
" Dell has heard you , " said a statement on the firm 's website .
" Our first step in this effort is offering Linux preinstalled on select desktop and notebook systems . "
Currently the company only offers Microsoft Windows on its computers , but sells servers running Linux .
Members of the Linux community welcomed the move .
The fact that Dell is offering a desktop with Linux is no surprise
Nick Veitch
Nick Veitch , senior editor of Linux Format magazine , described it as " significant " .
" I think it sends a message in two ways , " he said .
" One is that a major company is confident enough to be able to offer Linux preinstalled on a desktop - that sends a signal that Linux is usable to the average user - and I think it shows that there is a growing demand for an alternative to Windows . "
' No surprise '
Microsoft is the world 's largest software maker and its proprietary Windows operating system is found on nine out of every 10 personal computers .
Mr Mitchell had no plans to use Windows XP on his new laptop
While companies such as Microsoft earn money by licensing and charging for use of their products , Linux code is freely available .
That means anyone can modify it or develop applications for it .
As a result , there are many different types , or distributions , of Linux operating systems that offer different functionality .
As Linux is free to download and distribute , the exact numbers of users is difficult to quantify .
However , analysts believe that approximately 6 % of computers users run Linux , similar to the numbers choosing Apple Macs .
Big business and governments , particularly in the developing world , are also starting to exploit the flexibility of open source code .
The UK Cabinet Office recently evaluated the operating system and approved it as a viable alternative to proprietary systems .
Car manufacturer Peugeot has also rolled it out across its employees ' desktop computers .
But until now there has not been a major computer manufacturer willing to preinstall Linux on consumer computers .
" The fact that Dell is offering a desktop with Linux is no surprise , " said Mr Veitch .
" The surprise is that it has taken them this long . "
The Romans then focused this energy – they used their food batteries , so to speak – to create a productive , resilient , and phenomenally complex system of public buildings , manufacturing facilities , housing , roads , aqueducts , and social organization .
In his recent book The Upside of Down , a review of which can be found here , Thomas Homer - Dixon interpreted the development of the Roman Empire in terms of thermodynamics .
The success of the empire depended on its ability to extract energy surpluses , in the form of food , from the imperial territories and concentrate them at the centre , where they enabled the development of a tremendous degree of organizational complexity .
Without a large , and growing , hinterland to collect surpluses from , complexity on such as scale would not have been possible to establish and maintain .
Thermodynamics and the Implications of Entropy
In thermodynamic terms , a highly uneven distribution of energy is an ordered state , and therefore a low entropy condition .
Without a continual input of energy from outside the system , entropy within the system would increase , meaning that the relative concentrations would tend to equalize over time .
Moreover , if the concentration eventually equalized , it would do so at a very low level .
For instance , an even distribution of energy across the universe , which would theoretically occur eventually if the universe were to expand forever , would be called heat death – ironic , as it would be scarcely above absolute zero .
In order to generate a low entropy ( ordered ) state from a higher entropy ( less ordered ) state , energy external to the system is needed to drive the concentration of energy within the system uphill .
However , entropy in the larger system must increase , in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics .
If energy is to be concentrated at the centre , it must come at the price of a lower energy level in the periphery , and the energy loss in the periphery must be greater than the gain at the centre .

A discussion of the thermodynamics of empire is not complete without discussing the implications of entropy .
Many have argued that if only there were fewer people , so that we were living within the natural carrying capacity of the Earth , then all would be able to live at a modern standard of living .
However , a modern standard of living requires a very high concentration of wealth – wealth being a proxy for energy , as wealth represents a valid claim on available energy and resources .
For enough relative wealth to accumulate in a political centre for a complex civilization to develop , there must be a much larger periphery available to be relatively impoverished in providing the necessary energy subsidy .
An equal distribution would , in accordance thermodynamics , only be possible at a low level for all .
The Centre and the Periphery - Then and Now
With solar energy as their external energy source , Rome was able to subjugate a larger and larger expanse of the surrounding territory .
It derived a progressively greater total energy subsidy with each conquest , at least until it reached the point where the energy necessary to perform distant conquests became too large in relation to the energy subsidy Rome could hope to gain for itself in the process – a net energy limit .
Essentially , Rome managed to establish a long - lasting ‘ wealth conveyor ’ in its favour , through the imposition of imperial social , economic and legal structures on the territories of the periphery .
Beginning in the third century BCE , Roman expansion transformed the capital of other societies into resources for Rome as country after country was conquered and stripped of movable wealth .
( from How Civilizations Fall : A Theory of Catabolic Collapse , by John Michael Greer )
Codified laws regulated everything from money and debt to property rights , corporate organization , guilds and the empolyment of labour and slaves .
( from The Upside of Down , by Thomas Homer - Dixon )
There are obvious parallels between the Roman situation and our own , both from the point of view of political centres and from the perspective of the hinterland .
The solar energy subsidy available to the Romans allowed them to create a concentration of ordered socioeconomic complexity in a sea of relative disorder and and simplicity , driving entropy in reverse locally .
Western industrial economies , and more recently other competing centres of political power in the era of globalization , have been able to do the same , but to a much greater extent due to the very much larger energy subsidy provided by fossil fuels .
The centres have seen spectacular gains in complexity , while the hinterland has stagnated , to a greater and greater extent over time .
Indeed , in any complex society , those of us who are n’t farmers are essentially parasites on those of us who grow the sources of energy – the grain , vegetables , fruit and meat – that keep all our bodies running .
( from The Upside of Down , by Thomas Homer - Dixon )
Although there is currently no center which claims direct political control over a large periphery as Rome did ( a de jure empire ) , there is nevertheless at least one de facto empire in the form of the industrialized West , and more specifically the United States .
The economic power of the US ( with its reserve currency advantage ) to determine the terms of international finance and trade , backed by its military strength and extensive network of permanent military bases , has resulted in the ability to entice , cajole or coerce a large periphery into accepting life on the terms of the ‘ imperial ’ center .
This has involved the monetization of peripheral economies , often in tandem with leading those nations into a deep indebtedness thereafter managed through structural adjustment programs by quasi-imperial institutions such as the IMF .
The net effect has been the debt enslavement of whole nations , despite their putative sovereignty , as the established wealth conveyor carries resources and surpluses to the center while leaving most of the externalities behind .
We are entering a bifurcated world .
Part of the world is inhabited by Hegel ’s and Fukuyama ’s Last Man , healthy , well fed and pampered by technology .
The other , larger , part is inhabited by Hobbes ’ First Man , condemned to a life that is “ poor , nasty , brutish and short ” .
( from The Coming Anarchy , by Robert Kaplan )
A political centre gains the ability to create order - a highly differentiated society capable of monumental architecture - at the cost to the periphery of a greater loss of order .
The centre gains resources while avoiding many unpleasant externalities , but the periphery must suffer a loss of both resources and surpluses due to labour , and must tolerate all the externalities involved in providing for itself and for the centre .
Many parts of third world periphery - stripped of resources and burdened with externalities - now verge on anarchy , as there is too small a concentration of energy left locally to support an ordered state .
Sierra Leone is a microcosm of what is ocurring , albeit in a more tempered and gradual manner , throughout West Africa and much of the underdeveloped world : the withering away of central governments , the rise of tribal and regional domains , the unchecked spread of disease and the growing pervasiveness of war .
( from The Coming Anarchy , by Robert Kaplan )
Entropy and the Twilight of Empire
Rome eventually hit a net energy limit and could no longer sustain its internal complexity .
Efforts to strengthen the wealth conveyor through repression during the reign of Diocletian - an elaborate , highly intrusive and draconian regime of taxation in kind - amounted to feeding the center by consuming the productive farmland and peasantry of the empire itself .
This period represented a brief reprieve for a political center declining in resilience , at the cost of catabolic collapse .
Regions incorporated into the empire declined to a lower level of complexity than they had attained before being conquered .
Thus Britain in the late pre-Roman Iron Age , for example , had achieved a stable and flourishing agricultural society with nascent urban centers and international trade connections , while the same area remained depopulated , impoverished , and politically chaotic for centuries following the collapse of imperial authority .
( from How Civilizations Fall : A Theory of Catabolic Collapse , by John Michael Greer )
No longer able to project power at a distance , or to defend the concentration of wealth ( and therefore energy ) which had permitted entropy to be held at bay , the western Roman empire fell .
The result was the loss of an ordered state - with sharp disparities in energy concentration and resultant socioeconomic complexity - in favour of a more even distribution of both .
When entropy finally gained the upper hand , concentrations of wealth , and the claim to energy represented by wealth , were impossible to sustain .
Equalization at a low level was the natural outcome in the area of the former empire , although wealth conveyors in favour of other centers , such as the eastern empire , strengthened in their turn .
Rome itself remained a backwater for a thousand years .
The ability to concentrate wealth from the surrounding area arguably proceeds in cycles of ascendancy , supremacy and decline .
A new center begins to develop , often by being the beneficiary of wealth diversion from an established center where the citizens would rather buy the labour of others with their accumulated wealth than engage in labour themselves .
Services persist in a decadent centre , but real wealth creation is out - sourced , perhaps allowing a new center to reach critical mass - at which point its development would become self - sustaining .
For instance , the gold of Spain at the height of its power established industry in Britain , the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe .
As one Spaniard wrote at the time :
Let London manufacture those fabrics of hers to her heart ’s content ; Holland her chambrays ; Florence her cloth ; the Indies their beaver and vicuna ; Milan her brocades ; Italy and Flanders their linens , so long as our capital can enjoy them .
The only thing that it proves is that all nations train journeymen for Madrid and that Madrid is the queen of Parliaments , for all the world serves her and she serves nobody .
( quoted in The Wealth and Poverty of Nations , by David Landes )
New centres grew in power , while a decadent Spain declined into inward - looking repression as the supply of gold ran out .
According to David Landes :
By the time the great bullion inflow had ended in the mid-seventeenth century , the Spanish crown was deep in debt , with bankruptcies in 1557 , 1575 and 1597 .
The country entered upon a long decline .
Reading this story , one might draw a moral : Easy money is bad for you .
It represents short - run gain that will be paid for in immediate distortions and later regrets .
( from The Wealth and Poverty of Nations )
With the transfer of wealth , and eventually the power to concentrate wealth from the surrounding area , also comes the transfer of hegemonic power .
Britain in turn exported wealth to North America , and in doing so spawned a competitor with the luck to have access to a hitherto unexploited continent .
The American Century has been the result .
In recent years , the wealth conveyor in favour of the industrialized West has appeared to be approaching natural limits .
In freeing capital to seek a lower cost base through globalization , the West has fed the development of major new competitors in Asia .
In addition , the supply of fossil fuels , which have served as the external energy source driving the accumulation of wealth , is arguably approaching a net energy limit .
Social order in parts of the periphery is becoming so compromised that further resource extraction may no longer be possible .
West Africa is reverting to the Africa of the Victorian atlas .
It consists now of a series of coastal trading posts , such as Freetown and Conakry , and an interior that , owing to violence , volatility and disease , is again becoming , as Graham Green observed , “ blank ” and “ unexplored ” .
( from The Coming Anarchy , by Robert Kaplan )
If the West follows in the footsteps of Rome before it , one would expect that the loss of the ability to access new energy subsidies , or even maintain current energy flows , would result in the development of the same repressive , catabolic process that temporarily reinvigorated Rome under Diocletian .
The implications for surrounding territories could be unpleasant .
Eventually , the ability for the old centre to project power at a distance , or perhaps even to hold together as a nation would be lost , as the mechanism for concentrating wealth at the center would break down .
After that , entropy would be expected to run its course , resulting in the relative equalization of wealth , and therefore energy , between the old center and its erstwhile periphery .
The Rise of a New Centre ?
The interesting question for the future would be whether the developing competitors - initially fed by exported Western capital but now reaching critical mass as new centres in their own right - would be able to achieve self - sustaining development as capital exports from the old centre cease .
If so , the primary wealth conveyor would be re-established in favour of a new centre and , as has happened many times throughout history , hegemonic power would eventually follow .
However , the developing Asian centres are as dependent on energy subsidies in the form of fossil fuels as the current Western centre , and also as vulnerable to the effects of climate change , water scarcity , pollution and financial instability .
It is difficult to imagine a smooth transition of political and economic power to a new centre while carrying capacity is arguably shrinking in all regions even as population continues to expand .
If a new cycle of ascendancy is to begin elsewhere in due course - catagenesis , to use Homer - Dixon 's phrase - it appears unlikely to do so without a considerable increase in entropy in the meantime .
Sadly , though , history shows that most human civilizations over - extend the growth phase of their adaptive cycle , so they eventually suffer deep collapse .
" A long view of human history reveals not regular change but spasmodic , catastrophic disruptions followed by long periods of reinvention and development , " writes Holling .

Operations are usually performed on girls aged four to 13
The campaign is being launched at the start of the summer holidays , during which young girls - mainly from African communities - are thought most at risk .
Mutilation involves the partial or total removal of external female genitalia for cultural reasons .
Up to 7,000 girls in the UK are seen as at risk of this form of circumcision .
The long summer holiday is seen as the most likely time for parents to seek the procedure for their daughter as she has time to recover from what is usually a brutal ordeal before returning to school .
She can be sent abroad for the treatment , but police say they know it is also being carried out within the UK itself .
This is child abuse .
It is not an attack on anyone 's culture , it is an attack on anyone who commits this horrendous abuse of children
Alastair Jeffrey
Metropolitan Police
A new law was introduced in 2003 , which not only repeated 1985 legislation banning the procedure , but also criminalised those who took a child outside the country for mutilation to be performed .
No -one has been prosecuted under the new legislation .
" It 's a hidden act , " said Alastair Jeffrey , head of the Child Abuse Investigation Command , as he announced the reward .
" And that 's why it 's so hard to uncover .
" This is child abuse .
It is not an attack on anyone 's culture , it is an attack on anyone who commits this horrendous abuse of children . "
Preserving purity
The police said they were anxious not to arrive at a situation where young girls returning from holidays in Africa were routinely checked at airports , and that they desperately needed grassroots support to stamp out the practice .
I 'm sure my mother thought she was doing me a favour - and in any case , I do n't believe she had much choice
Waris Dirie
Mutilation campaigner
' There 's no escaping from it '
Female genital mutilation is practised in a number of mainly - although not exclusively - Muslim African communities , and the tradition can travel when immigrants settle abroad .
Islamic scholars say it has no justification in the Koran , and several have recently spoken out against the practice .
Yet many families apparently believe it is an essential part of initiation into adulthood and the only way to ensure their daughter is seen as " pure " and thus desirable by potential husbands .
One London youth worker within the Somali community said this was so ingrained that she had even come across young women who had wanted to be circumcised .
" You want to be part of the community , " said Leyla Hussein .
" You want to be married , and you do n't want to be considered dirty . "
There are several types of mutilation , ranging from a minor piercing of the clitoris to the complete removal of all the external genitalia .
In some cases , what remains is then stitched up with coarse thread - leaving a tiny hole , perhaps just the size of a matchstick , for urinating and menstruation .
The procedure is in most cases carried out by older women who have no medical training .
Anaesthetic is rarely used and the cuts are sometimes made with the most basic of tools such as razors or even pieces of glass .
It can have a range of short and long - term consequences including infection , incontinence and infertility , as well as causing significant psychological damage .
And it can be fatal .
Egypt , where as many as 90 % of women have been circumcised , has just announced a full ban on the practice after a 12 - year - old girl died last month .
ASHLAND --
In a scene reminiscent of the Cartoon Network bomb scare that paralyzed the Boston area in January , police shut down a strip mall yesterday in this small western suburb after employees at a Bank of America branch mistook a botched fax for a bomb threat .
Frustrated shop owners said the branch overreacted to the strange fax , which turned out to be an in - house marketing document sent by the bank 's corporate office .
" The women at the bank should have handled it a little better , " said Nick Markos , owner of Townhouse Pizza and Roast Beef , who estimated that he had lost $ 1,000 to $ 1,200 because of the lunch - hour evacuation .
" She blew it all out of proportion , and all of us business owners had to pay for it . "
A day - care center with about 30 children and more than a dozen small businesses in Ledgemere Plaza on Eliot Street were evacuated for about three hours after bank branch managers received a fax with images of a crude timer and a hand lighting a bomb , Ashland police Chief Scott Rohmer said .
Bank employees told police a suspicious package had arrived around the same time , elevating their fears .
Bank security personnel later determined that a fax machine at the corporate office left off the text alerting employees to Small Business Commitment Week in June , including the words , " The Countdown Begins , " above the bomb .
" It was not a communication that was ever meant to be distributed to customers or anyone externally , and the fax machine malfunctioned , so when it came out of the fax machine , it looked suspicious , " Bank of America spokesman Ernesto Anguilla said .
Anguilla said that branches across the Northeast received the distorted fax and that while other branches also evacuated , none saw law enforcement response as extensive as in Ashland .
He would not say how many branches received the fax or how many had been evacuated .
" In Ashland , the situation was compounded by the fact that we had a suspicious package on the scene , as well , " Anguilla said .
Added Rohmer , " I think it was reasonable to assume there was a threat , based on what they saw on the fax . "
Rohmer said that town officials may ask Bank of America to reimburse the town for the cost of the response , which included more than a dozen town officers and firefighters , personnel from neighboring towns , a State Police bomb squad , and police dogs .
Anguilla would not comment on whether the bank would be willing to pay for the emergency response .
A reimbursement would add to the similarities to the Cartoon Network scare in January .
The guerrilla marketing campaign , in which two artists hung 40 battery - powered light screens around Boston , Cambridge , and Somerville , shut down major streets and subways as bomb squads rushed to remove the suspicious - looking devices .
Turner Broadcasting System , Cartoon Network 's parent company , reimbursed local , state , and federal agencies and governments $ 1 million for the cost of the response and paid an additional $ 1 million in goodwill cash .
Dawn Frazier , a Holliston resident and owner of the Paul Albert Salon and Spa in the shopping plaza , said she immediately thought of that scare when she learned why she had to evacuate her busy shop .
" It was very disruptive , " she said .
Cristina Valas , owner of The Family Pet Hospital , said it was fortunate that the hospital was not in the middle of a surgery when police ordered the evacuation .
They were directed to leave three cats , including one recovering from dental surgery , inside .
" I would n't have taken it as a bomb threat , personally , " said veterinary technician Amy Tatreau .
" However , you have to , I guess , treat things seriously these days . "

Spore lets players create and control their own creatures
Publisher Electronic Arts has announced that the title will now be delayed until 2008 .
The ambitious title lets players create and control creatures from their cellular beginnings through to when they conquer space .
Although no official release for Spore has been given by EA , it was expected to be available for Christmas 2007 .
The news about Spore came during a quarterly earnings report from EA during which it issued a warning about future profits .
The company said it could no longer depend on profits from Spore in the financial year that ends in March 2008 .
This means that Spore is unlikely to be on shop shelves until later in 2008 .
The game was first announced in 2005 and since then has generated enormous interest .
The creation of Will Wright , the brains behind such iconic games as SimCity and The Sims , the title aimed to give players unprecedented freedom to mould their creations .
As well as letting players guide their creations through sentience to mastery of the stars , it planned to let the different civilisations created by players meet and interact via the net .
EA said the depressed profits for the next financial year were also a result of the investments it had made in online gaming .
During the quarter that ended on 31 March , EA lost $ 25 m ( £ 12.5 m ) on revenues of $ 641 m ( £ 322 m ) .
Fred Thompson : Neocon globalist By Basil Harrington
web posted March 26 , 2007
For the past few days , movement " conservatives " and GOP cheerleaders have been ecstatic that Fred Thompson , former senator from Tennessee , may form an exploratory committee to seek the GOP nomination for president .
" Now we 'll have a conservative in there , " said one person , who , I assume , has no idea what a real conservative is .
There already are two fine conservative candidates seeking the nomination : Ron Paul and Tom Tancredo .
And Fred Thompson does not even come close measuring up to them .
Fred Thompson is a neocon globalist .
First and foremost , let 's look at immigration .
A third - world invasion of the USA is taking place , and it is up to patriots to stop it .
As Jean Raspail taught us in Camp of the Saints , " the greatest conservative novel ever written , " we can fight back and reverse the invasion , or we can watch the West be destroyed .
Although Fred Thompson is tougher than McCain and Giuliani on border enforcement , which is n't saying much seeing how they line up with Barack Obama , he had a rather lackluster record on immigration while in the Senate .
As one commentator notes : " Overall , Americans for Better Immigration gives [ Thompson ] a career grade of C ; on chain migration , C ; visa lottery , C- ; reducing unnecessary visas , F ; on reducing asylum fraud , C- ; on reducing amnesties , D ; and on interior enforcement , C+.
Although he was tough on border control , he was lacking in almost every other area . " [ 1 ]
Fred Thompson also supports affirmative action , and ideologically worships free trade , regardless how much it harms America .
Historically , conservatives have opposed free trade , but Thompson , like others , has been " neoconned " into backing it .
He furthermore is a " fellow " at the American Enterprise Institute , one of the largest neocon think - tanks , which demonstrates where his true loyalty lies .
If you did not receive the Burkean memo , the transformation of the Middle East to liberal democracy is Jacobin , not conservative .
There is not a single thing conservative about the membership of AEI .
They are neocon / neoliberal globalists .
Why are neoncons backing Thompson ?
Ideally , being ex-Trotskyites themselves , neocons would prefer a liberal candidate , like McCain , Giuliani or Romney .
But they see that conservatives deplore these candidates , and now are going to try to peddle Fred Thompson , who is just socially conservative enough and just tough enough on the borders , even if it is feigned , to woo naive GOP voters .
But let 's hope this nefarious neocon plot fails .
Let 's pray that the more real conservatives learn about Fred Thompson , the more unacceptable he will appear . [ 1 ]
I , for one , should he receive the nomination , will vote Constitution Party .

In the north of Iraq , the Red Crescent Society and the director general for health services in Mosul have told US forces , there is a requirement for up to 3,000 replacement limbs a year .
If that estimate is applied across the country , it suggests an acute and looming long - term health challenge that has been largely ignored by the world .
The revelation of the scale of limb loss suffered by Iraqi civilians is not entirely surprising , even though it has gone unreported .
Levels of amputations performed by military surgeons on US troops in Iraq are twice as high as those recorded in previous wars : the most recently available figures suggest 6 per cent of wounded US troops require an amputation , compared with 3 per cent in other conflicts .
The problem is the nature of the war itself , which has involved a very high incidence of blast injuries from car bombs and suicide bombers , as well as collateral injuries caused to civilians by blasts from US airstrikes , numbers of which have increased fivefold since early 2006 .
' Eighty per cent of the injuries that we see here are to the extremities , ' says Lieutenant Colonel Wayne Mosley , an orthopaedic surgeon at the military hospital in Mosul that treats US soldiers , Iraqi civilians and members of the Iraqi security forces , and runs a clinic for recent Iraqi amputees .
' We see a lot of open long bone injuries or vascular injuries that require amputation .
We do a lot of amputations below the knee .
It is difficult to know how many amputees there are in Iraq , but I would say it is probably the number one operation performed . '
Another issue is that the prostheses that are available are largely outdated - based on models designed in the 1970s - while injured US troops returning home have benefited from a recent leap in prosthetics technology encouraged by the Iraq war itself .
The problem has reached such a scale that the Marla Fund - a charity named after US aid worker Marla Ruzicka , who was killed in a suicide bombing in Iraq - is proposing funding a new $ 500,000 factory in Mosul to build prosthetics to meet demand .
The disclosure of the existence of a generation of Iraqi war amputees comes in the middle of yet more violence : a car bomb exploded in a busy shopping street in predominantly Shia eastern Baghdad yesterday , killing at least four and wounding 10 .

Like the insatiable plant from the musical “ Little Shop of Horrors , ” a verdant menace is eating the Everglades .
The Old World climbing fern , known to botanists as Lygodium microphyllum , spreads its asphyxiating fronds like fingers around the necks of native cypress and mangroves .
It smothers the flora of the glades ’ unique tree islands and starves out the endangered wood storks and other fauna .
“ You ca n’t cut it because it grows right back .
You ca n’t burn it without harming what it covers .
You ca n’t kill it with water because it survives varying hydrologies , ” said Bill Miller , a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist .
And , Miller laments , “ nothing in the Everglades feeds on lygodium . ”

The fern and other invasive plants now cover more than 2 million acres of the Everglades , including 70 % of this national refuge and ever - expanding stretches of Everglades National Park , Big Cypress National Preserve , and the Seminole and Miccosukee reservations .
When environmentalists talk about invasive species in the Everglades , they are often referring to Nile monitor lizards , 350 - pound Komodo dragons from Indonesia or the Burmese pythons abandoned there by humans .
The pythons are now challenging alligators for supremacy in the swamp .
The rapacious lygodium , which originated in Australia , does n’t grab quite the same attention .
But biologists and conservationists contend the nonnative plants pose a greater risk to the Everglades , half of which has already disappeared after a century of bulldozing and dredging .

Scientists also warn that efforts to contain and eventually eradicate alien plants will increasingly challenge federal , state and local budgets , which are already struggling to ante up their shares of the $ 8 billion committed through the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan .
The Everglades is a natural resource that some people find hard to love .
Its malodorous , sweltering bogs are a sanctuary more for creatures that bite , sting and slither than for humans .
But because it is a shelter for rare flowers , birds and other animals , conservationists have fought to preserve it for a century .
The 2000 Everglades restoration project is aimed at correcting the engineering and development intrusions that have reduced wading bird populations by 95 % , endangered 68 plant and animal species , and cut water flow through the glades by 70 % .
It would refill canals , restore the natural flow of rivers , and cease mining and other industry encroaching on protected areas .
It also would relocate some farming communities established during the early 20th century that now require water diversions and electricity supply in the government - protected refuges and that release polluted irrigation water into the Everglades ’ reengineered flow .

But the restoration , the nation ’s biggest environmental repair project ever , pays little heed to invasive species , which nature defenders warn could nullify the project ’s results .
Left unchecked , lygodium will cover an area of southern Florida larger than the entire Everglades National Park by 2014 , according to a computer - generated projection by biologist John Volin of Florida Atlantic University .
His forecast is based on aerial surveys of the Everglades made since the 1970s , when lygodium first popped up on the pest - plant radar in the glades northeast of Lake Okeechobee .
Lygodium was brought to Florida in the 1950s by gardening clubs impressed by how fast it grew on fences , posts and trellises .
Winds shake loose its copious pods and carry seeds into virgin lands .

Another invasive plant , the Australian melaleuca tree , was imported a century ago : Some Floridians saw the Everglades as a useless swamp and wanted the land for crop production , so melaleuca , renowned for its water consumption , was planted among the tree islands to suck the wetlands dry .
People working to protect and restore the Everglades say they have succeeded in reducing melaleuca and other invasives , including Australian pine and Brazilian pepper .
But anti-lygodium efforts could be Sisyphean .
As many as 30 contractors and wildlife experts labor daily to get rid of the invasive fern in the Loxahatchee refuge alone .
But each frond is hemmed with pods , which disperse their seeds to the winds even when the fern is being burned , removed by hand or chemically treated .
The plant is spreading about 10 times faster than it is being destroyed .

Mike Page , a veteran helicopter pilot flying for the South Florida Water Management District , deploys half a dozen choppers with spraying booms over the infested tree islands to apply herbicide to lygodium and melaleuca .
The precision operation , which began this spring , costs the state up to $ 300 per acre .
By last week , Page ’s team had covered 8,000 acres -- less than 10 % of the invaded areas of the 143,000 - acre refuge .
Two weeks after a spray , the browned and desiccated plant scraps can be manually removed by laborers .
But a drought has marooned many of the invaded tree islands -- normally reached by airboat -- preventing collection of foliage that is now dead but still smothering native vegetation .
“ The goal now is control .
Eradication is a long time coming , ” said Miller of the Fish and Wildlife Service .

Meanwhile , dumping of other foreign species is far from uncommon in Florida ( though such dumping , whether of plant or animal species , is illegal in the state ) .
With the Everglades ’ thousands of miles of canals and millions of acres of remote territory , the risk of detection is minimal and the paths of encroachment long , vast and defenseless .

He greeted me with a firm handshake , the skin of his right hand soft as butter .
A lynch mob put a rope around James Cameron 's neck
James Cameron had agreed to talk to me about a painful time in his life , the day a racist , angry mob of thousands tried to lynch him .
Back in 1930 he was a 16 - year - old accused with two other teenagers of the murder of a white man in Indiana .
A mob lynched his friends and then went after him , breaking into the local jail .
He told me that the crowd was chanting his name as if it was at a football match cheering on a favourite player .
" We want Cameron .
We want Cameron .
We want Cameron . "
Then he was dragged from his jail cell and beaten all the way to the tree outside , where he could see his two friends Tommy and Abe already hanging , their necks broken .
A rope was put around his neck and he was about to be hoisted up when someone in the crowd shouted out that he was n't a murderer .
Miraculously the mob spared his life .
Imaginary crimes
Thousands of other African Americans were not so lucky in the years after the Civil War right up to the 1960s .
Lynching was never about justice .
It was about terror used to enforce white supremacy
The lynchings were mob justice for crimes real or imagined .
Public spectacles attended by thousands , happy , proud even to pose for photographs as dead bodies hung from trees behind them .
Now the Senate is expected to pass a resolution officially apologising for not enacting anti-lynching legislation over the years .
In all , seven presidents petitioned Congress to do something about the extrajudicial killings , but filibusters mainly by southern senators meant no vote was ever taken on the issue .
Some 200 bills went before Congress and were effectively ignored .
No memorial
Most lynchings were in the Deep South , but it was a nationwide curse .
James Cameron in his youth
Outside the building was a row of trees with a thick white arrow , pointing to the spot where a black man named Matthew Williams was lynched by a mob .
He 'd been accused of murder .
I went to the courthouse and found no plaque or memorial .
In fact it was hard to imagine a crowd of almost 3,000 people had gathered there all those years ago , baying for blood .
The irony of course was that Matthew Williams died in the shadow of the courthouse , having been denied a lawyer , a judge or a jury .
But then , despite claims to the contrary , lynching was never about justice .
It was about terror used to enforce white supremacy after the abolition of slavery .
Often the only crime of those accused of murder , or theft , or the rape of a white woman , was that they were black .
Terrible time
James Cameron showed me a macabre souvenir .
He still has a piece of the rope used to kill one of his two friends .
Lynchers often cut up the rope they used to commit murder and sold the pieces as 50 - cent souvenirs .
James told me that the rope represented a terrible time in American history .
It is a time that senators now say they want to acknowledge with an apology to lynchings victims , survivors and their descendants .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A U.S. appeals court lifted a preliminary injunction on Wednesday against Google Inc. from showing thumbnail - size photos from sexually explicit Internet sites , but said the company might be liable for allowing links to sites displaying pirated photos .
The logo of Google Inc. is seen outside their headquarters building in Mountain View , California August 18 , 2004 .
A U.S. appeals court ended a preliminary injunction on Wednesday against Google Inc.'s .
image - search service from displaying thumbnail - sized photos from a sexually explicit site .

The case is the latest in which courts are seeking to strike a balance between fostering the free flow of information on the Internet and protecting copyrighted content .
A lower court had found that Google ’s thumbnail images violated the copyright of adult magazine and Web publisher Perfect 10 Inc. , but said the Internet search company was probably not responsible for displays of the underlying images from Perfect 10 ’s Web site .
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco reversed those findings on Wednesday .
“ We conclude that Perfect 10 is unlikely to be able to overcome Google ’s fair use defense and , accordingly , we vacate the preliminary injunction regarding Google ’s use of thumbnail images , ” Sandra Ikuta wrote for a three - judge panel .
Perfect 10 , which boasts of “ The World ’s Most Beautiful Natural Women , ” first objected to Google about the thumbnail images in 2001 , saying Google linked to Web sites that republished images of their nude models without authorization .
Perfect 10 charges $ 25.50 per month for access to its site .
They sued in 2004 , alleging copyright infringement and in 2005 filed a similar claim against Amazon.com Inc. and its A9.com subsidiary , saying they provided links to Google search results .
A court granted a partial preliminary injunction in 2006 .
The lower court ’s ruling had threatened to bar Google from featuring thumbnail pictures -- small versions of photos that are linked to a bigger version of the same picture .
But the injunction was stayed pending further legal review , which meant Google continued to display the thumbnail images .
A number of photographer associations and the Motion Picture Association of America made legal filings in support of Perfect 10 .
TRANSFORMATIVE NUDES
Judge Ikuta found that the thumbnails were not an infringement as they fell under the category of “ highly transformative ” work .
“ We conclude that the significantly transformative nature of Google ’s search engine , particularly in light of its public benefit , outweighs Google ’s superseding and commercial uses of the thumbnails in this case , ” she wrote .
On a second issue of Google ’s liability for copyright infringement by linking to full - size images , the appeals court left the door open for Perfect 10 ’s argument .
“ There is no dispute that Google substantially assists web sites to distribute their infringing copies to a worldwide market and assists a worldwide audience of users to access infringing materials , ” the ruling found .
“ Google could be held contributorily liable if it had knowledge that infringing Perfect 10 images were available using its search engine , could take simple measures to prevent further damage to Perfect 10 ’s copyrighted works , and failed to take such steps . ”
The ruling said a lower court should re-examine the issues against both Google and Amazon .
Google welcomed the 9th Circuit ruling .
“ We are delighted that the court affirmed long - standing principles of fair use , holding that Google ’s image search is highly transformative by creating new value for consumers , ” the firm ’s general counsel , Kent Walker , said in a statement .
“ Google services respect intellectual property and help people around the world find what they ’re looking for . ”
Russia has banned the shipment of medical specimens abroad , threatening hundreds of patients and complicating drug trials by major companies , the national Kommersant newspaper reported on Wednesday .
Kommersant attributed the ban to fears in the secret service that Russian genetic material could be used abroad to make biochemical weapons targeting Russians .
The quality daily cited anonymous sources in the medical community .
The ban , initiated by the Ministry of Health and carried out by the Federal Customs Service , began on 28 May .
Shipment beyond Russia ’s borders of all biological material , including hair and blood , has been blocked .
“ If this is true , it will hit us like a cannonball ” due to the centre ’s reliance on processing of medical specimens abroad , Aleksei Maschan , director of the Central Children ’s Hospital , Moscow , told the newspaper .

Secret service warning
The ban may also complicate clinical trials by major pharmaceutical companies , including GlaxoSmithKline , which runs trials on tens of thousands of Russians .
The Russian Customs Service and Ministry of Health refused to comment on the reports .
An anonymous medical source linked the ban to a report by the FSB secret service in May 2007 , that he said warned of Russian genetic material being used in Western clinics to prepare biological weapons that would harm only Russians .
Nikolai Yankovsky , head of the Russian Institute of Sciences ’ General Genetics Institute , ridiculed the idea of a ban on transporting genetic material abroad .
“ Forbidding the shipment of one ’s DNA abroad is impossible – I am my DNA , ” he told Echo of Moscow radio .

At a time when the job approval rating for Bush is closer to a quarter than to a third , progressive - minded Americans are reaching out for some common sense leadership .
Congress ' job approval indicates that most people do n't feel that they 're getting what they crave in terms of truth - telling leadership from that direction either .
And with a corporate media complicit in everything the public has come to distrust about the Bush Regime , it is hard to know which way to turn .
But there 's a reason why of the top 5 grossing documentary films of all times , 3 were made by filmmaker / activist Michael Moore .
In the minds of millions of people in this country , generally people who have freed themselves from the chains of ideological dictates from the corporate media , Moore has earned the kind of trust people crave in the public forum .
The interests of the corporate right -- in politics and in media -- demand that this trust be dissolved and annihilated .
Independent , charismatic figures who can speak to and for the working people of America are destroyed , the old fashioned way ( John F. Kennedy , Robert Kennedy , John Kennedy , Jr. , Paul Wellstone ) or more subtly , in a less messy way , the way they did it to Howard Dean , the way they 're trying to do it to Barack Obama , John Edwards ... and , of course , Michael Moore .
Michael is more dangerous to the entrenched Establishment than almost anyone else in America because he can focus a great many people on a pressing national issue and stimulate independent thought , emotional identification and anger .
Their pathetic attempts to denigrate him and silence his message -- as in the case this month of CNN 's corporate doctor Sanjay Gupta -- have failed miserably .
And this afternoon everyone here at Crooks & Liars is very , very proud to offer an opportunity to our community to chat live and unfettered -- meaning no Wolf Blitzers -- with a man we admire and respect and who we all owe a great deal for his heroic , incisive and hilarious rage against the machine .
Brothers and sisters ... Michael Moore .

Abdullah Gul needed a favor .
It was February 5 of this year , and the Turkish foreign minister was fighting a push in the U.S. House of Representatives to recognize the Turkish murder of over one million Armenians during World War I .
In past years the House had placated Turkey by dropping similar resolutions .
But now , with the American - Turkish alliance weakened by the Iraq war , the resolution had found renewed support .
Gul summoned representatives from the Anti-Defamation League and several other Jewish - American organizations to his room at the Willard Hotel in Washington .
There he asked them , in essence , to perpetuate Turkey ’s denial of genocide .
Abraham Foxman ’s ADL acquiesced , and in so doing , performed the pièce de résistance of Foxman ’s highly effective , if unintentional , decades - long campaign to demoralize Jewish America and send young Jews scurrying for the communal exit doors .
The ADL chief is a danger to the future of the community , and it is a scandal that he remains at the head of a major Jewish organization .
Foxman must go .
And the organization he has done so much to shape must either change or go with him .
Soon after the meeting with Gul , the ADL joined three other American Jewish organizations — the American Jewish Committee , B’nai Brith International , and the Jewish Institute of National Security Affairs — to deliver to Congress a written plea from the Jews of Turkey that the U.S. not recognize the Armenian Genocide .
Turkish Jews are more vulnerable now than at any time in recent history as they struggle to reassert their place in a society polarized by the competing visions of Turkey ’s Islamists and secular nationalists , so it is hardly surprising that they would parrot their government ’s denialist claims .
By dutifully passing their letter to Congress , the Jewish American groups cynically exploited a small , frightened Jewish minority .
Worse was to come .
“ I do n’t think congressional action will help reconcile the issue .
The resolution takes a position ; it comes to a judgment , ” said Foxman in a statement issued to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency .
“ The Turks and Armenians need to revisit their past .
The Jewish community should n’t be the arbiter of that history , nor should the U.S. Congress . "
Foxman ‘s statement is in every way that matters equivalent to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s claim that he takes no position on the historicity of the Jewish Holocaust , but only hopes to see the matter resolved by dispassionate study .
Throughout the Congressional saga surrounding the resolutions , virtually no one other than Turkish lobbyists had explained their opposition by challenging the nearly undisputed consensus among historians that a genocide did indeed take place .
It is a scandal of unprecedented proportion when one of the most prominent figures in our community , a man who claims to speak on our behalf , publicly challenges the historicity of another community ’s genocide .
Foxman ’s ADL no longer represents the interests of the Jewish community .
In fact , it seems the only interests it represents are its own .
What ’s surprising is how unabashedly forthright Abraham Foxman has become about what motivates him and his institution .
In October of 2005 , Foxman addressed a classroom of Jewish students at New York University .
Young heads nodded and brows furrowed as Foxman riled them with his customary rhetoric :
Is n’t it antisemitic for pro-Palestinian groups to seek divestment only from Israel , ignoring the far greater crimes of regimes like Sudan or North Korea ?
How do we describe this sort of selective flagellation of the world ’s only Jewish state , if not as antisemitism ?
" What if the campus Free Tibet club campaigned for divestment from China ?
Would that be anti-Chinese bigotry ? " asked Asaf Shtull - Trauring , a 20 - year - old student and conscientious objector from the Israeli army .
Of course not , answered Foxman , but it was preposterous to compare the two conflicts , what with the Jews ’ experience of two millennia of murderous persecution .
Shtull - Trauring responded with two questions : Did Foxman mean that selective treatment is okay so long as it ’s not directed at Jews ?
And where did the Anti-Defamation League get off telling Jewish university students which opinions about Israel were acceptable and which verboten ?
The dialogue spiraled into a confrontation .
Shtull - Trauring says Foxman , frustrated and under attack , placed his cards on the table , angrily retorting : “ I do n’t represent you nor the Jewish community !
I represent the donors . ”
Foxman ’s outburst was surprising not because of its content , but because of its candor .
Foxman need n’t bother himself with the trifling concerns of American Jews who happen not to be multimillionaire philanthropists .
If he makes the Jewish community less appealing to young Jews , if his theatrics turn us off and turn us away , that ’s all beside the point .
Foxman ’s job is to keep the millionaire benefactors happy : the rest of us can go jump in the Kinneret .
Without a meaningful mission to pursue , the ADL has resorted to scaremongering to fill its coffers and justify its existence .
These efforts have grown increasingly bizarre and damaging .
For example , the ADL website surveys the vast changes in Jewish - American life over the past century and offers the grandiose judgment that they “ are due , in large measure , to the efforts of the League and its allies . ”
Yet Foxman also claims that today the Jewish people face as great a threat to their safety and security as they did in the 1930s .
In other words , the ADL takes credit for the vast improvements in the circumstances of American Jewry , and then denies that those changes have taken place .
It is still 1939 .
It will always be 1939 .
When the ADL was born , in the early 20th century , institutional discrimination against American Jews was commonplace at every level of society .
Populist politicians employed the most vulgar antisemitic language , and “ restricted ” hotels and country clubs reassured patrons that Jews would be stopped at the front door .
In 1915 , 31 - year - old factory manager Leo Frank was lynched in Marietta , Georgia after he was accused of raping a Christian girl .
But today , American Jews are successful and well - integrated .
And unlike in Weimar Germany , where we were accepted only so long as we obscured our Jewishness behind the accoutrements of gentile culture , in America we are accepted even as we celebrate what sets us apart .
Such a reality , however , does n’t serve the fundraising interests of the ADL .
The ADL ’s jihad against Mel Gibson ’s Passion of the Christ was typical of the organization ’s destructive , self - interested efforts .
Foxman , as you might remember , fanned fears it would inspire Chmielniki - style pogroms .
Yet not a single documented act of violence against Jews resulted from the film , nor even a single verbal assault .
A study conducted by Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles indicated some anger among Christians toward Jews — but because of the reaction to the film , rather than its contents .
Thanks to the ADL , our strong and self - confident community was made to appear silly and paranoid before the world .
The Passion fiasco was hardly the ADL ’s only effort to alienate and insult American Christians .
In November 2005 , Foxman delivered a widely publicized speech in which he warned that American Christian organizations were engaged in an insidious campaign to “ Christianize ” America .
It ’s a shocking allegation : firstly , because Jewish interfaith groups have developed very strong ties with precisely such organizations in the past decade ; and secondly , because conservative Jewish groups have been just as aggressive in their efforts to breach the wall between church and state .
While Christian groups ca n’t get the ornaments of Christianity placed in government buildings , Chabad has succeeded in publicly erecting enormous , gaudy menorahs throughout the country .
In this environment , where the push for more religion in public life unites religious conservatives across all faiths , why would Foxman single out Christians ?
Again , the answer is simple : Fundraising .
Such headline - grabbing proclamations add a historically evocative Christian dimension to the terrifying nightmare - world in which the ADL encourages its benefactors to live .
The ADL can libel American Christians in general without fear of legal consequence , but when it goes on to identify specific “ antisemites ” it leaves itself more vulnerable .
Time after time , Americans who resented being named - and - shamed as antisemites have sued the ADL for libel .
In 2000 , Colorado residents Dorothy and William Quigley received a ten million dollar verdict against the ADL , which , according to Federal judge Edward Nottingham , “ had labeled a…neighborhood feud as an antisemitic event . ”
Nottingham concluded that the ADL had not properly investigated the case nor considered the consequences of its accusations .
But what the ADL lost in libel fees , it gained in bogus credibility .
Baseless accusations of antisemitism contribute to a paranoid fundraising atmosphere that makes Foxman ’s ADL seem utterly necessary ; maybe the Quigleys were n’t antisemites , but that does n’t mean your neighbors are n’t Hitlerists in disguise .
Still , such bullying by the ADL has an inevitable chilling effect : Jewish community leaders , even those who take exception to the ADL ’s techniques , fear speaking out lest the ADL accuse them of some crime against the Jewish people .
Like all bullies , the ADL is widely disliked , but less widely spoken out against .
Ultimately , it is the seductive appeal of the ADL ’s dark visions that most threaten us .
American Jewry enjoys privileges undreamed of in Jewish history : we are a more accepted , more integral part of our country than any Jewish community ever has been .
We have entered unprecedented territory in Jewish history , and the enticements and possibilities of this new era should be setting our souls alight .
Foxman ’s ADL justifies its existence by beckoning us backward , encouraging us to hide from the ever - present Cossacks in a psychological shtetl .
It ’s a dark vision that serves the ADL ’s interests , but not ours .
So perhaps we should be grateful to Abraham Foxman for acting as he did after the April meeting with Abdullah Gul , and doing something to so publicly and incontrovertibly demonstrate how destructive he has become to his own organization , and to the Jewish community he claims to serve .

The Pirate Bay , the controversial Swedish piracy torrent tracker , is launching a music site where users can share as much music as they want .
Playable.com is a collaboration between The Pirate Bay , members of the Swedish rock band Lamont , and their manager Kristopher S Wilbur .
A statement said : " The shared insight that the record industry is outdated inspired the birth of Playable .com . "
Playable.com will allow users to support artists financially .
Users will have to pay a monthly fee , but it is up to them how much they want to spend .
Artists will receive a portion of that money every time one of their songs is downloaded .
It is unlikely that many record companies will join the initiative , in particular since The Pirate Bay intends to make transactions through its current torrent tracker almost " completely untraceable " .
Co-founder Peter Sunde approached several record companies in the USA and told the Los Angeles Times that one record boss even accused him of " perpetrating a disturbingly Viking - like act " on the executive 's livelihood .
It is more than likely Playable .com will face law suits for copyright infringement .
Last year , the popular file sharing network eDonkey agreed to pay $ 30 m to settle a case brought by six music labels .
P2P networks have succumbed one by one since the US Supreme Court ruled in June 2005 that file sharing services are illegal . ®
More than four in 10 Americans want the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against President Bush , and more than half want them for Vice President Cheney , a new poll shows .
In a survey of 1,100 people conducted last week by the American Research Group , 45 % said they favor impeachment of the president , while 54 % favor it for the vice president .
Why the difference ?
While the results may highlight lower public opinion of Mr. Cheney , they may also reflect a practical consideration that advocates of impeachment often point out :
If Mr. Bush is removed from office through impeachment , Mr. Cheney would become president .
One of the most common complaints I ’ve heard from IT workers over my years of working in the industry is “ users are idiots ” or some variant thereof .
It ’s an understandable but ultimately self - defeating attitude .
Users are your customers , they ’re the reason you have a job – treat them badly enough and you wo n’t have them or a job for long .
This is true whether they are literally customers ( people who buy a product you make ) or metaphorical customers ( the people within your company who use the product you develop ) .
This attitude is the primary reason IT workers have a reputation for arrogance in the business world .
This is not a touchy - feely “ always put the customer first ” post .
Some users are truly stupid .
Many more , while not being inherently stupid , are capable of behaving in what seem to be incredibly stupid ways .
A couple of my favourite examples from previous jobs :
One of the many times I was “ lucky ” enough to be working in the public service , I was working on the development of a global intranet for a division of the federal government ’s foreign trade department .
This was an intranet to serve over 100 overseas offices and one of the top public servants from Canberra came in to see how it was going .
This guy looked like a stereotype of a British major - general with a huge walrus moustache .
He gave off a vibe that made it obvious he considered us lucky to be worthy of his attention .
I started the demo I had been giving users from various offices ( which had been going quite well with other users ) .
I opened the home page and started to explain how clicking on the various links would let you complete certain tasks and invited him to try it for himself .
He did this by picking the mouse up from the desk and trying to use it like a TV remote – pointing it at the part of the screen he wanted to use , clicking madly , then berating me because “ it was n’t working ” .
I resisted the urge to ask “ are you from the past ? ”
In another case I was running a training session with a group and one user in particular was having trouble so I was taking him through the process again :
ME : Right click on that link .
HIM : I am !
ME : No , you need to right click .
With the right mouse button .
HIM : I know how to use a mouse , I ’m clicking it right and it is n’t working .
ME : Sorry , I did n’t mean right as in “ correct ” .
There are two buttons on the mouse ; one is on the left side , on is on the right .
When I say “ right click ” I mean click the button on the right hand side .
I ’m not passing judgement on whether or not you are correct .
HIM : You do n’t have to talk to me as if I ’m stupid .
ME : You reckon ?
At this point I absolutely did not trust myself to keep speaking to this person and so called for a break .
I bring these stories up firstly to provide a bit of a laugh ( hopefully ) and second , to illustrate that , yes , we do see some truly stupid user behaviour from time to time .
So this is the recurring conundrum faced by IT workers : users behave like idiots but it ’s a bad idea to treat them like they ’re stupid because our jobs depend on them .
The first coping strategy I would suggest is the one I described above : take a break .
It often does n’t occur to people to stop a conversation that ’s going nowhere .
Do it in the appropriate way , of course .
Saying : “ Let ’s get back to this later .
I ’ve made a note of your issues and I ’ll look into them more then get back to you , ” works way better than “ Shut up !
You ’re stupid !
I ’m not talking to you any more . ”
Likewise , email does n’t have to be answered instantly ( despite what some people seem to think ) .
If you get what you think is a stupid email , take some time to think about a reply .
Get a second opinion if you can .
Just do n’t fire off a quick response that makes it clear you think the user is stupid .
It ’s also important to be able to determine when the “ stupid user ” behaviour is n’t an IT issue at all , even though it ’s being directed at IT .
If a user ’s system is n’t working because of the crap they ’ve installed on their machine ( “ Download a free animated screen saver ?
That sounds like a great idea – what could possibly go wrong ? ” ) that is n’t an IT issue , it ’s a HR issue because they ’re misusing their PC .
If a user lack basic computer literacy that is n’t an IT issue , it ’s a training issue .
If a user keeps bugging individual developers and eating up their time rather than following established channels , that ’s a management issue .
One of the most important things to learn when dealing with stupid user behaviour is recognising when dealing with a stupid user is n’t part of your skill set .
Most developers are n’t hired for their people skills – it ’s great if you have good people skills but it ’s important to be honest ( both with yourself and with others ) when you do n’t .
That ’s why Business Analysts , Team Leaders and Project Managers exist .
If you ’re in one of these roles and you have lousy people skills then something is seriously wrong .
At the risk of ending with a platitude , if you are n’t part of the solution then you ’re part of the problem .
It ’s easy to bitch and moan about how stupid users are ( all too often it ’s like shooting fish in a barrel ) but that does nothing to make the situation better .
In a world where IT work is increasingly commoditised and a wider range of jobs are in danger of being outsourced , people skills become increasingly valuable .
So learning how to deal with stupid users can save your job as well as your sanity .
I ’ll borrow from another well - known platitude to close on a positive note :
There are no stupid users – just stupid situations .*
( * caveat : there really are some stupid users )
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Opposition to a compromise immigration overhaul grew on Monday , with labor unions and Hispanic groups saying the deal brokered by leading U.S. senators and the White House was bad for workers , families and employers .

The League of United Latin American Citizens , one of the country ’s oldest and largest Hispanic groups , said it opposed the plan ’s limits on family - based immigration .
A labor union and another Hispanic group said they would work to change the proposed law as it moves through Congress .
The opposition emerged as the Senate began debating the compromise plan , brokered in closed - door talks between White House officials and about a dozen Republican and Democratic senators .
President George W. Bush , said in an interview with Reuters he would ask that opponents actually read the bill before offering opinions on its content .
“ There ’s no question this is an emotional debate .
But people have to realize that in order to have border security , you must have a comprehensive approach to immigration reform , ” Bush said .
He said the compromise “ was a very serious effort to bridge a wide gulf that had existed in the Senate . ”
The measure would combine tough new border security and workplace enforcement measures with a temporary worker program and a plan to legalize an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the country before January 2007 .
In addition to limits on family - based immigration , the citizens league said it also opposed the temporary worker program because it would require laborers to return home for a year after each two - year work period .
Temporary workers would be allowed a total of three two - year visas .
“ This bill will dehumanize workers , short - change employers and lead to widespread undocumented immigration as many workers inevitably overstay their visas rather than return home , ” the group ’s president , Rosa Rosales , said in a statement .
The AFL - CIO plans a news conference on Tuesday with civil rights and Hispanic groups to outline their concerns about the guest worker program , new limits on family - based immigration and a proposed new merit - based system for future immigrants .
REDUCING TEMPORARY WORKERS
The Service Employees International Union plans to join that news conference , but officials said they hoped to work with lawmakers to change the bill as it moves through the Senate and eventually the House of Representatives .
Eliseo Medina , executive vice president of the SEIU , said requiring immigrants to return home to apply for permanent residence was unworkable .
The union , which has about 1.8 million members , also wants more labor protections for guest workers and a path to citizenship .

“ We are going to be evaluating every step of the way and at some point we will see what the final package looks like , ” he said in an interview .
National Council of La Raza Vice President Cecilia Munoz said her group would try to reshape the bill .
“ It is important that we get a good bill over the finish line , ” she said .
Dozens of amendments are expected and it is unclear whether the compromise will remain intact as it works its way through the Senate .
One of the first amendments will be aimed at reducing the number of visas available for temporary workers each year from 400,000 to 200,000 .
The amendment is being offered by Sen. Jeff Bingaman , a New Mexico Democrat .
The bill also faces stiff opposition from conservative Republicans who see it as an amnesty that rewards illegal immigrants who broke U.S. laws .
“ This bill is compromising to the country ’s economy , national security and very foundation of a democracy rooted in the rule of law , ” said Sen. Jim Bunning , a Kentucky Republican .
“ Each low - skilled immigrant household that gets amnesty costs the American taxpayers nearly $ 20,000 each year if we consider only the illegal aliens given amnesty , ” he said .
I have been using internet banks for more than eight years .
The first internet bank that I remember I used was NetBank in 1999 .
At that time , there are n’t many banks that offered savings accounts with decent rates .
My local bank , Summit Bank ( then Fleet Bank , now Bank of America ) , had a rate that was close to zero .
So I was quite happy with what I got from NetBank and have used it for a while until other banks started to offer similar products with better rates .
In fact , when I look back my banking history , I found I have used most of the banks in the online banking business .
In addition to NetBank , other banks that were part of my banking system include : E - Trade Bank , Citibank , AmericanBank .
The main reason for me to switch banks is the interest rate and that ’s what I am going after .
So if other banks offer better rates , there ’s no reason to stick with the old bank .
I want to get the best of my money , even it means I have to keep changing banks .
A direct result , as you can imagine , is I had many closed account and still own half a dozen accounts as of now .
However , all these activities are limited to only online savings account .
I have only one Bank of America checking account and no internet based checking account , though the BoA account does n’t ear me any interest .
When ING Direct introduced their interest checking account last year , I have once considered whether to switch , but eventually abandoned the idea for reasons I explained before .
I recently checked some online banks who provide high interest checking and savings accounts and put together a list to compare which bank offers the best deal .
If you decide to let one bank host both your checking and savings accounts , then at this point the best choice is Presidential Bank .
If you are looking for deals from big names , then ING Direct is still the one to beat .
In the following , I used the combined yield of both the checking and savings account ( simply add the yields of checking and savings accounts ) .
However , that does n’t mean you will get the combined yield .
Instead , what rate you will get depends on how you distribute your money between checking and savings account .
If , for example , you have 50 % of your money in checking and 50 % in savings , your yield will be half of the combined yield , which is only for the purpose of illustration .
My feeling is if the combined number is n’t high , it ’s unlikely you will get a good deal .
Update : The original post was written on June 17 , 2007 .
Since then , most of the banks have changed their rates significantly .

E - Trade Bank
I used E - Trade many years ago when it was probably the only choice for online stock trading .
In recent years , E - Trade has changed a lot after the once crazy online trading activities , and the profits , vanished .
Now , in addition to being a brokerage firm , E - Trade also offers a full line of banking products with attractive rates .
The combined checking and savings yield of E - Trade Bank is 8.30 % APY .

ING Direct
ING Direct is probably the first major bank to offer high yield savings account .
Though their rates have lagged quite significantly in recent years , they still control the largest share of online deposits ( Time Magazine , June 25 , 2007 ) .
The combined checking and savings yield of ING Direct is 8.50 % APY .

HSBC Direct
With their newly launched Online Payment Account , HSBC also enters the interest checking market to compete with rivals such as ING Direct .
However , one of the criteria I see as to be competitive is rate .
At 5.05 % APY , the savings account seems to be OK ( I use HSBC savings account ) , but the 2.50 % APY from the new checking account has nothing to be excited about .
HSBC ’s combined checking and savings yield is 7.55 % APY .

Breastfeeding benefits mother and child , many health experts say
The World Health Organisation and the UN children 's agency , Unicef , say more needs to be done to inform parents of the risks of breast milk substitutes .
Health experts at a conference in the Philippines say breastfeeding is better for children 's health .
The practice leads to lowered child mortality rates , doctors say .
Delegates to the conference in the Philippines ' capital , Manila , were told that in Cambodia , where breastfeeding has been promoted , the child mortality rate has dramatically fallen .
' Improved development '
In 2000 , one in 10 Cambodian mothers were still breastfeeding their children when they were six months old .
Five years later , the figure had grown to six out of 10 , says the BBC's Guy De Launey in Phnom Penh , Cambodia .
The comparable figure across Asia is 35 % , says the WHO .
The average family in the developing world , they do n't breast feed because they think bottle feeding is better
Karen Codling , Unicef
The child mortality rate in Cambodia dropped by a third in the same period and the WHO believes breastfeeding is largely to credit .
" It 's not just a matter of cost - it's a matter of survival for infants in developing countries , " Dr Chessa Lutter from the WHO told the BBC .
Infants born into conditions of poverty where there is not the access to clean water and adequate sanitation to safely feed infants formula milk , benefit from breastfeeding , she said .
Children in developed countries who are breastfed benefit too .
They " have better cognitive development " and lower risk of Type 2 diabetes , Dr Lutter added .
Our correspondent says large billboards depicting a nursing mother and baby are a common sight in towns and rural areas in Cambodia and local authorities have created breastfeeding - friendly sites in villages .
The health experts meeting in Manila want the rest of the region to follow Cambodia 's example .
They say more needs to be done to counter the marketing campaigns of makers of infant formula milk .
" The average family in the developing world , they do n't breast feed because they think bottle feeding is better , " said Karen Codling , a regional nutrition specialist at Unicef 's Asia - Pacific office .
An association of milk formula companies in the Philippines has launched a legal challenge against a strict marketing code imposed on the industry last year .
Via NY Post :
Fired FBI agent Peter Strzok has claimed that some of his letters and texts were “ altered ” before they were submitted as evidence by lawyers fighting to clear former national security adviser Michael Flynn .
Flynn ’s lawyers had included the messages in a fresh filing last Thursday , claiming they proved “ outrageous , deliberate misconduct by FBI and DOJ — playing games with the life of a national hero . ”
But a lawyer for Strzok — one of the special agents who interviewed Flynn about Russian “ collusion ” — wrote to the judge Monday insisting that some of the documents “ appear to have been altered . ”
“ On at least two occasions , there were handwritten additions , not written by Mr. Strzok , inserting dates , apparently designed to indicate the date or dates on which the notes were written , ” his attorney , Aitan Goelman , wrote .
The letter to US District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan included two of the notes , highlighting in yellow how dates appeared to be different penmanship .
“ On at least one occasion , the date added is wrong and could be read to suggest that a meeting at the White House happened before it actually did , ” Goelman said .

The number of U.S. - paid private contractors in Iraq now exceeds that of American combat troops , newly released figures show , raising fresh questions about the privatization of the war effort and the government ’s capacity to carry out military and rebuilding campaigns .
More than 180,000 civilians -- including Americans , foreigners and Iraqis -- are working in Iraq under U.S. contracts , according to State and Defense department figures obtained by the Los Angeles Times .
Including the recent troop buildup , 160,000 soldiers and a few thousand civilian government employees are stationed in Iraq .
The total number of private contractors , far higher than previously reported , shows how heavily the Bush administration has relied on corporations to carry out the occupation of Iraq -- a mission criticized as being undermanned .

“ These numbers are big , ” said Peter Singer , a Brookings Institution scholar who has written on military contracting .
“ They illustrate better than anything that we went in without enough troops .
This is not the coalition of the willing .
It ’s the coalition of the billing . ”
The numbers include at least 21,000 Americans , 43,000 foreign contractors and about 118,000 Iraqis -- all employed in Iraq by U.S. tax dollars , according to the most recent government data .
The array of private workers promises to be a factor in debates on a range of policy issues , including the privatization of military jobs and the number of Iraqi refugees allowed to resettle in the U.S .
But there are also signs that even those mounting numbers may not capture the full picture .
Private security contractors , who are hired to protect government officials and buildings , were not fully counted in the survey , according to industry and government officials .
Advertisement
Continuing uncertainty over the numbers of armed contractors drew special criticism from military experts .
“ We do n’t have control of all the coalition guns in Iraq .
That ’s dangerous for our country , ” said William Nash , a retired Army general and reconstruction expert .
The Pentagon “ is hiring guns .
You can rationalize it all you want , but that ’s obscene . ”
Although private companies have played a role in conflicts since the American Revolution , the U.S. has relied more on contractors in Iraq than in any other war , according to military experts .
Contractors perform functions including construction , security and weapons system maintenance .
Advertisement
Military officials say contractors cut costs while allowing troops to focus on fighting rather than on other tasks .
“ The only reason we have contractors is to support the war fighter , ” said Gary Motsek , the assistant deputy undersecretary of Defense who oversees contractors .
“ Fundamentally , they ’re supporting the mission as required . ”
But critics worry that troops and their missions could be jeopardized if contractors , functioning outside the military ’s command and control , refuse to make deliveries of vital supplies under fire .
At one point in 2004 , for example , U.S. forces were put on food rations when drivers balked at taking supplies into a combat zone .
Advertisement
Adding an element of potential confusion , no single agency keeps track of the number or location of contractors .
In response to demands from Congress , the U.S. Central Command began a census last year of the number of contractors working on U.S. and Iraqi bases to determine how much food , water and shelter was needed .
That census , provided to The Times under the Freedom of Information Act , shows about 130,000 contractors and subcontractors of different nationalities working at U.S. and Iraqi military bases .
However , U.S. military officials acknowledged that the census did not include other government agencies , including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department .
Advertisement
Last month , USAID reported about 53,000 Iraqis employed under U.S. reconstruction contracts , doing jobs such as garbage pickup and helping to teach democracy .
In interviews , agency officials said an additional 300 Americans and foreigners worked as contractors for the agency .
State Department officials said they could not provide the department ’s number of contractors .
Of about 5,000 people affiliated with the U.S. Embassy in Iraq , about 300 are State Department employees .
The rest are a mix of other government agency workers and contractors , many of whom are building the new embassy .
“ There are very few of us , and we ’re way undermanned , ” said one State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ We have significant shortages of people .
It ’s been that way since before [ the war ] , and it ’s still that way . ”
The companies with the largest number of employees are foreign firms in the Middle East that subcontract to KBR , the Houston - based oil services company , according to the Central Command database .
KBR , once a subsidiary of Halliburton Co. , provides logistics support to troops , the single largest contract in Iraq .
Advertisement
Middle Eastern companies , including Kulak Construction Co. of Turkey and Projects International of Dubai , supply labor from Third World countries to KBR and other U.S. companies for menial work on U.S. bases and rebuilding projects .
Foreigners are used instead of Iraqis because of fears that insurgents could infiltrate projects .
KBR is by far the largest employer of Americans , with nearly 14,000 U.S. workers .
Other large employers of Americans in Iraq include New York - based L - 3 Communications , which holds a contract to provide translators to troops , and ITT Corp. , a New York engineering and technology firm .
The most controversial contractors are those working for private security companies , including Blackwater , Triple Canopy and Erinys .
They guard sensitive sites and provide protection to U.S. and Iraqi government officials and businessmen .
Security contractors draw some of the sharpest criticism , much of it from military policy experts who say their jobs should be done by the military .
On several occasions , heavily armed private contractors have engaged in firefights when attacked by Iraqi insurgents .
Advertisement
Others worry that the private security contractors lack accountability .
Although scores of troops have been prosecuted for serious crimes , only a handful of private security contractors have faced legal charges .
The number of private security contractors in Iraq remains unclear , despite Central Command ’s latest census .
The Times identified 21 security companies in the Central Command database , deploying 10,800 men .
However , the Defense Department ’s Motsek , who monitors contractors , said the Pentagon estimated the total was 6,000 .
Both figures are far below the private security industry ’s own estimate of about 30,000 private security contractors working for government agencies , nonprofit organizations , media outlets and businesses .
Advertisement
Industry officials said that private security companies helped reduce the number of troops needed in Iraq and provided jobs to Iraqis -- a benefit in a country with high unemployment .
“ A guy who is working for a [ private security company ] is not out on the street doing something inimical to our interests , ” said Lawrence Peter , director of the Private Security Company Assn. of Iraq .
Not surprisingly , Iraqis make up the largest number of civilian employees under U.S. contracts .
Typically , the government contracts with an American firm , which then subcontracts with an Iraqi firm to do the job .
Stan Soloway , president of the Professional Services Council , a contractors ’ trade group , said the number of Iraqis reflected the importance of the reconstruction and economic development efforts to the overall U.S. mission in Iraq .
Advertisement
“ That ’s not work that the government does or has ever done ....
That ’s work that is going to be done by companies and to some extent by ” nongovernmental organizations , Soloway said .
“ People tend to think that these are contractors on the battlefield , and they ’re not . ”
The Iraqis have been the most difficult to track .
As recently as May , the Pentagon told Congress that 22,000 Iraqis were employed by its contractors .
But the Pentagon number recently jumped to 65,000 -- a result of closer inspection of contracts , an official said .
The total number of Iraqis employed under U.S. contracts is important , in part because it may influence debate in Congress regarding how many Iraqis will be allowed to come to the U.S. to escape violence in their homeland .
This year , the U.S. planned to cap that number at 7,000 a year .
To date , however , only a few dozen Iraqis have been admitted , according to State Department figures .
Advertisement
Kirk Johnson , head of the List Project , which seeks to increase the admission of Iraqis , said that the U.S. needed to provide a haven to those who worked most closely with American officials .
“ We all say we are grateful to these Iraqis , ” Johnson said .
“ How can we be the only superpower in the world that ca n’t implement what we recognize as a moral imperative ? ”

The back story
Information in this article is based in part on a database of contractors in Iraq obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act , which allows the public access to government records .
The database is the result of a census conducted earlier this year by the U.S. Central Command .
Advertisement
The census found about 130,000 contractors working for 632 companies holding contracts in Iraq with the Defense Department and a handful of other federal agencies .
The Times received the database last month , four months after first requesting it .
Because the Freedom of Information
Act law requires an agency to provide only information as of the date of the request , the census is based on figures as of February .
During interviews , Pentagon officials said the census had since been updated , and they provided additional figures based on the update .

House committee wants secretary of state to tell what she knew in 2003
• Claim that Iraq sought to buy uranium from Niger was part of pitch for war
• Rice was national security adviser when false claim was made
• Committee also subpoenas Republican National Committee , its chairman
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A House committee Wednesday subpoenaed Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to find out what she knew about the 2003 claim that Iraq sought uranium from the African country of Niger .
The uranium claim , which President Bush made in his 2003 State of the Union address , was a key element in the administration 's case for the invasion of Iraq .
Rice was President Bush 's national security adviser at the time .
The Oversight and Government Reform Committee vote was 21 - 10 .
In July 2003 -- two months into the Iraq war -- the White House backed away from the uranium assertion after a former diplomat , Joseph Wilson , announced the CIA had sent him to Niger in 2002 to check out the report .
Wilson said he found it unlikely to be true , and alleged the Bush administration had " twisted " the evidence for war .
Deputy State Department spokesman Tom Casey said Wednesday that the department " will be consulting with the White House on this matter . "
Casey also noted Rice has addressed " this four - year - old issue on many occasions , and the subject already has been exhaustively investigated . "
And even though Rice can legitimately be called upon to testify about the State Department , her testimony may be restricted by White House regulations , a State Department official said Wednesday .
The official said the White House will not allow current or former staff to testify about internal White House matters , and has categorized Niger uranium claim as an internal issue .
In addition , the official said the subpoena date conflicts with Rice 's travel schedule , so the State Department will attempt to negotiate an alternative to Rice 's testimony .
During Wednesday 's session , the committee also approved issuing a subpoena to Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan for testimony and documents related to use of RNC e-mails by White House officials for government purposes .
The committee also agreed to issue a separate subpoena to the RNC for copies of a political briefing that was distributed to the General Services Administration or other similar political briefings , or other information regarding the use of federal agencies to assist GOP candidates .
Since taking over as chairman of the House investigative committee , Rep. Henry Waxman , D - California , renewed his call to investigate what Rice knew about the Niger uranium claim .
He has said Rice has failed to adequately answer his questions in a series of letters he has sent the secretary .
In one letter , Waxman called on Rice to outline who at the White House " kept resuscitating " the disputed report after the CIA blocked its inclusion in an October 2002 Bush speech on Iraq .
He also asked her to lay out what steps the White House took after learning documents supporting the uranium claim were forgeries and what role presidential aides played in drafting a pre-war intelligence estimate on Iraq 's weapons programs .
Last month , Waxman announced he would turn the committee 's attention to the White House 's role in the public exposure of Wilson 's wife , Valerie Plame , who was a CIA operative at the time the Niger uranium controversy erupted .
A three - year federal investigation of that leak led to last month 's conviction of Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff , on charges of perjury , obstruction of justice and making false statements to investigators .
Libby was not charged with leaking Plame 's identity , but prosecutors accused him of lying to FBI agents and a grand jury investigating the disclosure .
In his trial , prosecutors argued the administration exposed Plame 's identity in an effort to counter Wilson 's allegations .
Libby 's attorney , Ted Wells , opened the trial by declaring his client was " set up " to protect Bush political adviser Karl Rove ahead of Bush 's 2004 re-election campaign .
Syndicated columnist Robert Novak , who first published Plame 's identity , attributed his information to " two senior administration officials " -- later identified as Rove and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage .
Neither has been charged .
The White House declared in October 2003 that Rove and Libby had denied any role in the leak .
It has largely refused to comment on the matter since then , citing the criminal investigation and Libby 's plan to appeal .
CNN 's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .
Kevin Chapman says he was attacked in the street
Kevin and Barbara Chapman say they and their four children , aged between 10 and 13 , have endured years of taunts , smashed windows and violence .
They said they moved from Walker to Newbiggin Hall to try to escape the bullying , and then again to Kenton Bar .
Son Kevin , 11 , said he was recently punched in a street attack .
Newcastle Council is " discussing the situation " .
Mr Chapman , 49 , said his 10 - year - old daughter Ryelle and sons Daniel , 10 , and Jordan , 13 , have also been badly affected .
He said each time the family received abuse they moved home .
They 've been punched and kicked and thrown over a hedge
Father Kevin Chapman
The family also say they have endured their homes being daubed in graffiti .
Mr Chapman said : " The abuse we get is unbelievable .
It started more than three years ago , when the kids started getting bullied by lads over the colour of their hair .
" They 've been punched and kicked and thrown over a hedge .
Every time they go out these gangs get to them . "
He added that the family now wanted to move again .
Community police officer Sergeant Colin Murray , of Northumbria Police , said there had been a number of incidents all of which had been fully investigated .
Commenting on the matter , a Newcastle City Council spokesman said : " We are currently discussing their situation . "
WASHINGTON , July 5 — A factory that makes uranium fuel for nuclear reactors had a spill so bad it kept the plant closed for seven months last year and became one of only three events in all of 2006 serious enough for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to include in an annual report to Congress .
After an investigation , the commission changed the terms of the factory ’s license and said the public had 20 days to request a hearing on the changes .
But no member of the public ever did .
In fact , no member of the public could find out about the changes .
The document describing them , including the notice of hearing rights for anyone who felt adversely affected , was stamped “ official use only , ” meaning that it was not publicly accessible .
“ Official use only ” is a category below “ Secret . ”
Documents in that category are not technically classified but are kept from the public .
PROTECTION for the mortgage lender has been unchanged since the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 .
At the time , first - time home buyers paid about 20 percent of the value of the houses upfront , got fixed - rate mortgages , and the lenders were local bankers — serious , skeptical types who scrutinized borrowers .
Homeowners agreed to mortgages they could afford .
When they ran into financial troubles , it was typically because of some unforeseen event in their lives like the loss of a job , an illness or a divorce .
The mortgage was rarely the problem .
Yet the mortgage often is the financial culprit these days .
That is particularly true of lending in the subprime market of zero - down loans with terms fixed for two years and then floating rates , arranged by aggressive national mortgage brokers and bankers who earn lucrative fees .
“ The bankruptcy law was written for a different world , and we want to give the bankruptcy courts , and creditors , more flexible tools to work with borrowers to save their homes , ” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois .
In September , Mr. Durbin , the Democratic whip , plans to propose amendments to the bankruptcy code , in a bill called the Helping Families Avoid Foreclosure Act .
It would , among other things , permit writing down loans and stretching out payment terms .
Some bankruptcy experts agree that it is time to change the law .
“ Our bankruptcy laws are not well designed to deal with a massive wave of mortgage foreclosures , ” said Elizabeth Warren , a professor at the Harvard Law School .
In particular , Ms. Warren said , bankruptcy courts should be able to rewrite mortgages in line with market conditions .
The banking industry , which pushed hard for the tougher bankruptcy law in 2005 , wants no easing up now .
For people struggling to hold onto their homes , the path to financial peril usually began with bad loans .
Bad choices often made matters worse .
Sir Tom said it could take him years to give away the cash
The donation is thought to be the single most generous philanthropic commitment made by a Briton .
The ex-owner of sports chain Sports Division has a £ 1.05 bn fortune .
He says it will take years to transfer the cash but that he is committed to doing it .
He had already committed £ 100 m to his charitable foundation to fight inequality in both Scotland and Africa .
In an exclusive interview with the BBC 's business editor Robert Peston , Sir Tom said he was concerned about the growing gap in the UK between the rich and poor and wanted to boost opportunities for those at the bottom .
My own personal belief is that with great wealth comes great responsibility

He added that putting the fruits of his labour to philanthropic use helped to motivate him as a wealth - creating businessman .
He said : " There is more great wealth in fewer hands than ever before in history .
" My own personal belief is that with great wealth comes great responsibility .
" We 've got all the material , goals have all been settled some time ago .
So now the philanthropy is the real motivator to continue to make money . "
He joked : " First of all , I 'm a Scotsman , so I 'm not very good at giving money away . "
In April Sir Tom became Scotland 's first home - grown billionaire .

Ranking 60th equal in the UK , the tycoon has amassed a fortune of about £ 1.05 bn .
He grew up in the mining village of New Cumnock in Ayrshire , before attending the University of Strathclyde .
He began his career by selling trainers from the back of a van and in 1984 founded the Sports Division chain .
The company was sold to retailer JJB Sports in 1998 , making Sir Tom an estimated £ 250m .
The store and the warehouse were gutted by the fire
They died after the store 's roof collapsed on them .
The mayor said it was " a tragedy of immense proportions " .
The fire began on Monday night , and was described by some witnesses as a " tornado of flames " .
Two employees were rescued from the buildings .
The cause of the fire is being investigated .
The fire began at about 1900 local time on Monday ( 2300 GMT ) in the Sofa Super Store and warehouse , Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley told reporters .
He said the blaze apparently started in a storage area .
Local residents said the store 's roof collapsed , burying the firefighters and throwing burning debris around the building .
" It was like a 30 - foot tornado of flames , " Mark Hilton was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency .
The mayor said the firefighters " extinguished the fire and they lost their lives fighting for the safety of our citizens " .
" To lose nine is just a tragedy of immense proportions , " he said .

This is an outstanding 3D animation of HIV replication cycle .
I especially loved the entry part , which is like watching a science fiction movie .
The animation is fairly accurate representation of what we know about the this viruses life cycle today , except the part on entry of viral DNA into nucleus .
Based on our current knowledge , import of viral DNA into nucleus is not dependent on integrase but other viral and host proteins that are still elusive .
Integrase is however necessary for the integration of virus DNA into host genome .

Timothy Cox saw a " gap in the market " , the court heard
Global agencies , led by UK investigators , examined more than 700 suspects , including 200 in the UK .
The ring was run by Timothy Cox , 28 , of Buxhall , Suffolk , who admitted nine offences and has been handed a sentence which could mean he dies in jail .
A judge at Ipswich Crown Court told Cox : " You are obsessed with images of children being sexually abused . "
Chatroom infiltration
Cox ran a website called " Kids the Light of Our Lives " which let users exchange abuse images , the court heard .
Judge Peter Thompson told Cox : " These are shocking images which involve very young children - in the worst cases being subjected to sadistic , painful abuse which you , for some distorted reason , appear to take enjoyment from . "
Anybody who thinks they can carry out such horrific activities undetected is in for a rude awakening
Jim Gamble
CEOP
More than 75,000 indecent and explicit images were found on Cox 's computer and there was evidence that he had supplied more than 11,000 images to other site users .
Cox pleaded guilty to possessing and distributing indecent images of children at an earlier hearing and was handed an indeterminate sentence .
Cox posed " significant risks " , the judge said , and had to be imprisoned for " for public protection " .
Under the terms of his sentence , he must satisfy the authorities that he is fit for release and does not pose any threat to the community before he can ever be set free .
Ian Robertson , of the UK - based Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre ( CEOP ) , told BBC News 24 that the ages of the children whose images were exchanged on the site ranged from babies to teenagers .
After he was arrested in September 2006 , undercover officers spent 10 days infiltrating the chatroom , assuming his identity to collect evidence about other users .
When Cox was arrested , undercover officers placed a message online saying he had gone for his tea and would be back in half an hour to avoid raising suspicions .
As many as 70 online paedophiles were waiting to download images of abuse .
Investigators from the Australian Federal Police , the US Department of Homeland Security and Toronto Police took part in the online surveillance operation .
In total , 31 children were saved as a result of the investigation , CEOP said .
Cox lived with his parents , sister and 26 - year - old girlfriend in a large farmhouse and worked at the family 's micro-brewery .
The website was operated from his bedroom .
CEOP said Cox hosted the website using the pseudonym " Son of God " - a reference to " G.O.D " , the online identity of the owner of another paedophile site shut down by police last year .
The court heard Cox spotted a " gap in the market " after the other site was closed .
Simon Spence , prosecuting , told the court : " For what must have been hours at a time he was online either viewing these images of children , arranging the chat room or communicating with other paedophiles . "
' Horrific activities '
Canadian police passed intelligence about the site to UK investigators
Jim Gamble of CEOP said his capture " sends a powerful warning to those using the internet to facilitate the sexual exploitation of children " .
He added : " From the apparent ' safety ' of his home , Cox spent hours each day planning , promoting and encouraging the abuse and exploitation of children .
" In doing so he provided a service to hundreds of like - minded individuals , enabling those with a sexual interest in children to share indecent images and discuss further plans for abuse .
" Anybody who thinks they can carry out such horrific activities undetected is in for a rude awakening . "
Cox had been identified after intelligence connecting the site to the UK was passed to CEOP by Canadian investigators .
Detective Constable Stefan Jochan said : " He does n't fit any kind of traditional image of paedophile .
He had a veneer of respectability . "
The investigation uncovered another member of the same ring , Gordon Mackintosh from Hertfordshire , who attempted to keep the website going after Cox was arrested .
Mackintosh , 33 , used the names " silentblackheart " and " lust4skoolgurls " .
More than 5,000 images were found on his computer as well as 392 indecent movie files .
He pleaded guilty to 27 charges of making , possessing and distributing the material and is due to be sentenced on June 29 .
By Kim Tae -gyuStaff ReporterSophisticated security robots will be deployed in the near future to patrol schools around the clock to protect students from violence and other dangers .
DU Robo said Wednesday that the Seoul - based venture start - up company plans to begin a pilot run of the security robot , dubbed OFRO , in a middle school .
This is the first time in the world that a robot will be employed to guard an educational institution , according to DU Robo .
`` We are set to check the viability of OFRO as a school robot at a middle school in southern Seoul this week along with KT Telecop , '' DU Robo CEO Kang Jung - won said .
`` After going through the feasibility test , we look to commercialize the feature - rich OFRO that retails at around $ 100,000 as a school guardian , '' he said .
Affiliated with the country 's dominant fixed - line telecom company KT , KT Telecop offers security services based on landline telephone lines .
OFRO , which moves at a maximum speed of 5 kilometers per hour , can automatically patrol areas on pre-programmed maps or it can be manually controlled .
Equipped with a camera and a microphone , OFRO also provides visual files to officials of KT Telecop or teachers at schools on a real - time basis .
`` One possible scenario is that OFRO will alert officials when it detects someone trying to seduce a student .
Then , teachers will send a warning to the perpetrator through a loudspeaker , '' Kang said .
`` If the suspicious person refuses to comply with the instruction , KT Telecop guards will be sent there , '' he said .

Last year , when students at Skyline Vista and Baker elementary schools missed federal math and reading goals for a third consecutive year , officials in the Adams 50 School District did what the law required .
They sent letters to parents in English and Spanish , notifying them that under the federal No Child Left Behind act of 2001 , their children were eligible for free tutoring .
Parents , the letters said , could choose from a list of state - approved tutoring companies .
The district , the letters said , would spend up to roughly $ 1,000 and tutoring would be provided by private companies such as Catapult Online or PLATO Learning .
More than 650 families were eligible .
A few parents called with questions , but when the sign - up period concluded , “ none of our families took us up on that , ” said Cynthia Davis , a district coordinator .
Under No Child Left Behind , public school students are required to meet certain reading and math goals each year .
If a school that gets Title I money – federal grants to benefit economically disadvantaged students – misses those goals three years in a row , it must offer supplemental services to low - income students .
Supplemental services are most often tutoring , but could also be summer school programs , and are provided by nonprofit , for - profit or other state - approved companies .
But across the nation – and throughout Colorado – most of the poorest students in low - performing schools are n’t benefiting .
At Thornton Middle School , for example , 556 students were eligible for free tutoring last year , but just two took part .
And at Kepner Middle School in Denver , just 28 students out of 1,046 took advantage of supplemental services provided under the law .
An August study by the federal Government Accountability Office found that just 19 percent of eligible students nationwide participated during the 2004 - 05 school year .
In Colorado , where 72 schools were required to offer supplemental services , just less than 11 percent of the 28,420 students eligible took part last year , according to the Colorado Department of Education .
Participation is so low that state officials plan this month to assemble a group of parents to find out why more families are not using the free tutoring , said Patrick Chapman , a federal programs director for the Colorado Department of Education .
Federal officials worry that some schools are n’t doing enough to inform parents the service is available .
“ The primary concern is that while some schools have done a good job of outreach , there are still many ” that have not gone beyond sending letters out to parents , said Morgan Brown , an assistant deputy secretary at the U.S. Department of Education .
Real - life obstacles
Colorado educators attribute the low response to various reasons , including lack of interest and competition from other after - school programs or real - life obstacles – such as lack of transportation or students needing to care for younger siblings after school .
Others say the notification letters schools send to parents are sometimes confusing or filled with technical jargon .
“ Parents very often do n’t know what it is they ’re receiving and they do n’t understand there is an actual deadline , ” said Judy Kaufman , director of the Colorado Parent Information & Resource Center in Denver .
Kaufman also said districts have an incentive not to raise participation in tutoring because if the money earmarked for tutoring goes unused , districts can allocate it for other programs for poor students .
Chapman said districts must set aside at least 5 percent of their Title I funds to cover tutoring costs , but must spend at least 15 percent if there is demand .
Patti Paredes , executive director of Title 1 programs for the Adams 12 School District , said the district set aside $ 136,595 in federal funds for tutoring last year , but only had to use $ 14,288 .
The unused portion covered summer school costs for students who were rated “ unsatisfactory ” on state tests .
She said does n’t agree districts are deterring students from taking advantage of tutoring .
“ I do n’t believe … that schools promote or do n’t promote ” the program , she said .
Dave Crews , assistant superintendent in the Montezuma - Cortez School District , said he sent letters to the families of students at Manaugh and Kemper elementary schools last year , but only in English .
Spanish - speaking families had family members who could translate for them , he said .
Just 20 out of 496 students took part .
One reason is that students are already participating in after - school enrichment programs offered by the school , including dance and tutoring .
More than half of schools required to offer tutoring last year were in the Denver Public Schools system .
Nancy Connor , director of Title 1 programs in DPS , agreed that some students do n’t go to federally funded tutoring because they already participate in a number of other after - school programs .
“ This is not the only game in town , ” she said .
Efforts go beyond letters
In schools where participation was higher , it appears administrators went beyond sending a letter .
Wheat Ridge Middle School in Jefferson County had one of the highest participation rates in the state last year – one in four eligible students took part – despite operating its own after - school session where students could get tutoring .
Literacy coach Diane Wilson personally called parents and asked them to take part in after - school tutoring .
She speculated that some students may not be able to attend because of life demands .
“ There are some parents who ca n’t allow their kids to participate because the junior high kid has to babysit younger siblings .
They have to prepare dinner , ” she said .
Larry Tarver , assistant principal at Wheat Ridge Middle School , said some parents choose not to participate because “ they do n’t realize this is going to help them . ”
Denver ’s Schenck Elementary School had the highest participation rate of any school in the state , with 38 percent of the 469 eligible students taking part .
Vickie Maniscalco , assistant principal at Schenck , said that in addition to the notification letters , one tutoring service offered a $ 100 reward to all students who had perfect attendance in their tutoring program .
“ That is a huge incentive , ” she said .
The students also got a treat if they had a perfect attendance in one class , and an ice cream or pizza party for five days of perfect attendance .
In addition , the school provided snacks .
“ We ’re actually a low - performing school and we really felt it might benefit our students , ” Maniscalco said .
Unlike some of the other schools , Schenck did not have alternative tutoring programs , she said .
Parent Cecilia Medina sent her daughter , 8 - year - old Cecilia Frances Medina , to tutoring last year , when she was a second - grader .
“ They did a lot of the reading and they did a lot of hands - on stuff , ” she said .
“ I noticed that my little girl was better at reading and also with math . ”
Medina ’s daughter also received $ 75 for having good – though not perfect – attendance . ”
“ She was so happy , ” Medina said .

One by one , half a dozen Republican presidential hopefuls auditioned Saturday before an Iowa audience of economic and social conservatives , pledging lower taxes , tougher border enforcement and a tighter - fisted approach to federal spending .
The candidates also echoed one another in reiterating their opposition to abortion and to legalizing same - sex marriage .
“ One man .
One woman .
Lifetime relationship , ” said former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who joined former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney in advocating a constitutional amendment spelling out that domestic arrangement .
“ We need to affirm that ’s what marriage means , ” said Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas .

The forum in downtown Des Moines attracted hundreds of activists who sacrificed an unusually mild summer day -- and a nearby arts festival -- to hear nearly four hours of back - to - back political speeches in a darkened arena .
In short , they were the kind of devotees that each candidate covets as he eyes the state ’s caucuses that open the presidential balloting in January .
There was little in their remarks to differentiate the six speakers .
Asked to respond to a handful of preselected questions , each vowed to cut taxes as well as federal spending , to simplify the tax code , and to oppose federal funding for embryonic stem cell research .
“ We do n’t need to hurt the weak to help the strong , ” Brownback said .
The candidates celebrated the Senate ’s rejection last week of immigration legislation and endorsed an enforcement - first approach , starting with the construction of a 700 - mile fence along the U.S. - Mexico border and the creation of an electronic employee verification system .

Brownback and Romney did split with others by declining to endorse the so - called Fair Tax bill , which would replace the federal tax code with a 23 % national sales tax .
Each endorsed tax fairness and simplification as a goal but said that particular proposal needed more study before he could embrace it .
Among the six , only Rep. Duncan Hunter of El Cajon declined to take a no - tax - hike pledge , saying a national emergency might require him to break that vow .
Touting his record of “ voting for every major tax cut that has come in front of Congress for 26 years , ” Hunter said he nevertheless would not make a promise he might someday have to break .
For the most part , the candidates ignored one another .
Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson took a veiled swipe at Romney , who has turned more conservative since eyeing the White House .
Thompson called himself the “ true ” and “ reliable ” conservative in the race .
“ I did n’t become right - to - life on the road to Des Moines , ” he said of his antiabortion stance .

Rep .
Tom Tancredo of Colorado , a crowd favorite , drew cheers by challenging others to forswear Spanish - language advertising as they seek Latino support .
Two candidates were notably absent : former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Sen. John McCain of Arizona , both of whom have alienated many conservatives with their break from orthodoxy on social issues and immigration , respectively .
Earlier Saturday , Romney discussed his Mormonism when a woman at a campaign forum asked how faith would guide his actions as president .
“ Where would the Bible be in that process ? ” Mary Van Steenis asked .
“ Would it be above the Book of Mormon or would it be beneath it ? ”
“ I do n’t know that there ’s any conflict at all between the values of great faiths like mine , like yours , like other faiths , like Jews who do n’t believe in the New Testament , ” Romney replied .
“ People of faith have different doctrines and different beliefs on various topics of a theological nature .
But in terms of what it is we are going to believe and also based on our values for our country , I think we come from the same place . ”

Van Steenis was not satisfied .
“ I asked , If you had to look to one source , what would it be ? ” she told reporters after the event in Pella , Iowa .
“ He did n’t really respond to that .
This is serious to me . ”
The Romney campaign later issued a statement saying Romney took his gubernatorial oath of office on his family Bible .
“ He swore to follow the Constitution and uphold the laws of the land , ” spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom said .
“ That would continue to be his highest duty as president . ”

This report includes information from the Associated Press .
MPs previously rejected attempts to extend the limit to 90 days
A " highly visible " uniformed force would bring together immigration and Customs officers , Gordon Brown said .
He also announced a review of allowing intercept evidence in court , and plans to raise from 28 days the time police can hold suspects without charge .
But the Tories and Lib Dems said any border force should include police officers , new resources and new powers .
Officers from the Border and Immigration Agency , Revenue and Customs and UKVisas will be brought together to create a " single primary checkpoint " for passport control and customs .
New uniforms do not make a new force
David Davis
Analysis : Terror consensus ?
Terrorism statements in full
Outlining his counter - terrorism strategy to MPs , he said the cabinet secretary had been asked to report back by October on how to implement the proposal " very soon " .
But Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told the BBC the proposal was " a bit less than met the eye " adding : " New uniforms do not make a new force . "
And for the Lib Dems , Nick Clegg said it was " a border force lite without police powers or the incorporation of the transport police " .
Biometric visas
But Mr Brown said the new borders officers would have " immigration , customs and police powers to investigate and detain people suspected of immigration , customs and criminal offences " .
He also said he wanted stronger measures to stop terrorism suspects arriving in the first place , through electronic screening of all passengers checking in and out of the UK .
I think it is a complete and utter nonsense , this idea that Parliament could act as a court
Nick Clegg
Lib Dems
Who guards UK borders ?
Q&A : Anti-terror laws
All visa applicants would require biometric visas from March 2008 and the existing " e- borders scheme " would be expanded .
An " all - party consensus " on the use of intercept evidence in court and questioning of suspects after they have been charged would be sought .
But the government looks set to press ahead with attempts to extend the period for which terrorism suspects can be held without charge , beyond the current 28 day limit .
Terror detention
Mr Brown said one option was to double it to 56 days , subject to parliamentary scrutiny and a judge 's approval .
He said there had been 15 attempted terrorist attacks on Britain since 2001 and 30 people had been convicted so far this year .
Ministers say it is right to consider extending it because of the increasing complexity of some plots - but the Tories , Lib Dems and some Labour backbenchers have opposed previous attempts to do so .
For the Lib Dems Mr Clegg said the idea of parliamentary oversight of any extension was " complete and utter nonsense " .
" What is Parliament supposed to do when the police are detaining someone without charge ?
They wo n't be given privy to all the information so I 'm afraid I think a lot of that is a bit of a fig leaf . "
' Terrorist recruiter 's dream '
Mr Davis also indicated that the Tories would continue to oppose the moves , unless there was any new evidence that it was necessary .
Amnesty International 's Nicola Duckworth said locking people up for 56 days without charge " amounted to internment " which had " devastating consequences " in Northern Ireland in the 1970s .
And Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti said it would act as a " terrorist recruiter 's dream " .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith told the BBC the government recognised the " very real concerns about liberty " , but added that terrorist plots were becoming more complicated , more international and police were having to go through hundreds of discs , computers and house searches abroad .
" The weight of opinion , not just from us but from others , suggests that we may well be getting to the point where 28 days will not be long enough to have done that investigation and to have charged somebody in order that you can then bring them to a conviction . "
Other proposals announced include :
A new system of electronic exit controls at UK borders from 2009 , so that passports can be checked against the " warnings index " in real time .
From March 2008 biometric visas to be extended to all visa applicants
A review of how to best protect crowded places , buildings and national infrastructure such as roads , railways , tunnels , bridges , water systems and utilities
UK watch list of suspects to be linked to the Interpol database of lost and stolen documents
£ 70 m to help local councils and community groups with citizenship projects aimed at combating extremism
Consultation on tightening bail conditions and travel restrictions on terrorism suspects
Mr Brown also revealed that 900 shopping centres , sports centres and other venues where large numbers of people congregate had been assessed by counter - terrorism advisers .
And he said " additional protection " was needed for utility sites , crowded places and the national infrastructure , from roads and the railway to waterways .
Reviews on security measures at such sites would be on - going over the summer , he added .
Higher Fish Diet Seems To Make Babies Smarter
As part of the University of Bristol Children Of The 90s project dietary information and child cognitive performance was checked for children in thousands of families ( the news reports speak of 9000 families or 11,875 pregnant women - maybe the higher number includes multiple pregnancies from some of the women ? ) .
Children whose mothers ate fish more than 3 times a week did better in tests of cognitive function .
Mothers who ate more seafood than the US guidelines ( 340 grams , or three portions a week ) had children who were more advanced in development tests measuring fine motor , communication and social skills as toddlers , had more positive social behaviours and were less likely to have low verbal IQ scores at the age of eight .
Those children whose mothers had eaten no fish were 28 per cent more likely to have poor communication skills at 18 months , 35 per cent more likely to have poor fine motor coordination at age three and a half , 44 per cent more likely to have poor social behaviour at age seven and 48 per cent more likely to have a relatively low verbal IQ at age eight , when compared with children of women who ate more than the US guidelines advised .
But did they test parental IQ ?
Or did they control for socio-economic status of the parents ?
( which would be a rough proxy for genetic differences )
Main study author Joseph Hibbeln thinks these results suggest US government advice on fish eating in pregnancy is wrong .
The new findings suggest that , for developing brains , the risks of limiting seafood consumption outweigh the benefits of such a limit , the NIH 's Joseph R. Hibbeln , MD , tells WebMD .
" Regrettably , these data indicate that the [ FDA - EPA ] advisory apparently causes the harm that it was intended to prevent , especially with regard to verbal development , " Hibbeln says .
The FDA - EPA advisory is aimed at reducing mercury exposure .
But you can avoid the mercury while still getting lots of omega 3 fatty acids by either eating low mercury fish or by taking fish oil capsules .
Avoid higher mercury fish from the top of the food chain .
The study supports the contrary advice , given by the Food Standards Agency in the UK , which backs fish as a healthy food .
The FSA simply advises mothers to avoid shark , swordfish and marlin , and restrict their intake of tuna .
The new research into childrens behaviour and intelligence suggests that women who follow the US advisory  issued in 2004 to limit consumption , or cut fish out of their diet altogether , may miss nutrients that the developing brain needs  and so harm their children .
The women filled out a seafood consumption questionnaire while pregnant .
At 32 weeks into their pregnancy , the women were asked to fill in a seafood consumption questionnaire .
They were subsequently sent questionnaires four times during their pregnancy , and then up to eight years after the birth of their child .
Researchers examined issues including the children 's social and communication skills , their hand - eye coordination , and their IQ levels .
As with any study based on self - reporting methods , however , the results cannot be considered entirely definitive .
What I want to know :
Did the mothers who ate less fish have lower IQs than the mothers who ate more fish ?
In other words , did these researchers measure an effect of nutritional differences or of genetic differences ?
We still do not know with certainty that omega 3 fatty acids help make babies smarter .
But since there 's a chance they might it seems prudent for women to eat very low mercury fish .
High Fish Consumption Raises Baby Intelligence But Mercury Lowers IQ

In a telephone interview with the Guardian , Christopher Dell said prices were going up twice a day , sapping popular confidence in a government that is now " committing regime change on itself " .
" I believe inflation will hit 1.5 m % by the end of 2007 , if not before , " Mr Dell said .
" I know that sounds stratospheric but , looking at the way things are going , I believe it is a modest forecast . "
Zimbabwe 's official inflation is 4,500 % but independent economists and retailers say it is actually above 11,000 % and picking up speed .
The black market rate for the pound soared from Z$ 160,000 last week to Z$ 400,000 this week .
The US dollar rate has topped Z$ 250,000 , while the official rate is fixed at just Z$ 250 .
Mr Mugabe stubbornly insists that the Zimbabwe currency must not be devalued .
" Prices are going up twice a day , in some cases doubling several times a week , " said Mr Dell , who is approaching the end of his posting to Zimbabwe .
" It destabilises everything .
People have completely lost faith in the currency and that means they have lost faith in the government that issues it .
" By carrying out disastrous economic policies , the Mugabe government is committing regime change upon itself , " he said .
" Things have reached a critical point .
I believe the excitement will come in a matter of months , if not weeks .
The Mugabe government is reaching end game , it is running out of options . "
For Zimbabweans living in the turmoil of economic meltdown , hyperinflation is spreading poverty , as even basic goods become unaffordable .
Supermarkets ' trollies lie idle as few can afford to buy more than a handful of goods .
Government regulations will only permit withdrawals from banks of Z$ 1.5 m per day , which is not enough to buy a week 's worth of groceries .
At golf courses , golfers pay for their drinks before they set off on their round , because the price will have gone up by the time they have finished the 18th hole .
One individual was recently told by a pension company that it would no longer send him statements as his fund was worth less than the price of a stamp .
" I can barely cope with inflation in the thousands , but millions ?
We will die , " said Iddah Mandaza , a Harare factory worker .
Mr Mandaza said some workers are now saving on transport costs by " going to their jobs on Monday and sleeping at the workplace until Friday .
They all share their meals .
That 's what they do to get by . "
Many Zimbabweans are resorting to barter .
" I traded some soap for two buckets of maize meal [ Zimbabwe 's staple food ] .
It was far much better than trying to buy it in the shops , " said worker Richard Mukondo .
" People in the rural areas are even worse off .
You can see they are hungry and their clothes are in tatters .
They trade in whatever they can produce : tomatoes , onions , chickens and eggs . "
Tony Hawkins , professor of economics at the University of Zimbabwe , said that no one holds cash in the country any more .
" People spend it as soon as they get it .
Goods hold their value , not money .
The government has run out of solutions .
At this rate perhaps inflation could hit 1 m % , but one gets a sense that things will crack before then . "
At the other end of the technological scale , enterprising Zimbabweans abroad have set up internet trading schemes , such as Mukuru.com , in which Zimbabweans overseas pay for goods with foreign currency and then vouchers for fuel , food and medicines are sent to recipients in Zimbabwe via email or on their cell phones .
This business has thrived because more than three million Zimbabweans - a quarter of the country 's 12 million people - now live abroad .
Half of Zimbabwe 's families depend on remittances from overseas to pay basic monthly bills , according to a recent survey by the University of Zimbabwe .
Mr Dell , 51 , who has had a tumultuous three years as ambassador to Zimbabwe , said that Mr Mugabe faces further trouble from his army , which used to be considered solidly loyal to the president .
Last week six men , including an army private and a retired senior officer , were charged in court for plotting against the president .
He said the allegations of the coup plot show divisions within Mr Mugabe 's ruling party , the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front ( Zanu - PF ) .
" I do n't believe it was a real coup plot .
I think it shows one side of Zanu - PF plotting against the other .
The bitter factional infighting is now dragging in the military .
That can not be good news for Mugabe , " said Mr Dell .
South African president Thabo Mbeki's efforts to mediate between Zanu - PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) are " the last great hope for a peaceful resolution to Zimbabwe 's crisis " , Mr Dell said .

http://www.vector-scan.com/workshop/TTL/10/
：月刊誌に電子玩具の作り方を連載していたときに紹介したものの一つがコレ。記事はにありますが、英訳したい方がいたら大歓迎です。メカ二ズムは単純なフィードバック・システムで、音を出すトリガーとセンサー、音を遅らせるメモリで構成されています。誰でも一目で分かるシンプルなものですね。
( “ PLX ” （Kuwakubo , 2001 ）
：ディスプレイをはさんで2人のプレイヤーが別々にプレイするんだけども動いてるアイコンは同じ、というのがこの“ PLX”ですね。片方がハートを射るキューピット、でも反対側は宇宙船を射るプレイヤー、みたいな。このジュクスタポジションを選んだ経緯は？
コンソールのデザインでプレイヤー間に生じるテンションは何故重要と考えるのか？ という辺りですけど。
： PLXの基本モチーフはミス・コミュニケーションです。
例えば普段の会話でも知らぬ間に互いにすれ違うことって、ありますよね？
それでも長い時間、会話は成り立ってしまう。
あと、褒めるつもりで言ったことが逆に相手を傷つけちゃったり。PLX はそういった状況をシミュレートしています。あと一つの隠されたモチーフはもっとオタッキーで、ずっと昔バンダイの潜水艦ゲームLSIを解体したことがあって、
その時このゲームを戦車の戦闘ゲームとしてコンフィギュアする別の接続オプションがPCBにあったんですね。で、これを見て、バイナリーの世界では別々のものも似たように表現されることに気づいた。コンソールのデザインに関しては、最近はアーケードに行くとみんな（僕自身ゲームはあまりやらないんだけども）背筋をピンと伸ばしてスクリーンと真剣に向き合っていて互いのことなんか目もくれないんですよ（なんだか役人みたいに）。それが悪いと思ってるわけでは全くないんですけど。あとPLXではゲームや仕事にまつわる偶然性を表現しています。全然話は変わるんですけど80年代のはじめにはスペースインベーダーが出てビデオゲームが喫茶店に置かれていたもんです。そんな古いスタイルが僕は好きなんですよ。コンソールでありながら同時にそれがテーブルにもなりコーヒーも味わえる、という。

：このビットマンは本体自身の動きに応じて小さなLEDのフィギュアをディスプレイに表示するシンプルな端末。振れば振るほどフィギュアは激しくダンスして興奮する…最初に意図したのは何？
商品化されて一般の受け止め方はどう変わった？
：プロトタイプというのは製品バージョンのようには機能しませんし、これは単なる8×8のLEDサインボードです。自分が電子で最初に手がけた作品ですね。最初はこれをビットマンにしようなんて特に考えていなかった。ただ自分の電子スキルを生かして何か面白いものを作ってやろうじゃないか、ということだけでしたね。ビットマンでコラボした明和電気さんが製品バージョンを作ろうと企画した時、まず考えたのは皆を巻き込めるものにしたいな、ということ。ボタンの代わりに傾きセンサーを採用したのもそのためです。ライブのアニメーションをわずか8×8ピクセルという中で生成することにも興味がありました。なもんだから、アニメーション・エディターを最初に作ってしまった。
( “ ループスケー プ ” （Kuwakubo , 2003 ）
：このループスケープは、2人のプレイヤーが360度の円形スクリーンで宇宙船を追いかけながら行うアクションゲームですね。既存ゲームのインタラクションの効果をどう高めたかったんでしょうか？
：最初に意図したのは終わりの無い世界をつくることです。“ Lifegame ” も“ Defender ” もやってることなのでバーチャル分野では珍しくないアイディアですけど、実際フィジカルにそんな世界が存在したらどうなるか、と思ったんですね。で、ちょうど秋葉原でカーブしたLEDのマトリックスが安く売ってたので作ってみました。このゲームには2つの効果があります。フィジカルなインタラクション…自分が制御する戦士を追い掛け回さなきゃならない。バーチャル世界がフィジカルな世界に影響を及ぼし、その逆もアリなので、肩と肩を小突き合わせて戦ってるプレイヤーもいたりしますね。戦略…無闇に弾を撃ち過ぎると自分自身を撃ってしまうんです。これが非常に面白いところ。因果がループになっている。
( “ HeavenSeed ” （Kuwakubo , 2003 ）
：こ の“ Heaven Seed ” はプラスティック製ボールで埋め込みセンサーが本体自体の動きを監視し、そのデータをワイヤレスでコンピュータに送信したら、コンピュータがその動きをベースに音声を生成する、という作品。 企画意図は ？
：僕が作りたかったのはボタンやパッドのないデジタル玩具ですね。昔ながらの玩具や自然物のような。何かにウィジェットがついていると人間はそれで何かをやらなきゃならなかったり、何かすることができたりしますが、そこにはいちいち目的が存在します。これが単なるボールを手にした時には目的はそれほど明確ではないから無意識のうちに物体をいじってみたりしちゃうんですよね。僕はここからファンタジーが始まるんだと考えています。物と人の関係性を高めるオブジェクトをイメージしてみました。
( “ ビデオバル ブ ” （Kuwakubo , 2000 ）
： “ ビデオバル ブ ” はどん なRCA入力端子にもプラグを挿し込んでビットマンのキャラのアニメーションを生成できる作品ですが、どうこのコンセプトに辿り着いたのでしょう？
：アニメーション企画のビットハイクを手がけたとき、アニメーションを内臓して再生できる端末が欲しいな、と思ったのが始まりです。
：現在はどんなプロジェクトを手がけていますか？ 過去作品とどう違う？
：これまで僕の作品はイノベートするためではなく、イノベーションの世界を観察するために作ったものでした。僕が常に気になるのは、新たな技術の登場によって人の行動がどう変わるか（いつも例として挙げるのは携帯電話がもたらした変化です。自分たちの暮らしがどう変わり、自分たちのプライベートな空間をパブリックな場に持ち出すことでどれだけ興奮したか、満員電車で大声で話す人をどんな風に見ているのか）隠れたイマジネーションを呼び覚ます何か、それを作り出していきたいですね。

ImpeachforPeace.org
by Mikael Rudolph with Jodin Morey
The offices of www.ImpeachforPeace.org learned this morning that Rep. Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) ( seen in photo with IFP members prior to May Day Parade ) has cosigned House Resolution 333 as authored by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) calling for impeachment hearings to commence against Vice President Richard B. Cheney .
Members of ImpeachforPeace had met with Rep. Ellison in April at which time he had said that “ Impeachment Should Be on the Table ” , but that he needed to hear clearly from his consituents as to their will in this matter before cosigning the impeachment bill authored by the Representative Kucinich who he described as “ a good friend ” .
Rep . Ellison ’s signature , along with that of Rep. James McDermott ( D - WA ) , who also added his name to the resolution this week , brought the number of cosigners of H. Res. 333 to ten .
Ellison is notably the second member of the House Judiciary Committee to cosign , along with Maxine Waters ( D - CA ) .
The HJC is where the bill sits for now , waiting for enough citizen support and pressure to be brought to a vote .
A vote resulting in a simple majority of the 38 members of the HJC would initiate impeachment hearings in the House of Representatives against Vice President Cheney for lying to lead us into the invasion and occupation of Iraq , among other charges .
Resolutions in support of H. Res. 333 and calling for Rep. Ellison to cosign were resoundingly passed at the Minnesota 5th District Democratic Farmer - Labor Party Central meeting last week after a presentation by ImpeachforPeace .
Tens of thousands of Minneapolis citizens – constituents of Rep. Ellison – had roared their approval as black - hooded , orange clad ‘ detainees ’ in chains preceded the ImpeachforPeace.org banner in both the May Day and the Pride Festival Parades .
A stack of single page Do - It Yourself Impeachment Memorials over a foot and a half tall was collected at the ImpeachforPeace table during the Pride Festival in Loring Park last weekend alone .
DIY Impeachment Memorial forms are available to be downloaded , filled out and mailed to IFP and IFP members will be hand delivering thousands of completed forms to the HJC in July .
It is the view of ImpeachforPeace that the Bush Administration has many times over proven themselves to be domestic enemies to the U. S. Constitution and that Rep. Ellison has simply honored his oath to ‘ support and defend the Constitution of the United States against enemies both foreign AND DOMESTIC ’ by adding his name to this resolution .
It is also the view of ImpeachforPeace that those civil servants at every level of our government from City Council and Mayor up through State Congress and the U.S. Congress who have yet to make a public stand against the Bush Administration from their citizen - appointed seat of power are in violation of their oaths of office until they do .
To view a partial list of impeachable offenses committed by and still being committed by Vice President Dick Cheney and others in the Bush Administration , visit the IFP Evidence Page .

How do you do solve a problem shown through an uncomfortable paper trail demonstrating a misuse of power and possible overreach ?
You eliminate the paper trail .
In all the recent headlines about blame babes ( Plame ) and politically fired political appointees ( AGs ) , the FBI overreach ‘ scandal ’ has lost its grip on first page and slipped somewhere into the middle of the paper .
( And who remembers the curfuffle about that Walter Whatever hospital ? )
The FBI story surfaced about two weeks ago when it was revealed that the government was using so called “ emergency letters ” to request telephone records .
The “ emergency letters ” were to precede a court ordered subpoena and were only to be used in – well – emergencies .
It does n’t seem to have worked out quite like that .
An audit of the practice by that oh - so - politicized Department of Justice turned up misuse .
From the Washington Post ,
The audit by the department ’s inspector general detailed widespread abuse of the FBI ’s authority to seize personal details about tens of thousands of people without court oversight through the use of national security letters .
It also found that the FBI had hatched an agreement with telephone companies allowing the agency to ask for information on more than 3,000 phone numbers — often without a subpoena , without an emergency or even without an investigative case .
In 2006 , the FBI then issued blanket letters authorizing many of the requests retroactively , according to agency officials and congressional aides briefed on the effort .
The disclosures prompted a public apology from FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III and promises of reform from Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales , who was the focus of a new tide of criticism from Democrats and Republicans already angry about his handling of the firing of eight U.S. attorneys .
The problem was that during the audit ( the download 34 MB ) , the inspector general found a paper trail showing the abuses .
Management promised to address the problem .
Yesterday ’s Washington Post carried the administration ’s solution .
Simply remove the paper trail and stop using letters – just ask for the information .
The FBI , which has been criticized for improperly gathering telephone records in terrorism cases , has told its agents they may still ask phone companies to voluntarily hand over toll records in emergencies by using a new set of procedures , officials said yesterday .
In the most dire emergencies , requests can be submitted to the companies verbally , officials said .
[…]
Under past procedures , agents sent “ exigent circumstances letters ” to phone companies , seeking toll records by asserting there was an emergency .
Then they were expected to issue a grand jury subpoena or a “ national security letter , ” which legally authorized the collection after the fact .
Agents often did not follow up with that paperwork , the inspector general ’s investigation found .
The new instructions tell agents there is no need to follow up with national security letters or subpoenas .
The agents are also told that the new letter template is the preferred method in emergencies but that they may make requests orally , with no paperwork sent to phone companies .
Such oral requests have been made over the years in terrorism and kidnapping cases , officials said .
Now the Patriot Act spelled out that the “ emergency letters ” were only to be used in “ emergencies . ”
The Patriot Act spelled out that “ emergency letters ” were to be followed up with supoenas .
But as one FBI person interviewed described in the original story ( and sorry ca n’t find the reference ) , once you have the documents the urge to do paperwork goes way down .
But hey , this new plan – no paper , but an auditable trail ( of what breadcrumbs ? )
I ’m sure that will work much better .
Bravo .
We do n’t need no paper anymore .
( Hey FBI , do you even have working software yet ?! )
According to the article there will be an audit trail .
FBI Assistant Director John Miller says so and we just have to believe him .
Because even if the FBI is wrong and the telephone records were n’t needed , the government will never tell you they requested it .
And if they forget to write it down , no one can prove they asked for it .
Neat huh ?
But perhaps more interesting is that this story got bounced back from the front page to page A06 in yesterdays WP .
It got covered almost nowhere else .
Whereas Reagan was known as the Teflon president , Bush has developed a completely new strategy : produce so much shit that the press is simply overloaded .
After all , there are only 30 minutes ( or subtracting fluff , sports , weather and advertising about 10 minutes ) on the evening news and the cable news shows manage about the same average spread over 24 hours ( but with pundits ! )
In recent years the newspapers have been getting thinner and smaller and the journalistic staffs cut .
The Bush administration has finally managed to tweak spin to a fine art .
You do n’t need to spin a story for more than three or four days if you can toss another headline grabbing scandal on the fire .
Brilliant .
Do n’t spin , scandal !
And who says Bush is n’t smart .
After all , has n’t he proven he knows where the library is in the White House ?
Now if we could only find the record of his library card to find out what he is really reading .
Oh .
Yeah .
Forgot .
No paper trail
~ Mayor Rybak with Jodin Morey of IFP
May Day at Powderhorn Park
D.L. Corvin and Natalie Morrison of ImpeachforPeace.org – Minneapolis
The weather report predicted a 50 % chance of rain , but not a drop was falling as we gathered at the parade starting location near Powderhorn Park in Minneapolis .
The events of the day demonstrated that support for impeachment exceeds expectations , and is building rapidly toward climax .
As we were preparing to march , Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak stopped by and shared his thoughts on impeachment .
At first , he noted , he had considered impeachment a distraction from the important political work that needed to be done , but he had been convinced after hearing a talk by Daniel Ellsberg , the whistleblower who leaked “ The Pentagon Papers ” in 1971 : “ If the actions of the Bush Administration do n’t justify impeachment , what would ? ” 
Mayor Rybak chatted with us briefly before departing , and soon after , Representative Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) stopped by and gave his best wishes to impeachment marchers .
Rep. Ellison also indicated that he would be interested in hosting a Town Hall meeting on impeachment .
Both Rep. Ellison and Mayor Rybak were given ImpeachforPeace.org buttons , which they promptly pinned to their shirts .
Soon the final marchers arrived ( for a total of about ten people ) and donned orange Guantanamo Bay detainee outfits to remind people about the torture and the people held unlawfully without trial at this and other U.S. institutions around the world .
Shortly , the march began .
As we walked , some of the marchers carried chains .
Some occasionally fell to their knees or to the ground to signify the abuses that detainees were suffering .
For most of the trip , impeachment demonstrators were behind The Anti-War Committee , which shouted slogans in protest of Bush ’s illegal war .
Marchers and members of the crowd shouted back with feeling .
Applause and cheering greeted the marchers the entire way along the path .
Meanwhile , as more and more people moved past the ImpeachForPeace.org table at the other side of the parade , public passion for impeachment was becoming increasingly obvious .
The enthusiasm of the event goers for signing Do - It - Yourself impeachment memorials to impeach Bush and Cheney was , frankly , beyond all of our expectations .
It was like being in an old movie about Wall Street , when the sellers on the floor were trying to keep up with the throngs of buyers before the bell rang to end the day .
Four booth staffers were kept busy for hours ensuring that the throngs of people had DIY petitions to sign .
We had petitions in our teeth , between our fingers , and under our elbows to keep them from flying away in the wind while trying to keep up with the crowd surrounding our table waiting to sign the memorials for impeachment .
At one time , we ran out of our 400 to 500 petitions and sent someone to a printer to make more .
When one of the boothers held up the last petition and yelled , “ Last petition to impeach Cheney ! ” people raised their hands and jumped up and down to be able to be sign the petition with their name and demand impeachment .
Numerous people commented that we had the most popular booth at the event .
After we ran out of petitions , we had to pass out our web address and let people know that they could download a petition to sign .
As soon as the new petitions arrived , however , it was back to finding room on the table and pens to accommodate the crowd at the table to sign them .
Even as the event was calming down , people continued to crowd around to sign petitions .
With popular and political support building , the May Day parade event was more invigorating proof that we are the majority !!!
Man's First Powered Flight Richard Pearse , Waitohi , New Zealand , March 31 , 1902 A Tribute by Bill Sherwood Please note :
This essay is reproduced here from the original in a format reworked to match the rest of this site .
The original page was not compatible with earlier browsers as is required by the brief for this project .

Waitohi , New Zealand just near Timaru Download a closeup of the aircraft
Popular history has it that the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk [ in the United States ] were the first to fly [ a heavier - than - air craft ] , but this is not true !
The first flight was by a twenty - five year old New Zealander , Richard Pearse on March 31 , 1902 .
Pearse , ( 1877 - 1953 ) , is not generally known for this wonderful feat as [ until recently ? ] there has been very little publicity about it .
In fact the first formal mention of his achievement was some seven years later in the newspapers of 1909 .
Replica of Pearse 's Machine at MOTAT in New Zealand
Pearse was an enthusiast , and perhaps a turn of the century ' mad scientist ' inventor .
Certainly his other creations - mostly farm machinery - were far from the mainstream and thus [ also ] did n't get much credit .
But he did get a few things right on his flying machine that were amazingly advanced for the time .
Accounts by witnesses of the flight vary , from " 50 to 400 yards in length " , but it seems most likely that it was around 350 yards long , and ending prematurely when the flying machine landed in a large hedge - 4 metres off the ground !
The aircraft was the first to use proper ailerons , instead of the inferior wing warping system that the Wright 's used .
Front Elevation of Pearse 's Machine
The flying machine also had a modern tricycle type landing gear , thus negating the need for ramps , slides , or skids .
Any suitable road would do .
The flying machine was aerodynamically crude , for sure , but did the job on the day , and in fact for months afterwards .
Postal Issue for the Centenary of Pearse 's flight 1903 - 2003
By the end of July 1903 , Pearse had achieved flights of around one kilometre in length , and perhaps even more amazingly , some of them included turns !
An absolutely fantastic achievement for the time .
Pearce also built the engine , which was estimated at about 15 - 22hp , but hampered by a much cruder propeller than the Wright 's machine .
Postal Issue 1990
He did n't realise the historic importance of the event , and so did n't bother to have any photographs taken of his machine flying , though [ as mentioned above ] , there is extensive evidence from witnesses describing his flights .
The Flights
Mch 31 , 1902 - First powered flight .
Estimated distance around 350 yards .
Similar to the first Wright Brothers flight , ie , in a straight line , and barely controlled .
Mch ?
1903 - After spending a year working on the engine , and tending to his farm , Pearce made another flight , this time with a distance of only about 150 yards .
May 2 , 1903 - Distance unknown , but as usual the aircraft ended up stuck in a gorse hedge 15 ' off the ground !
May 11 , 1903 - This , my opinion , [ ie . the opinion of Bill Sherwood ] was man 's first real flight .
Pearse took off along the side of the Opihi River , turned left to fly over the 30 ' tall river bank , then turned right to fly parallel to the middle of the river .
After flying nearly 1,000 yards , his engine began to overheat and lost power , thus forcing a landing way down the dry-ish riverbed .
One of the locals , Arthur Tozer , was crossing the river at the time and was rather surprised to have Pearse fly right over his head !
Aerial view of the Opihi River and Pearse 's flight path Bill Sherwood 's article makes mention of and apologises for the poor quality of this image .
The red line has been added here for clarity
July 10 , 1903 - Again , distance unknown , but the aircraft was ( yet again ! ) stuck in a hedge many feet above the ground until the snow melted some time later .
While these dates are as certain as they can be , is clear that Pearse flew many other times , perhaps as early as 1901 .
( Though this whilst being towed by two horses ! )
It is also believed that he also continued to make many other flights in the privacy of his own property , which as you may have guessed had some very large gorse hedges around it .
His desire for privacy was no doubt a major restriction in his ability to find a clear area to fly for any great distance .
The engine that he made was extremely clever , I [ Bill Sherwood ] think it was a twin cylinder and piston device , but the pistons worked in both directions so that it was effectively a four cylinder piston engine .
Pearse 's Engine Download a larger version - 136 k [ 1000 x 1500 pixels ]
Fairly soon afterwards
Pearse lost interest in the fledgling aviation scene , as unfortunately all the credit was going to overseas flights .
It was too late to claim the credit he was due , so he went back to farming .
He made a brief return in the mid 1930's , when designed and partly built an aircraft that would have revolutionised air travel for the masses -
It had fold up wings and tail so it could be put into a conventional garage .
The engine could be run as either a 2 stroke or a 4 stroke , and also either supercharged or naturally aspirated .
Also , the entire engine / prop assembly pivoted so that the aircraft could do a vertical takeoff and landing .
It was never finished , for various reasons .

Wild and inaccurate statements have been publicised from time to time concerning Richard Pearse 's achievements in the field of aviation .
However .
no responsible researcher has ever claimed that he achieved fully controlled flight before the Wright brothers , or indeed at any time .
To attain fully controlled flight a pilot would have to be able to get his plane into the air , fly it on a chosen course and land it at a predetermined destination .
Obviously Pearse 's short " hops " or " flights " , whilst they established the fact that he could readily become airborne , did not come within this category , but neither , for that matter , did the first powered flights of the Wright brothers in December 1903 .
The Wiight brothers , however , had the resources necessary to continue their experimentation until they achieved fully controlled flight .

.
First of all , he was the first president to be sworn in by a nickname .
Second , his Inauguration Day parade included a Macy ’s Parade - like balloon of a peanut to celebrate his past .
And third , his wife , Rosalyn , was also the only First Lady ( in recent history , anyway ) to wear an old gown for the swearing - in ceremony .
Seeing no reason it should n’t be worn again , she wore a dress she had worn to a gubernatorial ceremony in Georgia .
The position of president could n’t just be vacant until Monday , so the President Pro Tempore of the Senate , David Rice Atchison , was brought in as a pinch hitter .
There ’s some debate as to whether this actually makes him the 12th president and Zachary Taylor the 13th , but obviously , it ’s generally accepted that he does n’t count .
He did n’t even stake claim to the title , and repeatedly told people that he slept through most of his day as president .
He must have had a good sense of humor about the whole thing , though , as evidenced by the inscription on his gravestone .

3. Calvin Coolidge had some interesting people swear him in as president .
The first time , after Warren G. Harding died in office , Coolidge was sworn in by his notary public dad .
They were at a farm in Vermont and had to conduct the whole thing by kerosene lamp .
The second time , he was sworn in by former president William Howard Taft , who was chief justice of the Supreme Court at the time .
4. Thomas Jefferson walked to and from his own inauguration .
5. Warren G. Harding was the first to arrive at his inauguration via car .
6 . When Andrew Johnson was inaugurated as vice president , he was totally trashed .
He was very ill from typhoid fever and drank whiskey to try to numb the aches and pains a little .
Except he overdid it and ended up slurring his way through his oaths .
Then he tried to swear in the new senators , but got too confused and had to let a Senate clerk complete his duties instead .
“ The inauguration went off very well except that the Vice President Elect was too drunk to perform his duties and disgraced himself and the Senate by making a drunken foolish speech , ” Senator Zachariah Chandler reported .
“ I was never so mortified in my life , had I been able to find a hole I would have dropped through it out of sight . ”
7 . More than three tons of Jelly Belly jelly beans were used in Ronald Reagan ’s inauguration in 1981 .
When he was governor of California , he developed a jelly bean habit because he was giving up smoking and the jelly beans helped distract him .
He became known for it , so red , white and blue jelly beans were used for his inauguration celebrations .
The blueberry Jelly Belly , in fact , was created just for this purpose .
8. Barack Obama may be using the same Bible to take his oath as Abraham Lincoln did , but Teddy Roosevelt still has one up on him : he actually wore one of Lincoln ’s rings .
John Hay , Roosevelt ’s secretary of state , was also Abraham Lincoln ’s private secretary ( he was only 22 at the time ) and was there when Lincoln was assassinated .
Hay was given the ring by Mary Todd Lincoln and let Roosevelt use it in his 1905 inauguration .
9 . The Adams presidents were apparently sore losers .
When their successors were inaugurated , both John Adams and John Quincy Adams made it a point to be otherwise occupied far out of town .
10 .
In his inaugural address , James Buchanan announced that he was n’t going to run for re-election .
He was true to his word , and maybe that ’s for the best : he ’s continually ranked as one of the worst presidents the U.S. has ever had .

As Democrats work to defund Vice President 's office , Republican asks ' Will Cheney get a Katrina trailer ? '
Michael Roston
Published : Thursday June 28 , 2007 Print This Email
This A group of Democrats made their case Thursday afternoon to cut all funding for the executive branch office of Vice President Dick Cheney on the floor of the House of Representatives .
The move prompted a Republican Congressman to ask whether Cheney would get a ' Katrina trailer ' in place of his official residence .
" I offer a simple amendment that bars the executive branch from being used to fund an office that does not exist in the executive branch , the Office of the Vice President , " said Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) , Chairman of the Democratic Caucus , who introduced the amendment .
" There have been 46 vice presidents in US history , and not one of them ... ever claimed [ that the vice president was not part of the executive branch ] . "
Pointing to a four - part series that ran in this week 's Washington Post on Cheney 's role in the presidency of George W. Bush , Emanuel assailed the vice president for having too much power .
" Rather than claiming that he was n't part of the executive branch ... it sounds like he is the executive branch , " the Illinois Democrat said .
" There is no Cheney branch of government ... He been held unaccountable for six years , and now he wants to be held unaccountable in the historical record . "
Emanuel 's amendment moved to cut all funding to the Vice President 's executive office , as well as the funds for his residence .
The latter half of the amendment prompted Rep. Ralph Regula ( R - OH ) , the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services which funds the White House , to ask where Cheney would live .
" Of course you 're going to abolish the residence , and I assume you 're going to get a Katrina trailer to provide for the vice president since we historically have provided housing , and you do n't offer any substitute for the existing residence , " Regula said .
" So I would think you would want to give that some thought . "
But he also offered a warning to the Democrats who were moving to cut the vice president 's funding .
" Where do we stop if we decide to use the power of the purse to pass judgment on the policies of people who serve in government ? " the Ohio Republican asked .
" You might have a Vice President , too , and once you set that precedent , I 'm not sure you 'd want that to be part of your legacy . "
Rep. Steve Israel ( D - NY ) rebutted the notion that there was a bad precedent being set by the Democratic members of the House .
" We may have a vice president some day , but that vice president will admit that he is part of the executive branch , " he said .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) also responded to Regula 's warning .
" The gentleman from Ohio said be careful what you wish for .
Well , here 's what I wish for - a vice president of the United States who will not show contempt for the norms of democracy , " the chairman of the Financial Services Committee said .
Rep. Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) , the Republican House Whip , accused the Democrats in the chamber of only seeking press coverage .
" This is an amendment in search of a press release , " he argued .
" We know what branch of government he belongs to , no matter how confusing that may seem , there are only three , we know which one he 's part of . "
Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) also argued that the bill created constitutional dangers .
" This is not a legitimate debate about whether or not the vice president is in one branch or another ... this is a raw grab for power to defund an essential constitutional office , and it is wrong , and if it even comes close to passing , if it is not on a bipartisan basis defeated , the gentleman from Illinois will in fact have undercut the very underpinnings of the constitution , " he argued .
Ultimately , Emanuel emphasized that his bill was not purely partisan in nature , and was needed for the purposes of promoting partisan accountability .
" I do n't come to this amendment lightly ... you had said 'we may have a vice president ' .... Vice President Cheney is all of our vice president , he 's not yours , " the Democratic Caucus chairman argued .
" For every step of the way , he has chosen secrecy over sunshine , obstruction over accountability . "
With limited members in the chamber , Rep. Emanuel 's amendment appeared to be defeated by a voice vote .
However , the bill is set to receive a recorded vote later in the day .
A Democratic leadership staff member told RAW STORY that a party - line vote in favor of the amendment was expected .

HANOI ( Reuters ) - Seven prominent Vietnamese and Americans will work together to support humanitarian efforts in cleaning up wartime dioxin , or “ agent orange ” in Vietnam , the U.S. - based Ford Foundation said on Wednesday .
Ten - year - old Pham Duc
Duy is cradled in the arms of his mother , Nguyen Thi Thanh Van , 35 , in their house in Hanoi June 16 , 2007 .
Vietnamese doctors believe Duy , whose grandfather served in the Vietnam war , is a victim of exposure to dioxin passed down through the generations .

The Foundation said the policy makers , scientists and business figures “ aim to build a collective , bipartisan humanitarian response where diplomatic discussion alone has proved difficult ” in resolving a bitter war legacy .
The announcement , the latest by Americans and Vietnamese on the sensitive issue , was made during the visit to the United States by President Nguyen Minh Triet .
He is the first head of state of communist - ruled Vietnam to be welcomed by Washington since the war ended in 1975 .
Toxins that Vietnam says affected millions of people over three generations are a thorn in otherwise friendly ties built up over 12 years since Washington and Hanoi established diplomatic relations .
The U.S. government maintains there is no scientific link between the toxins and the disabled .
“ The time is right for our two countries to come together to address this legacy and to mainstream discussion of this unresolved issue , ” group member Christine Todd Whitman , a former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency head , said in a statement .
The Ford Foundation said it was funding the U.S. - Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange / Dioxin .
The compound of dioxin is a component of “ agent orange ” toxic herbicides sprayed during the 1960s and 1970s war but it is one of the most toxic known .
Separately , the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi said in statement that U.S. defense officials had provided the Vietnam Ministry of Defense “ the most detailed maps ever published outlining where herbicides were loaded and stored from 1962 to 1971 ” .
It said that at a June 18 - 19 conference , Vietnamese officials presented details of sampling and remediation work at former U.S. bases of Danang in central Vietnam and Bien Hoa in southern Vietnam .
COMBINED EXPERTISE
“ Dioxin has had a profound impact on Vietnamese society , ” said a Vietnamese group member , prominent diplomat Madame Ton Nu Thi Ninh , who is Vice Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly .
“ We need to combine our expertise to reduce the harm and provide services . ”

Triet told Reuters before leaving Hanoi that he would discuss the health and environmental impacts of dioxin with U.S. President George W. Bush when they meet on June 22 .
A Foundation spokeswoman said that in February the group of seven visited the Danang airport , one of three “ hot spots ” identified by scientists as having dioxin levels hundreds of times higher than would be accepted elsewhere .
The others are Phu Cat in south - central Binh Dinh province and Bien Hoa in southern Dong Nai province .
On Tuesday in New York , Triet met Ford Foundation president Susan Berresford , convener of the group .
Its tasks include supporting clean up at former U.S. bases and health programs in surrounding communities ; treatment and education centers for victims ; development of a Vietnamese laboratory for dioxin testing ; training courses for restoration of land affected with herbicides and advocacy efforts .
Four teenage boys were arrested for allegedly driving around Los Angeles and attacking homeless people while using a cellphone camera to capture some of the assaults , LAPD officials said Monday .
The youths allegedly attacked at least eight homeless people either by throwing smoke bombs or firing plastic pellets from an air pistol at them and in one case throwing a bike into a homeless person ’s tent as he slept .
Police said the suspects filmed some of the attacks with a cellphone camera , and the attackers intended to post the recordings on the Internet .
“ That ’s not going to happen now , ” said LAPD Lt. Paul Vernon .

One of the smoke bombs caused a homeless man ’s blanket to catch fire early Sunday , leading to the arrest of three of the four teenage suspects shortly afterward .
A fourth boy was taken into custody Monday while at summer school .
All four teenagers have been booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and could face arson charges , Vernon said .
The incidents sparked outrage on skid row and beyond , with some advocates saying it was just the latest of several high - profile attacks on homeless people .
“ There is a vulnerability to being out on the street .
It ’s just a terrible situation , ” said Rebecca Isaacs , executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority .

The youths , ages 15 to 17 , are all from Los Angeles and have no prior criminal records , Vernon said .
Cellphones with recordings of previous assaults have been confiscated and the teenagers ’ parents have been cooperating with authorities , police said .
Detectives believe that other homeless people were attacked and are asking the public to provide information about other possible incidents , Vernon said .
The attacks occurred between July 3 and July 15 , although police said the dates , which were taken from the cellphones , could be wrong .
The first attack happened July 3 near Melrose Avenue and Vine Street in Hollywood , where , police said , the youths used an air pistol to shoot a man whose head was covered with a blanket .

Then on July 4 in Hollywood , police said , the teenage boys threw a homeless man ’s bicycle into his tent .
Evidence linking the foursome to four smoke bomb attacks against homeless men in the early hours of July 15 in downtown L.A. has been collected , police said .
The victims include a sleeping homeless man on San Pedro Street near Washington Boulevard ; a group of several homeless men at Olympic Boulevard and Santee Street ; a homeless man on Olympic , east of Broadway ; and a homeless man whose blanket caught on fire after a smoke bomb was thrown at him in the 1000 block of South Broadway .
Two years ago , the Los Angeles Police Department arrested two 19 - year - old men for driving around downtown L.A. in the early hours of Aug. 16 and hitting homeless people with baseball bats .

One of the victims , Ernest Adams , 57 , was in a coma for three weeks and sustained permanent scars and vision loss in one eye .
Justin Edward Brumfield of Inglewood was convicted of assault and is serving an 11 - year prison sentence .
His accomplice , William Alexander Orantes , received a three - year prison sentence after pleading no contest to assault charges .
Andy Bales , chief executive of the Union Rescue Mission in downtown L.A. , said the attacks were part of a “ long , long unfortunate tradition . ”
“ Homeless people have enough ugliness in society to face with the normal everyday , let alone with having kids beat up on them , ” Bales said .

A 2006 study by the National Coalition for the Homeless recorded 142 attacks last year against homeless people , 20 of which resulted in death -- a 65 % increase from 2005 , when 86 homeless people were violently assaulted , including 13 homicides , the advocacy group said .

Computers can usually out - compute the human brain , but there are some tasks , such as visual object recognition , that the brain performs easily yet are very challenging for computers .
The brain has a much more sophisticated and swift visual processing system than even the most advanced artificial vision system , giving us an uncanny ability to extract salient information after just a glimpse that is presumably too fleeting for conscious thought .
To explore this phenomenon , neuroscientists have long used rapid categorization tasks , in which subjects indicate whether an object from a specific class ( such as an animal ) is present or not in the image .
Now , in a new MIT study , a computer model designed to mimic the way the brain itself processes visual information performs as well as humans do on rapid categorization tasks .
The model even tends to make similar errors as humans , possibly because it so closely follows the organization of the brain 's visual system .
" We created a model that takes into account a host of quantitative anatomical and physiological data about visual cortex and tries to simulate what happens in the first 100 milliseconds or so after we see an object , " explained senior author Tomaso Poggio of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT .
" This is the first time a model has been able to reproduce human behavior on that kind of task . "
The study , issued on line in advance of the April 10 , 2007 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , stems from a collaboration between computational neuroscientists in Poggio 's lab and Aude Oliva , a cognitive neuroscientist in the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences .
This new study supports a long -- held hypothesis that rapid categorization happens without any feedback from cognitive or other areas of the brain .
The results also indicate that the model can help neuroscientists make predictions and drive new experiments to explore brain mechanisms involved in human visual perception , cognition , and behavior .
Deciphering the relative contribution of feed - forward and feedback processing may eventually help explain neuropsychological disorders such as autism and schizophrenia .
The model also bridges the gap between the world of artificial intelligence ( AI ) and neuroscience because it may lead to better artificial vision systems and augmented sensory prostheses .
Rapid Categorization
During normal everyday vision , the eye moves around a scene , giving the brain time to focus attention on relevant cues , such as a snake curled in the path .
Evolutionarily speaking , however , survival often depends on extracting vital information in one glance , so that we jump out of danger 's way before we even realize what we 've seen .
advertisement
Cognitive neuroscientists have studied this phenomenon using a rapid categorization task during which subjects are asked to say whether a specific object ( such as an animal ) is present or not .
In this task , subjects see an image flashed on a screen that is quickly replaced with an erasing mask ( pink noise ) , which is presumed to shut down cognitive feedback .
After just a 50 milliseconds glimpse of an image , less than the time it takes to flash two video frames , people can still accurately report an object 's category , even though they are barely aware of what they have seen .
In parallel , computational neuroscientists have traced the flow of information from the retina through increasingly complex visual areas ( V1 , V2 , V4 ) to the highest purely visual region , the inferotemporal cortex ( IT ) , and on to higher areas such as prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) where object categorization is represented .
The Poggio lab replicated the hypothetical computations the brain performs as information speeds forward through the visual pathway .
They recently demonstrated that this biologically inspired model , which matches a number of different physiological data , can also learn to recognize objects from real - world examples and identify relevant objects in complex scenes .
That and other studies from the lab demonstrated that the information processing that occurs during one feed - forward pass through the visual cortex is sufficient for robust object recognition .
The model is thus an appropriate vehicle for testing the behavioral study 's no-feedback - necessary theory , while the animal / no animal behavioral test makes a good reality check for the model .
Glimpsing an Animal -- or Not
To proceed , Serre " trained " the model on only a few hundred animal and non-animal images , a paltry number compared to human visual experience .
" This is a very hard task for any artificial vision system , " Serre explained .
" Animals are extremely varied in shape and size .
Snakes , butterflies , and elephants have little in common , and the animals in the image may be lying , standing , flying , or leaping . "

The team organized images in different subcategories from full views of an animal head to far views , using single as well as groups of animals .
As preliminary model simulations predicted , the task became harder as the relative size of the animal decreased and the amount of clutter ( the background scene ) increased .
Importantly , the results showed no significant difference between humans and the model .
Both had a similar pattern of performance , with well above 90 % accuracy for the close views dropping to 74 % for distant views .
The 16 % drop in performance for distant views represents a limitation of the one feed - forward sweep in dealing with clutter , Serre suggested .
With more time for cognitive feedback , people would outperform the model because they could focus attention on the target and ignore the clutter .
" We have not solved vision yet , " Poggio cautioned , " but this model of immediate recognition may provide the skeleton of a theory of vision .
The huge task in front of us is to incorporate into the model the effects of attention and top - down beliefs . "
The team is now exploring what happens after the first feed - forward sweep , during the next 200-300 milliseconds of object recognition .
The Poggio lab plans to include feedback loops in the model by modeling the widespread anatomical backprojections in cortex , while Oliva is designing behavioral studies that can test if the enhanced model matches the performance of humans who have more time to examine a scene .
For cognitive neuroscientists , these results add to the convergence of evidence about the feed - forward hypothesis for rapid categorization .
" There could be other mechanisms involved , but this a big step forward in understanding how humans see , " said Oliva .
" For me , it 's putting light in the black box and gives direction to design new experiments , for instance to explore perception in clutter . "

The union representing East Coast dockworkers has been hemorrhaging assets and members in the past two years , according to a new financial report .
Yet the union ’s president was paid twice as much as several labor leaders who head unions more than 30 times larger .
The union , the International Longshoremen ’s Association , paid its president , John Bowers , $ 587,078 last year , according to the annual report that the union submitted to the federal government late last month .
That made him one of the nation ’s highest - paid union officials .
Mr. Bowers ’s son John Jr. , a union vice president , was paid $ 292,440 last year , the report said .
The report is another indication of trouble for the union , which the federal government has sued in a civil racketeering lawsuit that is seeking to have a trustee take control of the union because of its longtime ties to organized crime .
Membership in the union , which represents dockworkers from Maine to Texas , dropped to 43,500 in 2006 , from 59,000 two years earlier , according to the report .
That 26 percent drop occurred even though the nation ’s ports , including huge ones in Newark and Elizabeth , N.J. , were handling record volumes .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
After setting record highs less than a month ago , gasoline prices are on the way down .
Experts say motorists can expect gradually declining prices from now until July 4 .
After the Fourth , and barring any unforeseen event like war with Iran , the cost of gas will largely depend on how the hurricane season shapes up .
Nationwide average retail prices have fallen from a record high of $ 3.23 a gallon at the end of May to about $ 3.07 as of Tuesday , a drop of roughly 5 percent , according to the motorist organization AAA .
The government reported a similar decline in its latest weekly survey .
Prices for gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange have fallen much further .
The front - month contract on NYMEX has slid nearly 45 percent since hitting a high of $ 2.44 a gallon in late April .
" I certainly think prices for the summer have peaked , " said Stephen Schork , principal of the industry newsletter the Schork Report and a former NYMEX trader .
" I can see [ retail prices ] getting back down to between $ 2.50 and $ 2.75 . "
Retail prices kicked off the year averaging just over $ 2 a gallon , pushed lower all fall by a 2006 hurricane season that never materialized and an early winter drop in crude prices sparked by concerns over economic growth .
But while crude prices gained about 30 percent since the start of the year , gasoline prices surged over 50 percent as one refinery after another shuttered production and gasoline supplies ran low heading into the summer driving season .
Refinery production is still well below normal , as are gasoline inventories .
But inventories have grown for the last several weeks , helped mostly by higher imports , but also due to an easing of demand .
Throughout the winter gasoline demand was growing by a higher - than - usual 2.5 percent .
It 's now down to it 's normal 1.5 percent , and could slacken still .
" There was a large enough section of the population that curtailed their habits just a little , " said Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service .
" I think you 're going to see some very soft demand numbers in the next few weeks . "
Kloza sees retail gas prices falling to maybe $ 2.80 a gallon sometime between now and July 4 , but said " there will be some storm hype , and that will give gas prices some staying power . "
Just before July 4 there may be a bump up in prices , as Americans hit the road in what will most likely be record numbers , driving demand for gas higher .
After that , it all depends on hurricane season , which officially began June 1 but does n't usually produce the big , powerful storms until August or September , when the ocean water is at its warmest .
Hurricane experts are predicting an active season , but oil analysts say the chances of another massive storm making a direct hit on refinery country , like Katrina did , are slim .
" The odds of that happening , it would just have to be the most perfect of perfect storms , " said Schork .
If it does happen , Schork said to expect a retail price jump of at least 18 percent , which was the one - week price spike following Katrina .
If gas was $ 2.80 a gallon , that would push prices to $ 3.30 a gallon , a new record .
Barring such a storm , analysts see prices declining further in late September and falling for the rest of autumn , possibly reaching the low $ 2 range they hit at the end of last year .
But until hurricane season is safely behind us , traders will remain jumpy .
As Mike Fitzpatrick , an analyst at the energy desk of Man Financial put it : " Nobody expects we 'll go through the season completely unscathed like last year . "

Imagine my shock .
Via : Taiwan Headlines :
The government is now discussing the possibility of large - scale ocean current power generation , using the strong Kuroshio current off the east coast of Taiwan to generate up to 1.68 trillion kilowatt - hours per year , officials at cabinet - level Council for Economic Planning and Development ( CEPD ) said Monday .
The project task force , led by Chen Fa-lin — director of Energy and Environment Research Laboratory under Hsinchu - based Industrial Technology Research Institute , is currently working on fine - tuning the guidelines , which will be presented to CEPD senior officials in August or September .
After the project is green - lighted , the possible first step should be setting up a five - megawatt marine turbine off Taiwan ’s east coast on a trial basis , with the goal of testing both related technologies and power - generating efficiency , CEPD officials , adding that hopefully , the project can enter the next stage in three years .
“ Current power generation is not a new idea , ” officials noted .
“ Countries like Britain , Canada , Norway , and Australia all have experience in deploying offshore marine turbines with capacities ranging from one megawatt to eight megawatts to support the electricity demand of hundreds to thousands of households . ”
“ The problem is not the technology itself but how to locate a suitable site — with a current strong enough , an undersea shelf not too deep , and a distance short enough to achieve power supply efficiency , ” they added .
However , they explained that based on the surveys done by National Taiwan University ( NTU ) , the sea area of some 6,000 square kilometers between the eastern county of Taitung and the outlying Green Island in the Pacific Ocean appears to meet all the requirements , and that the maximum potential capacity there exceeds 1.68 trillion kilowatt - hours per year — while Taiwan ’s current annual demand of electricity is only about 98 billion kilowatt - hours .
According to the estimates of the project task force , a given site of 25 square kilometers located in the “ shallow , high - speed zone ” could support the deployment of 1,000 one - megawatt marine turbines , which would have a peak capacity of 1,000 megawatts : equal to the output of Taiwan ’s second nuclear power plant .
Chen , the project leader , noted that once the turbines enter commercial operation , Taiwan ’s existing coal power plants could be retired , while the nuclear power generators could be used as a backup system — thereby resulting in a great reduction in Taiwan ’s total carbon dioxide emissions .

Yesterday ’s top tech policy story was the copyright lawsuits filed by Viacom , the parent company of Comedy Central , MTV , and Paramount Pictures , against YouTube and its owner Google .
Viacom ’s complaint accuses YouTube of direct , contributory , and vicarious copyright infringement , and inducing infringement .
The complaint tries to paint YouTube as a descendant of Napster and Grokster .
Viacom argues generally that YouTube should have done more to help it detect and stop infringement .
Interestingly , Viacom points to the privacy features of YouTube as part of the problem , in paragraph 43 of the complaint :
In addition , YouTube is deliberately interfering with copyright owners ’ ability to find infringing videos even after they are added to YouTube ’s library .
YouTube offers a feature that allows users to designate “ friends ” who are the only persons allowed to see videos they upload , preventing copyright owners from finding infringing videos with this limitation … .
Thus , Plaintiffs cannot necessarily find all infringing videos to protect their rights through searching , even though that is the only avenue YouTube makes available to copyright owners .
Moreover , YouTube still makes the hidden infringing videos available for viewing through YouTube features like the embed , share , and friends functions .
For example , many users are sharing full - length copies of copyrighted works and stating plainly in the description “ Add me as a friend to watch . ”
Users have many good reasons to want to limit access to noninfringing uploaded videos , for example to make home movies available to family members but not to the general public .
It would be a shame , and YouTube would be much less useful , if there were no way to limit access .
Equivalently , if any copyright owner could override the limits , there would be no privacy anymore – remember that we ’re all copyright owners .
Is Viacom really arguing that YouTube should n’t let people limit access to uploaded material ?
Viacom does n’t say this directly , though it is one plausible reading of their argument .
Another reading is that they think YouTube should have an extra obligation to police and / or filter material that is n’t viewable by the public .
Either way , it ’s troubling to see YouTube ’s privacy features used to attack the site ’s legality , when we know those features have plenty of uses other than hiding infringement .
Will future entrepreneurs shy away from providing private communication , out of fear that it will be used to brand them as infringers ?
If the courts are n’t careful , that will be one effect of Viacom ’s suit .
Obsessive - Compulsive personality disorder is similar to obsessive - compulsive anxiety disorder .
People with this disorder are overly focused on orderliness and perfection .
Their need to do everything " right " often interferes with their productivity .
They tend to get caught up in the details and miss the bigger picture .
They set unreasonably high standards for themselves and others , and tend to be very critical of others when they do not live up to these high standards .
They avoid working in teams , believing others to be too careless or incompetent .
They avoid making decisions because they fear making mistakes and are rarely generous with their time or money .
They often have difficulty expressing emotion .

This is the second installment of our weekly column entitled Ask a Shiite .
Our resident Shiite will be fielding questions of a philosophical , physical , and political nature in regards to Shiite Islamic belief and Middle East perception .
Interested in asking a question ?
Send an email to alec .
Question :
What are the philosophical and moral differences of Sunni and Shiites ?
In your experience , how do the two groups regard and perceive each other ?
Is there really as much hostility between the two groups as we are led to believe in the American media ?
Answer : The Shias and Sunnis are the two major sects in the religion of Islam .
At the time of the Prophet ’s ( AS ) death , there was a conflict upon who would succeed the Prophet .
This conflict was not a typical one which comes to a person ’s mind .
The Shias believe that Imam Ali ( AS ) was the rightful successor to the Prophet .
Imam Ali was the Prophet ’s son in law as he had only one daughter and the three others were adopted .
Imam Ali was also the Prophet ’s cousin .
He was the first person to accept Islam when the it was revealed to the Prophet .
He was only 10 years old when he accepted Islam .
The Sunnis believe that the first rightful successor was Abu Bakr , a friend of the Prophet .
The first four of their caliphs ( leaders ) were called the Rightly Guided Caliphs .
The second caliph was Umar ibn Khattab , third Usman ibn Affan and the last one Imam Ali .
What happened was that when the Prophet passed away , there was a meeting in a hut at a place called Sakifa .
Only the Prophet ’s so called companions were present .
The fought amongst themselves and couldnt decide on a caliph .
This meeting was a few hours after the Prophet ’s death without the opinion of any of the other Muslims .
Their intention is of course not known for sure but it is suggested from the behavior that the people were power hungry .
Umar stood up and supported Abu Bakr and forced everyone else to do the same .
This is all accepted as authentic by both Shias and Sunni .
The declared this to the all the Muslims .
Everyone accepted except the partisans ( Shias ) of Ali .
History shows that this small group of people were very loyal people .
Imam Ali was a person who was very close to the Prophet , a person on whom the Prophet relied on and trusted .
This is also accepted by both Shias and Sunnis .
When the Abu Bakr and his followers found out about Imam Ali and his stance , they dragged him across the streets with a rope
around his neck , burnt his house causing a door to fall on the Prophet ’s daughter leading to her miscarriage .
Imam Ali did not accept the new rule and his followers continued following him silently .
He remained silent for the sake of Muslim unity .
Silently he used to help the the first three caliphs from making critical mistakes .
Umar himself has said that if Ali had not been there I would have perished .
This is all accepted by both Shias and Sunnis .
Imam Ali ’s stance gives us a very high end example of patience .
The Shias believe that Imam Ali was the first of 12 Imams .
An Imam in this sense means someone who is better than everyone else in everything .
They are someone who are living examples of a perfect human being .
Later on when Umar was dead the people came to Imam Ali and asked if he would accept the leadership but on four conditions .
The first condition was that Imam Ali would give his rulings according to the Qur’an .
Imam Ali accepted , then the next one was that his rulings would be according to the Prophet ’s Sunnah .
Sunnah is what the Prophet said , did and accepted .
Basically it is what the Prophet approved of from his actions and sayings .
The Sunnah is recorded from different narrators .
Imam Ali accepted this as well .
The third condition was that Imam Ali ’s rulings comply with Abu Bakr and Umar ’s rulings .
Imam Ali asked them if the two went against the Quan and Sunnah and if they did then why should he accept the condition and if they did not then the two had wrong leadership .
The people went silent on this and went and made Usman the third caliph .
After Usman the people were sick of the caliphs rule as it had messed up the society and they wanted Imam Ali to take up leadership .
He accepted with a lot of reluctance and set about putting the society right .
Basically Shias believe that the successor to the Prophet has to be divinely appointed whereas the Sunnis do not and they take Abu Bakr as the first caliph .
One of the caliphs even said that he would go astray and the Muslim population should put hi right if he does so .
From this ‘ split ’ many other differences arise amongst the Muslims .
Some narrators were accepted in bringing forward the Prophet ’s Sunnah .
All the differences between Muslims comes form this main split .
But even then the Muslims , at least the Shias , have to consider the others as their Muslims brothers and have to stay united .
Creating differences between the two is not allowed for the Shias .
Quite a few other factors also led to the difference there is amongst us .
But even then it is not such that we consider each other as from a totally different faith .
The most important things are accepted unanimously in both the sects .
For example our declaration of faith is the same in both :
There is no deity ( worthy of worship ) except for Allah Muhammad is His Messenger
Most of our differences are quite ignorable .
The Shi’ite perception towards the Sunnis is quite tolerant .
We consider them as fellow Muslims , we treat them like any other person and leave our differences for Allah to judge .
We generally ignore the differences .
The Sunni perception towards us quite mixed .
Most of the average Sunnis accept us like we accept them .
But some extremist groups or some people to whom our ( Shia ) message has not reached treat us as non-Muslims and even think that killing us will send them to heaven .
Normally these people hate us and think that we should be oppressed and if we rise , we will overwhelm and oppress them back .
But this perception of theirs is quite wrong .
I am a Shia and I know my religious leaders well .
We want all Muslims to be united and we would never oppress them .
We have been oppressed since the death of the Prophet and that kind of oppression more or less continues till this day .
at one point of time the oppression was such that the Shias were almost ‘ extinct ’ .
Muslims leaders have been more or less oppressive people in history .
We Shias almost never had power .
It is recently that Iran was made , Iraqi being liberated but on the other hand possibly occupied and our message is getting to other parts of the Muslims world .
The media in most cases over exaggerates the differences and sense of enmity .
They do not , as I have said earlier , show how the Muslims are uniting .
There are so many unity meetings where world leaders take part but none of that is shown .
All that is shown is how the Muslims are fighting amongst themselves and hence an image is created that the Shias and Sunnis are at each others ’ throats all the time .
As said before terrorists create the problems in the world for Muslims because they rise form within Muslims and say that they are doing it for Islam , so everyone thinks that they represent Islam and the Muslims even though they do not .
To summarize it all , Shias believe in a divinely appointed leader because divine matters can not be meddled with by fallible people , Sunnis believe that Abu Bakr was the closest ‘ friend ’ of the Prophet and try to justify the reign of the caliphs , our differences were quite hostile earlier on but we are moving towards unity at a snails pace and the terrorists mess things up for Muslims and they do not represent Islam and finally the western media exaggerates our hostility and plays down our unity .

White House blocks Congress from meeting with former aides in Attorneys investigation Michael Roston
Published : Monday July 9 , 2007 Print This Email This White House Counsel Fred Fielding sent a letter to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees stating that President George W. Bush will refuse to comply with subpoenas for testimony from former White House aides .
The move was criticized by the Congressional committees that continue to press their investigations of the firing of 8 US Attorneys .
Monday morning was the deadline for the White House to explain its refusal to comply with an earlier set of subpoenas for document related to the fired US Attorneys .
Fielding also took the opportunity to note that Sara Taylor , a former top aide to Karl Rove , and Harriet Miers , who formerly held Fielding 's job , were covered under the president 's invocation of executive privilege . " [ A ] s we remain at the present impasse , the President feels compelled to assert Executive Privilege with respect to the testimony sought from Sara M. Taylor and Harriet E. Miers covering White House consideration , deliberations , or communications , whether internal or external , relating to the possible dismissal or appointment of United States Attorneys , " Fielding wrote to the committees ' chairmen , Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) and Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) .
Miers and Taylor were scheduled to testify on Wednesday and Thursday respectively .
Rep. Conyers strongly criticized the move .
" While we remain willing to negotiate with the White House , they adhere to their unacceotable all - or - nothing position , and now will not even seek to properly justify their privilege claims , " he wrote in a statement released to RAW STORY .
" Contrary [ to ] what the White House may believe , it is the Congress and the Courts that will decide whether an invocation of Executive Privilege is valid , not the White House unilaterally . "
Senator Leahy also asked , " What is the White House trying to hide by refusing to turn over evidence it was willing to provide months ago as long as that information was shared in secret with no opportunity for Congress to pursue the matter further ? "
He added , " The White Houses refusal to properly justify its basis for this executive privilege claim raises questions about the validity of its assertion . "
In the letter , Bush 's attorney criticized the Congress members for the " tone and apparent direction in dealing with a situation of this gravity " as found in their earlier letter to the White House of June 29 .
" [ I ] t is incorrect to say that the President 's assertion of Executive Privilege was performed without good faith , " he argued .
He also rejected Conyers and Leahy 's call for a log documenting why the White House refused to turn over the documents in question .
" We are aware of no authority by which a congressional committee may ' direct ' the Executive to undertake the task of creating and providing an extensive description of every document covered by an assertion of Executive Privilege , " he wrote .
Fielding also repeated the White House 's offer for off the record interviews with White House officials .
The offer has been roundly rejected by Conyers and Leahy .
Notably absent from both Conyers and Leahy 's response was any mention of enforcing the subpoenas , perhaps with criminal contempt citations issued to the White House .
Instead , Leahy appeared to be seeking more negotiation .
" I hope the White House stops this stonewalling and accepts my offer to negotiate a workable solution to the Committees oversight requests , as so many previous White Houses have done throughout history , " he said in his statement .
Fielding 's letter can be accessed at the White House website .

It has a name that many people can't utter without a smirk , yet half a billion of them are sold each year .
The stuff of urban legend , pop-culture satire and even then - U.S. president Bill Clinton 's Millennium Time Capsule , Twinkie is about as iconic as an American food can get .
Since its birth during the Depression , the gold - coloured cakelet has morphed from scrumptious symbol of American ingenuity to epitome of additive - laden junk .
Rumour has it that the gold - coloured snack can last forever ( in truth , the shelf life is about 25 days ) .
The belief that a Twinkie can survive a nuclear holocaust inspired an episode of the animated series The Family Guy , while an instalment last year of the comic strip Doonesbury joked that a year 's supply of Twinkies are baked every February .
When New York City writer Steve Ettlinger set out several years ago to write a book about artificial ingredients in processed foods , Twinkie emerged as the perfect specimen .
" It 's the quintessential processed food , " says Ettlinger , author of Twinkie , Deconstructed ( Hudson Street / Penguin ) .
" And the ingredients in a Twinkie are found , I realized pretty early on , in most processed foods ; they 're in canned goods , they 're in salad dressings , they 're in ice cream , cookies . "
Ettlinger , a member of the International Association of Culinary Professionals , got the idea for his book while at the beach in Connecticut with his son and daughter .
The kids were eating ice cream bars , and dad , as was his wont , began reading the list of ingredients .
Soon the children wanted to know what polysorbate 60 was and where it came from .
Dad was stumped .
That substance – an " emulsifier " that basically does the work of cream and eggs at much lower cost , and is created through a complicated chemical process involving corn syrup , palm oil and petroleum – has its own section in Twinkie , Deconstructed .
In fact , each of the 26 chapters in Ettlinger 's book is devoted to a Twinkie component .
The cake 's main ingredient is wheat flour , while its least prevalent are the dyes " yellow no . 5 " and " red no . 40 . "
In between are substances including water , corn sweeteners and syrup , cellulose gum and sodium stearoyl lactylate .
In the course of five years of research , Ettlinger sometimes had to remind himself that he was writing about something you eat and not , say , the mineral , petrochemical or wood pulp industries .
" Some of the ingredients listed on the Twinkie ingredient label are recognizable foods , sugar and flour , and so forth , " he says .
" And the corn and soybean products , while highly processed , nonetheless obviously start with corn and soybeans .
" But the more chemical - sounding names , or the names of things that are unfamiliar , I thought at one point would be sourced from raw materials like seeds or berries or weeds or bark or something .
Somewhere I figured there'd be a factory with a recognizable food coming in the back door and the more odd - sounding thing coming out the front . "
Instead , he found himself interviewing scientists about complicated , sometimes dangerous , chemical reactions – or visiting mines .
" Almost any bread or cake you eat is made from at least five different kinds of rock , " says Ettlinger .
" The raw material for baking powder and a few other things are rocks . "
So the author went 500 metres beneath the ground in Green River , Wyo. , to observe the mining of trona , a rock containing sodium sesquicarbonate , from which baking soda is derived .
Ettlinger discovered that a whole lot of Twinkie ingredients – as with many other processed foods – are derived from petroleum and petroleum products .
That includes the food colouring that gives Twinkies their warm , golden - yellow glow .
" The colours are made in great part from petroleum products in China , " says Ettlinger .
" Their final mix is usually in the country that 's using the colour .
In this case , I travelled to St. Louis , where I saw the grey powders mixed together and then turning bright red or yellow . "
Some of the B vitamins that enrich most flour are also derived at least partly from petroleum , such as niacin or B3 ( the ingredients are water , air and petroleum ) , and thiamine mononitrate or B1 ( from coal tar ) .
" It 's pure chemistry , " says Ettlinger .
" I really thought if anything was going to be extracted from a plant , somehow it would be vitamins , and they 're not .
And then the minerals – the lone mineral , ferrous sulphate , definitely is not .
Ferrous sulphate , which you can buy as an iron supplement in your pharmacy , is made from running steel at a steel mill through a big bath of sulphuric acid . "
It does n't exactly get the salivary glands working overtime .
Neither do Ettlinger 's descriptions of the toxic substances that are raw materials for some processed - food ingredients .
Flammable and carcinogenic benzene , for example , plays a major role in the extremely complicated set of chemical reactions that yield the artificial flavouring vanillin .
And the chlorine used to bleach the flour in Twinkies – and the cakes many of us bake at home – is extremely toxic .

" It 's hard to wrap your mind around that , " he concedes , " unless you remind yourself that you have two very reactive and toxic chemicals sitting on your kitchen table .
Before you get alarmed , let me tell you that it 's salt .
So we have to remind ourselves that a lot of common foods at first blush seem like they might be made of dangerous chemicals , but the chemicals react together to make harmless and even benign chemicals that we eat . "
His descriptions of alternate uses for the ingredients he explores can be eye - opening .
Take cane sugar , which – together with corn-derived products – accounts for the 4 3/4 teaspoons of sweeteners in each Twinkie .
As Ettlinger points out in Twinkie , Deconstructed , cane sugar and its derivatives are added to polyurethane foam to work as a flame retardant , and are used to make water - based ink , cure tobacco , and help clean out cement mixers .
Sweet .
Several Twinkie ingredients are manufactured in China and India .
Despite the recall by Mississauga 's Menu Foods and other companies of pet food containing gluten from China tainted with melamine , Ettlinger is confident that the global trade in food additives is safe .
Still , he has mixed feelings .
" My suspicion is that the food for human consumption is produced under more rigorous conditions and controls than food for pets , " he says .
" I was very reassured by the high level of professionalism among the people I met , the places I went .
" But , yes , it makes you pause for a moment to consider that all these products , which are super - concentrated and used in small , small amounts , are also spread across , because of that , many millions of servings of products .
Should there be a problem with a raw ingredient coming from , say , a foreign country , it would be spread around every part of the continent in no time . "
Although he describes himself in Twinkie , Deconstructed as a foodie who delighted in the regional foods of France while living there for six years , and who likes to gather mussels when he visits coastal Maine every summer , Ettlinger , 58 , strikes a non-judgmental tone in his book and his interview with the Star .
Does he eat Twinkies ?
Almost never , he says .
" I snack more on whole foods , and I 'm probably more conscious of that now .
Nuts , fruits .
" I 'll leave the preaching to others about how you should eat local or organic foods , " he continues .
" But if people ask me , ` Is the Twinkie bad for you ? ' which is a way of saying , ` Is it good for you ? ' – if you want something that is good for you , eat fruits and vegetables and do n't worry about the rest . "
Nor is Ettlinger keen to pounce on Twinkie – and , specifically , the high - fructose corn syrup it contains – as a guilty party in North America 's obesity epidemic .
" When I researched ( high - fructose corn syrup ) , I was prepared to find all kinds of nasty things about it because the molecules are changed in such a way that they might be hard to digest , " he says .
" In fact , I could not find any damning scientific studies . "
Ettlinger maintains the jury is still out , but he cites portion size as a more likely culprit .
" When I was growing up , Coke and Pepsi ( both of which contain high - fructose corn syrup ) were served as treats in six - ounce cups or eight - ounce bottles .
And now people are drinking Coke and Pepsi routinely as a beverage at meals , quite often buying 22 - ounce bottles . "
But , did n't Ettlinger experience any distaste or horror while deconstructing the Twinkie ?
" I experienced more amazement , " he replies .
" It continues to stun me the extent to which we go to make artificial ingredients and the extent to which those ingredients are bound up in the major industries of the world .
" For example , 14 of the most common chemicals we use are found in Twinkies .
I mention the Twinkie - Industrial Complex .
It 's tied in with major industries that are also often tied with government policy .
This is n't mere food , " he says .
" This is industry . "
SPEECHES SHOW DEEP DIVIDE SPEECHES SHOW DEEP DIVIDE Excerpts of floor speeches given Tuesday in the Senate on Iraq : " ... the terrorists are in this war to win it .
The question is : Are we ?
Withdrawing before there is a stable and legitimate Iraqi authority would turn Iraq into a failed state and a terrorist sanctuary , in the heart of the Middle East .
We have seen a failed state emerge after U.S. disengagement once before , and it cost us terribly .
In pre-9/11 Afghanistan , terrorists found sanctuary to train and plan attacks with impunity .
We know that today there are terrorists in Iraq who are planning attacks against Americans .
We can not make this fatal mistake twice . " — Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz .
" The question is : Do we continue to send our kids in the middle of a meat grinder , based on a policy that is fundamentally flawed ?
...
If we do n't start bringing home combat forces within the next few months , get them out of the midst of a civil war , we will have so soured the American people on the ability to do even the things that need be done that this president and the next president will be left with absolutely no option -- absolutely no option -- but to withdraw totally from that area and let the chips fall where they may . "
— Sen. Joseph Biden , D - Del. " ... the enemy is on the run , but here in Congress , in Washington , some members seem to be on the run -- chased , I fear , by public opinion polls .
... I will say to my colleagues today that this war in Iraq will never be lost by our military on the ground in Iraq .
The war in Iraq can only be lost with a loss of political will here at home , and perhaps with a loss of political will in Iraq . " — Sen. Joe Lieberman , I - Conn .
BUSH : WAIT FOR PETRAEUS BUSH : WAIT FOR PETRAEUS President Bush on Tuesday ruled out an imminent withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq as he urged critics , including fellow Republicans , to wait at least two months before judging his war policy .
Bush urged patience until Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , can " tell us whether his strategy is working . "
Petraeus will report to Bush and Congress in September .
Bush 's remarks to a civic group in Cleveland came as the Senate continued debate on Iraq policy .
Ohio Sen. George Voinovich is among a handful of Republicans to recently call for a change of course in Iraq .
" Congress ought to wait for Gen .
Petraeus to come back and give his assessment before they make any decisions , " Bush said .
The president again warned of the consequences of failure in Iraq and noted the potency of insurgents : " They thrive on chaos .
It enables them to more likely achieve their objectives . "
Another report on whether the Iraqi government is meeting political , military and economic targets is due Sunday .
" You 're going to find some of the benchmarks have been met and some have not , " White House spokesman Tony Snow said .
Petraeus ' report will deal with Bush 's plan that has increased U.S. troop levels in Iraq by about 28,000 .
Bush told the Greater Cleveland Partnership that the process of inserting extra troops was only recently finished .
" They 're now beginning operations in full , " he said .
" In Washington , you got people saying , ' Stop . ' " Digg

Facebook WASHINGTON 
Four months ago , Sen. Susan Collins , R - Maine , was one of 50 senators who voted against a resolution calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by next March .
On Tuesday , she said she 'll vote to recommend a spring pullout — and may back a measure to mandate it .
" I attended a funeral last week of a soldier killed in Iraq .
We received a notification last evening of another Maine soldier being killed , " Collins said .
" It 's extremely difficult , especially when I do n't see the Iraqi government stepping up to the plate . "
WHITE HOUSE : Meeting meant to gain GOP senate support Moments later , she stepped away to return a phone call from the White House .
It was a scene that summed up the situation here as the Senate heads toward another series of votes on Iraq policy :
As Republican divisions over the war grow more apparent , furious efforts are underway by President Bush and his allies to convince lawmakers to wait until a September progress report from Gen.
David Petraeus , commander of U.S. forces in Iraq .
" There 's tremendous pressure to stay the course , " said Sen. Gordon Smith , R - Ore. Smith already has made his decision :
He 's co-sponsoring an amendment with Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , that would require most U.S. troops to be out of Iraq next spring .
Collins and Sen. Olympia Snowe , R - Maine , said they may vote for the withdrawal measure , which will be offered as an amendment to a defense bill .
" I 'm looking at it very seriously , " Snowe said .
Snowe said she received a phone call from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urging her to wait for the Petraeus report .
National security adviser Stephen Hadley was on Capitol Hill to lobby , and Vice President Cheney , who asked for more time at the Republican senators ' Tuesday luncheon .
Participants in the luncheon described the atmosphere as highly charged .
" Rip - snorting , " was the adjective Smith used .
" People spoke from their hearts , " said Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Texas , who chaired the lunch .
One of the most impassioned speakers , according to Senate Republican Whip Trent Lott , R- Miss . , was Sen. John McCain .
The Arizona Republican , who visited Iraq last week , delivered an emotional defense of the president 's policy in a floor speech .
" I know that senators are tired of the war , tired of the mounting deaths , " McCain said .
He asked " whether Americans still have the political courage to fight for victory . "
Sen. Jack Reed , D - R.I. , also spoke about his visit to Iraq last week .
He and McCain agreed the military is making progress against a stubborn insurgency ; both also agreed that Iraqi leaders are n't doing enough to end sectarian infighting and assume control of their own country .
Even so , the two senators reached diametrically opposed conclusions about what should happen next .
McCain , a former Navy fighter pilot who spent five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , came away convinced the United States needs to redouble its efforts .
Reed , an Army veteran and West Point graduate , argued that a withdrawal deadline will pressure Iraqi leaders who " to date have been reluctant to make hard choices . "
Still uncertain : whether supporters of a troop withdrawal will have the 60 votes they need for Senate passage .
Sen . Dick Durbin of Illinois , the assistant Democratic floor leader , said he 's not sure of conservative Democrats such as Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska .
And Sen. Joseph Biden , D - Del. , said he does n't believe there are enough Republicans ready to vote for a deadline .
" So far , most of them are hedging their bets , " Biden said of Republicans during a conference call with reporters .
" They 're just saying … we think the president has to change strategy .
But my guess is most of them will hold off until September to actually beginning to vote with us . "
Sens. Richard Lugar , R - Ind. , and Pete Domenici , R - N.M. , though outspoken critics of Bush 's Iraq policy , both said Tuesday that they will not back a mandatory deadlines for troop withdrawal .
" To the extent it said firmly , ' We 're out of there , I would n't support it , ' " Lugar said .
A potential vehicle for Republicans who want to register disapproval with the Bush policy : a bipartisan amendment that calls for implementing the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group .
That measure urges , but does not require , a withdrawal of most American troops by next spring .
When Sen. Ken Salazar , D - Colo. , introduced the measure Tuesday , it had a dozen co-sponsors , six Republicans and six Democrats .
Salazar said he hopes there is enough support to get it " past the finish line . "
Democratic leaders are less optimistic because the measure lacks specific deadlines .
" I 'm troubled if the best we can do at the end of the day is to have a general statement on policy goals , " Durbin said .

Cheney has a low center of gravity , a knack for being unperturbed by the by - play of Washington politics , but make no mistake , he is keeping score , relentlessly .
Dick Cheney is a profane man who fancies himself cut from a mold that once cut Teddy Roosevelt .
He is a " sportsman " and respecter of manly arts .
When an " effete Vermonter " pissed him off , his " Go f*ck Yourself , Senator " came straight from the hip and was barely noticed by his prefrontal cortex or any other part of his brain that might be involved ( in other people ) with ethics and courtesy .
Cheney believes that courtesy is a weakness , but that brash assertiveness is the mark of a survivor , a winner .
Accordingly , Cheney does not think much of other human beings .
Cheney is a social darwinist , a person who believes that human life is meant to be a struggle for survival .
For him survival is gaining control over his environment , and being one who acquired power by association with smarter people or richer people or just by accident , he sees himself as a survivor and the rest are , well , stooges .
This aspect of Cheney 's personality dominates his conscious and unconscious life .
Cheney has a bit of an inferiority complex because he does not have a very strong pedigree or resume .
He coattailed Rumsfeld into Washington politics and made use of his singular opportunity like some sort of dark Horatio Alger , learning the back channels , the dirt , the seamy side and the levers of power .
He has been astute and despite his modest intellect , he is above average in achievement , and it would be a very big mistake to underestimate his ability to reach a conclusion quickly .
It would be appropriate to notice , nevertheless , that he ( like many who are not well - endowed with synaptic agility ) tends to hold onto his judgments despite accumulating evidence .
This is part of his " manliness " construct , of course .
Cheney is no wimp , at least not his own mirror .
Dick Cheney 's grounding in the masculine mythos and in the survival of the fittest ethos of the 19th century American wild west , ( as portrayed to the world on Wyoming license plates ) , and the strange moodiness that overcomes natives of the area during the Chinook winds off the slopes of the Rocky Mountains ( rendering Casper as the per capita suicide capital of America ) led him inexorably to the neocon ideology expressed by the Project for a New American Century ( PNAC ) .
You will recall that when the Constitution was written and ratified the United States was not a world power and was engaged in consolidating itself as an isolated continental power in North America , with unfriendly Spaniards to the south and semi-hostile , semi-friendly British to the north in Canada .
The ideas in the PNAC credo do not quite fit our Constitution and , therefore , Cheney does not quite believe the Constitution fits anymore .
I would not want to overemphasize the causal connection here .
Cheney 's animus was never quite ready for the give and take and balance that our Constitution requires .
For Dick Cheney the Constitution is an old piece of paper , useful for giving a minimum structure in which to operate , but almost entirely without moral or principled implications .
He just does not respect it , period .
Cheney is fundamentally and viscerally intolerant .
To satisfy his own intellect , he does not have to concede anyone 's hypotheses about life , government , politics .
He reaches his own opinion and that is that .
It is not pragmatism , ; it is totalitarian , in fact .
Cheney is not democratic and frankly disdains the idea that democracy is a better form of government than oligarchy or even kleptocratic corporatist fascism , which is his own faith and the proof that Cheney does not exist in a vacuum .
There are Cheneyists and Cheneyites all over the place .
Cheney , like Stalin before him , has salted the federal government with people who are beholding to him and him alone for their position and sway .
They were picked because they agree with Dick Cheney 's analysis of history and government , namely , that there is too much opportunity there to be left to the hoi polloi , to democratic inefficiencies , to the vagaries of public opinion .
Cheneyism is a generalized phenomenon into which Dick Cheney fits in some ways only by accident .
He seems to epitomize the callous disregard for rule of law , for might - makes - right foreign affairs , for secrecy and subterfuge , for torture , for anti-democratic spin and for spoils - system kleptomania , but actually Cheney is just the most visible and perhaps the most immediately dangerous practitioner of Cheneyism .
Cheneyism is a name we give to the dark , kleptofascist corporatists that swim among us .
Their group is as old as the republic and never gives up trying to acquire power and riches so to acquire insulation from the vagaries of life .
In Cheney 's case no amount of insulation will protect him from his own dark damaged heart .
Cheneyism is a false ideology , of course .
The fittest are those who cooperate , not those who kill and torture and disdain the lives and minds of people they cannot use .
Cheneyism is , to paraphrase Rahm Emanuel on Countdown Tuesday evening , the credo of George Bush , for without that partnership Cheney would not be where he is today - the options behind " the Decider . "
Long time readers will recall that you saw here first the notion that Bush 's declaration of being The Decider was partly in reaction to seeping knowledge that Cheney was the power behind the throne .
But Cheneyism goes much , much farther than Bush .
There are Cheneyistas in Congress , men and women who believe that their affiliation to the Republican party trumps their oath of office , particularly the idea that their number one job is to preserve and defend the Constitution of the United States .
The hardline party loyalists believe as Cheney does the moment he awakes hanging upside down in his cave on Naval Observatory hill that a republic need not be a democracy , but rather would be more effective and efficient as a corporatist republic , representing the needs of the masses through their employers , and - never forget - enriching those chosen to " public service " in the corporate ladder - climbing processes .
Cheney may fall .
He may die of heart failure .
He may get impeached .
The problem is that like all good cockroaches , he has multiplied and his kind are in the cracks and boldly strutting down the boulevards of Washington .
Meanwhile the press believes they have identified an anomolous creature .
They are wrong .
Cheney is just the darkest of his kind .

I picture NASA shifting uncomfortably in its chair , running its fingers under its collar and wondering if it 's the only one feeling warm now that sex is in the air .
Or beyond the air , as the case may be .
You see , the space agency is almost 50 years old , and while it likes to think it 's a leader in exploring new frontiers , it has yet to shake off the fetters of its childhood when it comes to sex , romance and relationships .
Yet it is starting to talk more publicly about the special considerations associated with long space flights , such as how to deal with illness and even death when you can't just turn around and come home .
And sex is on the list for future discussions .
In the past , NASA has not been comfortable talking about sexuality , says science journalist Laura Woodmansee , who encountered resistance while researching her book Sex in Space .
" It 's almost as if ( retired astronauts ) agreed not to talk about sex when they left ( NASA ) , " she says .
" And the current ones worry about their jobs and how it would make them look . "
Yet as humans begin to spend more time in space and to travel further from Earth , space agencies will need to factor sex into their equations .
" We will have to address crew compatibility , sexuality issues , whether there is a necessity for sexual activity , " says David Steitz , NASA senior public affairs officer .
He had the grace to laugh when I interrupted with a " Hell , yeah ! "
But I was serious , too .
We cannot expect astronauts to spend three years in a spacecraft and not have sex – of some kind .
Probably with each other , and likely in more than one combination .
Sex in space presents a number of challenges beyond tangible matters like zero gravity or awkward enclosures .
In fact , the physics should be the least of NASA 's concerns .
It 's the touchy - feely bit that the agency will need to consider seriously .
Blindly applying Earth - bound standards that astronauts cannot follow under space - voyage conditions will only lead to guilt and shame .
What happens if one person in the spaceship makes a romantic overture , only to be rebuffed ?
What happens if an astronaut in a relationship back home falls in love with another member of the mission ?
What to do – send a breakup text message from Mars ?
How do you handle love , sex , romance , heartbreak , jealousy , hurt , unrequited longing , crushes , loneliness and twitterpation when you 're 18 months away from Earth and perhaps unsure whether you 'll make it back ?
You cope with it the way you do everything else in space .
You rely on your intelligence , your commitment to the common good and your training .
If NASA invites me to take part in discussions about sexual standards in space – it could happen – I will suggest sending all candidates into the adult internet for a year .
They do n't have to have cybersex or fall in love , but they should participate in different types of adult communities until they become comfortable with the wide range of human sexual relationships .
I 'm sure I 'm not the only one who would gladly volunteer to show astronauts the ropes .
Online , astronauts ( and their partners , if they have any ) can learn how to deal with sexual situations similar to those they will face in space , with one important difference : an escape hatch .
They can observe and experiment with sex without possession , partnership without monogamy , sexual pleasure without expectation of roses or breakfast .
They can discover group love , bond with a special someone , or both .
They can try letting go of jealousy and fear , figure out how to protect themselves from other people 's drama , and develop healthy ways to cope with desire , love and rejection .
Some astronauts might discover they are comfortable with polyamory or bisexuality while others might reaffirm their commitment to monogamy .
The important thing is that they practice living and working respectfully with others regardless of who is sleeping with whom .
We need to acknowledge that humans will bring our sexuality with us into space and that includes all the complexities of relationships as well as the relatively simple matter of bodies .
NASA cannot avoid confronting those complexities , especially now that the public knows even astronauts sometimes confuse obsession with love .
" How long can humans go without sex ? " is not the right question .
I do n't care if you have a same - sex crew of great - grandparents who have never had a flicker of sexual desire in their entire lives .
Lock a group of humans into a ship , sail them through space and time , and it wo n't take long for that deep , ancient need for touch and intimacy to surface .
For now , Steitz says , NASA is still trying to work out how to keep crewmembers physically healthy on an interplanetary journey .
" Obviously mental health is as important as the physical .
The difference is , it 's easier to develop physical standards for human bodies than for psychological or behavioral well - being , " he says .
" I can tell you how much bone mass you have , what your muscle strength is , how much oxygen you 're breathing .
But it 's much harder to try to figure out ' are you happy ? ' "
Once they develop standards for maintaining physical health , he says , they can start designing a spacecraft .
Only then do the less technical matters come to the fore .
Like where to stow the chocolate .
See you next Friday ,

Brian Beutler notes the fear that Michael Moore has put into the hearts of insurance executives .
It seems to me that the main cause here is that Moore has gone where liberal health wonks fear to tread , touching not only on the policy issues but on the question of ethics .
He helps tap into the anti-capitalist folk instincts that worry Bryan Caplan .
The crux of the matter is that ordinary people think that if there 's a sick person , and you 're in a position to help the sick person , that you ought to help the sick person .
Insurance companies strengthen this commonsense moral obligation by actually entering into contracts -- you pay them , each and every pay period , so that when you 're sick , they 'll help you .
But insurance companies are largely in the business of devising excuses to avoid helping you when you 're in need .
They employ people wake up every morning , drive to the office , and work all day denying sick people health care .
The labors of these individuals line the pockets of the companies ' executives .
Most people find this repugnant .
Bloodsucking vampires and flesh - eating zombies have the excuse of being driven by insatiable urges .
Insurance companies have free will and just choose to do bad things because they 're greedy .
That 's not an argument that 'll win you high grades in a public policy class or get you made a fellow at a think tank .
It 's demagogic and anti-intellectual .
But it 's effective and not , I think , entirely wrong

MAZAR-E-SHARIF , Afghanistan – While United States officials accuse Iran of arming a resurgent Taliban , officials here say the weapons are actually part of vast caches left behind by the Soviet army that fought a nine - year war in Afghanistan before withdrawing in 1988 .
Ustad Basir Arifi , secretary for the Disarmament of Illegal Armed Groups ( DIAG ) program in northern Afghanistan , told IPS that weapons abandoned by the Soviet Union there are now being moved by professional smugglers to the southern provinces where the Taliban Islamist movement has its stronghold .
" Huge caches of weapons remained with the people from the Soviet Union period .
These are now being smuggled to the south of Afghanistan .
These weapons are bought in the north of Afghanistan and smuggled to the south to be used against government and foreign forces , " Arifi said .
According to Arifi , security officials have on several occasions intercepted weapons being smuggled to the south .
He said the DIAG has urged the government to take firm measures to avoid all this .
Abdul Aziz Ahmad Zai , the chief of DIAG , said his group was " very concerned over the issue .
It shows that the Taliban are being fortified . "
Zai did not rule out the possibility of weapons originating from outside Afghanistan .
" Smugglers could be bringing weapons from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the north .
A good transit point could be Badakhshan province , " he said without mentioning Iran .
Zai said powerful syndicates were carrying out the smuggling .
" However , our security officials and the Interior Ministry are working very actively in this regard , " he added .
According to Zai , the recent riots in northern Jowzjan province were an indicator of the fact that weapons were freely available to people .
He also said that there still were armed groups in the north of Afghanistan .
" It is a very great concern for us that there are lots of illegal armed groups in the north , " he said .
Gen .
Abdul Manan , representative of the defense ministry in the DIAG program , said the government has been able to collect 70,000 heavy and light weapons from the whole country under the DDR and DIAG programs .
But he believes that at least a million more pieces were in the hands of armed groups in the north .
A gun smuggler operating from the Balkh province district told IPS that he has been in the business for the last two years .
The Pashto - speaking , bearded man , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said he regularly comes to the north to buy different kinds of weapons .
" I have employed people to collect weapons from people who have them and these are ferried to the south . "
" I have my customers in Kandahar .
When the weapons reach there , they come and receive it .
I make a good profit .
I can buy an AK - 47 for $ 200 in the north and sell it for $ 400 in the south , " he added .
Occasionally he smuggles explosives as well .
Ahmad Shah , 45 , a resident of Chemtal district in the Balkh province , freely admitted to supplying the smugglers with guns .
" I earn my living through running this business , " he told IPS .
Atta Mohammad
Nur , the governor of Balkh province , neither accepts nor rejects the fact that the weapons are being smuggled to the south .
" It could be right .
Insurgents are doing their utmost to disrupt life in the country .
They could be smuggling weapons from north to the south , " he said .
Rohullah Samun , spokesman for the Jowzjan governor , accepts that vast amount of weapons still exist in the province .
" People do have weapons .
There are lots of illegal armed militias in Jowzjan and its neighboring provinces .
Some of the warlords are regrouping , " he said .
The reference was to Abdorrashid Dostum , one of Afghanistan ’s most formidable warlords .
Dostum , who once supported the Soviets , has had a hand in the many regime changes that this war - torn country has seen over the last three decades and retains enormous influence in Jowzjan .
Dostum was among leaders who helped the U.S. - led forces to overthrow the Taliban government in 2001 .
Until recently he was regarded as the strongman of the north , but his role has been reduced to that of a military adviser to Afghanistan ’s President Hamid Karzai .
On June 13 , U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns told CNN television in Paris that there was " irrefutable evidence " that Iran was supplying weapons to the Taliban .
Ironically , the Taliban owes its origins largely to mujahedeen that were once armed and backed by the U.S. against communist rule in Afghanistan and the Soviet occupation .

Barring an unexpected Lame Duck attempt to amend the U.S. Constitution , Democratic control of Congress will probably result in a temporary moratorium on proposed amendments to the Constitution that would ban gay marriage or ban burning Old Glory Of course , the G.O.P. does not have a monopoly on converting a Congressional majority into failed attempts to amend the Constitution .
During the next 2 years of their pending majority , if the Democrats need to find examples of entertaining failed attempts to amend the U.S. Constitution , history provides some real doozies .
In this post , we 'll explore three prominent categories of failed Constitution amendments .
Starting in the early 20century , Congress began placing deadlines on the amendments it sent to the states for ratification .
Typically , the states were given seven years to ratify an amendment .
After the passage of the deadline , the proposed amendment would expire and Congress would need to start the process all over again to raise the issue .
( In the past 50 years , two amendments expired after Congressional approval : the 1972 Equal Rights Amendment & the 1978 D.C. Voting Rights Amendment However , absent explicit sunset provisions , approved yet unratified amendments do not expire .
Instead , they linger eternally , pending ratification .
As shown with the 27th Amendment , an amendment which floated around for 200 years before finally being ratified in the 1990's , each of these amendments has the potential of becoming law .
This proposed amendment was the first of the original twelve amendments proposed to Congress ( The original 2 Amendment eventually became the 27th Amendment mentioned above ) .
If passed , the amendment would have restricted the original size of the House of Representatives to 100 representatives , with later enlargements to be determined by Congress .
From 1789 to 1792 , 11 states ratified this amendment , leaving it two states short of ratification .
Proposed in 1810 , this amendment would strip U.S. citizenship from any citizen accepting , claiming , retaining , or receiving a foreign title of nobility without the consent of Congress .
Believed by some [ See here and here .
For a rebuttal , see here ] to have been ratified and then supressed by a conspiracy of lawyers ( who – so the theory goes – would lose their citizenship via their esquire title ) , this amendment was approved by 12 states , just one shy of full ratification .
Since , at the time , it came within one house of the South Carolina legislature of being ratified , some 19century printings of the Constitution erroneously include it as the 13 Amendment .
A last - ditch effort to avoid a civil war , this amendment – approved by the House and Senate on Februrary 28 & March 2 , 1861 , respectively – stated simply : Apart from its subject matter , the language of this amendment raises an important issue in U.S. Constitutional theory : Can a Constitutional amendment prohibit a later amendment through an entrenched clause Although this amendment was ultimately ratified by Ohio and Maryland , neither legislature ratified it before the start of Civil War hostilities with the Battle of Fort Sumter on April 12 , 1861 .
Proposed in 1924 and ratified by 28 states , this still - pending amendment requires the approval of 10 more states in order to restrict to the federal government all power to regulate the labor of persons under 18 years old .
This amendment is a direct reaction to the Child Labor Tax Case which found Congress had overstepped the boundaries of the 10 Amendment with the scope of the taxes it placed on factories employing child labor .
Had they been ratified , these proposed amendments would dramatically change the way our country works .
These proposed amendments were going exactly nowhere , but that 's why we like 'em .

When Playboy was establishing itself , most men ’s magazines , as revealed in The History of Men ’s Magazines , Vol. 2 , were still heavy with adventure ( war , gunfights , outlawry , cannibalism , man-versus - beast encounters , lots of Nazis ) .
Women , if present , tended to be either damsels in distress ( rescue fantasies loom large ) or vamps — or else they were mere cheesecake intermissions , like Helen Petroff in the July 1956 Man ’s Life , situated as she and her bikini and her stuffed tiger are between “ Attacked by a Giant Boa ” and “ 25 Best Fishing Spots . ”
This class of magazine advertised everything from rifles , knives , fishing tackle , trusses , accordions , and high - paying jobs in meat cutting to Charles Atlas body - building regimens and careers in accounting and real - estate brokering ( the March 1958 See even has an article on how to ask for a raise ) , all of which suggests a readership that ranged from Sam the butcher to Walter Mitty .
Playboy , exhibiting little interest in “ Jim Bowie ’s Big Knife ” ( Argosy , August 1956 ) , instead gathered the ladies and set a tone of cheerfully mixed company and sleek cosmopolitanism .
The April 1962 issue , for example , has a classic photo essay showing handsome couples out and about in Paris , part of which is reproduced in The Playboy Book : Fifty Years , a gorgeous sampling of illustrations , covers , candids , travel photos , and concept photography as well as the requisite figure studies .
It ’s an intoxicating collection — provoking no small amount of loopy nostalgia .
But that ’s all part of its charm .
There may be poignancy in Hefner ’s bourgeois midwestern dream of the luxe life ; witness the stilted grooviness of the old Playboy ’s Penthouse TV show , now available on DVD under the blanket title Playboy After Dark , in which Hef , a polite young man turned psychology major , does his best impression of a tuxedoed hipster - host .
But is this any more quaintly touching than Plimpton and company ’s Ivy- abroad , shabby - chic attempt to relive the Lost Generation ?
At least Hefner , against all odds ( many , many odds ) , seems to be held in high regard by just about every woman who ever knew him , including ex-wives and ex-girlfriends and all manner of coworker .
The Playmate Book has an air of lighthearted reunion , only so much of which can be manufactured .
Many of the former centerfolds have submitted biographical updates and family photos , and over the years have returned to the mansion on occasion to see old acquaintances and even pose for reunion pictorials — sometimes decades after their initial appearance , and looking better than ever .
( This bonhomie is borne out in testimonial after testimonial in the documentary Hugh Hefner : American Playboy .
Yes , it ’s an obvious brief for the defense .
But still , no one ’s forcing first wife , Mildred , or ex-girlfriend Barbi Benton to recall fondly the man who cheated on them prodigiously . )
Compare all that with what Patsy Matthiessen , the ex-wife of one of the Paris Review founders , said to Talese about that milieu :
The whole life seemed after a while to be utterly meaningless …
And there was something very manqué about them — this going to West Africa , and getting thrown in jail , and getting in the ring with Archie Moore …
And I was a Stepin Fetchit in that crowd , getting them tea at four , and sandwiches at ten .
One might argue that the average Playboy belle is n’t sophisticated enough to register such pique , but that would seem only to make Matthiessen ’s treatment the worse .
Who would ever have thought that where rude male self - indulgence is concerned , Hefner could be outdone by a bunch of patricians ?
Apparently so as not to suffer the same emasculating fate in their day , the laddies at Maxim , Stuff , and FHM take every opportunity to nudge readers , with eyebrows dancing , and ask ( actually shout ) , “ Are n’t we just so naughty ? ! ”
Which can only be answered , “ Not really . ”
To open these magazines is to walk into a teenage boy ’s room : the air scented with dirty socks and the contents of wadded - up Kleenex ; the walls decorated with pictures of swimsuit models and he -man athletes and sports cars ; the desk barely visible under piles of video - game cartridges , action figures , and forgotten junk food ; and all of it colored by the boy ’s glee in knowing it exasperates Mom .
In fact , that phantom mom ( or equivalent mother figure ) is just about the only palpable female presence in these magazines .
The last living witness to the final hours of Adolf Hitler , the Nazi leader 's personal bodyguard Rochus Misch , has turned 90 but vowed to keep his secrets to himself , a report said .
Mr Misch was 27 when he left Hitler 's bunker on May 2 , 1945 as Soviet troops stormed the chancellery in Berlin , two days after the Fuhrer killed himself with a gunshot to the head , Spiegel Online reported .
He has kept quiet on who killed Hermann Fegelein , who was married to the sister of Eva Braun .
According to Mr Misch , Hitler did not give the order to shoot Fegelein , contrary to the findings of German historian Joachim Fest .
He said the representative of the commander of Hitler 's personal guard gave the order .
" I know it from an officer from the Reich security service whose colleague shot Fegelein , " Mr Misch told Spiegel Online .
" I know his name , but I am keeping it for myself . "
Fegelein was the liaison officer between Hitler and Heinrich Himmler , the head of the SS , and left the bunker without authorisation on April 27 .
He was shot on April 29 .
Mr Misch , who lives in Berlin , has written a book called I Was Hitler 's Bodyguard , which is due to appear in Germany later this year .
It has already been published in South America , Japan , Spain , Poland and Turkey , Spiegel Online reported .

SAN DIEGO —
With rooms starting at $ 450 a night , this city ’s newest hotel is keeping company with some grand dames of San Diego County : Four Seasons Resort Aviara , Hotel del Coronado and the US Grant .
But the only thing strait - laced about the Ivy Hotel is the leather - covered , corseted columns in the lobby .
The 159 - room , $ 90 - million property could pass as Playboy Mansion South , from the skin - baring cocktail waitresses to the $ 3,000 - a- night specialty suite with king - size bunk beds , a group shower and , ahem , a fireman ’s pole .
“ We wanted something a little voyeuristic , a little seductive , ” said Michael Kelly , the Ivy ’s co-owner who has made his fortune buying and selling depressed assets .
“ It ’s an adult playground , but it ’s not cheap . ”
It used to be that only managers of by - the - hour motels were happy to have their properties mistaken for bordellos .
But with soccer moms taking erotic dancing classes at the local community college and Carl ’s Jr. using Paris Hilton ( read : sex ) to sell hamburgers , some hotels are n’t afraid to offer guests more than X - rated pay - per - view movies .
Julie Albright , who teaches classes on human sexuality and social psychology at USC , says easy access to sexual messages and images has shifted the bounds of what ’s considered socially acceptable .
“ It ’s the pornification of mainstream society , ” she said .
“ There ’s more overt sexuality in our media , on television .
More people have cable TV .
More people are on the Internet . ”
Restaurants are also following suit .
In West Hollywood , the adults - only Hadaka Sushi and its “ sushi gone naughty ” concept serves up ahi tuna on a naked model strategically draped with banana leaves .
The experience costs $ 2,100 — and that does n’t include the food .
Those on a tighter budget can order more traditional fare from a menu that reads like a smutty novel .
“ I think people should break out of their shell a little bit and not be afraid to explore new and different things , ” owner and chef Edward Brik said .
“ If you ’re not comfortable coming in and ordering a threesome roll , you can go to some other boring sushi place and order a spicy tuna roll . ”
From a purely business perspective , though , the Ivy and restaurants such as Hadaka Sushi are simply differentiating themselves , experts say .
Tom Reichert , coauthor of “ Sex and the Consumer Culture ” and an advertising professor at the University of Georgia in Athens , calls it “ sex - based segmentation . ”
“ It ’s not targeted to everybody but I think there ’s at least enough people to keep them in business . ”
The Ivy is likely to raise a few eyebrows in wholesome San Diego , which bills itself as “ America ’s Finest City . ”
Co-owner Kelly said that was exactly the idea : “ This town needed a little style .
I left San Diego every weekend and took off to Vegas , Los Angeles , Miami or St. Tropez .
People want , and are willing to pay for , quality and service . ”
Los Angeles entrepreneur Brad Beckerman agrees .
After a recent visit to the Ivy , he ’s already planning a return trip .
“ I was blown away , ” said Beckerman , founder and CEO of Trunk Ltd. , an apparel and accessories company .
“ This in L.A. would be over the top , incredible .
It would kill . ”
The Ivy ’s owners say their hotel concept is consistent with the times — and the neighborhood .
Ten years ago , Kelly and his sister Louise opened a bar called the Bitter End in San Diego ’s Gaslamp Quarter .
Since then , the surrounding downtown has undergone a major renaissance , thanks to construction of the Petco Park baseball stadium and a $ 216 - million overhaul of the San Diego Convention Center .
In the last seven years , convention business has more than doubled ; 574,000 convention attendees came last year , many of them executives who have expense accounts to burn on swanky soirees , pricey rooms and hard - to - find wines .
In the Gaslamp Quarter , bottle service — once reserved for velvet - rope clubs in New York , Vegas and Los Angeles — has “ completely changed ” San Diego ’s night life in the last couple of years , said Carl Winston , director of San Diego State University ’s School of Hospitality and Tourism Management .
“ The whole bar scene has gotten tremendously sophisticated here and tremendously expensive , ” Winston said .
“ People are buying bottles for $ 500 and $ 600 for the evening .
There seem to be 25 - to 35 - year - olds who do n’t mind paying several hundred dollars to entertain friends . ”
The Kellys are hoping to capture some of this money .
At their hotel club , Envy , they are charging $ 600 to $ 5,000 to reserve a choice booth for the evening .
They are also targeting couples , businessmen and mavens of the L.A. party scene who currently would rather hop a jet to Vegas .
Indeed , the Kellys are merely expanding the practice promoted by Vegas hoteliers .
The Palms in Las Vegas has its own version of the Erotic Suite , stripper pole and all .
Adventurous guests at Sin City ’s Hard Rock can order blindfolds , whips and rabbit - fur handcuffs from room service .
( All sales are final . )
The Ivy , which opened last month , markets itself as class , not trash .
Envy is decorated with floor - to - ceiling photos of legs clad in fishnet stockings and women in lingerie .
Instead of curtains , red chain mail hangs from the ceiling .
Couches are upholstered in red patent leather with black fringe .
And in the restaurant , run by chef Damon Gordon , there is seating for six at a chef ’s bed .
To set the mood , the hotel is crawling with attractive workers in couture Tadashi uniforms .
( Kelly interviewed a pool of 1,500 before settling on a staff of 300 . )
Hostesses wear black gowns with plunging necklines .
Cocktail waitresses deliver martinis in short black lace dresses .
Rooms have a “ functional work space ” for guests who need to punch in .
But visitors are more likely to be impressed by the see - through shower that overlooks the bed .
Sociologist Albright calls places like the Ivy “ a recipe for infidelity . ”
Studies have shown that businessmen who earn more than $ 75,000 a year and whose jobs take them out of town are more likely to cheat , said Albright , who is studying men who pursue multiple relationships for sex , money or status .
The same demographic tends to eschew hard drugs and heavy gambling but embraces recreational views of sex .
“ It ’s the one area where they allow themselves to be hedonistic , ” she said .
“ In the privacy of their hotel rooms is their chance to cut loose , unbutton the buttoned - up oxford shirt . ”

USC College theoretical physicist Itzhak Bars has pioneered efforts to discern how a second dimension of time could help physicists better explain the laws of nature .
Photo credit : Don Milici
For a long time , Itzhak Bars has been studying time .
More than a decade ago , the USC College physicist began pondering the role time plays in the basic laws of physics — the equations describing matter , gravity and the other forces of nature .
Those laws are exquisitely accurate .
Einstein mastered gravity with his theory of general relativity , and the equations of quantum theory capture every nuance of matter and other forces , from the attractive power of magnets to the subatomic glue that holds an atom ’s nucleus together .
But the laws ca n’t be complete .
Einstein ’s theory of gravity and quantum theory do n’t fit together .
Some piece is missing in the picture puzzle of physical reality .
Bars thinks one of the missing pieces is a hidden dimension of time .
Bizarre is not a powerful enough word to describe this idea , but it is a powerful idea nevertheless .
With two times , Bars believes , many of the mysteries of today ’s laws of physics may disappear .
Of course , it ’s not as simple as that .
An extra dimension of time is not enough .
You also need an additional dimension of space .
It sounds like a new episode of “ The Twilight Zone , ” but it ’s a familiar idea to most physicists .
In fact , extra dimensions of space have become a popular way of making gravity and quantum theory more compatible .
Extra space dimensions are n’t easy to imagine — in everyday life , nobody ever notices more than three .
Any move you make can be described as the sum of movements in three directions — up - down , back and forth , or sideways .
Similarly , any location can be described by three numbers ( on Earth , latitude , longitude and altitude ) , corresponding to space ’s three dimensions .
Other dimensions could exist , however , if they were curled up in little balls , too tiny to notice .
If you moved through one of those dimensions , you ’d get back to where you started so fast you ’d never realize that you had moved .
“ An extra dimension of space could really be there , it ’s just so small that we do n’t see it , ” said Bars , a professor of physics and astronomy .
Something as tiny as a subatomic particle , though , might detect the presence of extra dimensions .
In fact , Bars said , certain properties of matter ’s basic particles , such as electric charge , may have something to do with how those particles interact with tiny invisible dimensions of space .
In this view , the Big Bang that started the baby universe growing 14 billion years ago blew up only three of space ’s dimensions , leaving the rest tiny .
Many theorists today believe that 6 or 7 such unseen dimensions await discovery .
Only a few , though , believe that more than one dimension of time exists .
Bars pioneered efforts to discern how a second dimension of time could help physicists better explain nature .
“ Itzhak Bars has a long history of finding new mathematical symmetries that might be useful in physics , ” said Joe Polchinski , a physicist at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at UC Santa Barbara .
“ This two - time idea seems to have some interesting mathematical properties . ”
If Bars is on the right track , some of the most basic processes in physics will need re-examination .
Something as simple as how particles move , for example , could be viewed in a new way .
In classical physics ( before the days of quantum theory ) , a moving particle was completely described by its momentum ( its mass times its velocity ) and its position .
But quantum physics says you can never know those two properties precisely at the same time .
Bars alters the laws describing motion even more , postulating that position and momentum are not distinguishable at a given instant of time .
Technically , they can be related by a mathematical symmetry , meaning that swapping position for momentum leaves the underlying physics unchanged ( just as a mirror switching left and right does n’t change the appearance of a symmetrical face ) .
In ordinary physics , position and momentum differ because the equation for momentum involves velocity .
Since velocity is distance divided by time , it requires the notion of a time dimension .
If swapping the equations for position and momentum really does n’t change anything , then position needs a time dimension too .
“ If I make position and momentum indistinguishable from one another , then something is changing about the notion of time , ” said Bars .
“ If I demand a symmetry like that , I must have an extra time dimension . ”
Simply adding an extra dimension of time does n’t solve everything , however .
To produce equations that describe the world accurately , an additional dimension of space is needed as well , giving a total of four space dimensions .
Then , the math with four space and two time dimensions reproduces the standard equations describing the basic particles and forces , a finding Bars described partially last year in the journal Physical Review D and has expanded upon in his more recent work .
Bars ’ math suggests that the familiar world of four dimensions — three of space , one of time — is merely a shadow of a richer six - dimensional reality .
In this view the ordinary world is like a two - dimensional wall displaying shadows of the objects in a three - dimensional room .
In a similar way , the observable universe of ordinary space and time may reflect the physics of a bigger space with an extra dimension of time .
In ordinary life nobody notices the second time dimension , just as nobody sees the third dimension of an object ’s two - dimensional shadow on a wall .
This viewpoint has implications for understanding many problems in physics .
For one thing , current theory suggests the existence of a lightweight particle called the axion , needed to explain an anomaly in the equations of the standard model of particles and forces .
If it exists , the axion could make up the mysterious “ dark matter ” that astronomers say affects the motions of galaxies .
But two decades of searching has failed to find proof that axions exist .
Two - time physics removes the original anomaly without the need for an axion , Bars has shown , possibly explaining why it has not been found .
On a grander level , two - time physics may assist in the quest to merge quantum theory with Einstein ’s relativity in a single unified theory .
The most popular approach to that problem today , superstring theory , also invokes extra dimensions of space , but only a single dimension of time .
Many believe that a variant on string theory , known as M theory , will be the ultimate winner in the quantum - relativity unification game , and M theory requires 10 dimensions of space and one of time .
Efforts to formulate a clear and complete version of M theory have so far failed .
“ Nobody has yet told us what the fundamental form of M theory is , ” Bars said .
“ We just have clues — we do n’t know what it is . ”
Adopting the more symmetric two - time approach may help .
Describing the 11 dimensions of M theory in the language of two - time physics would require adding one time dimension plus one space dimension , giving nature 11 space and two time dimensions .
“ The two - time version of M theory would have a total of 13 dimensions , ” Bars said .
For some people , that might be considered unlucky .
But for Bars , it ’s a reason for optimism .
“ My hope , ” he says , “ is that this path that I am following will actually bring me to the right place . ”

Tomgram : Elizabeth de la Vega , Indicting Bush
Think of it as a Tomdispatch.com milestone .
This is now the first website to " indict " the President , the Vice President , and their colleagues for defrauding us into war in Iraq .
I put that " indict " in quotes because what follows , as former federal prosecutor Elizabeth de la Vega makes clear in her new book United States v. George W. Bush et al. , is " not an actual indictment . "
It can't be , of course ; but consider it the second best thing .
De la Vega has , in her career as a prosecutor , prepared numerous fraud indictments and , as she argued in the first excerpt from her book posted at Tomdispatch earlier this week , " A Fraud Worse than Enron , " what George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , and their senior officials committed was a crime , not just in the colloquial sense of the word , but in the legal sense too ( and not a victimless crime either ) .
While their crime was of a magnitude that puts even Enron , no less run -of - the - mill fraud cases , to shame , it also has all the elements of a typical , small - time scam .
De la Vega 's " hypothetical indictment " of George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Condoleezza Rice , and Colin Powell that you are about to read remains , unfortunately , in the realm of fantasy .
But only for now .
Until our world comes more fully to grips with the criminal nature of the Bush administration 's acts , you can at least turn to the full de la Vega book .
A Tomdispatch.com special project , produced in conjunction with Seven Stories Press , a wonderful independent publisher , it 's officially published on December 1st ( but available now ) .
You wo n't want to miss it .
It 's superbly done and -- though I hesitate to say it , given the nature of the subject matter -- genuinely enjoyable to read because
De la Vega turns out to be as skilled a writer as she is a prosecutor , and applies both her talents to the book .
So check out the indictment , read the first day of grand jury testimony ( which will be posted at this site on Thursday ) , and in the meantime get the investigative ball rolling by purchasing the book at Amazon.com or , if you want to give all involved a few extra cents , directly at the Seven Stories website .
After all , the excerpts at Tomdispatch can only give you a taste of the full case De la Vega makes .
This book should be the political stocking - stuffer of the Holiday season .

INDICTMENT
THE GRAND JURY CHARGES :
Introductory Allegations
At times relevant to this Indictment :
1 . The primary law of the United States Federal Government was set forth in the U.S. Constitution ( " Constitution " ) , which provides that the first branch of government is the Legislative Branch ( " Congress " ) .
Pursuant to Article I , Section 8 , Congress has certain powers and obligations regarding oversight of foreign affairs , including the powers to : ( 1 ) declare war ; ( 2 ) raise and support the armed forces ; and ( 3 ) tax and spend for the common good .
2. Article II of the Constitution establishes the Executive Branch .
The Executive Power of the United States is vested in the President , who is also the Commander in Chief of the Armed Services .
3. Defendant GEORGE W. BUSH ( " BUSH " ) has been employed as President of the United States since January 20 , 2001 .
On that day , BUSH took a constitutionally mandated oath to faithfully execute the Office of President and to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution .
BUSH is also constitutionally obligated to take care that the laws be faithfully executed .
4 . As Chief Executive , BUSH exercised authority , direction , and control over the entire Executive Branch , which includes the White House , the Office of the Vice President , the Departments of State , Defense , and others , and the National Security Council .
5. Defendant RICHARD B. CHENEY ( " CHENEY " ) has been employed as Vice President of the United States since January 20 , 2001 .
6. Defendant CONDOLEEZZA RICE ( " RICE " ) was employed as the National Security Adviser from January 2001 to January 2005 , when she became Secretary of State , a position she holds as of the date of this indictment .
As National Security Adviser , RICE exercised direction , control , and authority over the National Security Council , which coordinates various national security and foreign policy agencies , including the Departments of Defense and State .
7. Defendant DONALD M. RUMSFELD ( " RUMSFELD " ) has been employed as Secretary of Defense since January 2001 .
8. Defendant COLIN M. POWELL ( " POWELL " ) was employed as Secretary of State from January 2001 through January of 2005 .
9 . Before assuming their offices , CHENEY , RICE , RUMSFELD and POWELL took an oath to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution .
10 .
As employees of the Executive Branch , BUSH , CHENEY , RICE , RUMSFELD , and POWELL were governed by Executive Orders 12674 and 12731 .
These Orders provide that Executive Branch employees hold their positions as a public trust and that the American people have a right to expect that they will fulfill that trust in accordance with certain ethical standards and principles .
These include abiding by the Constitution and laws of the United States , as well as not using their offices to further private goals and interests .
11 . Pursuant to the Constitution , their oaths of office , their status as Executive Branch employees , and their presence in the United States , BUSH , CHENEY , RICE , RUMSFELD , and POWELL , and their subordinates and employees , are required to obey Title 18 , United States Code , Section 371 , which prohibits conspiracies to defraud the United States .
12 . As used in Section 371 , the term " to defraud the United States " means " to interfere with or obstruct one of its lawful government functions by deceit , craft , trickery , or at least by means that are dishonest . "
The term also means to " impair , obstruct , or defeat the lawful function of any department of government " by the use of " false or fraudulent pretenses or representations . "
13 . A " false " or " fraudulent " representation is one that is : ( a ) made with knowledge that it is untrue ; ( b ) a half - truth ; ( c ) made without a reasonable basis or with reckless indifference as to whether it is , in fact , true or false ; or ( d ) literally true , but intentionally presented in a manner reasonably calculated to deceive a person of ordinary prudence and intelligence .
The knowing concealment or omission of information that a reasonable person would consider important in deciding an issue also constitutes fraud .
14 . Congress is a " department of the United States " within the meaning of Section 371 .
In addition , hearings regarding funding for military action and authorization to use military force are " lawful functions " of Congress .
15 . Accordingly , the presentation of information to Congress and the general public through deceit , craft , trickery , dishonest means , and fraudulent representations , including lies , half - truths , material omissions , and statements made with reckless indifference to their truth or falsity , while knowing and intending that such fraudulent representations would influence Congress ' decisions regarding authorization to use military force and funding for military action , constitutes interfering with , obstructing , impairing , and defeating a lawful government function of a department of the United States within the meaning of Section 371 .
The Conspiracy to Defraud the United States
16 . Beginning on or about a date unknown , but no later than August of 2002 , and continuing to the present , in the District of Columbia and elsewhere , the defendants ,
GEORGE W. BUSH ,
RICHARD B. CHENEY ,
CONDOLEEZZA RICE ,
DONALD M. RUMSFELD , and
COLIN M. POWELL ,
and others known and unknown , did knowingly and intentionally conspire to defraud the United States by using deceit , craft , trickery , dishonest means , false and fraudulent representations , including ones made without a reasonable basis and with reckless indifference to their truth or falsity , and omitting to state material facts necessary to make their representations truthful , fair and accurate , while knowing and intending that their false and fraudulent representations would influence the public and the deliberations of Congress with regard to authorization of a preventive war against Iraq , thereby defeating , obstructing , impairing , and interfering with Congress ' lawful functions of overseeing foreign affairs and making appropriations .
17 . The Early Months of the Bush - Cheney Administration : Prior to January of 2001 , BUSH , CHENEY , and RUMSFELD each demonstrated a predisposition to employ U.S. military force to invade the Middle East , including , specifically , to forcibly remove Saddam Hussein .
18 . Since 1992 , CHENEY has endorsed a " bold foreign policy " that includes using military force to " punish " or " threaten to punish " possible aggressors in order to protect the United States 's access to Persian Gulf oil and to halt proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ( " WMD " ) , a term that is customarily used to describe chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons .
19 .
On or about January 26 , 1998 , RUMSFELD and seven other future BUSH - CHENEY administration appointees signed a letter sent by a conservative policy institute named " Project for a New American Century " ( " PNAC " ) to then President William Clinton , which called for U.S. military action to forcibly remove Saddam Hussein from power .
20 .
In January 1999 , BUSH named RICE and her future Deputy National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley ( " Hadley " ) , as his presidential - campaign foreign - policy advisers , along with future Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz ( " Wolfowitz " ) and four others who had publicly advocated forcibly removing Saddam Hussein .
21 . On or before September 2000 , 12 future BUSH - CHENEY administration appointees , including Wolfowitz , former Assistant to Vice President CHENEY , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , and Rumsfeld 's long - term aide Stephen Cambone , participated in drafting " Rebuilding America 's Defenses , " a PNAC policy statement which asserted that the " need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein . "
PNAC acknowledged that its goals would take a long time to achieve " absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event -- like a new Pearl Harbor . "
22 . Once BUSH became the Republican candidate in the 2000 presidential election campaign , he and CHENEY informed the general public that they would be reluctant to use military force and did not believe that the United States should engage in " nation - building . "
23 . On and after January 20 , 2001 , BUSH and CHENEY caused to be appointed as senior foreign policy advisors and consultants , at least thirty - four persons who had publicly endorsed the PNAC principles of United States global preeminence and use of force to " punish " or " threaten to punish " emerging threats from weapons of mass destruction ( " WMD " ) or impediments to United States access to oil in the Middle East .
Of those appointees , eighteen had also publicly advocated forcibly removing Saddam Hussein .
24 . In late December 2000 , BUSH and CHENEY advised outgoing President William J. Clinton and others that , among potential foreign policy issues , BUSH 's primary concern was Iraq .
25 . On February 11 , 2001 , BUSH ordered the first airstrikes since 1998 to be conducted outside of the United Nations ( " UN " ) agreed - upon No - Fly zones , to get Saddam Hussein's " attention . "
26 . The Attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
On September 11 , 2001 , nineteen men hijacked four commercial airplanes .
They crashed two planes into the World Trade Towers in New York City and another into the Pentagon in Washington , DC .
The fourth plane crashed in Pennsylvania .
In total , nearly 3,000 people died as a result of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks ( " 9/11 " ) .
27 . Shortly afterward , United States intelligence agencies determined that 9/11 was the work of the terrorist organization al Qaeda , spearheaded by Osama Bin Laden .
Fifteen of the nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia , two from Yemen , and two from Lebanon .
This information , along with the conclusion that no evidence linked Saddam Hussein to the attacks or al Qaeda , was immediately communicated to BUSH , CHENEY , RICE , RUMSFELD , POWELL , and others .
28 . BUSH -CHENEY administration members began discussing an invasion of Iraq immediately after 9/11 .
BUSH , RUMSFELD and others also assigned various subordinates , including former counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke , CIA Director George Tenet , and General Richard Meyers to look for intelligence that could justify attacking Saddam Hussein 's regime .
29 .
On September 17 , 2001 , BUSH secretly ordered the formulation of preliminary plans for an invasion of Iraq , while admitting to his aides that no evidence existed to justify an attack .
30 .
On or about September 18 , 2001 , in response to BUSH 's request , Clarke sent RICE a memo that stated : ( a ) the case for linking Hussein to 9/11 was weak ; ( b ) only anecdotal evidence linked Hussein to al Qaeda ; ( c ) Osama Bin Laden resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein ; and ( d ) there was no confirmed reporting of Saddam cooperating with Bin Laden on unconventional weapons .
31 . On September 20 , 2001 , BUSH informed British Prime Minister Tony Blair that after Afghanistan , the United States and Britain should return to the issue of invading Iraq .
32 . U.S. Intelligence Community Assessments of Risk from Iraq in Effect on November 2001 .
On occasion , Executive Branch officials request assessments of current intelligence on risks posed by WMD in a given country .
Although such assessments are coordinated by the Central Intelligence Agency ( " CIA " ) , the final product incorporates the analyses , including dissenting opinions , of the intelligence branches of the Departments of State , Energy , Defense , the National Security Agency , and others , which are collectively called the Intelligence Community ( " IC " ) .
33 .
As of November 2001 , the most recent assessment on Iraq was a December 2000 classified Intelligence Community Assessment ( " ICA " ) called " Iraq : Steadily Pursuing WMD Capabilities . "
This ICA was a comprehensive update on possible Iraqi efforts to rebuild WMD and weapons delivery systems after the 1998 departure of International Atomic Energy Agency ( " IAEA " ) representatives and UN weapons inspectors , who are collectively referred to as the United Nations Special Commission ( " UNSCOM " ) .
34 . Regarding Iraq 's possible nuclear program , the December 2000 NIE unanimously concluded that :
(a) The IAEA and UNSCOM had destroyed or neutralized Iraq 's nuclear infrastructure , but Iraq still had a foundation for future nuclear reconstitution ;
( b) Iraq was continuing low - level theoretical research and training , and attempting to obtain dual - use items that cold be used to reconstitute its nuclear program ;
( c ) if Iraq acquired a significant quantity of fissile material through foreign assistance , it could have a crude nuclear weapon within a year ; if Iraq received foreign assistance , it would take five to seven years to produce enough weapons - grade fissile material for a nuclear weapon ; and
(d) Iraq did not appear to have reconstituted its nuclear weapons program .
35 . Escalation of Military Activity and Planning for Invasion of Iraq .
On November 21 , 2001 , BUSH secretly ordered preparation of a formal war plan for invading Iraq .
Thereafter , for sixteen months , the BUSH - CHENEY administration expended substantial U.S. government funds in military activity and planning for invasion of Iraq , all without notice to , or approval by , the U.S. Congress .
36 . BUSH did not receive an extensive briefing about possible WMD in Iraq before ordering a war plan , nor did he discuss the legitimacy of grounds for war with anyone .
BUSH received no such briefing until December 21 , 2002 .
37 . On or about November 27 , 2001 , RUMSFELD asked General " Tommy " Franks , head of Central Command , which supervises Middle East operations , to immediately prepare an Iraq war plan in response to BUSH 's order .
38 . Thereafter , Franks discussed numerous revised Iraq war plans with RUMSFELD .
Between December 2001 and August 2002 , BUSH , CHENEY , RICE , RUMSFELD , POWELL , and others held at least five lengthy meetings about Franks ' plans .
In August , BUSH ordered Franks to prepare to invade Iraq using the " Hybrid Plan , " a combination of the " Running Start " and " Generated Start " plans developed previously .
39 .
During 2002 , the United States and Great Britain increased air strikes in order to degrade Iraqi air defenses and began deploying troops to areas around Iraq .
40 .
On or about July 30 , 2002 , without approval by , or notice to , Congress , BUSH caused the diversion of $ 700 million from Afghanistan war funds into Iraq invasion preparations .
41 . On September 5 , 2002 , without approval by , or notice to , Congress , BUSH caused approximately 100 United States and British aircraft to launch ballistic missiles at Iraq 's major western air - defense facility .
42 . By September 12 , 2002 , without approval by , or notice to , Congress , BUSH had caused the movement of 40,000 military personnel and over 350,000 tons of equipment to areas around Iraq .
Franks also ordered Central Command to be moved to Al Udeid Air Base near Doha , Qatar .
43 . Behind - the - Scenes Strategizing with British Officials :
On or before March 2002 , BUSH , RICE , Wolfowitz , and others secretly began discussing ways to persuade the public and foreign allies to accept Bush 's goal of invading Iraq , with British Prime Minister Tony Blair ( " Blair " ) and his advisers .
44 . On March 12 , 2002 , in Washington , DC , RICE met with Blair 's Foreign Policy Adviser Sir David Manning and informed him of BUSH 's problems with persuading " international opinion that military action against Iraq was necessary and justified . "
45 . On March 17 , 2002 , in Washington , DC , British Ambassador Sir Christopher Meyer advised Wolfowitz that the two countries should " wrongfoot " Saddam Hussein by seeking a UN resolution that would require the readmission of weapons inspectors with the expectation that Saddam would create a justification for war by obstructing the inspections .
46 . On April 6 , 2002 , in Crawford , Texas , BUSH and Blair discussed strategies to sway public opinion regarding military action in Iraq .
Blair agreed to support a United States invasion if the two countries obtained a UN resolution first .
47 .
In mid-July , 2002 , in Washington , DC , White House officials discussed Iraq with visiting British officials .
Upon their return to London , these officials reported the talks to Blair in a meeting at 10 Downing St. on July 23 , 2002 .
Among other things , Blair 's advisers suggested that he urge BUSH to devise a more realistic political strategy for attacking Iraq , because a desire for " regime change " would not justify military action under international law .
48 . In mid-July , 2002 , in Washington , DC , CIA Director Tenet and others talked about the Bush administration 's intentions regarding Iraq with Sir Richard Dearlove , the head of British Intelligence .
49 . On July 23 , 2002 , during the Downing St. meeting described above , Dearlove informed Blair that in the United States " Military action was now seen as inevitable .
BUSH wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD .
But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy . "
50 . On July 23 , 2002 , British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw also noted that BUSH had " made up his mind to take military action . "
Straw said he would urge POWELL to persuade BUSH to seek a UN resolution requiring Saddam Hussein to readmit weapons inspectors , in effect , suggesting the " wrongfooting " strategy that Meyer had described to Wolfowitz .
51 . Behind - the - Scenes Efforts to Fix Intelligence Around the Policy .
Within weeks after learning from Clarke , Tenet , and others that Iraq and Saddam Hussein had no involvement with either 9/11 or al Qaeda , RUMSFELD caused Deputy Undersecretary for Defense Douglas Feith ( " Feith " ) to secretly create the Counter Terrorism Group ( " CTEG " ) , a small unit of political appointees whose mission was to find links between Iraq and al Qaeda by reviewing raw intelligence that previously had been discarded as unreliable .
CTEG reported weekly to RUMSFELD 's long - term associate Stephen Cambone , and occasionally presented information directly to Wolfowitz , thereby circumventing standard IC procedures .
52 .
At some time in 2002 , Feith also designated political appointees to work under his supervision in the newly - created Office of Special Plans , whose purpose was to develop and package information for use in marketing the President 's plan for an invasion of Iraq .
In the fall of 2002 , this group presented information directly to RUMSFELD , to RICE 's office , and to CHENEY 's office , thereby circumventing standard IC procedures .
53 .
In the spring of 2002 , CHENEY and his former aide , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , began visiting CIA headquarters to question CIA agents ' assessments about Iraq .
RUMSFELD and Deputy National Security Adviser Hadley also repeatedly pressed CIA Director Tenet and his subordinates to present a stronger case against Iraq .
54 . Bush 's Creation of the White House Iraq Group .
By the summer of 2002 , domestic and international support for BUSH 's plan to invade Iraq was lukewarm .
At the same time , Bush 's chief political strategist and Senior Adviser Karl Rove and Kenneth Mehlman , head of the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives , were beginning to coordinate the President 's involvement in the November 7 , 2002 , congressional election .
Their overall goal was to gain Republican majorities in both houses of Congress so that the President would have the greatest possible support for his policies .
Rove had specifically recommended that Republicans " focus on war " as a way to win elections .
Consequently , in the summer of 2002 , BUSH 's efforts to win support for an invasion of Iraq and his efforts to assist Republican congressional candidates became inextricably intertwined .
55 .
In the summer of 2002 , BUSH caused the creation of the White House Iraq Group , which was cochaired by BUSH 's long - term political operatives Karl Rove and Karen Hughes , who remained BUSH 's close associate even though she had resigned her position as Counselor to the President .
This team , also called WHIG , was largely a political and public - relations entity that included RICE , Hadley , President 's Chief of Staff Andrew Card , President 's legislative liaison Nicholas Calio , CHENEY 's key aide and veteran Republican political strategist Mary Matalin , CHENEY 's senior adviser Libby , and James Wilkinson , another Republican campaign consultant .
56 . On or about September 6 , 2002 , Rove and Card publicly announced that : ( a ) the BUSH - CHENEY administration was beginning to " roll out " its case for an invasion of Iraq ; ( b ) its public - relations campaign was specifically directed at forcing Congress to pass a resolution authorizing the President to use military force in Iraq ; ( c ) BUSH wanted the resolution passed in about five weeks , before the 2002 election ; and ( d ) in the end , it would be difficult for any legislator to vote against it .
57 . The Defendants ' Massive Fraud to " Market " an invasion of Iraq .
On or about September 4 , 2002 , BUSH staged a photo opportunity with a bipartisan group of congressional leaders , after which he falsely and fraudulently announced that Iraq posed a serious threat to the safety of the United States and the world , while concealing from Congress and the American people the material facts that : ( a ) he had no reasonable basis whatsoever for his assertion ; ( b ) he had never discussed the legitimacy of the grounds for an attack against Iraq with anyone ; ( c ) he had never extensively reviewed existing intelligence regarding any possible threat from Iraq ; ( d ) he had not requested an updated intelligence assessment on Iraq ; ( e ) the United States intelligence assessment then in effect stated that Iraq had neither nuclear weapons nor a nuclear weapons program ; and ( f ) the IC had consistently reported that Iraq had no involvement in 9/11 and no relationship with al Qaeda .
58 . On September 4 , 2002 , BUSH also falsely and fraudulently claimed he was beginning an " open dialogue " with the American public , with Congress , and with United States allies to decide how to respond to Iraq , while concealing the material facts that he : ( a ) had requested a formal plan to invade Iraq nearly a year before ; ( b ) had been conducting significant military and nonmilitary planning and attacks against Iraq for a year ; ( c ) had directed significant military deployment to areas around Iraq ; ( d ) was planning a massive air assault against Iraq 's air defense facility for the next day ; and ( e ) intended to work with the UN only to create a justification to use military force against Iraq .
59 .
Thereafter , the defendants and WHIG executed a calculated and wide - ranging strategy to deceive Congress and the American people by making hundreds of false and fraudulent representations that were only half - true , or literally true but misleading ; by concealing material facts ; and by making statements without a reasonable basis and with reckless indifference to their truth , regarding , among other things :
( a ) their true intent to invade Iraq ;
( b ) the extent of military buildup and force used against Iraq without notice to or approval by Congress ;
( c ) their true purpose in seeking a Congressional resolution authorizing the use of military force against Iraq ;
( d ) their true intent to use their involvement in seeking a UN resolution requiring Iraq to cooperate with weapons inspectors as a sham ; and
( e ) their claimed justifications for invading Iraq , including but not limited to :
* The alleged connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11 , 2001 ;
* The alleged connection between Iraq and al Qaeda ;
* The alleged connection between Saddam Hussein and any terrorists whose primary animus was directed towards the United States ;
* Saddam Hussein's alleged intent to attack the United States in any way ;
• Saddam Hussein's possession of nuclear weapons and the status of any alleged ongoing nuclear weapons programs ;
* The lack of any reasonable basis for asserting with certainty that Saddam Hussein was actively manufacturing chemical and biological weapons ; and
* The alleged urgency of any threat posed to the United States by Saddam Hussein .
60 . Congressional Joint Resolution to Authorize Use of Force Against Iraq .
As a result of the defendants ' false and fraudulent " marketing " of the President 's plan to invade Iraq , on October 11 , 2002 , the U.S Congress , acting pursuant to its Article I constitutional authority to oversee and authorize use of military force , passed a Congressional Joint Resolution to Authorize Use of Force Against Iraq [ " the Resolution " ] which stated :
The President is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to --
( a ) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq ; and
( b ) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq .
61 . The Resolution required the President to , either before or within 48 hours after exercising the authority to use force , make available to the Senate and the House of Representatives his determination that :
( a ) reliance by the United States on further diplomatic or other peaceful means alone either ( 1 ) will not adequately protect the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq or ( 2 ) is not likely to lead to enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq ; and ( b ) acting pursuant to this resolution is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations , including those nations , organizations or persons who planned , authorized , committed or aided the terrorists attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 .
62 . The Resolution also required the President to , at least every 60 days , present Congress a report on " matters relevant to this joint resolution . "
63 .
In furtherance of the above - described conspiracy , the defendants and their coconspirators committed and caused to be committed the following overt acts :
Overt Acts
A. On December 9 , 2001 , CHENEY announced on NBC's Meet the Press that " it was pretty well confirmed " that lead 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta had met the head of Iraqi intelligence in Prague in April 2001 , which statement was , as CHENEY well knew , made without reasonable basis and with reckless disregard for the truth , because it was based on a single witness 's uncorroborated allegation that had not been fully investigated by U.S. intelligence agencies .
B. On July 15 , 2002 , POWELL stated on Ted Koppel 's Nightline : " What we have consistently said is that the President has no plan on his desk to invade Iraq at the moment , nor has one been presented to him , nor have his advisors come together to put a plan to him , " which statement was deliberately false and misleading in that it deceitfully implied the President was not planning an invasion of Iraq when , as POWELL well knew , the President was close to finalizing detailed military plans for such an invasion that he had ordered months previously .
C. On August 26 , 2002 , CHENEY made numerous false and fraudulent statements including : " Simply stated there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction .
There is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends , against our allies , and against us , " when , as CHENEY well knew , this statement was made without reasonable basis and with reckless indifference to the truth in that the IC's then prevailing assessment was that Iraq had neither nuclear weapons nor a reconstituted nuclear weapons program .
D. On September 7 , 2002 , appearing publicly with Blair , BUSH claimed a recent IAEA report stated that Iraq was " six months away from developing a [ nuclear ] weapon " and " I do n't know what more evidence we need , " which statements were made without basis and with reckless indifference to the truth in that : ( 1 ) the IAEA had not even been present in Iraq since 1998 ; and ( 2 ) the report the IAEA did write in 1998 had concluded there was no indication that Iraq had the physical capacity to produce weapons - usable nuclear material or that it had attempted to obtain such material .
E. On September 8 , 2002 , on Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer , RICE asserted that Saddam Hussein was acquiring aluminum tubes that were " only suited " for nuclear centrifuge use , which statement was deliberately false and fraudulent , and made with reckless indifference to the truth in that it omitted to state the following material facts : ( 1 ) the U.S. intelligence community was deeply divided about the likely use of the tubes ; ( 2 ) there were at least fifteen intelligence reports written since April 2001 that cast doubt on the tubes ' possible nuclear - related use ; and ( 3 ) the U.S. Department of Energy nuclear weapons experts had concluded , after analyzing the tubes 's specifications and the circumstances of the Iraqis ' attempts to procure them , that the aluminum tubes were not well suited for nuclear centrifuge use and were more likely intended for artillery rocket production .
F. On September 8 , 2002 , RUMSFELD stated on Face the Nation : " Imagine a September 11th , with weapons of mass destruction .
It 's not three thousand , it 's tens of thousands of innocent men , women and children , " which statement was deliberately fraudulent and misleading in that it implied without reasonable basis and in direct contradiction to then prevailing intelligence that Saddam Hussein had no operational relationship with al Qaeda and was unlikely to provide weapons to terrorists .
G. On September 19 , 2002 , RUMSFELD told the Senate Armed Services Committee that " no terrorist state poses a greater or more immediate threat to the security of our people than the regime of Saddam Hussein , " which statement was , as Rumsfeld well knew , made without reasonable basis and with reckless indifference to the truth in that : ( 1 ) Hussein had not acted aggressively toward the United States since his alleged attempt to assassinate President George H. W. Bush in 1993 ; ( 2 ) Iraq 's military forces and equipment were severely debilitated because of UN sanctions imposed after the 1991 Gulf War ; ( 3 ) the IC 's opinion was that Iraq 's sponsorship of terrorists was limited to ones whose hostility was directed toward Israel ; and ( 4 ) Iran , not Iraq , was the most active state sponsor of terrorism .
H. On October 1 , 2002 , the defendants caused the IC 's updated classified National Intelligence Estimate to be delivered to Congress just hours before the beginning of debate on the Authorization to Use Military Force .
At the same time , the defendants caused an unclassified " White Paper " to be published which was false and misleading in many respects in that it failed to include qualifying language and dissents that substantially weakened their argument that Iraq posed a serious threat to the United States .
I. On October 7 , 2002 , in Cincinnati , Ohio , BUSH made numerous deliberately misleading statements to the nation , including stating that in comparison to Iran and North Korea , Iraq posed a uniquely serious threat , which statement BUSH well knew was false and fraudulent in that it omitted to state the material fact that a State Department representative had been informed just three days previously that North Korea had actually already produced nuclear weapons .
The defendants continued to conceal this information until after Congress passed the Authorization to Use Military Force against Iraq .
J. Between September 1 , 2002 , and November 2 , 2002 , BUSH traveled the country making in excess of thirty congressional - campaign speeches in which he falsely and fraudulently asserted that Iraq was a " serious threat " which required immediate action , when as he well knew , this assertion was made without reasonable basis and with reckless indifference to the truth .
K. In his January 28 , 2003 State of the Union address , BUSH announced that the " British have recently learned that Iraq was seeking significant quantities of uranium from Africa " which statement was fraudulent and misleading and made with reckless disregard for the truth , in that it falsely implied that the information was true , when the CIA had advised the administration more than once that the allegation was unsupported by available intelligence .
L. In a February 5 , 2003 , speech to the UN , POWELL falsely implied , without reasonable basis and with reckless disregard for the truth , that , among other things : ( 1 ) those who maintained that Iraq was purchasing aluminum tubes for rockets were allied with Saddam Hussein , even though POWELL well knew that both Department of Energy nuclear weapons experts and State Department intelligence analysts had concluded that the tubes were not suited for nuclear centrifuge use ; and ( 2 ) Iraq had an ongoing cooperative relationship with al Qaeda , when he well knew that no intelligence agency had reached that conclusion .
M. On March 18 , 2003 , BUSH sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate which asserted that further reliance on diplomatic and peaceful means alone would not either : ( 1 ) adequately protect United States national security against the " continuing threat posed by Iraq " or ( 2 ) likely lead to enforcement of all relevant UN Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq , which statement was made without reasonable basis and with reckless indifference to the truth in that , as BUSH well knew , the U.S. intelligence community had never reported that Iraq posed an urgent threat to the United States and there was no evidence whatsoever to prove that Iraq had either the means or intent to attack the U.S. directly or indirectly .
The statement was also false because , as BUSH well knew , the UN weapons inspectors had not found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and wanted to continue the inspection process because it was working well .
N. In the same March 18 , 2003 letter , BUSH also represented that taking action pursuant to the Resolution was " consistent with continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations , including those nations , organizations or persons who planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorists attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 , " which statement was entirely false and without reasonable basis in that , as BUSH well knew , Iraq had no involvement with al Qaeda or the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
All in violation of Title 18 , United States Code , Section 371 .

If you 're in the possession of a NYC taxi medallion , you 're sitting on a goldmine .
A retiring Pakistani driver who'd been driving a cab in New York for the last 25 years sold his medallion Wednesday for a staggering $ 600,000 -- an all - time record for such a sale .
The medallion , which gives cab drivers the right to operate legally in the city , cost $ 30,000 when it was purchased in 1981 .
The new owner is a taxi fleet operator who already owns somewhere around 100 medallions .
Prices have been steadily rising in recent years , and at the last city - held auction , medallions fetched upwards of $ 500 K .
Experts feel that the city could bring values down to a more realistic level -- around $ 300,000 -- if they added 5000 new ones to the pool .
Until that happens ( if it happens at all ) , expect to see more astronomical sale values as medallions change hands .
There 's a limited number of the things out there , and right now , the demand appears to be off the charts .
At this rate , it 's probably just a matter of time before we see a reality show about this .

A group of senior doctors and scientists has stepped up its campaign to stop homeopathic treatment being funded on the NHS .
In a letter to primary health care trusts , the seven argue that the evidence for a benefit from the complementary therapy " is equivocal at best , despite many years of research and hundreds of studies " .
The letter comes exactly a year after a similar one from a larger group of scientists , including a Nobel prizewinner and six fellows of the Royal Society .
Since then , several PCTs have taken their advice , prompting hospitals such as the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital - which provides a range of alternative treatments - to warn that they may be forced to close because of lack of NHS business .
In April , Peter Fisher , personal homeopath to the Queen and clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital , wrote an open letter to the monarch , its patron , asking for her support to save the hospital .
The Queen reportedly takes 60 vials of homeopathic remedies with her when she goes abroad in case she falls ill .
One signatory of the latest letter criticised Prince Charles ' defence of alternative medicine following the first letter .
" It has been wholly inappropriate because it is not his role as Prince of Wales to mingle in health politics , " said Edzard Ernst , who is professor of complementary medicine at the Peninsula Medical School in Exeter .
Another signatory , David Colquhoun , professor of pharmacology at University College London , called homeopathy " crack - pot medicine " .
The lead author of the letter , Gustav Born , emeritus professor of pharmacology at Kings College London said : " There are still trusts that continue to use these unproven remedies ...
That is why we have written again to all the PCTs urging them to follow the commissioning example set by others . "
David Fish , medical director at the University of London Hospital trust , which includes the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital , said there was a strong demand from patients for alternative treatments .
But Hillingdon PCT , which had been spending around £ 60,000 annually on homeopathy , decided to stop funding the therapy around two years ago .
Hammersmith and Fulham PCT and Westminster PCT , which between them spent more than £ 300,000 on homeopathy treatment last year , also plan to cease the treatment .
However , the scientists behind the campaign insist it is about more than money .
" While it may be tempting to dismiss homeopathy expenditure as relatively small across the NHS , we must consider the cultural and social damage of maintaining as a matter of principle expenditure on practices which are unsupported by evidence , " they wrote .
Music appears to have a profound effect on the brain
Canadian scientists compared children aged four to six who took music lessons for a year with those who did not .
They found the musical group performed better on a memory test also designed to assess general intelligence skills such as literacy and maths ability .
The study , by McMaster University , is published online by the journal Brain .
It is clear that music is good for children 's cognitive development
Dr Takako Fujioka
The researchers also measured changes in the children 's brain responses to sounds during the year .
They found changes developed in the musical group in as little as four months .
Previous studies have shown that older children given music lessons recorded greater improvements in IQ scores than children given drama lessons .
But lead researcher Professor Laurel Trainor said : " This is the first study to show that brain responses in young , musically trained and untrained children change differently over the course of a year . "
Brain measurements
The researchers focused on 12 children , six of whom attended a Suzuki music school , using a Japanese approach which encourages children to listen to and imitate music before they attempt to read it .
The other six had no music lessons outside school .
They measured brain activity using a technique called magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) while the children listened to two types of sounds : a violin tone and a white noise burst .
All the children recorded larger responses when listening to the violin tones compared with the white noise - indicating more brain power was being deployed to process meaningful sounds .
In addition , all children responded more quickly to the sounds over the course of the year of the study - suggesting a greater efficiency of the maturing brain .
However , when the researchers focused on a specific measurement related to attention and sound discrimination , they found a greater change over the year among the Suzuki children .
Professor Trainor said this difference , coupled with the better performance of the Suzuki children in the memory test suggested musical training was having a profound impact .
He said : " It suggests that musical training is having an effect on how the brain gets wired for general cognitive functioning related to memory and attention . "
Dr Takako Fujioka , of the Baycrest 's Rotman Research Institute , also worked on the study .
He said : " It is clear that music is good for children 's cognitive development and that music should be part of the pre-school and primary school curriculum . "
The next phase of the study will look at the benefits of musical training in older adults .

The Lucifer Effect : Understanding How Good People Turn Evil
by Philip Zimbardo
Rider Books £ 18.99 , pp576
On 28 April 2004 , the American news programme 60 Minutes II broadcast photographs taken in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq .
The images , picked up immediately by the world 's media , have since become scorched on our consciousness : naked Iraqi prisoners stacked in a human pyramid , presided over by grinning US soldiers ; a female soldier leading a naked Iraqi around by a leash ; other Iraqis forced to simulate fellatio ; a hooded inmate balanced on a cardboard box , electric wires attached to his fingers .
One of the stunned Americans watching 60 Minutes II back in 2004 was eminent psychologist Professor Philip Zimbardo , in Washington that night on business .
Zimbardo , more than anyone else in the country , had been there before .
In 1971 , as a young psychologist at California 's Stanford University , he had conducted an experiment into the psychology of imprisonment , dividing a group of undergraduate students into ' guards ' and ' prisoners ' .
That August , Zimbardo witnessed levels of cruelty he'd never have predicted or imagined .
Within no time , liberal undergraduates became sadists , tormenting prisoners , even forcing them , in an uncanny premonition of George W Bush 's Iraq 33 years later , to simulate sodomy with one another .
After six days , Zimbardo called a halt to the experiment .
Although the ' guards ' knew the ' prisoners had done nothing criminally wrong to deserve their lowly status ' , he writes in his new book , ' some ... were transformed into perpetrators of evil ' .
The experiment taught him that ' most of us can undergo significant character transformations when we are caught up in the crucible of social forces ' .
It is to answer the question of ' how good people turn evil ' that Zimbardo has written The Lucifer Effect , a formidable piece of research into the nature of evil and the systems and situations that foster it .
Zimbardo , who grew up in poverty in the South Bronx and , as a child , witnessed how a harsh environment can breed cruelty and abuse , has come to some chilling conclusions .
Far from the Abu Ghraib atrocities being the work of a handful of bad apples , or ' rogue soldiers ' , as General Richard B Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , put it , Zimbardo argues that they were the result of an entire ' bad barrel ' , going right to the top .
Zimbardo begins his book with a painful but necessary examination of some of the 20th century 's worst examples of man 's inhumanity to man : the butchery of up to 350,000 Chinese civilians at the hands of the Japanese at Nanking in 1937 ; the ' banality of evil ' as personified by Adolf Eichmann ; the massacre of some 800,000 Rwandans in the 1994 genocide .
Morality , he observes , is like ' a gearshift that at times gets pushed into neutral ' .
The story of Abu Ghraib , the focus of the book , is told with precision , in detail , and with no little narrative skill .
The prison had previously been where Saddam Hussein had arranged for the torture and murder of ' dissidents ' in twice - weekly public executions .
When the Americans occupied it after their overthrow of the Iraqi regime in March 2003 , and began to fill it with Iraqi prisoners , it remained a hellish place .
It was attacked as many as 20 times a week by mortar shelling .
Fear pervaded both prisoners and the US soldiers whose sorry job it was to guard them .
The officer in charge of the prison , Brigadier General Janis Karpinski , the only female commander in the war zone , who had no experience of running any kind of prison , never visited the special interrogation centre where the abuses were carried out .
It was , she later said , a ' special site ' , and so not under her supervision .
After the publication of the photographs , seven guards were charged with ' maltreating detainees ' , among them Ivan ' Chip ' Frederick , at whose trial Zimbardo appeared as an expert witness .
Frederick , then 37 , the son of a West Virginia coal miner , was an archetypal ordinary American Joe : God-fearing , basketball - playing , a disciplined soldier , super - patriotic .
At Abu Ghraib , though , he became ground down and dehumanised .
He worked 12 - hour shifts , from 4 pm to 4 am , seven days a week , 40 days without rest , and slept in a prison cell when off duty .
In his words : ' Shit was backed up in the porta - potties .
There was trash and mould everywhere ... there were human body parts in the facility ... there was a pack of wild dogs running around . '
Prisoners regularly attacked guards ; on one occasion , a gun was smuggled in and a shoot - out with guards followed .
Such an environment , Zimbardo writes , ' was as extreme a setting for creating deindividuation as I can imagine ' .
Cruelty became sexualised : one guard sodomised a male prisoner with a chemical light ; another raped a female detainee .
Bush , grandstanding in typical fashion after the event , vowed that the ' wrongdoers will be brought to justice ' .
But , to date , only the lowly guards have ever been tried , with Frederick , who pleaded guilty , being given eight years .
Human Rights Watch , in a 2005 report , blamed former US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , and the heads of the CIA and the US army , for ' decisions and ... policies that facilitated serious and widespread violations of the law ' .
Zimbardo agrees : ' The seeds for the flowers of evil that blossomed in that dark dungeon of Abu Ghraib were planted by the Bush administration in its triangular framing of national security threats , citizen fear and vulnerability , and interrogation / torture to win the war on terror . '
But , Zimbardo argues , there is no cause for complacency : all of us , given the right circumstances , are capable of monstrous acts .
As Solzhenitsyn writes in The Gulag Archipelago : ' The line between good and evil is in the centre of every human heart . '
GC FAQ -- draft
Text versions ( converted with lynx ) of these files are available , as GC - faq.txt , GC- algorithms.txt , GC- lang.txt , and GC - harder.txt .
There 's been some concern that the emphasis here ought to be a bit more evangelical , and a little less academic ( perhaps that evangelism ought to be added , rather than technical content subtracted ) .
Concise arguments for the wonderfulness of garbage collection are more than welcome , as are pointers to non-concise arguments .
Table of Contents
What is garbage collection ?
Garbage collection is a part of a language 's runtime system , or an add - on library , perhaps assisted by the compiler , the hardware , the OS , or any combination of the three , that automatically determines what memory a program is no longer using , and recycles it for other use .
It is also known as ``automatic storage ( or memory ) reclamation ' ' .
Why is it good ?
Manual memory management is ( programmer - ) time consuming , and error prone .
Most programs still contain leaks .
This is all doubly true with programs using exception - handling and / or threads .
A second benefit of garbage collection , less obvious to people who have n't used it , is that relying on garbage collection to manage memory simplifies the interfaces between components ( subroutines , libraries , modules , classes ) that no longer need expose memory management details ( " who is responsible for recycling this memory " ) .
You can read more at Object - Orientation FAQ -- 3.9 ) Why is Garbage Collection A Good Thing ?
Is garbage collection slow ?
Not necessarily .
Modern garbage collectors appear to run as quickly as manual storage allocators ( malloc / free or new / delete ) .
Garbage collection probably will not run as quickly as customized memory allocator designed for use in a specific program .
On the other hand , the extra code required to make manual memory management work properly ( for example , explicit reference counting ) is often more expensive than a garbage collector would be .
This is more likely to be true in a multithreaded program , if the specialized allocator is a shared resource ( which it usually is ) .
Since this was first written , memory has become so cheap that garbage collectors have been applied to very - large heaps , for example more than a gigabyte .
For a sufficiently large live set , pause times are still an issue .
On the other hand , for very many applications modern garbage collectors provide pause times that are completely compatible with human interaction .
Pause times below 1/10th of a second are often the case , and applications with relatively small live sets ( or slowly changing live sets , for generational collector ) can obtain pause times below 1/100th of a second .
Can I use garbage collection with C or C ++?
Probably .
Modern ( well - tested , efficient , non-pausing ) garbage collectors are available that work with all but the most pathological C and C++ programs , including legacy code .
See GC , C , and C++ for more details .
Does garbage collection cause my program 's execution to pause ?
Not necessarily .
A variety of algorithms allow garbage collection to proceed concurrently , incrementally , and ( for some definitions of the term ) in " real time " .
There are incremental garbage collectors that work with C and C++ , for instance .
Where can I get a C or C++ garbage collector ?

GC is necessarily slower than manual memory management .
GC will necessarily make my program pause .
Manual memory management wo n't cause pauses .
GC is incompatible with C and C ++.
Most allocated objects are dynamically referenced by a very small number of pointers .
The most important small number is ONE .
Most allocated objects have short lifetimes .
Allocation patterns ( size distributions , lifetime distributions ) are bursty , not uniform .
VM behavior matters .
Cache behavior matters .
" Optimal " strategies can fail miserably .
precise vs. conservative
moving / compacting vs. non-moving
explicit vs. implicit reclamation phase
stopping vs. incremental vs. concurrent
generational vs. non-generational
What do you mean , garbage collection and C ?
malloc
free
malloc
free
It is also possible to program in a style where free still reclaims storage , but the garbage collector acts as a backstop , preventing leaks that might otherwise occur .
This style has also been tested with many applications , and it works well .
The advantage here is that where it is easy for the programmer to manage memory , the programmer manages the memory , but where it is not , the garbage collector does the job .
This does n't necessarily run any faster than free - does - nothing , but it may help keep the heap smaller .
How is this possible ?
This does n't sound very portable .
What if I need to port my code and there 's no garbage collector on the target platform ?
Wo n't this leave bugs in my program ?
If a program is developed using garbage collection , and the collector is taken away , then yes , the result may contain bugs in the form of memory leaks .
Similarly , if a program is developed using FP ( or VM ) and that is taken away , that program , too , may contain bugs .
Also in practice , many programs that use malloc and free already leak memory , so use of a garbage collector can actually reduce the number of bugs in a program , and do so much more quickly than if they had to be tracked down and fixed by hand .
This is especially true if the memory leak is inherent in a library that can not be repaired .
Ca n't a devious C programmer break the collector ?
One problem described by a team considering the use of GC is the use of pointer mangling to get " really opaque " pointers .
That is , pointers handed out from a package to a client are XORed with a random number chosen at program start time , and thus the client cannot access package data structures without going through defined interfaces .
This is simply incompatible with conservative GC .
It is also incompatible with a strict interpretation of the Ansi C standard , and can confuse leak detection tools ( which use conservative GC technology to detect leaks ) , but nonetheless people do it , and it generally does work .

What does a garbage collector do about destructors ?
There remains the question of what to do with destructors that do something other than assist in memory management .
There are a couple of typical uses .
One use is for objects that have state outside the program itself .
The canonical example is an object that refers to a file .
When a file object becomes eligible for reclamation , the garbage collector needs to ensure that buffers are flushed , the file is closed , and resources associated with the file are returned to the operating system .
Another use is where a program wants to keep a list of objects that are referenced elsewhere .
The program may want know what objects are in existence for , say , accounting purposes but does not want the mechanism of accounting to prevent objects from otherwise being freed .
There are several ways of handling such situations :
In systems where the garbage collector is " built in , " it typically has special knowledge of all the cases where outside resources can be referenced and can deal with them appropriately .
Many GC systems have a notion of a " weak pointer . "
A weak pointer is one that is not considered as a reference by the garbage collector .
So if an object is referenced only by weak pointers , it is eligible for reclamation .
Weak pointers can be used to implement the object list example .
For another example , in Java an external resource R might by protected like this : class ClientR { CRWeak wr ; // delegate all methods to wr ; ClientR ( ) { wr = new CRWeak ( this ) ; } } class CRWeak extends WeakReference { static ReferenceQueue rq = new ReferenceQueue ( ) ; static { Thread th = new CRCleaner ( rq ) ; th.setDaemon( true ) ; th.start ( ) ; } CRWeak( Object x ) { super( x , rq ) ; } ExternalResource r ; // delegated methods from ClientR } class CRCleaner extends Thread { ReferenceQueue rq ; CRCleaner ( ReferenceQueue rq ) { this .rq = rq ; } public void run ( ) { while ( true ) { CRWeak x = ( CRWeak ) rq.remove ( ) ; // Release x.r } } }
When no clients have references to a ClientR , its memory is released , and the weak reference to it is placed on the respective reference queue .
The cleaning thread can ensure that the external resource is reclaimed .
Many GC systems have a notion of " finalization . "
An object may be registered with the GC system so that when it is about to reclaim the object , it runs a function on the object that can perform necessary cleanups .
Finalization is tricky .
Some of the issues are :
When can an object actually be finalized ?
This is trickier than it first appears in the presence of some normally - desirable optimizing transformations .
In what thread , resource , or security context does a finalization function run ?
What happens when registered objects reference each other ?
What happens if a finalization function makes an object not be garbage any more ?

Serbian vampire hunters have acted to prevent the very remote possibility that former dictator Slobodan Milosevic might stage a come - back - by driving a three - foot stake through his heart .
According to Ananova , the politically - motivated Van Helsings , led by Miroslav Milosevic ( no relation ) , gave themselves up to cops after attacking the deceased despot in his grave in the eastern town of Pozarevac .
Milosevic popped his clogs back in 2006 , while on trial in a UN war crimes tribunal for various unsavoury activities connected with the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia .
Miroslav Milosevic said " he and his fellow vampire hunters acted to stop the former dictator returning from the dead to haunt the country " .
His team explained that the wooden stake had been " driven into the ground and through the late president 's heart " .
Slobodan Milosevic 's Socialist Party of Serbia naturally condemned the desecration , while his daughter - in - law Milica Gajic said she " planned to sue the vampire hunters and accused the police of failing to protect the grave properly " . ®

Tackling climate change need not cost the Earth , the IPCC says
Boosting renewable energy , reducing deforestation and improving energy efficiency can all help , they said .
This is the third report this year from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , and aims to set out the costs and benefits of various policies .
IPCC chair Rajendra Pachauri said the report was " stunning " .
If we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble

The report suggests that if major climate impacts are to be avoided , global emissions should peak and begin declining within one or two decades .
The IPCC has already this year produced the two other elements of this global assessment report - its fourth since 1990 - dealing respectively with the science of climate change and the potential impacts .
Continued growth
Greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 70 % since 1970 , and will rise by between 25 % and 90 % over the next 25 years under " business as usual " .
That rise will mainly be caused by an expansion in the use of fossil fuels , which are set to continue as the world 's dominant energy source .
" If we continue to do what we are doing now , we are in deep trouble , " observed Ogunlade Davidson , a senior author on the report .
During the early part of the week , China had repeatedly tried to tone down some elements of the draft text , delegates said , being keen to remove references to scenarios which it feared could affect its short - term economic growth .
But in later sessions it played a more consensual hand .
Stable futures
The report assesses the likely costs to the global economy of stabilising greenhouse gases at various concentrations in the atmosphere .
Stabilisation at reasonable cost is possible , it concludes , commenting : " There is considerable economic potential for the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades , that could offset the projected growth of global emissions or reduce emissions below current levels . "
The sharpest cuts , keeping greenhouse gas concentrations to levels equivalent to between 445 and 535 parts per million of carbon dioxide , might cost anything up to 3 % of global GDP by 2030 , while milder curbs could even enhance growth .
COSTS OF STABILISATION IPCC assesses the likely impacts on global GDP by 2030 if cost - effective routes are used Stabilisation between 445 ppm and 535 ppm would cost less than 3 % of global GDP , it concludes Between 535 ppm and 590 ppm would cost 0.2 - 2.5 %
Between 590 ppm and 710 ppm would bring anything between a net benefit of 0.6 % and a net cost of 1.2 % Different greenhouse gases have different impacts on warming per volume ; total concentrations are expressed as the equivalent in parts per million of a certain volume of CO2 ( ppm CO2 - eq ) Current concentration is about 425 ppm CO2 - eq
Assessing the impacts of a given concentration is not an exact science , but many researchers believe that keeping concentrations below about 450 ppm CO2 - eq is necessary if the average global temperature rise is to be kept below 2C , and major impacts avoided .
The IPCC suggests that concentrations between 445 ppm and 490 ppm would keep the temperature rise to 2.0 - 2.8C .
European Union policy is to avoid a rise greater than 2C .
" If you want to stabilise around 450 ppm , that means in a decade or two you have to start reducing emissions far below the current level , " said Dr Pachauri .
" So in other words , we have a very short window for turning around the trend we have in rising greenhouse gas emissions .
We do n't have the luxury of time .
Building concensus
Renewable energy generally has a positive impact on energy security , employment and air quality
IPCC report
In quotes : Reaction to report
Many technologies can play a role in cutting emissions , the IPCC says ; but it singles out the building sector as a potential major contributor , and energy efficiency as something that " plays a key role across many scenarios for most regions and timescales " .
Nuclear power and carbon capture and storage , where emissions from fossil fuel power stations are captured and buried underground , could play important roles ; but with nuclear , " safety , weapons , proliferation and waste remain as constraints " .
But , observed Dr Pachauri , economic incentives are needed to drive any technological transformation .
" Technology alone will not be enough , " he told BBC News , " and in any case , technology has a clear connection with government policy .
" Incentives ... must come from taxes or a carbon price . "
Catherine Pearce , international climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth UK , said there was now no economic excuse for inaction .

" By introducing measures and investment that will stimulate sustainable renewable energies and energy efficiency , governments can help to achieve cuts in global emissions by 50 % by 2050 .
Without this , we face devastating consequences . "
The next edition of the Guinness Book of World Records will list Indonesia as the country with the fastest rate of forest destruction on the planet .
The environmental group Greenpeace says Indonesia is destroying an area of forest equivalent to 300 football pitches every hour .
It has already lost 72 percent of its large intact ancient forests and half of what remains is threatened .
Guinness World Records , considered a global authority on record - breaking achievements , has confirmed to Greenpeace that this unfortunate record will feature in its 2008 record book to be published in September this year .
It will read : “ Of the 44 countries which collectively account for 90 percent of the world ’s forests , the country which pursues the world ’s highest annual rate of deforestation is Indonesia with 1.8 million ha ( 4,447,896 acres ) per year between 2000 - 2005 – a rate of 2 per cent annually or 51 square km ( 20 square miles ) every day . ”
The record breaker was announced as the international community are considering reduced or avoided deforestation to mitigate climate change at the Third working group meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change taking place in Bangkok .
Up to 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from tropical forest clearance .
Indonesia ’s forests cover over 120 million hectares but the forestry sector is plagued by lawlessness , corruption and forest plunder , which the Indonesian Government is failing to control .
International demand for timber and paper , as well as commodities such as palm oil , is driving this destruction .
Greenpeace is calling on the Indonesian Government to stem the tide of forest destruction and to reduce its contribution to climate change by imposing a moratorium on commercial logging operations in its rainforests .
Greenpeace also says that countries must ban the import of forest products that come from illegal or destructive sources .
Opinion Legalize Neighbourhoods Again !
Traditional city development is now illegal across most of North America .

Have you ever found yourself driving down a wide suburban street looking at the pole signs and parking lots and thinking , " Surely we can do better than this ? "
Have you ever wanted to walk out into the middle of a six - lane , medianized , signalized , double left - turn arterial street , wave your arms in the air and say , " Hey !
We 're doing this all wrong !
This is not how you make a city ! "
Well , of course you have n't , because you 'd get run over .
Six - lane roadways are for cars , not for people , everybody knows that .
Which is exactly the problem .
Since about the end of World War II , the United States has remade itself from a nation of people into a nation of automobiles .
Do n't believe me ?
Look around you .
Unless you live in central Boston , New York , San Francisco or Chicago , chances are you spend most of your waking hours driving - not walking - around a city that did n't exist fifty years ago - a city made for cars .
Interstate highways and incredibly wide arterial streets lead you to office " parks " that are not parks , " garden apartments " where there are no gardens , shopping malls , schools located on vast acreage , and residential " neighbourhoods " consisting of nothing but singlefamily homes on curving dead - end streets .
These are not neighbourhoods - they are not even a good imitation of a neighbourhood , the way some suburban office buildings are a good imitation of commercial architecture .
They are highly segregated communities where the only tie that binds one neighbor to another is the confidence that all our houses are approximately the same price .
Is this where you live , or where you aspire to live ?
Some call it the American Dream .
I call it a nightmare .
This sprawling , suburban , car - comfort lifestyle is not how we were meant to live .
This manifesto will sketch a brief picture of life before car culture took over , how things got the way they are , why this is not a good thing , and how to get back to a more civilized pattern of living .
Life Before Car Culture
I was not born before World War II , but often find myself wishing I was , particularly when I look at old black and white photos of downtown Kansas City in the era before the shopping malls emptied it of retailers .
I actually have memories of pre-car life , when our family owned just one automobile , so my mother would sometimes take my brother and me on the bus to shop downtown .
What a wonder the city was , so full of interesting ( and odd ) people , the proverbial hustle and bustle of workers , shoppers and beggars creating a rich stew of humanity that is still visible today in a handful of urban centres .
For most people , however , this city exists only in memory , preserved as a black and white film , like downtown Bedford Falls in " It 's a Wonderful Life . "
What made the city work , then , was its density .
Prior to the dominance of the private automobile , cities were dense because they had to be - people either walked where they were going , or , in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , took public transit .
This resulted in business districts and neighbourhoods with narrow lots , tall , slender buildings , and many different uses in close proximity .
The corner grocery store made perfect sense because most people carried groceries home from it on foot .
No one stopped to consider whether density was good or bad - it just was .
It was how you made cities , because the alternative , non-density , was inconceivable .
Then as now , no one wanted to walk six or ten miles to work .
Since no one had cars , people made the obvious choice : to live closer together to reduce distances .
The result of these obvious and natural decisions was the obvious and natural city : still in evidence many places in Europe , relatively rare nowadays in the United States .
Such a city had a very dense urban core , filled with high rise buildings ( the definition of high - rise varying a good bit depending on whether you were in Chicago or Peoria ) , surrounded by close - packed neighbourhoods of apartments , shops and single - family homes jammed onto narrow lots in a grid of streets radiating out from the commercial core .
Oh , and yes , the very rich often owned a " country home " that was several miles outside of town ( more about this later ) .
If you 're holding this picture in your mind 's eye - a dense urban scene with shops and apartments and skinny houses crowded together on narrow streets filled with streetcars and yes , automobiles , plus wide sidewalks where mothers and workers jostle with vendors and layabouts , consider that this scene , for better or worse , is now illegal in almost every municipality in the United States .
This is true despite the fact that people pay large sums of money to visit such places , e.g. , Newport , Rhode Island ; Seaside , Florida ; San Francisco and Boston ( not to mention any number of cities in Europe ) .
If you stop and think about it , nearly everything about that prototypical city scene has changed dramatically in the past 50 years :
The urban core is decayed with surface parking lots , its immediately surrounding neighbourhoods are degraded and largely abandoned , the street grid has been decimated by limited - access roadways , and narrow lots have given way to the wide expanses necessary to fit " ranch houses " ( sans ranch , of course ) , strip malls and McDonald 's restaurants .
What precipitated this fundamental change in the way we make cities ?
Automotive Advent
The short answer : the widespread use of private automobiles .
Henry Ford 's development of the Model T as a car for everyman had the eventual effect of convincing families that they were n't even in the middle class if they were n't in possession of an automobile .
With the widespread adoption of private cars as a primary means of transportation , beginning before World War II but skyrocketing after it , our cities had to be remade to fit the new paradigm .
And they were .
Were they ever .
Although suburbs were spawned , ironically enough , by streetcars that could move large quantities of people out of the city rapidly , they did n't see explosive growth until automobile ownership reached the tipping point , in the boom that started shortly after World War II .
The advent of widespread car ownership made the rural retreats of the very rich , an idea that can be traced at least as far back as the Italian Renaissance , into the model for all development .
But since not all automobile owners were ( or are ) super - rich , the patrician villa was downsized and plopped into a suburban lot that is bigger than it needs to be to keep you from smelling the neighbors ' cooking , but far too small to be a real " estate , " though that is what they are often called .
( Note that the language of real estate development evokes the imagery , if not the reality , of the rural retreat : " Bradford Downs . " " Patrician Woods . " " Carriage Crossing . " " Exclusive Estates . " )
The romantic notion of suburban tract home as a rural retreat for the masses still captures the imagination of young families looking to build a nest for their offspring .
Unfortunately , this neither - urban - nor - rural prototype , the suburban home on a larger - than necessary lot , has become the preferred housing type of recent generations .
Though they give an occasional nod to " loft living " or " cluster homes , " week after week the housing supplement to your weekend newspaper features the latest so - called " community " of single family detached houses whose features invariably include large attached garages , curving cul - de- sacs , lush landscaping ( well , at least for the model ! ) , and perhaps a pool for the exclusive use of the subdivision 's residents .
All designed to be approached , seen and experienced from the seat of a private automobile .
It is the automobile that has , pardon the expression , driven the development of cities for the past fifty years .
First as an escape from the supposed degradation of the centre city , and later as an exploder of distances , the car has remade America 's human habitat from the ground up .
What happened ?
Roadway Redo
Skyrocketing automobile ownership necessitated massive road - building .
America 's roadways had to be rebuilt , starting with the relatively quaint ideas like Route 66 in the 1930s , but rapidly expanding to the more insidious idea of interstate freeways in the 1950s .
Now an interstate highway is not a pernicious thing in itself - it 's actually a good way to get from Kansas City to Denver without using an airplane - but interstate highways were superimposed onto existing cities without the slightest regard for how the city itself would react .
Interstate highways cut off neighbourhoods from the central business district and from each other , created shadowy realms of overly broad rights - of - way that became , in the city , literally no man 's land , and flung traffic ( and people ) away from the central city like a centrifuge .
Traffic planning became a profession in its own right after the war , one populated by well intentioned engineers who believed the problem they were trying to solve was how to get the most cars to the most places at the highest velocity safely possible .
When you define the problem in those terms , the state of our city streets today seems inevitable : more and wider traffic lanes , broader curves , more turn lanes and , whenever possible , ramps and overpasses instead of intersections .
Unfortunately , defining the problem this way did not take into consideration what such traffic planning would do to neighbourhoods , to the centre city , and most particularly to pedestrians , who seem to have been entirely forgotten in the rush to speed traffic out of the city .
Anyone who has ever attempted to cross a modern suburban intersection with multiple turn lanes and absurdly large curves knows that it is a daunting challenge to the able - bodied and a near impossibility for the young , the old and the disabled .
Overpasses destroy the ground plane , an amazingly simple concept that in public , people , buildings and cars generally should exist at grade level .
Simple as that concept is , it gets violated again and again in efforts to get more cars more places faster than ever .
Retail Migration
Soon came the realization that if everyone had a car , downtown might not be the most convenient place to go shopping , since the streets were already crowded and parking was scarce .
Kansas City 's own J.C. Nichols pioneered the suburban shopping centre when he created the Country Club Plaza in what was then a swampy wasteland in the 1920s , but like the road building boom , shopping centres did n't really take off until after the war .
Once shoppers ( and developers ) realized that an alternative to downtown shopping existed , the race was on to evacuate retailers from the centre city .
In many cities , like my hometown , downtown retail is today either an oxymoron or a sad reminder of what once was .
Not long after the retail exodus began , business owners began to realize that they did n't have to be downtown either , since most of their employees now had their own cars .
This realization , coupled with the fact that the upper - middle class of managers and owners had already decamped to the suburbs , began the exodus of office workers from the centre city , following on the heels of the shoppers and the merchants .
Today , many central " business " districts are a sad mix of government workers , lawyers and creative professionals who still feel the need to mix it up with each other on the city streets - not that there are many people to mix it up with any more .
Better Living Through Restrictive Zoning
As traffic engineers were making our cities more car - friendly , the city planning department was busy cooking up something much worse : single - use zoning .
Born out of the perfectly reasonable desire to legislate against slum developments that crowded dozens of families into tiny flats in overscaled walk - up tenements , zoning laws morphed over the decades from a public health necessity into a land development control mechanism .
The change in zoning from outlawing slums to planning suburbs took city planning out of the marketplace and into the realm of professionals .
While this may have sounded like a good idea , the result was not good .
Planners became enamored with the idea of regulating " land use , " a term that would have been meaningless to a 19th century citizen .
Regulating land use meant planners and politicians should decide what could go where , based not on historical patterns of development , but rather on the latest trends in planning ( or , more cynically , on political patronage ) .
As a practical matter , it meant reserving some tracts for specific types of housing and others for commercial or industrial uses , distinctions that had never before existed in America .
The result of land use planning was the single - use zoning codes in place in virtually every city in America that make neighbourhoods illegal today .
Under single - use zoning , it is illegal for a bar to be next to an apartment building next to a post office .
It is illegal , in some single - family residential zones , to build schools or churches .
It is illegal for retail shops not to have four parking spaces per thousand square feet of store , a formula that automatically guarantees a parking lot larger than the shop itself .
And it is illegal , under single - use zoning , to build a grocery store on the corner with a few apartments above it - this relatively simple building type is labeled a " mixed use " that confounds the simplistic formulae of the zoning ordinance .
To make matters worse , single - use zoning became particular in the extreme .
Ordinances in some cities not only designate specific zones where " retail " is legal , they then proceed to spell out which retail uses are permitted ( e.g. , candy stores ) and which are not ( e.g. , dry cleaning establishments ) .
This kind of inductive zoning law proscribes any use that is not specifically permitted , a bizarre inversion of the Constitution 's own limitations on the power of the State .
Zoning has also brought us the ubiquitous setback , the invention of which has proven to be a setback indeed for urban life .
Though intended to improve the health and beauty of our cities by creating " green space " and openness , in reality building setbacks contribute to sprawl , destroy the public realm - the notion of a street as a public outdoor room - and create greater distances between buildings , encouraging ( or forcing ) people to drive instead of walk .
Setbacks are yet another illustration of zoning as a good idea that has gone horribly wrong in its current dispensation .
Learning to Love Suburbia
The objection might be raised that people tend not to complain much about the generally suburban shape of the modern city .
I would respond that first , they tend not to think about the city much at all .
Pole signs and parking lots seem as inevitable as air and water if they 're all you know .
And the better suburbs require massive amounts of decorative landscaping , a pleasant enough idea that tends to obscure the fact that you 're in an environment that is utterly inhospitable to people , especially people on foot or on bicycles .
Proponents of suburbia point out that the single family home on a large lot ( dubbed " McMansions " by some wags ) still defines the American dream .
If private homes in private yards with two - ( or three - , or four - ) car garages are what immigrants aspire to , what could be wrong with this picture ?
Plenty , as it turns out .
Suburban sprawl development may typify the American dream , but it is a dream as illusory as winning the lottery .
Suburbia as a utopia is highly overrated .
A brief listing of ways in which suburbia , brought to you by single - use zoning , fails as a pattern of human settlement would need to take into account the following observations :
It discriminates against any level of income that is not the equal of every other income level in a subdivision .
It alienates the home from the workplace , resulting in long commutes , pollution , and traffic accidents .
By moving community functions far away from each other , it makes children and seniors entirely dependent on rubber - tired transportation - and on others to drive it .
Its wormy pattern of dead - end streets that characterizes the modern subdivision makes it impossible for children to walk or bike anywhere ( except a neighbor 's house ) safely .
Its characteristic lack of sidewalks typifies suburban contempt for the pedestrian .
Its low scale of development ( mostly one story , sometimes two , rarely three ) creates a boring , sprawling landscape without interest or human scale .
Its abandonment of the urban grid concentrates traffic on arterial and collector streets , worsening traffic congestion instead of relieving it .
It lacks any concept of public space ( except perhaps parks ) , and relegates the functions of the town square to a privatized shopping mall where basic rights of free speech and free assembly are sharply curtailed .
And so on .
Clearly , if you were trying to design a neighbourhood that worked for all citizens instead of just for owners of automobiles , the modern American suburb is not the first thing that would come to mind .
Or perhaps even the last .
Anatomy Of a Neighbourhood
Supposing that you could once again legalize neighbourhoods , what would they look like ?
Would they be starkly urban or as comforting as a Thomas Kincaide painting ?
Would cars be prohibited altogether ?
Would you be allowed to have a yard ?
Yes , yes , no , and yes .
There is no one right way to design a neighbourhood , but at the onset of the 21st century , cities have all but settled on the single most completely wrong way .
Though it can vary in a myriad of ways , a good neighbourhood is almost always a complete negation of the contemporary suburban development pattern .
The one way in which the two are alike is that both should have good public schools .
To be a healthier , more effective human environment , neighbourhoods need to have the following qualities :
DENSITY : Expressly prohibited by most zoning ordinances , neighbourhoods need at least ten dwelling units per acre , even more in the case of urban neighbourhoods .
This is not especially high density ( at least not by San Francisco standards ) , but this ratio precludes a development consisting solely of single family homes on large lots with large setbacks .
What it by necessity includes is a mix of housing types from apartments to duplexes to flats to townhouses to even a few stand - alone houses - on smaller lots , without giant garage saddlebags .
ACTIVITY : Good neighbourhoods are active neighbourhoods .
People are present on the streets and sidewalks at almost any hour of the day or night .
Cars and bicycles share the road in a dance of reasonable accommodation .
Mothers push strollers , kids play on the front porch , and strange vehicles or persons are taken note of .
DIVERSITY : Diversity includes not just the obvious mix of ethnicities and cultures , but also diverse levels of age and income .
People should not have to move out of their own neighbourhood as they reach different stages of life .
The name for this idea is aging in place .
It presumes enough diversity of housing types that as singles transition to couples , families , empty nesters and retirees , there is a housing type available in the neighbourhood to fit .
In the same way , diversity assumes the existence of many income levels : hourly workers living in dignified dwellings proximate to the managerial class .
This does not mean that everyone 's house is the same size .
On the contrary , it means a mix of home sizes and types that accommodates a mix of incomes .
The holy grail of political correctness , diversity is easier to achieve in the workplace than in a neighbourhood , but urban neighbourhoods are where diversity has its best shot .
AMBIGUITY : One of the pernicious qualities of single - use zoning is how boring it makes a city .
You zone for car dealers , you get - guess what ?
Car dealers .
Retail zones get filled with one - story strip malls - and nothing else .
Ditto for R - 1 Residential .
Rich and rewarding urban neighbourhoods have the opposite quality - you never know what might be around the next corner .
A small grocery or a small bar ?
A hair salon or a funeral home ?
Maybe even a car dealer - hey , it 's been done .
One car dealer wo n't kill a neighbourhood .
A mile - long strip of nothing but car dealers will .
VITALITY : Everybody wants to live in a vital neighbourhood , but what makes a neighbourhood vital ?
My definition revolves around the presence of retail stores .
Especially small retailers as opposed to megastores like Best Buy and Home Depot .
A vital neighbourhood would include enough retail shops to provide for neighbors ' basic needs ( food , clothes , hardware , soft goods ) , with enough variety to animate the principal streets during both the day and the evening hours .
Life on the street is not just for the homeless - it's for everybody - including the homeless .
And yes , vitality includes cars .
Vitality is not the absence of cars , it is the presence of pedestrians to tame the wild automotive beast .
Parallel or angled on - street parking can provide a wonderful metallic safety zone between pedestrians and traffic .
FLEXIBILITY : Real neighbourhoods change over time .
Real neighbourhoods have the flexibility to allow for change to happen in an orderly way .
But change is not wipe - the - slate - clean urban renewal .
Change is incremental , gradual , and accretive .
But just as historic districts try ( in vain ) to freeze a neighbourhood in a particular time period , zoning laws try to freeze areas with respect to the " highest and best " use of land and buildings .
This is unnatural and unfair , and it warps the natural evolution of real neighbourhoods .
Without zoning , neighbourhoods could evolve naturally through cycles of development and redevelopment , growth , decline and renewal .
PUBLIC SPACE : One of the most important qualities of real neighbourhoods is the presence of public space .
Public space can be as simple as a street that respects the quality of civic life , or as elaborate as Central Park .
But it must be public , that is , open to anyone .
And it must be a real space , intentional and designed , not a leftover " open space " pushed to the margin of some gigantic parking lot .
Where To , Mac ?
It bears repeating that the neighbourhood just described is illegal in most municipalities .
Too dense , unacceptably diverse in housing types and building uses , built too close to streets which do not meet current ( i.e. ridiculously high - velocity ) traffic safety standards , this neighbourhood cannot be built under planning and zoning ordinances in place in most U.S. cities .
( To be fair , many cities have a Central Business District zone that allows dense development and does n't require setbacks , but this zone usually only covers the current downtown , and often prohibits residential or mixed uses ) .
What to do ?
Legalize neighbourhoods again !
Let 's change the laws - zoning laws in particular .
My first inclination is to take all the zoning ordinances 1 and burn them .
Like the tax code ( manifesto , anyone ? ) , zoning codes have become carbuncled with amendments and interpretations that render most of them unintelligible , with the result that they mean , like the Queen of Hearts would say , " whatever I want them to mean , " the Queen in this case usually being the local planning commission .
Moreover , we have seen that zoning ordinances are based on a flawed concept : that land uses should be categorized and mapped and regulated like groups of books in a library .
What 's good for a library is not necessarily good for a city .
Do zoning laws have any legitimate uses ?
Maybe a couple .
Communities might find it useful to relegate certain activities , say , airports , adult entertainment or rendering plants , to the edge of town .
Having said that , most zoning ordinances go way overboard , regulating everything from the height of letters on your sign to the color of your awnings to the number of shrubs you must plant per parking space in your ( grossly oversized ) parking lot .
It would be difficult , in my opinion , to sift through all that chaff to find the few grains of wheat in most current zoning laws that have any value .
Far better , in my view , to pass an ordinance restricting the locations of demonstrably noxious activities to certain remote locations and be done with it .
Some will protest that zoning ordinances also limit the scale of development , preventing unsightly high - rise condos from appearing in upscale neighbourhoods .
While this view may be reasonably put forward , I disagree with it , giving as evidence the case of Houston , Texas , a city without zoning , where upscale high - rises do in fact pop up in upscale neighbourhoods , which seem none the worse for their having popped up .
Some wealthy people actually like the idea that they can move to a high - rise when their mansion and grounds become too much to handle .
The real object of scale limitations in most zoning ordinances is to prevent apartment ( which some view as a code word for public housing ) projects from occurring anywhere in a suburban community , an insidious goal that is not worthy of public policy .
New Traffic Plan
Once we have held the great bonfire of zoning ordinances , we should turn our attention to the traffic engineers .
Now I have nothing against traffic engineers personally .
As I said before , as good engineers , they developed workable solutions to the problem as they understood it .
My suggestion is that we defined the problem for them the wrong way .
The problem of traffic , in my view , is not how to get the most cars to the most places as fast as humanly possible .
The problem of traffic is to design cities and neighbourhoods where :
People have the option of walking instead of driving .
Bicycles are acknowledged as a healthier choice for wheeled transportation .
A grid of streets provides multiple alternative routes to get to a destination .
Curb radii favor the pedestrian rather than the turning vehicle .
Street parking protects pedestrians from the nearest moving vehicle .
One - way streets are reserved for historic neighbourhoods where the cartway ( curb - to - curb ) dimension is less than 20 feet wide .
Left - turn lanes exist only where they fit , not wherever they are desired .
And public transit ( including rail transit ) is respected as a viable alternative to private cars .
This sort of problem statement is one that I am sure traffic planners are up to taking on , if only the public and our elected representatives will choose to define it in those terms .
I hope that traffic planners themselves will begin to see the problem of traffic in different terms and work to change its parameters from within their own profession .
What Next ?
Once we have burned the zoning books and freed traffic planners from the straitjacket of an equation with too few variables , we will be free to build ( or rebuild ) neighbourhoods as they should be .
I believe that a market exists for such neighbourhoods .
The smattering of urban lofts , coffee shops and townhomes that dot my mostly suburban city gives me hope .
Visiting truly urban cities like Chicago and Boston gives me even more hope , tempered by the realization that both Boston and Chicago are encircled by vast suburbs where neighbourhoods are still mostly illegal .
I suggest we start this trend not on the periphery of the city , where new development always seems to move , or in new towns on greenfield sites , but atop the grid of streets that exists in that nether region between downtown and the suburbs in almost every American city .
The massive investment in infrastructure ( utilities , and streets ) has already been made .
The grid exists .
Often the only obstacle ( besides zoning and traffic planning ) is the perception of this realm as being undesirable , a perception underscored by the obvious disinvestment that has occurred in these areas over the past 50 years .
It is much easier , in my view , to overlay urban neighbourhoods on areas that are already urban than to attempt to create them out of whole cloth on the periphery of a metroplex .
But let 's let suburbs get in on the act , too .
Let 's encourage suburban towns , after they have burned their zoning books , to develop real neighbourhoods with dense commercial cores surrounded by tall apartment buildings and townhouses , corner bars and coffee shops and people walking and riding bikes on something other than bike trails .
There 's no reason why big cities should have all the fun .
Almost every suburb has a dead mall or two that could be razed or remodeled for such a purpose .
Imagine : you could build practically an entire town in a mall parking lot , have it be very dense and urban , and still probably reduce the storm water runoff from the mall 's former parking lot !
Specific Steps
Let 's get real .
Most of you reading this are n't real estate developers ( but if you are , call me ! ) .
What can you do to legalize neighbourhoods again ?
Here are a few down - to - earth suggestions .
Oppose street widening plans in your community unless they are solving a problem other than moving more cars faster through your neighbourhood .
Demand that any street improvements anywhere acknowledge the importance of both bicycles and pedestrians .
Support initiatives for transit , biking and pedestrian routes .
Fight to protect the ground plane .
Oppose sunken or elevated roadways , and most especially oppose sunken or elevated routes for bikes or pedestrians .
Make sure your community 's zoning ordinance : permits or encourages mixed use development does not require setbacks in commercial districts - or not at all does not require excessive ( or even adequate ) parking for development projects does not require " open space " for development that ends up being sickly islands of broomstick trees in a giant parking lot
If your community seems committed to sprawl development standards , work to elect new leaders who are willing to change the rules , who recognize the value of walking and biking and density .
Engage your neighbors in a conversation about density .
Point out that while rural retreats are nice in theory , the reality of low density development is discrimination against our weakest citizens , namely the very young and the very old .
Find a dense , rich , mixed - use urban neighbourhood in your city and support it .
Move there , even .
Sure , you 'll help drive the costs up , but they 'll go up more for the people who come after you .
Engage the local media .
Write letters to the editor .
And do n't forget your snoozy suburban shopper , weekly or neighbourhood insert .
All politics is local , especially when it comes to planning and zoning issues .
If you hear about a " New Urbanist " development in your area , do two things :
First , check out the plan to make sure it 's real .
Many developers are labeling their projects " New Urbanist " because their tract houses have front porches or sidewalks , without really changing the basic formula of sprawl development .
Second , if it seems legit , support it .
Go to the zoning hearings and just stand up and say , " I 'm in favor of this . "
You do n't need to be eloquent , just be heard .
Think about where and when you can patronize local retail businesses instead of the Sprawl - Marts .
There may be a cost involved , but there is also a cost involved in living life the way Sprawl - Mart has laid it out for us .
Well , you get the idea .
I hope that you now feel a bit more inclined to stand in the middle of your six - lane arterial street waving your arms and say , " Hey !
We 're doing this all wrong ! "
But please do n't do it .
You 'd probably just get run over by an SUV on its way to the strip mall .
Endnotes
1 It is important to distinguish between zoning ordinances , which are mostly evil and unnecessary , and building codes , which , while not without problems , are generally a good idea .
Building codes mandate the safety of buildings of various types for human habitation , especially with respect to structural integrity ( think earthquakes ) and egress ( like fire stairs ) .
Building codes have their own problem with being unable to deal with mixed uses ( generally , mixed uses are treated like gasoline and matches by the codes ) , but nevertheless , they serve an important role in protecting the public .
I do not advocate the wholesale burning of building codes , only zoning ordinances .

Architect and urbanist David Greusel is committed to the restoration of American cities .
With over 25 years experience in architecture , David has had the opportunity to help design many of the buildings that make up a city , from schools and supermarkets to ballparks and office buildings .
Some of those projects have contributed to suburban sprawl , while others have helped to heal the wounds of central cities .
A project David worked on of which he is particularly fond was helping to design PNC Park , the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates , which has been rated the best ballpark in America by several publications and websites .
Over the years , David has come to value the " messy vitality " of cities , and has focused his work on projects that help restore the urban fabric .
When he is not practicing architecture , David performs in a syndicated radio comedy program " Right Between The Ears , " which is produced by Kansas Public Radio .
He is the author of the book Architect 's Essentials of Presentation Skills , published by Wiley .
David and his family live in the Kansas City area .

Superconducting mirrors made of copper covered by a thin layer of niobium .
These mirrors are able to store microwave photons up to one - tenth of a second ( Image : Michel Brune )
For the first time the birth , life and death of a single photon – a particle of light – has been “ watched ” in real time .
Previously , scientists were restricted to momentary glances because the mere act of measurement absorbed and destroyed the delicate quantum particles .
Now , Serge Haroche and colleagues at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris , France , have succeeded in tracking photons over an average lifetime of 0.13 seconds – long enough for a photon to travel one - tenth of the way to the Moon .
Advertisement
At the heart of their remarkable achievement lies a small box - like cavity , walled with ultra-reflective , superconducting mirrors , which is cooled to just 0.5° above absolute zero ( - 273.15 °C ) .
Photons appear and disappear randomly within the cavity due to tiny energy fluctuations in space that cause quantum particles to blink in and out of existence .
However , once there , the photon is trapped , bouncing billions of times between the mirrored walls before it decays .
Trapped and annihilated
To observe the photon , the researchers passed rubidium atoms across the cavity one at a time .
A single rubidium atom is unable to absorb a single photon , because the photon is not the correct package of energy to boost the rubidium atom to a different energy state .
However , the photon ’s electric field slightly shifts the atom ’s energy levels by a measurable amount ( once the atom has emerged ) , which the team used to determine whether there were any trapped photons .
“ This is not performed at the expense of the photon energy , so if one is detected , it is still there afterwards for successive rubidium atoms , allowing us to track it , ” says Haroche .
“ A typical signal has a sequence of atoms at one energy level , meaning an empty cavity , suddenly interrupted by atoms at another energy level , signalling the photon birth .
Later , a jump in the opposite direction signals the photon annihilation . ”
“ This is a very important fundamental achievement as no one has ever seen a photon a second time , ” says Ferdinand Schmidt - Kaler at the University of Ulm in Germany .
“ It also has significant implications for the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing . ”
Quantum computing relies on transferring qubits – quantum bits of information – between different energy states to vastly speed up calculations .
According to Schmidt - Kaler , the results demonstrate a stream of atomic qubits can be fully controlled by the qubit state of a trapped photon – a notable achievement , since such operations are fundamental to quantum computers .

One in four Britons out of work
August 16 , 2007 17:28 IST
One in four Britons is jobless .
According to official figures released by the UK government , nearly ten million adults in Britain are jobless .
There 're 1.65 million people who are unemployed , with a further 7.9 million defined as ' economically inactive ' , the official figures revealed .
The second group includes over two million people who are on long - term sickness benefits as well as students and people who have taken early retirement .
Reacting to the revelation , opposition politicians in the UK have said that " the figures exposed the true scale of hidden joblessness under Labour " .
" The ( nearly 10 million ) people of working age not working in Britain today represent a huge pool of wasted talent .
Many of these people could work , and would want to work , if given the right incentives and support .
" Gordon Brown 's ' New Deal ' is failing , with only one in five lone parents on it getting a proper job .
But the Prime Minister seems determined to block the radical welfare reforms that would help millions of these back to work , " Philip Hammond of the Conservative Party was quoted by The Daily Telegraph ' as saying in London .
Even business organisations have voiced concern .
" The rising number of people classified as economically inactive is worrying .
Whilst we accept that many people cannot work for valid reasons ... , there are many more that are claiming welfare in one form or another , " Kieran O ' Keeffe , the policy adviser at the British Chambers of Commerce , was quoted as saying .
" These represent a ' hidden unemployed ' , lost within the complexity of official statistics .
This underlines the urgent need to find a long - term solution to welfare dependency , which if left unchecked will condemn a growing proportion of the working population to a cycle of low aspiration and worklessness , " Keeffe said .

PITTSBURGH -- Carnegie Mellon University researchers have developed a new series of robots that are simple enough for almost anyone to build with off - the - shelf parts , but are sophisticated machines that wirelessly connect to the Internet .
The robots can take many forms , from a three - wheeled model with a mounted camera to a flower loaded with infrared sensors .
They can be easily customized and their ability to wirelessly link to the Internet allows users to control and monitor their robots ' actions from any Internet - connected computer in the world .
The new tools that make this possible are a single piece of hardware and a set of " recipes " that people follow to build their ' bots .
Both are part of the Telepresence Robot Kit ( TeRK ) developed by Associate Professor of Robotics Illah Nourbakhsh and members of his Community Robotics , Education and Technology Empowerment ( CREATE ) Lab .
Their goal is to make highly capable robots accessible and affordable for college and pre-college students , as well as anyone interested in robots .
Unlike other educational robot kits on the market , TeRK is not sold as a complete set of parts .
The CREATE Lab 's recipes allow for a variety of robots to be built with parts commonly available through hardware and hobbyist outlets .
At the heart of each TeRK robot is a unique controller called Qwerk that combines a computer with the software and electronics necessary to control the robot 's motors , cameras and other devices .
Qwerk , developed by the CREATE Lab and Charmed Labs of Austin , Texas , also connects the robot automatically and wirelessly to the Internet so it can be controlled by any Internet - connected computer .
" The Internet connection means the robots are much more global , " Nourbakhsh said .
Not only can the robot be operated remotely at any location with a wireless Internet connection , but it can also send photos or video , respond to RSS feeds , or access the Internet to find information .
That combination opens a wide range of possibilities .
" We 're hoping people notice that the sky 's the limit , " he added .
Among the TeRK recipes already available is a small , wheeled robot with a video camera that people might use to keep an eye on their home or pet while they are at work or school .
Another recipe under development includes environmental sensors for air quality and sound pollution .
A less conventional recipe will produce a robotic , six - petaled flower that can open and close based on moods or use its petals to play a game of catch .
" We want robots that do n't just subscribe to geeky notions of what robots should be , " Nourbakhsh said .
One recipe under development , for instance , can control a stuffed teddy bear .
" Once people have followed a recipe and become acquainted with robots , they can build on their experience , " said Emily Hamner , a senior research associate in the CREATE Lab .
" Not only can they customize the recipes to their liking , they can also design new robot types using the Qwerk controller . "
Qwerk itself is a full - fledged computer with a Linux operating system that can use any computer language .
It features a field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) to control motors , servos , cameras , amplifiers and other devices .
It also accepts USB peripheral devices , such as Web cameras and GPS receivers .
" We leveraged several low - cost , yet high - performance components that were originally developed for the consumer electronics industry when we designed Qwerk , " said Rich LeGrand , president of Charmed Labs .
" The result is a cost - effective robot controller with impressive capabilities . "
Building such a capable robot only five years ago would have been all but impossible , Nourbakhsh said .
Using the Internet to provide telepresence on a routine basis , he explained , is practical today because of widespread broadband Internet access and the ubiquity of wireless hotspots in both public and residential settings .
###
TeRK was developed over the past year and a half with support from Google Inc. , Intel Corp. and Microsoft Inc .
It 's already being used in a variety of college courses , middle school classes and community outreach programs .
In addition to Nourbakhsh and Hamner , the CREATE team includes graduate student Tom Lauwers , research programmer Christopher Bartley and design researcher Carl DiSalvo .
Recipes , software , technical support and other information are available free at the TeRK Web site , www.terk.ri.cmu.edu.
The Qwerk controller is available for sale from Charmed Labs , www.charmedlabs.com/.
Photos of the robots will be available at www.terk.ri.cmu.edu

AMID THE HYPE about the birth of the 300 millionth American last week , a bigger population milestone was largely ignored .
For the first time , according to the Census Bureau , households headed by single people outnumber those headed by married ones .
It may seem unromantic , but marriage has always been a vital economic institution as well as a social one .
A marriage is , among many things , a contract to secure the welfare of an economic unit that , in most cases , includes children .
The tale of the last generation is how the value of that contract has declined , while its costs and risks have increased -- and how the vaunted nuclear family has suffered as a result .
Consider personal bankruptcy , one of the nation ’s biggest growth sectors of the last 20 years .
In 2001 , married people with kids were twice as likely to file for bankruptcy as single adults or childless couples .
Even married couples without children were slightly more likely to file for bankruptcy than single adults .
Families also were more likely to lose their homes than were married couples without children or than single adults -- during an era in which foreclosure rates have skyrocketed .
They also were much more likely to be behind on their credit card bills .
And they were drowning in debt , with their median debt substantially exceeding their median annual income ( according to the Federal Reserve Board ’s 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances ) , a level of debt not seen among any other household type .

Clearly , something is financially amiss with the once rock - solid American family .
But what ?
Why has n’t the rising number of two - earner families protected more Americans from the risks of financial disaster ?
The answer lies ultimately in a simple fact :
To most families , a second income is not a luxury but a necessity in a transformed economy .
The world has not stood still , after all , as women have entered the workforce .
Wages for men have basically flat - lined .
Although the unemployment rate has been low , the job market has become more uncertain , with roughly as large a share of workers involuntarily losing their jobs every three years as during the steep economic downturn of the early 1980s .
The difficulty of balancing work and family has increased .
And the costs of housing , education , healthcare and child care have exploded .
It is families that have born the brunt of these economic changes , and families that falter when , as is too often the case , the strain proves too much .
The family used to be a refuge from risk .
Today , it is the epicenter of risk .
And , increasingly , families are a source of risk as well .
Because it takes more work and more income to maintain a middle - class standard of living , financial shocks are more threatening for families .
What happens when a woman leaves the workforce to have children ?
What happens when a child is chronically ill ?
What happens when a spouse loses his or her job ?
And what happens when families fall apart ?

We are not used to thinking of children as an economic liability , but the facts are clear .
According to 2005 calculations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture , raising a child to age 18 will cost almost $ 237,000 for a middle - income family .
And that leaves out the upward - spiraling college tuition that is now a required ticket for admission into the middle class .
Fully one - quarter of “ poverty spells ” -- periods in which family income drops below the federal poverty line -- begin with the birth of a child .
Spouses , of course , do not equally share the investment of time and money that raising children entails .
Women still mostly care for the child -- and bear the greatest cost .
Their careers are most likely to be disrupted by family events .
If they work , their jobs are most likely to be low - paying and with poor benefits .
And they are most disadvantaged when families fall apart .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the probability of a first marriage ending in divorce or separation within 10 years rose from about 14 % in the early 1950s to more than 30 % by the late 1980s , where it ’s largely remained .
This is n’t just an American problem : Across the Western world , divorce has become more common when and where women have gained greater economic autonomy .
Yet , the financial effects of divorce on families -- and especially on women -- can nonetheless be devastating .
In a two - earner world , parents raising kids mostly or entirely on their own face truly dire circumstances .
What ’s more , women who work longer hours are more likely to divorce than women who work fewer hours or do n’t have a job .
This is a new -- and striking -- development :
In the 1960s and 1970s , two - earner couples and one - earner couples were about equally likely to break up .
By the 1980s , however , two - earner couples were about 40 % more likely to break up .

Strong families are the backbone of strong societies .
And yet , they do not magically emerge .
They take hard work and commitment , and they require investments -- of love , of course , but also time and money .
As the family has become the epicenter of risk , these investments have become more uncertain .
Yet U.S. families have been left to manage these risks without any of the common supports working families abroad enjoy -- such as paid leave to have a child .
Among 14 rich Western democracies , the United States ranks dead last in supporting mothers with children 6 or younger .
More than 160 nations in the world offer paid family leave .
Although a few states in the U.S. offer paid disability leave , the country as a whole does not , making it the only rich nation besides Australia ( which guarantees all women a year of unpaid leave ) without such a policy .
Forming a family and having kids is the most personal of decisions .
Yet it ’s a decision that has profound benefits for society as a whole .
Americans do need to make the right choices for their families .
But they should n’t have to choose between economic security and getting married and having kids .
W hat I imagined the people around me were saying when I was . . .
Eleven :
“ Oh , man , I ca n’t believe that kid Simon missed that ground ball !
How pathetic ! ”
“ Wait .
He ’s staring at his baseball glove with a confused expression on his face .
Maybe there ’s something wrong with his glove and that ’s why he messed up . ”
“ Yeah , that ’s probably what happened . ”
— — ——
Twelve :
“ Did that kid sitting behind us on the bus just get an erection ? ”
“ I do n’t know .
For a while , I thought that was the case , but now that he ’s holding a book on his lap it ’s impossible to tell . ”
“ I guess we ’ll never know what the situation was . ”
— — ——
Thirteen :
“ Hey , look , that thirteen - year - old is walking around with his mom ! ”
“ Where ? ”
“ There — in front of the supermarket ! ”
“ Oh , my God !
That kid is way too old to be hanging out with his mom .
Even though I ’ve never met him , I can tell he ’s a complete loser . ”
“ Wait a minute .
He ’s scowling at her and rolling his eyes . ”
“ Oh , yeah . . . and I think I just heard him curse at her , for no reason . ”
“ I guess he ’s cool after all . ”
— — ——
Fourteen :
“ Why does that kid have a black ‘ X ’ on the back of his right hand ? ”
“ I bet it ’s because he went to some kind of cool rock concert last night . ”
“ Wow .
He must ’ve stayed out pretty late if he did n’t have time to scrub it off . ”
“ Yeah , and that ’s probably why his hair is so messy and dirty — because he cares more about rocking out than conforming to society . ”
“ Even though he is n’t popular in the traditional sense , I respect him from afar . ”
— — ——
Fifteen :
“ Hey , look , that kid is reading ‘ Howl , ’ by Allen Ginsberg . ”
“ Wow .
He must be some kind of rebel genius . ”
“ I ’m impressed by the fact that he is n’t trying to call attention to himself . ”
“ Yeah , he ’s just sitting silently in the corner , flipping the pages and nodding , with total comprehension . ”
“ It ’s amazing .
He ’s so absorbed in his book that he is n’t even aware that a party is going on around him , with dancing and fun . ”
“ Why are n’t any girls going over and talking to him ? ”
“ I guess they ’re probably a little intimidated by his brilliance . ”
“ Well , who would n’t be ? ”
“ I ’m sure the girls will talk to him soon . ”
“ It ’s only a matter of time . ”
— — ——
Sixteen :
“ Hey , look , it ’s that kid Simon , who wrote that scathing poem for the literary magazine . ”
“ You mean the one about how people are phonies ?
Wow — I loved that poem ! ”
“ Me , too .
Reading it made me realize for the first time that everyone is a phony , including me . ”
“ The only person at this school who is n’t a phony is Simon . ”
“ Yeah .
He sees right through us . ” ♦
JULY 19 -- Incensed by the most recent arrest of an alleged drug dealer , a Cleveland politician wrote the perp a scathing , profanity - filled letter that referred to the man as a " crack dealing piece of trash " who should " go to jail or the cemetery soon . "
In a July 12 letter , a copy of which you 'll find here , Councilman Michael Polensek , 57 , tore into Arsenio Winston , 18 , after learning of the teenager 's arrest earlier this month on a felony drug trafficking rap .
The letter 's writer and its recipient are pictured at left .
Winston 's bust came in Cleveland 's 11th Ward , which Polensek has represented since 1982 .
Writing that jail or a funeral home would be Winston 's next stop , Polensek noted , " Quite frankly , I do n't care which one you get to first as long as your dumb stupid ass is out of my neighborhood . "
While Polensek defended the confrontational letter in an interview with the Cleveland Plain Dealer , Winston 's mother said she considered the missive a threat to her son and was conferring with her lawyer .

So what has happened to the Israeli army ?
This question is now being raised not only around the world , but also in Israel itself .
Clearly , there is a huge gap between the army ’s boastful arrogance , on which generations of Israelis have grown up , and the picture presented by this war .
Before the choir of generals utters its expected cries of being stabbed in the back 
" The government has shackled our hands !
The politicians did not allow the army to win !
The political leadership is to blame for everything ! "  it is worthwhile to examine this war from a professional military point of view .
( It is , perhaps , appropriate to interject at this point a personal remark .
Who am I to speak about strategic matters ?
What am I , a general ?
Well  I was 16 years old when World War II broke out .
I decided then to study military theory in order to be able to follow events .
I read a few hundred books  from Sun Tzu to Clausewitz to Liddel - Hart and so on .
Later , in the 1948 war , I saw the other side of the medal , as a soldier and squad - leader .
I have written two books on the war .
That does not make me a great strategist , but it does allow me to voice an informed opinion . )
The facts speak for themselves :
On the 32nd day of the war , Hezbollah is still standing and fighting .
That by itself is a stunning feat : a small guerilla organization , with a few thousand fighters , is standing up to one of the strongest armies in the world and has not been broken after a month of " pulverizing . "
Since 1948 , the armies of Egypt , Syria , and Jordan have repeatedly been beaten in wars that were much shorter .
As I have already said : if a lightweight boxer is fighting a heavyweight champion and is still standing in the 12th round , the victory is his  whatever the count of points says .
In the test of results  the only one that counts in war  the strategic and tactical command of Hezbollah is decidedly better than that of our own army .
All along , our army ’s strategy has been primitive , brutal , and unsophisticated .
Clearly , Hezbollah has prepared well for this war  while the Israeli command has prepared for a quite different war .
On the level of individual fighters , the Hezbollah are not inferior to our soldiers , neither in bravery nor in initiative .
The main guilt for the failure belongs with Gen. Dan Halutz .
I say " guilt " and not merely " responsibility , " which comes with the job .
He is living proof of the fact that an inflated ego and a brutal attitude are not enough to create a competent chief of staff .
The opposite may be true .
Halutz gained fame ( or notoriety ) when he was asked what he feels when he drops a one - ton bomb on a residential quarter and answered : " a slight bang on the wing . "
He added that afterwards he sleeps well at night .
( In the same interview , he also called me and my friends " traitors " who should be prosecuted . )
Now it is already clear  again , in the test of results  that Dan Halutz is the worst chief of staff in the annals of the Israeli army , a completely incompetent officer for his job .
Recently he has changed his blue air force uniform for the green one of the land army .
Too late .
Halutz started this war with the bluster of an air force officer .
He believed that it was possible to crush Hezbollah by aerial bombardment , supplemented by artillery shelling from land and sea .
He believed that if he destroyed the towns , neighborhoods , roads , and ports of Lebanon , the Lebanese people would rise and compel their government to remove Hezbollah .
For a week he killed and devastated , until it became clear to everybody that this method achieves the opposite  strengthens Hezbollah , weakens its opponents within Lebanon and throughout the Arab world , and destroys the worldwide sympathy Israel enjoyed at the beginning of the war .
When he reached this point , Halutz did not know what to do next .
For three weeks he sent his soldiers into Lebanon on senseless and hopeless missions , gaining nothing .
Even in the battles that were fought in villages right on the border , no significant victories were achieved .
After the fourth week , when he was requested to submit a plan to the government , it was unbelievably primitive .
If the " enemy " had been a regular army , it would have been a bad plan .
Just pushing the enemy back is hardly a strategy at all .
But when the other side is a guerilla force , this is simply foolish .
It may cause the death of many soldiers , for no practical result .
Now he is trying to achieve a token victory , occupying empty space as far from the border as possible , after the UN has already called for an end to the hostilities .
( As in almost all previous Israeli wars , this call is being ignored , in the hope of snatching some gains at the last moment . )
Behind this line , Hezbollah remains intact in their bunkers .
However , the chief of staff does not act in a vacuum .
As commander in chief he has indeed a huge influence , but he is also merely the top of the military pyramid .
This war casts a dark shadow on the whole upper echelon of our army .
I assume that there are some talented officers , but the general picture is of a senior officers corps that is mediocre , or worse , gray and unoriginal .
Almost all the many officers who have appeared on TV are unimpressive , uninspiring professionals , experts on covering their behinds , repeating empty clichés like parrots .
The ex-generals , who have been crowding out everybody else in the TV and radio studios , have also mostly surprised us with their mediocrity , limited intelligence , and general ignorance .
One gets the impression that they have not read books on military history , and fill the void with empty phrases .
More than once it has been said in this column that an army that has been acting for many years as a colonial police force against the Palestinian population  " terrorists , " women , and children  and spending its time running after stone - throwing boys , cannot remain an efficient army .
The test of results confirms this .
As after every failure of our military , the intelligence community is quick to cover its ass .
Their chiefs declare that they knew everything , that they provided the troops with full and accurate information , that they are not to blame if the army did not act on it .
That does not sound reasonable .
Judging from the reactions of the commanders in the field , they clearly were completely unaware of the defense system built by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon .
The complex infrastructure of hidden bunkers , stocked with modern equipment and stockpiles of food and weapons , was a complete surprise for the army .
It was not ready for these bunkers , including those built two or three kilometers from the border .
They are reminiscent of the tunnels in Vietnam .
The intelligence community has also been corrupted by the long occupation of the Palestinian territories .
They have gotten used to relying on the thousands of collaborators who have been recruited in the course of 39 years by torture , bribery , and extortion ( junkies needing drugs , someone begging to be allowed to visit his dying mother , someone desiring a chunk from the cake of corruption , etc. ) .
Clearly , no collaborators were found among Hezbollah , and without them intelligence is blind .
It is also clear that intelligence , and the army in general , was not ready for the deadly efficiency of Hezbollah ’s anti-tank weapons .
Hard to believe , but according to official figures , more than 20 tanks were hit .
The Merkava ( " carriage " ) tank is the pride of the army .
Its father , Gen. Israel Tal , a victorious tank general , did not want only to build the world ’s most advanced tank , but also a tank that provided its crew with the best possible protection .
Now it appears that an anti-tank weapon from the late 1980s that is available in large quantities can disable the tank , killing or grievously wounding the soldiers inside .
The common denominator of all the failures is the disdain for Arabs , a contempt that has dire consequences .
It has caused total misunderstanding , a kind of blindness of Hezbollah ’s motives , attitudes , standing in Lebanese society , etc .
I am convinced that today ’s soldiers are in no way inferior to their predecessors .
Their motivation is high , and they have shown great bravery in the evacuation of the wounded under fire .
( I very much appreciate that in particular , since my own life was saved by soldiers who risked theirs to get me out under fire when I was wounded . )
But the best soldiers cannot succeed when the command is incompetent .
History teaches that defeat can be a great blessing for an army .
A victorious army rests on its laurels , it has no motive for self - criticism , it degenerates , its commanders become careless and lose the next war .
( See : the Six Day War leading to the Yom Kippur War ) .
A defeated army , on the other side , knows that it must rehabilitate itself .
On one condition : that it admits defeat .
After this war , the chief of staff must be dismissed and the senior officer corps overhauled .
For that , a minister of defense is needed who is not a marionette of the chief of staff .
( But that concerns the political leadership , about whose failures and sins we shall speak another time . )
We , as people of peace , have a great interest in changing the military leadership .
First , because it has a huge impact on the forming of policy and , as we just saw , irresponsible commanders can easily drag the government into dangerous adventures .
And second , because even after achieving peace we shall need an efficient army  at least until the wolf lies down with the lamb , as the prophet Isaiah promised .
( And not in the Israeli version : " No problem .
One only has to bring a new lamb every day . " )
The main lesson of the war , beyond all military analysis , lies in the five words we inscribed on our banner from the very first day : " There is no military solution ! "
Even a strong army cannot defeat a guerilla organization , because the guerilla is a political phenomenon .
Perhaps the opposite is true : the stronger the army , the better equipped with advanced technology , the smaller are its chances of winning such a confrontation .
Our conflict  in the north , the center , and the south  is a political conflict , and can only be resolved by political means .
The army is the instrument worst suited for that .
The war has proved that Hezbollah is a strong opponent , and any political solution in the north must include it .
Since Syria is its strong ally , it must also be included .
The settlement must be worthwhile for them too , otherwise it will not last .
The price is the return of the Golan Heights .
What is true in the north is also true in the south .
The army will not defeat the Palestinians , because such a victory is altogether impossible .
For the good of the army , it must be extricated from the quagmire .
If that now enters the consciousness of the Israeli public , something good may yet have come out of this war .
The next time you are plagued with indecision and need a clear way out , it might help to get angry , according to a surprising new study .
Despite its reputation as an impetus to rash behavior , anger actually seems to help people make better choices — even aiding those who are usually very poor at thinking rationally .
This could be because angry people base their decisions on the cues that " really matter " rather than things that can be called irrelevant or a distraction .
Previous research has shown that anger biases people ’s thinking — turning them into bigger risk - takers and making them less trusting and more prejudiced , for instance .
But little has been done to study how , exactly , anger affects a person ’s thinking .
So Wesley Moons , a psychologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara , and his colleague Diane Mackie designed three experiments to determine how anger influences thinking — whether it makes people more analytical or careful about their decisions , or whether it leads people to make faster , rasher decisions .
In the first experiment , the researchers induced anger in a group of college students by either asking them to write about a past experience that had made them very angry , or by having their stated hopes and dreams harshly criticized by another participant .
In a second group of students , anger was not induced .
The researchers later checked to be sure that the subjects were as riled up as they were supposed to be .
The two groups were then asked to read either compelling or weak arguments designed to convince them that college students have good financial habits .
The strong argument cited research from numerous scientific studies , whereas the weak argument contained largely unsupported statements .
The subjects were asked to logically evaluate the strength of the arguments they read and indicate how convinced they were by them .
The researchers repeated the experiment with a second group of students , this time giving the subjects an additional piece of information : who had made the arguments .
Some students were told that the argument was made by an organization with relevant expertise in financial matters ; others were told that the argument was made by a medical organization whose expertise was irrelevant to the financial topic being considered .
In both studies , the researchers found that the angry subjects were better at discriminating between strong and weak arguments and were more convinced by the stronger arguments .
Those who were not made to feel angry tended to be equally convinced by both arguments , indicating that they were not as analytical in their assessments .
The angry students were also better at weighing the arguments appropriately depending on which organization had made them .
The researchers repeated the experiment a third time using a different argument — one that supported the implementation of a university - wide requirement for graduating seniors to take comprehensive exams .
This time , they tested only those subjects who were the least analytical , or in other words , those who were the least likely to make logical decisions .
This way , the researchers would be able to see whether anger also makes typically non-analytical thinkers more analytical .
Once again , they found that the angry subjects were better able to discriminate between strong and weak arguments than the ones who were not angry — suggesting that anger can transform even those people who are , by disposition , not very analytical into more careful thinkers .
Their findings , detailed in this month ’s issue of the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , suggest that anger helps people focus on the cues that matter most to making a rational decision and ignore cues that are irrelevant to the task of decision - making .
This could be because anger is designed to motivate people to take action — and that it actually helps people to take the right action , the authors wrote .
LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - “ Star Wars ” is so firmly ensconced in the pop culture firmament that its success -- in a movie universe a long time ago -- would seem to have been pre-ordained .
But that was hardly the case .
As the movie celebrates its 30th anniversary , George Lucas will be joined by many of his collaborators at a special screening at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences ’ Goldwyn Theater on Monday .
Simultaneously , Ballantine Books is publishing J.W. Rinzler ’s “ The Making of Star Wars , ” which bills itself as “ The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film . ”
More than just a promotional making - of book , Rinzler ’s account seeks to strip away a lot of the mythology about the movie ’s creation that has grown up over the years .
Rinzler , an executive editor at Lucasfilm , was aided in that quest when he discovered a treasure chest of interviews that Charles Lippincott , Lucasfilm ’s vp marketing and merchandising in the mid-‘70s , conducted with the film ’s principals between 1975 and 1978 .
They provided him with a contemporaneous view into the movie ’s origins , uncolored by its eventual success .
“ Everyone ’s memories are somewhat faulty , and opinions have changed over the years , ” Rinzler explains .
But the discovery of the old interviews allowed him “ to do as close to an oral history as I could . ”
Among the forgotten aspects of the movie ’s production that he unearthed was a failed attempt to use front - projection , forcing the production to shift to bluescreen .
Rinzler quotes Lucas saying , “ The biggest change during filming was from front projection to bluescreen .
We had shot the approach to the Death Star , but once we got the results , we realized it was n’t going to work . ”
In fact , the production was constantly fighting battles on two fronts .
A skeptical 20th Century Fox whittled away the budget -- just four months before shooting was to begin in 1976 , the studio shaved the production budget from $ 7.5 million to $ 6.9 million .
At the same time , Lucas was constantly challenging his crew to come up with innovative solutions like John Dykstra ’s motion - control camera that defined the state - of - the - art .
But as Lucas was forced to fund most of the movie ’s preproduction , one of the suits , Alan Ladd Jr. , then the studio ’s production chief , emerged as a hero .
In October 1975 , smarting from the failure of the big - budget “ Lucky Lady ” with Gene Hackman , Burt Reynolds and Liza Minnelli , Fox imposed a moratorium on further spending on “ Star Wars ” until its board met on December 13 .
Ladd persuaded the board to issue a greenlight .
But even on May 25 , 1977 , when the movie opened to lines that snaked around Grauman ’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood , no one involved was quite convinced that they were witnessing a pop cultural phenomenon .
“ Star Wars ” bowed in just 32 theaters nationwide , and the only reason it was booked into the prestigious Chinese was that the release of William Friedkin ’s “ Sorcerer , ” which had been set to play that house , had been postponed .
Lucas himself was holed up at the Goldwyn Studios , mixing down the film ’s 8 - track stereo mix to monaural for its wider release .
Ladd called him with the first boxoffice results .
“ Wait , calm down , ” Lucas told the studio boss .
“ Remember , science - fiction films do really great the first week , then they drop off to nothing .
It ’s a good sign , but it does n’t mean anything .
Let ’s wait a couple of weeks . ”
Turning to the others in the room , Lucas added , “ The movie ’s only been released for five hours .
I do n’t want to count my chickens before they hatch . ”

Chavez is known for his defenders .
I ’ve noticed quite often that the ones that comment here seem to think we ’re all a bunch of “ gringos ” who want to exploit the poor and ruin Chavez ’ socialist revolution .
And I understand , of course …
After all , I ’m just a blogger .
What credibility do I have on Venezuela , other than my study of the history of socialist nations ?
But today , I ’ve got good news .
No longer do I have to rely on my own reading of the facts to call Chavez a corrupt dictator who is running his nation into the ground and offering little more than lip service to the nation ’s poor .
I ’ve got the World Bank and The Economist to do it for me !
From The Economist ( subscription may be required ) :
Mr Chávez proclaims that “ being rich is bad ” .
He frequently lashes out at what he calls “ the oligarchy ” .
Strange , then , that the streets of Caracas are clogged with big new 4x4s ( Hummers are especially favoured ) , it is hard to get a table at the best restaurants , and art dealers and whisky importers have never had it so good .
A new oligarchy seems to be rising in Venezuela on the back of the “ Bolivarian Revolution ” , named for the country ’s independence hero . …
Their prosperity owes much to an oil windfall : the price of Venezuela ’s main export has increased almost eightfold since 1999 and the economy has been growing at 10 % a year .
But government policies , too , have favoured the bankers and other intermediaries : inflation is close to 20 % and the official value of the currency is twice its black - market exchange rate .
So the savvy investor looks for access to cheap dollars , import opportunities and government contracts , all of which are largely conditional on political obedience .
By contrast , manufacturers and farmers face price controls and risk sporadic official harassment .
The result has been the rise of what is known , in obeisance to Bolívar , as the “ Boli- bourgeoisie ” .
This is typical socialism .
When a private company makes a decision to award a contract ( paying for it with their own money ) , they make the decision based on who they think is most likely to provide the best service at the most competitive price .
When the government makes the decisions of who gets key contracts , spending taxpayer dollars with no accountability , those decisions are made based on who has the most political pull .
And are the poor being served ?
Only if they ’re politically connected .
If they ’re regular hardworking non-political people , they may just starve :
Mr Chávez claims to be pursuing economic nationalism and “ endogenous development ” .
But farmers and manufacturers struggle against cheap imports .
Though local dairy products are often missing from the supermarket shelves , Gouda and Emmenthal cheeses nestle beside Irish butter .
The frozen chickens at Mercal , a government chain of subsidised grocery shops , are Brazilian .
The importers who supply Mercal have grown rich .
But Venezuela ’s ranchers are becoming extinct , threatened by expropriations , land invasions and price controls , as well as by extortion and kidnappings by criminal gangs .
After all , Chavez ’ rule is that “ being rich is bad ” , and that businessmen are evil .
But there ’s a corollary to that rule .
If the businessmen support Chavez , they should be rich and they ’re no longer evil .
And through all of this , his socialist rule is n’t even promoting “ income equality ” , one of the cardinal tenets of socialism :
Thanks to economic growth and social programmes , the government claims that only 30 % of Venezuelan families now live in poverty , down from 55 % at the peak in 2003 .
But according to a new report by the central bank , income inequality has widened slightly under Mr Chávez : the Gini coefficient — a statistical measure of inequality — has gone from 0.44 in 2000 to 0.48 in 2005 .
…
Officials stress that two - thirds of the poor have benefited directly from government social policies .
As well as Mercal , these include the “ missions ” , which offer education and health care .
Up to 2 m people get a small cash stipend .
But despite hefty increases in the minimum wage and price controls on basic goods , inflation is eating away at the gains .
Whether you believe that the Venezuelan govenrment ’s numbers on poverty are true ( and I do n’t ) , the fact that income inequality is rising is contrary to Chavez ’ goals .
In fact , income inequality is even higher than here in the USA !*
In Hugo Chavez ’ Venezuela , the rich get richer , and the poor ca n’t buy groceries .
Hugo Chavez may have put the snow job on Barbara Walters , but I do n’t think he can fool the World Bank :
For those with connections , however , the rewards are great .
The World Bank recently ranked Venezuela as the second - worst country in the Americas for the control of corruption , above only Haiti .
Others confirm this perception .
“ We usually ask for 10 % , ” a foreign diplomat reports one government official admitting .
“ But some get greedy and want 15 - 20 % . ”
Does anyone else find it strange that the same people who criticize BushCo for their ties to Halliburton and “ Big Oil ” champion a corrupt dictator like Chavez , doling out wealth and riches to those with the most political pull ?
¿ Quién es el diablo , ahora ?
* Note that I do n’t place a lot of faith in the Gini coefficient .
In fact , I do n’t see it as the government ’s business to fix this “ problem ” .
I just find it funny that Chavez ’ socialist revolution can’t even get the number lower than what we have in the USA .
A murder on the high seas .

Game two – the missed mate
Before we try to explain how the blunder of the century could happen , here for all of you who have been out of touch with chess is the fateful game , the second of the match and one that is going to haunt the dreams of the world champion for a long time to come .
Deep Fritz 10 - Kramnik , V ( 2750 ) [ D10 ]
Man vs Machine Bonn , Germany ( 2 ) , 27.11.2006
1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.e4 b5 4.a4 c6 5.Nc3 b4 6.Na2 Nf6 7.e5 Nd5 8.Bxc4 e6 9.Nf3 a5 10 .Bg5 Qb6 11.Nc1 Ba6 12.Qe2 h6 13 .Be3 Bxc4 14 .Qxc4 Nd7 15 .Nb3 Be7 16.Rc1 0-0 17.0-0 Rfc8 18.Qe2 c5 19 . Nfd2 Qc6 20 .Qh5 Qxa4 21.Nxc5 Nxc5 22.dxc5 Nxe3 23.fxe3 Bxc5 24 . Qxf7 + Kh8 25 .Qf3 Rf8 26 .Qe4 Qd7 27.Nb3 Bb6 28.Rfd1 Qf7 29.Rf1 Qa7 30 .
Rxf8 + Rxf8 31 . Nd4 a4 32 . Nxe6 Bxe3 + 33.Kh1 Bxc1 34 . Nxf8 . Now 34 ... Kg8 35 .Ng6 Bxb2 36 .Qd5 + Kh7 37.Nf8 + Kh8 38.Ng6 + is the forced draw .
But Kramnik played 34 ... Qe3 ??
The blunder of the century .
35 .Qh7# 1 - 0 . [ Click to replay ]
As we mentioned in an earlier report Kramnik played the move 34 ... Qe3 calmly , stood up , picked up his cup and was about to leave the stage to go to his rest room .
At least one audio commentator also noticed nothing , while Fritz operator Mathias Feist kept glancing from the board to the screen and back , hardly able to believe that he had input the correct move .
Fritz was displaying mate in one , and when Mathias executed it on the board Kramnik briefly grasped his forehead , took a seat to sign the score sheet and left for the press conference , which he dutifully attended .
Fritz operator Mathias at the end of the game
In the post match press conference Vladimir Kramnik confirmed that he had not blundered out of exhaustion , and had been calculating very well right to the end .
He had no real explanation for the oversight that happened right at the end .
The press conference minutes after the game , with Vladimir Kramnik , match organiser Joseph Resch , and Fritz operator Mathias Feist
Kramnik still quite dazed by the sudden end of the game
Kramnik in the press conference : " It was actually not only about the last move .
I was calculating this line very long in advance , and then recalculating .
It was very strange , some kind of blackout .
I was feeling well , I was playing well , I think I was pretty much better .
I calculated the line many , many times , rechecking myself .
I already calculated this line when I played 29 ... Qa7 , and after each move I was recalculating , again , and again , and finally I blundered mate in one .
Actually it was the first time that it happened to me , and I cannot really find any explanation .
I was not feeling tired , I think I was calculating well during the whole game ...
It 's just very strange , I can not explain it . "

Thus the question that everyone was asking remained unanswered : how can a player of Kramnik 's caliber , a world champion who hovers around the Elo 2800 mark , overlook a mate in one move ?
Naturally there is no logical explanation – we have to delve into the realm of pattern recognition and the psychology of human perception if we want to understand anything .
Let us at least try to imagine what when through Kramniks head , and through his eyes and optical nerves , in the critical position .
We will use the spectacular new 3D graphics of Deep Fritz 10 , the program Vladimir is playing against , to illustrate what we are saying .
The above picture ( click to enlarge ) shows is what Vladimir was concentrating on .
He had probably seen that after 34 ... Kg8 Deep Fritz had a forced draw ( 34 ... Kg8 35.Ng6 Bxb2 36 .Qd5 + Kh7 37.Nf8 + Kh8 38.Ng6 + ) , and so his mind was concentrated on the two wonderful pawns on the queenside which , were it not for the white queen on e4 , would simply advance and queen on a8 , winning the game .
Vladimir Kramnik pondering the position before his 34th move in game two .
How to deflect the queen ?
Well , why not offer a queen trade with ... Qe3 . If White takes on e3 Black has an easy win , e.g. 34 ... Qe3 35 . Qxe3 Bxe3 36 .Ng6 + Kh7 37.Nf8 + Kg8 38.Nd7 a3 39.bxa3 bxa3 40.g3 a2 41.Kg2 a 1Q 1 - 0 .
And if the white queen moves away Black still has very powerful winning lines , e.g. 35 .
Qxb4 Qe2 36 .Qb6 Be3 and White can resign .
So things were looking great for the world champion , who was probably checking lines we discussed above , and others as well , most involving the black pawns on a4 and b4 .
In the picture above you can see his eyes are on the queenside .
Unfortunately , Kramnik had somehow not registered the threat generated by the Fritz move 34 .
Nxf8 .
The white queen threatens mate in one on h7 ( where it is protected by the knight ) .
Black does nothing to neutralise this threat with his move 34 ... Qe3 .
And so , after he played it , Kramnik was immediately mated by the computer .
But how could he not have seen the threat after 34 .
Nxf8 .
An explanation was proffered by a very experienced chess player and trainer , Alexander Roshal , who is also the editor of the Russian chess magazine " 64 " .
Alexander told us that the mating pattern that occurred during the game , with the white queen protected by a knight on f8 ( as in the screen shot above ) , is extremely rare in chess .
It is not one of the patterns that chess grandmasters automatically have in their repertoire .
This was confirmed by a GM commentator in Bonn , who after Kramnik 's move did not notice that it was a blunder and started discussing White 's options – but not the mate in one .
Alexander Roshal assured us that , had the white knight somehow moved to g5 or f6 , as in the above Fritz 10 screen shots , Kramnik would have seen the mate in micro-seconds .
The square h7 would have had a big red light blinking on it , Roshal said , because this kind of mate ( or mating threat ) occurs quite often in chess , and the mating pattern would be firmly anchored in his mind .
With the knight in an unsual position the square remained dark and Kramnik simply did not see the danger .

" The charade that took place at Guantanamo Bay would have done Stalin 's show trials proud , " Mr Richter said in a commentary for The Sunday Age .
" First there was indefinite detention without charge .
Then there was the torture , however the Bush lawyers , including his attorney - general , might choose to describe it .
Then there was the extorted confession of guilt . "
The controversial deal came a day after the US Defence Secretary , Robert Gates , told a congressional committee in Washington that tribunal verdicts would lack credibility because of the reputation of Guantanamo around the world .
A law professor at the University of Richmond in the US , Carl Tobias , said the " machinations " in the Hicks trial " suggest the accuracy of Gates 's Thursday testimony about global perceptions of the military trials " .
The Hicks deal stunned even the military prosecutors , who were seeking a much longer sentence .
It only emerged later that Colonel Morris Davis , the lead prosecutor , and his team had been kept in the dark about negotiations between the Hicks defence team and Susan Crawford , the Defence Department lawyer who oversees the tribunals .
Colonel Davis said he had learned of the deal at lunchtime on Monday , before Hicks 's first appearance .
The sentence of nine months shocked him .
" I was n't considering anything that did n't have two digits , " he said .
Colonel Davis said he could have chosen not to sign the papers but it would have been just a symbolic move .
Maureen Byrnes , the executive director of the New York organisation Human Rights First , said the Hicks proceedings " illustrated everything that 's wrong with these military commissions " .
" The plea deal in particular has the taint of coerced statements and secrecy .
The deal effectively censors anything Mr Hicks might allege about what he says he suffered and implausibly characterises the last five years of his detention as justified under the laws of war , " she said .
Lex Lasry , the Australian QC who observed the tribunal for the Law Council of Australia , said the conditions attached to the deal were suspicious .
Hicks would be locked away and forbidden to speak publicly until after the federal election later this year .
" What an amazing coincidence that , with an election in Australia by the end of the year , he gets nine months and he is gagged for 12 months from talking about it , " Mr Lasry said .
A lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union , Ben Wizner , said if Hicks was such a menace to Western security , " why was he given a sentence more appropriate for a drunk - driving offence ? "

The Neurobiology of Spontaneity All brains are spontaneously active Brains balance actions and responses Traditionally , the neurosciences have been working under the assumption of the sensorimotor hypothesis , namely that the main function of brains is to compute motor output from sensory input .
At the same time , ecologists have known for a long time that such passive strategies are not evolutionarily stable .
Instead , animals must be constantly active , exploring , probing the environment with spontaneous actions and planning future actions by learning from behavioral consequences .
Today , output - input as well as input - output computations are regarded as equally important mechanisms of action selection .
This insight entails that general brain function can be best described as computing the balance between actions and responses , or , in ecological terms , balancing exploration and exploitation .
From a neurophysiological perspective , brains balance exogenous with endogenous processing .

This shift in perspective , from passively responding brains to spontaneously acting brains opened a new avenue in the neurosciences : how do brains generate spontaneous activity ?
In the last decade , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) in humans and non-human primates has provided insights on a phenomenon the dynamics of which provide a hypothetical mechanism by which this balance may be achieved .
The so - called ' default - mode network ' interacts in a push - pull fashion with task - related networks such that they mutually inhibit each other .
Whenever no particular task is being solved by the person in the fMRI scanner , the default - mode network is active ; whenever a task is being computed , a task - related network is active and the default - mode network is attenuated .
Importantly , behavioral variability during a task can be explained to a large extent by the fluctuations in the activity of the attenuated default - mode network .
Moreover , mistakes during a task are often preceded by activation of the default - mode network .
Finally , many psychiatric disorders which affect action selection also affect the structure , connectivity and dynamics of the default - mode network .
Studying spontaneity in invertebrates
However , humans are a poor study subject for a functional analysis of neurobiological processes .
Early experiments in invertebrates , notably insects , suggested that spontaneous activity was a property of all brains , opening up the possibility to use the genetic toolbox of the fruit fly Drosophila to study the neurobiology of spontaneous behavior .
Indeed , these early ethological studies matched ecological research suggesting that spontaneous behavioral variability was an adaptive trait selected for by evolution due to several different functions :
Render the animal unpredictable to prey , predators or competitors
Discover hidden resources
Identify the stimuli in the sensory stream which are controlled by the animal itself
In our quest for the neurobiological substrate of spontaneity , we started out with a mathematical analysis of spontaneous flight behavior , which set out to test if the variability observed in the fly turning behavior was due to random noise or initiated by decision - making circuits in the fly brain .
After we found evidence for nonlinear decision - making circuits controlling Drosophila turning behavior , we have started a project localizing these circuits in the fly brain , using the genetic tools available for our model system .
It is inescapable to notice that the ability to initiate spontaneous behavior does have implications for the question of whether we have free will .
Therefore , I have proposed a scientific framework for the term ' free will ' , based on the ability of all animals to spontaneously vary their behavior .
Sen Selva reportedly feigned illness to get to an interview
Senator Gustavo Selva was widely criticised for using an ambulance to rush to a TV interview .
Sen Selva used the ambulance to speed through Rome 's streets , blocked with traffic during a visit by US President George W Bush on Saturday .
In his resignation letter he praised the " speed and efficiency " of the crew .
' Old journalist 's trick '
Sen Selva 's ambulance use provoked a storm of criticism from Italian politicians and media .
Sen Selva reportedly feigned an illness , asking the ambulance to take him to his heart specialist , but giving the address of the TV studio .
Health Minister Livia Turco said an investigation would be held into the senator 's " irresponsible " behaviour .
" I used an old journalist 's trick to get here , " Sen Selva reportedly said during his interview .
Ms Turco said : " This arrogant stunt could have had tragic consequences if another person had really needed that ambulance . "
Rome 's emergency services had about 50 ambulances standing by in case anti-Bush protests in the city turned violent .
They had about 600 emergency calls during the day , Reuters news agency said .
Barney came down on McHenry for breaking the rules and trying to implement an amendment .

He cracked me up when he said his past behavior was not relevant ... Hilarious .
( I 'm really not going to post too much the next few days .
I 'm really not ... no... really .... Nicole has been yelling at me . )
Because the Government 's Making You
Naming your baby Brooklynn , America , or Lindsee might be acceptable ( if mockable ) in the good ol ' US of A , but do n't try a stunt like that in Denmark .
Of all the European laws regulating baby names , Denmark 's are the strictest .
Danish parents must choose from a state - approved list of 7,000 names , which seems like a lot , until you fall in love with a name that is n't on there .
And bucking the system means months of slogging through a bureaucratic process to get your chosen moniker individually approved by the Names Investigation Department and the Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs .
Each year , those organizations reject 15 to 20 percent of the names they review — all in the , uh , " name "  of protecting the baby 's dignity .
Because You Are n't As Religious As Your Parents
Forget the hippies , the award for # 1 crazy - baby - name subculture absolutely has to go to the Puritans .
Well known for burning eccentric neighbors , forcing adulterers to wear colorful letterman jackets , and condemning the concept of " fun "  in general , Puritan culture was basically a big ball of repressed wackiness looking for an outlet .
Thus , did little Silence , Humiliation , and Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin ( i.e. the writing on the wall from the Book of Daniel ) pay the price for their parents ' self - flagellation .
Some , however , later rebelled .
Sometime before 1660 , a preacher 's son-turned doctor changed his name from Hath - Christ - Not - Died - For - Thee - Thou - Woudst - Be - Damned Barbone to the more sensible Nicholas Barbon .
He went on to found the world 's first insurance company , thus storing up treasures on Earth and probably getting himself in even more trouble with his dad .
For the Sake of A Little Publicity
Between 1965 and 1979 , San Francisco painting contractor Bill Holland changed his name no fewer than three times .
But Holland 's odyssey was n't part of some New Age attempt to find himself .
Rather , it was a purely Capitalist scheme .
In order to become easily identifiable as the " last name in the phone book " 
Holland took on the professional pseudonym of Zachary Zzzra .
Over the next 15 years , he had to periodically add some " z's "  as first a " Zelda Zzzwramp "  and then a " Vladimir Zzzzzzabokov "  ostensibly moved to town .
By 1979 , Holland 's painting contract business could be found under the unwieldy moniker of Zachary Zzzzzzzzzra .
