Rental Property Management Services For Property Owners and Tenants Across Sydney
What makes us stand out from the crowd ?
Good question .
Let ’s start at the top .
Back in 2005 , it was clear things were n’t working out in the rental game .
Owners were unhappy , tenants felt like second - class citizens and property managers were miserable .
Surely it did n’t need to be this way ?
Enter Let ’s Rent .
We made it our mission to turn property management on its head with a new philosophy , vibrant culture – and best of all – no sales agents .
This turned out to be the start of something big .
Since then , we ’ve continued to push the property management industry boundaries as far and wide as we can , never afraid to innovate and always providing our clients and their tenants with the stellar service they ’ve come to expect .
Our vision is to be the property management number one , offering a service where care , diligence , expertise and professionalism are paramount ; where owners and renters can trust that when it ’s needed , their property manager will get the job done .
We train to ensure we 're the best
We make a point of training our own team .
Why ?
We ’ve found that standard of property managers in the industry can be shockingly low , generally because of poor training ( or no training at all ) .
That ’s why we take the time to keep our team up to speed and make sure they ’ve got what it take to be industry experts .
We ’re structured for results Unlike other companies , we do n’t have portfolio managers .
Instead we have a task - based team structure with team members being highly skilled in select areas .
We ’ve found this gets the best results and cuts down on any possible risk such as rental arrears or property vacancy .
We ’re innovators
We ’re constantly looking to innovate to enable us to continue offering superior service .
For example , we use a cutting - edge software package that ’s used by only 90 other agents in Australia .
We think it ’s really given us the edge .
We ’re communicators Building positive relationships is a priority at Let ’s Rent .
After all , if we get on well with your tenant , they ’re less likely to move on .
And should they decide it ’s time to leave , we ’ll be in a better position to reduce your vacancy risk .
That ’s because tenants are only required to give access to show prospective new tenants through 14 days before they vacate .
Most of our tenants , however , happily allow access 4 weeks prior to vacating .
The result ?
The time between tenants moving out and a new lease starting can be as little as 3 - 7 days .
In an interview with Gamasutra , D2C founder and Madden veteran Scott Orr called Sony 's PlayStation Portable " a sleeping giant " in terms of possible sales .
D2C has lined up some new titles to be launched this spring for the PSP and WiiWare , including SPOGS Racing , the bull riding title we told you about earlier .
Gamasutra asked Orr why he chose these platforms over Xbox Live or PSN .
He cited the Wii's mass - market appeal , and added that the PSP is also well suited to the family - oriented , downloadable style games .
" I believe given its installed base and increasingly strong sales , the PSP platform is a sleeping giant just waiting for the right kind of content that ’s value priced and easily obtainable , " said Orr .
Orr went on to say that he 's not ruling out Live or PSN , but he did say that most titles have been " lacking in originality " up until this point .
Do you think the PSP has potential as a source of downloadable games ?
The US has criticised President Lukashenko's authoritarian regime
The decision was also prompted by US sanctions imposed on the country 's state - controlled oil - processing and chemicals company , Belneftekhim .
The Belarusian Foreign Ministry announced at the same time that it was recalling its own ambassador to the US .
A White House spokesman described the expulsion as " deeply disappointing " .
The United States - along with the European Union - has restricted the travel of authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko and members of his inner circle , as well as imposing economic sanctions .
We strongly regret this unjustified action by the Belarusian government .
This is deeply disappointing and only takes them further away from Europe and the rest of the world
Gordon Johndroe , White House spokesman
Both the US and the EU have demanded that President Lukashenko frees political prisoners , and allows more democratic regimes , before normal relations can be restored .
Mr Lukashenko has signalled that it would like better relations with the West , after Russia decided on a large increase in the prices of its oil exports to Belarus - which it relies on heavily .
Pressure from Washington
Some opposition activists were released this year , a move which was welcomed by the US State Department .
But there has been no response to pressure from Washington to release Alexander Kozulin , who challenged Mr Lukashenko in the 2006 presidential election , and was arrested during a post-election protest .
Mr Kozulin was allowed to attend his wife 's funeral , but then put back in prison .
The United States said the expulsion of its ambassador , Karen Stewart , further isolated Belarus from the West .
Preachers , pastors , priests and the like have played quite a role this political season .
Just ask Barack Obama – the Democratic presidential hopeful had to defend his ties to both Donnie McClurkin and Jeremiah Wright .
Republican John McCain , meanwhile , had a short - lived shit storm over John Hagee , the Catholic bashing preacher man who endorsed the Arizona Senator and blamed the gays for Hurricane Katrina .
McCain also had a bit of trouble from Rod Parsley , the Ohio - based Evangelical who takes regular swipes at the lavender set .
Certainly Parsley and Hagee ’s respective opinions are n’t the most progressive , they ’re less important to McCain than a man named Dan Yeary , the Baptist politico ’s actual preacher .
While Yeary ’s not as inflammatory as Parsley and Hagee , his views on the gays are pretty straight forward : we ’re sinners .
From the horse ’s mouth :
The entire canon of Scripture precisely teaches that sexual expression is intended for and restricted to the confines of heterosexual marriage .
Jesus never affirmed , permitted , or condoned homosexual expression or practice .
He clearly taught that God ’s intention was heterosexual marriage ( Matthew 19:1 - 9 ) .
The apostle Paul emphatically opposed the practice of homosexuality .
Romans 1:26 - 27 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 detail condemnation of homosexual expression with the view that such is unnatural .
McCain ’s voting record proves at least a small amount of agreement .
Yes , he opposed a federal amendment banning gay marriage , but that was only because McCain ’s a firm believer in state ’s rights , which he exhibited when he voted for his home state ’s own prohibition , which failed .
People in Yeary ’s position are known for their violent denouncements of gays , who some believe can be “ cured ” of their queer ways .
Yeary ’s not the naive , surprisingly , and does n’t endorse reparative therapy .
Rather , Yeary endorses the old fall back : celibacy .
Via Box Turtle Bulletin :
Outside the bonds of heterosexual marriage , the proper use of sexuality is to honor God by obedience .
Celibacy is a gift from God , and a chaste life is God ’s expectation .
Only God can provide the spiritual strength for this difficult commitment .
So , we gays do have a spiritual value , so long as we restrain our sexual expression .
That ’s fair , although his opinions still offend : “ Homosexuality breaks God ’s law .
Scripture is precisely prohibitive in defying homosexual practices .
God views homosexuality as detestable . ”
He also describes homosexuality as “ less than ideal and is the product of the fall of humanity .
Though he does n’t necessarily believe in ex-gay therapies , Yeary clearly believes the gays can be saved via the power of Christ :
A significant key to hope for the homosexual is the response of Christians .
Repulsive acts must not be permitted to cause us to reject persons .
We must minister with grace to all who need love , respect , and forgiveness .
We must repent of our arrogance and intolerance and learn to love the sinner convincingly while condemning sin clearly .
Some voters may find Yeary ’s relative tolerance to be a blessing , but his ultimate take causes us concern :
Viewing persons and the practice of homosexuality from the perspective of biblical revelation is both responsible and redemptive .
Biblical principles must take priority over public opinion or practice .
Religious hegemony ?
That ’s far scarier than anything Wright ever dished out .
What if our cellphones , instead of sound alone , could provide a pleasant fragrance to go along ?
Does that sound like something useful ?
NTT Communications are working on a way to combine smell with a tone , using a special infrared device .
Users would download a “ recipe ” for a fragrance from a specific site , and by an simple command , the device will “ cook ” that smell and provide the scent of your choice .
In addition , since this is wireless , it is envisioned to be taken to your workplace , vehicle , and any other place you would like to provide a special scent .
I may be jumping ahead here , but what if this special device would become a lot more mobile ?
Would n’t we be able to have actual smell tones ?
Just imagine assigning different scents to your friends , family and co-workers .
If something smells awful , you could always blame it that your boss has called .
If your loved ones call , an amazing scent can be distributed within the room .
What do you think ?
Would you download special smell tones ?
Better yet , would you like to make your own special smell tones for different colleagues ?

" Augmented Cognition , " the Darpa program to build computer interfaces that adapt to their users ' brains , has officially run its course .
But efforts to build mind - reading PCs continue throughout the military establishment .
Augmented Cognition relies on the idea that people have more than one kind of working memory , and more than one kind of attention ; there are separate slots in the mind for things written , things heard and things seen .
By monitoring how taxed those areas of the brain are , it should be possible to change a computer 's display to compensate .
If people are getting too much visual information , send them a text alert .
If they reading too much at once , present some of the data visually – in a chart or map .
The Air Force has tapped Design Interactive , Inc. to
build a battlefield command - and - control system that works along these lines .
It 's supposed to use EEG and eye - tracking monitors to " assess the operator 's actual cognitive state . "
That way , the system can play around with its " information display " to " avoid cognitive bottlenecks before they occur . "
And that 's just the start .
Eventually , the company wants the program to " anticipate future mission state and operator functional state ahead of time , " too .
This Air Force has also handed out a contract to Quantum Applied Science and Research , Inc. – that 's right , QUASAR for short – to perfect a mind - reading interface for squads of killer drones .
Supervising all those armed , flying robots might be doable when things are relatively calm .
But , in the heat of battle , it might be too much for one puny human mind to handle unassisted .
Darpa is n't done with these technologies , either .
The agency plans to spend $ 12 million next year on brain - science programs like Neurotechnology for Intelligence Analysts .
It 's an AugCog - inspired effort to tap the firings of the subconscious mind to sort through satellite pictures quickly .
Early tests have shown as much as a six - fold increase in the analysts ' efficiency , when the computer and the brain work together .

Angola to allow arms ship to dock
Reports say the ship is carrying millions of rounds of ammunition Angola 's government has authorised a Chinese ship carrying arms destined for Zimbabwe to dock , although it says it will not be allowed to unload weapons .
In a statement , the government said the vessel would only be allowed to deliver goods intended for Angola .
On Thursday , the Chinese authorities said they would recall the ship to China after port workers in South Africa refused to unload the weapons .
Other southern African countries had also refused to allow the ship to dock .
Leaders in the region had expressed concern that the weapons could heighten tensions in Zimbabwe .
The results of presidential elections held there nearly a month ago have still not been released .
Grenades
The state news agency , Angop , said the ship , the An Yue Jiang , had been authorised to dock in the capital Luanda .
Zimbabwe needs to arm itself more than any other country in Africa today for the simple reason that it has been targeted for destabilisation
Herald newspaper
Zimbabwe
But it can only unload " merchandise destined for Angola " , a government statement said .
Angola is a close ally of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe .
On Thursday , a Chinese foreign ministry official said the ship , which reportedly contains three million rounds of ammunition , 1,500 rocket - propelled grenades and 2,500 mortar rounds , might return to China .
The US had urged China to recall the An Yue Jiang , while the UK called for an international arms embargo on Zimbabwe .
Zambia 's president urged African countries not to let the arms in .
But Zimbabwe 's state - run Herald newspaper condemned the country 's neighbours as " myopic stooges " for refusing to let the cargo dock .
" Zimbabwe is ... under attack from the former coloniser and its allies .
As such , Zimbabwe probably needs to arm itself more than any other country in Africa today , " the paper said .

Ava M. Paquette , Esq.Moxon & Kobrin3055 Wilshire Boulevard , Suite 900 Los Angles , CA 90010Re : Michael Pattinson v. Church of Scientology International , USDC , CV - 98-3985 .Dear Ms. Paquette : I know that David Miscavige ( “ DM ” ) , Tom Cruise ( “ TC ” ) and you have been expecting me as well as this Epistle to Tom and David .
My clients Anonymous “ do not forgive .
They do not forget . ”
Neither do I .
The world ’s fastest shrinking religion and satanic based cult is now locked in a struggle for “ truth revealed ” with the worlds fastest growing global protest group of the technology age and the 21st Century , ‘ Anonymous . ’
On Saturday April 12 , 2008 , as I participated in the third monthly global picket of Scientology offices by over 10 , 000 supporters of Anonymous in over 110 cities in over 42 nations , your legal unit of the Church of Scientology Office of Special Affairs ( “ OSA ” ) chose to very publicly serve me with a Judgment Debtor Examination subpoena in the above - captioned case ; using the “ fruits ” of the demonstrably fraudulent and criminally based orders your OSA Legal Unit and it ’s co-counsel such as former Paul , Hastings partner Samuel D. Rosen , Esq. and former Orrick , Herrington & Sutcliffe partner Gerald Chaleff , Esq. obtained in the Pattinson , Berry and Jeavon ’s cases .
At the time of this sordid service , in view of over 300 protestors , there was a global picket of over 10,000 people against , among other things , your OSA legal units R.I.C.O. abuses of the legal system .
In fact , it was a continuation of Scientology ’s copyright frauds , usually perpetrated through your own OSA Legal Unit , which triggered the continuing monthly global protests against Scientology ’s criminal racketeering , human rights and civil rights abuses .
This on - going copyright fraud is frequently commenced by what is publicly and derisively called the ‘ Avagram ; ’ a letter or email from Ava Paquette expressing reliance upon fraudulently obtained Scientology copyrights to chill otherwise free speech , fair use , and fair comment .
Indeed , it was demonstrable copyright fraud , among other things such as my filing of the L. Ron Hubbard Estate Probate Petition [ click on http://www.factnet.org/probate1.htm ] , that led the Scientology RICO enterprise to back - out of the RTC v. Erlich and the RTC v. FACT Net cases !
As you should also know , your copyright claims have weakened even further since those settlements ( with Scientology actually paying over five million dollars in benefits to Rev. Dennis Erlich through his pro bono lawyers at Morrison & Foerster ) .
This past Saturday morning at the junction of Sunset Boulevard and L. Ron Hubbard Way , when your OSA Legal Unit had me served in front of all of these protesters and gathered media , your very own Kendrick L. Moxon , Esq. ( an unindicted co-conspirator in U.S. v. Hubbard , 668 F. 2d 1238 ( 1981 ) was watching from some 40 feet away .
The service occurred in front of “ The Way to Happiness , ” which was unlawfully closed to the general public upon instructions to the LAPD from Scientology attorney Kendrick L. Moxon .
The resulting civil rights and other violations have been and are being separately addressed to more appropriate local , state and federal venues .
Attorney Moxon ’s active participation in the stipulated provision of fabricated evidence , as part of a stipulated conspiracy to obstruct justice in the largest ever criminal infiltration of the United States Federal Government , is described in the 284 page stipulation of evidence agreed to and signed by attorneys for the Church of Scientology .
Mr. Moxon ’s own criminal role is explained at pages 197 , 198 ( footnote # 143 ) , 213 , 214 and 239 of the Stipulation of Facts entered into by the Church of Scientology attorneys and the U.S. Department of Justice .
It can be read at this hyperlink : http://www.lermanet.com/reference/stipu ... SvsMSH.txt Also see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White and http://www.holysmoke.org/cos/mary-sue-h ... randum.htm and http://www.antisectes.net/usa-vs-msh-ap ... randum.htm and http://www.holysmoke.org/grand-jury.htm
Mr. Moxon ’s involvement in the current R.I.C.O. enterprise commenced just a few short years after this devastating description of his and his Church ’s criminal activities .
It included his early 1980s participation in the execution of the church ’s copyrighted policies and practices for “ the handling of Suppressive Persons ” against former Scientologists and litigants Gerry Armstrong and Lawrence Wollersheim , and it continues in an unbroken chain through to today .
Later this summer I expect to publicly examine many witnesses to much of this RICO activity and other civil rights and human rights violations !
See , http://www.fairgamed.org/nocancl1.htm
Also Google : Moxon and dog and Swearinger .
Finally , Google : Kendrick Moxon and scientology .
I. SUMMARY OF PERTINENT BACKGROUND FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCESClearly , this latest abusive legal process you have served upon me last Saturday is not about the sanctions obtained herein through multiple frauds upon multiple courts .
Instead , it is more about trying to chill the exercise of my First Amendment rights to protest Scientology Disconnection policies , and other Scientology related abusive and coercive conduct , which has destroyed so many families .
These civil and human rights abuses were the theme of the world - wide anti-scientology pickets of that day .
Next month , the protest issues will include the very essence of the “ Fair Game ” activities that your organization has been employing against me personally , with many tens of millions of tax exempt celebrity dollars , for over 15 years .
Your R.I.C.O. enterprise ’s more recent brutal and terrifying invasion of privacy and intimidation of hundreds of young Anonymous protesters and their parents , with home visits from hundreds of Scientology hired goons , has been properly described by various media out - lets as despicable and blatant criminal civil rights violations .
In light of my April 11 , 2008 filings in that regard , your April 12 service of me assumes an ominous and suspicious hue .
Even more blatantly , your flamboyant service this past Saturday morning followed only 21 hours after the LAPD received a letter and enclosures from me , as one of the pro bono counsel for Anonymous , complaining of serious civil rights and other criminal violations being perpetrated by both the Scientology enterprise and your office / OSA Legal Unit against numerous Anonymous protest participants and requesting emergency LAPD intervention .
These young Anonymous protesters have been stalked , identified and harassed by the hundreds of private investigators you and your OSA legal unit have hired , to intimidate these courageous youths and young adults .
Significantly , the currently relevant portion of that April 11 , 2008 letter to the LAPD read as follows : CIVIL RIGHTS AND R.I.C.O. VIOLATIONSL .
Ron Hubbard Way , Los AngelesMarch 15 , 2008 and April 12 , 2008CONFLICTS OF INTEREST .
TOTAL SCREENING REQUESTED .Police Command Team member , L.A.P.D attorney , Gerald Chaleff , Esq. has been one of the senior most attorneys in the Church of Scientology legal teams and is a participant in the long history of R.I.C.O. violations that are the subject of the criminal R.I.C.O. investigations that are being requested by further filings next week .
He has also been a co-counsel with Scientology lawyers Moxon , Kobrin and Paquette in Church of Scientology cases and litigation conduct during the early to mid 1990s , when he moved to the L.A .
City attorneys office to intervene in resulting requests for prosecution that are part of the 25 years R.I.C.O. activity that is being addressed in the filings .
These filings and associated requests are being submitted to local , state and federal law enforcement and legislators .
As the Commanding Officer of the LAPD R.I.C.O. Consent Decree Bureau , Police Administrator Gerald L. Chaleff , Esq. has a clear conflict of interest in these matters and he should be precluded from having any access to any part of these matters , or any knowledge of these matters .
Similarly , Paul Paquette , Esq. of the L.A. City Attorneys Office ( R.I.C.O. consent decree unit ) is a Scientologist and is married to Ava Paquette , Esq. , who is an attorney in the Church of Scientology Office of Special Affairs Legal Unit known as Moxon & Kobrin .
She is a participant in the R.I.C.O. relief to be requested , and is involved in the initial matters addressed herein by way of this emergency request for immediate intervention and immediate remedial measures to be taken in connection with the Anonymous global protests on April 12 , 2008 - one of which will take place on L. Ron Hubbard Way from 11 AM until 1 - 30 PM .
See : Supporting Declaration of Graham E. Berry ( “ Berry Declaration ” ) paragraphs 12 , 30 - 38 , 42 , 46-48 , 57 , 94 , 115 , 126-140 .
Some of the racketeering conduct , directed at me personally , by your office / OSA - Legal Unit has been described on pages 20 - 80 of the hyperlinked email version of this January 21 , 2002 letter to the U.S. Department of Justice : http://www.lermanet2.com/reference//Gra ... plaint.htm
In addition to the evidence referred to therein , much of it still protected in safe places , there is the subsequent evidence of further obstruction of justice perpetrated against me by your Mr. Moxon at the Dandar disqualification hearing in the Lisa McPherson v. Church of Scientology wrongful death case ; specifically the suborning of perjury from Stacy Brooks and rebutted by the corroborated testimony of her former husband the late Robert Vaughan Young .
Then there is the new evidence obtainable from some of the actual participants in your OSA Legal Units racketeering activity against me .
Interestingly , only this year the head of the Church of Scientology in New Zealand confirmed in a public statement to the media that the Church of Scientology had hired private investigators to follow me when I had been visiting my parents in New Zealand in 1995 / 1996 .
“ I think we were curious about what Graham Berry was up to , ” said Scientology Rev. Mike Ferris .
http://www.stuff.co.nz/4403031a20455.html
You may also recall , from previous matters , that your private investigator on that occasion was requested , but refused , to engage in an unlawful wiretap of my parent ’s telephone .
In refusing those instructions of Scientology ’s Office of Special Affairs , in which you and the Moxon & Kobrin OSA Legal Unit also work , the private investigator commented that “ the New Zealand Police treat unlawful telephone tapping much more seriously than appears to be the case in the United States . ”
At least as it concerns Scientology ’s Office of Special Affairs that appears to be a true statement .
As I wrote on pages 51 - 52 of my January 21 , 2002 criminal , civil rights violations , etc. complaint the U.S. Attorney – General : “ The Hurtados went along with whatever the lawyers , Wager and Moxon , and Scientology ’s investigator Ingram told them to do .
The Hurtados even went so far as to allow Ingram to tap their phone to entrap me .
I had similarly found Abelson and Scientology illegally tapped into my telephone line on December 11 , 1996 .
The FBI did nothing on that occasion either .
Illegal wiretapping is par for the course for the Church of Scientology : “ The Scientology Guardian ’s Office Group [ now renamed “ OSA ” ] illegally wiretapped several federal agencies , including the Internal Revenue Service ( “ IRS ” ) , a perennial Scientology foe . ”
http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/010/7.90.html
In fact , Michael Hurtado did not agree with Wager and Moxon to sue me because of what was allegedly done to him .
Instead , Michael Hurtado testified he had ( only ) sued for money ( as opposed to something I had done to him ) and because of the contents of the perjured First Cipriano Declaration , which Moxon showed him and discussed with him .
Accordingly , Moxon was using perjury he had been instrumental in extorting to procure yet more perjury to file a merit less lawsuit with which to intentionally obstruct justice in Berry v. Cipriano , Barton , Miscavige , Church of Scientology International , Ingram ( Moxon , Abelson ) and later to file two frivolous lawsuits , a federal bankruptcy claim and numerous ( fraudulent ) insurance demands starting at $ 750,000 .
Wager did not meet with Michael Hurtado until January 22 , 1999 , after Wager had met with Abelson , Ingram , Moxon and the Hurtado family .
Michael Hurtado has testified that he was told by Ingram that Moxon was “ an attorney watching Berry for a long time because Berry is a bad person . ”
Moxon had “ been trying bury the guy [ Berry ] for his wrongdoings [ against the Church ? ] for a long time .
” Since the time you fraudulently obtained the orders you did in this Michael Pattinson case , and in the associated Berry and Jeavon ’s cases , there has been much adverse comment upon what your many co-counsel had the Federal had and State Judges wrongly do herein .
Perhaps they will one day show the same strength of judicial character as did D.C. District Court Judge Leona Brinkema in RTC v. Lerma where she stated , in a November 25 , 1995 Memorandum Opinion that , “ the Court is now convinced that the primary motivation of RTC in suing Lerma , DGS and The Post is to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics . ”
Similarly , U.S. Special Master James Kolts has ruled that “ Plaintiffs [ the Church of Scientology ] have abused the federal court system by using it , inter alia , to destroy their opponents rather than to try and resolve an actual dispute …
This constitutes extraordinary , malicious , wanton and oppressive conduct . ”
See generally , http://www.lermanet.com/scientology/legal/main.html
Indeed , only last week the New York Village Voice , in a March 11 , 2008 , story by Tony Ortega titled , “ How ‘ Anonymous ’ has Changed the Game of Exposing Scientology ’s Ruthless Global Scam , ” wrote :
“ In another story , we put the lie to the church 's claim that it no longer practices " Fair Game " -- L. Ron 's famous edict that his troops should engage in dirty tricks to bury its perceived enemies .
In " Double Crossed , " we detailed one of the most hellacious cases of Fair Game in recent years , the smearing of attorney Graham Berry with the use of a coerced , false affidavit claiming that Berry was a pederast who went after boys as young as 12 .
When the man who made that false affidavit , Robert Cipriano , was sued by Berry in a defamation suit , the church , in order to keep him from recanting his false claims , offered to represent him in the lawsuit for free , donated thousands to Cipriano 's nonprofit projects , and even got him a house , a car , and a job at Earthlink ( which had been founded by Scientologists ) . ” Emphasis added .
You can remind yourself of some your office ’s frauds , crimes and ethical violations against me by reading the story here http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-
... e-crossed / The Church of Scientology now compares me to Hitler , Mussolini and Stalin and brands me an “ Anti-Religious Extremist ” even though I say my Episcopalian prayers every night before sleep .

This website is demonstrably connected to the Office of Special Affairs in which you work , as also did the fiancé of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Alexander Williams at the same time he was refusing to recuse himself from your legally merit less vexatious litigant petition and doing the bidding of Gerald Chaleff , Esq. , and you who were also representing the Church of Scientology against me .
Concurrently , your office was engaging in similar wrongful conduct in the Pattinson v. Church of Scientology case and using the fruits of frauds upon two Los Angeles Superior Courts to perpetrate equally serious frauds upon the federal court in this Pattinson v. CSI case ( and the related Reveillere v. Pattinson case ) including the sanctions order herein , suspiciously worded as if written within the Office of Special Affairs itself .
See generally , http://www.lermanet.com/reference/Cipri ... .20.99.pdf
Also further URLs to some of the evidence : http://www.lermanet.com/search/sessearc
... ec=&pvdc=0 Against this background of demonstrable and directly related blackmail , bribery , perjury , fraud and obstruction of justice , among other things , you now use the fraudulently obtained and now clearly inequitable order from Michael Pattinson v. Church of Scientology International for the further improper purpose of trying to chill my First Amendment rights as part of a massive and demonstrative R.I.C.O. enterprise dating back over twenty - five years and involving many of the same corporate and individual participants throughout .
For example , Captain David Miscavige , Michael Rinder , Rev. Lynn Farney , Kendrick Moxon , Esq. , Helena Kobrin , yourself and private investigator Eugene Ingram ( himself formerly of the L.A.P.D. ) .
Crimes built upon crimes and frauds built upon frauds , in a host of overlapping civil law suits , criminal conspiracies and criminal conduct comprising a rich mosaic of obstruction of justice and public corruption .
As GO / OSA operations go , this massive public corruption was actually a relatively small project .
The reported judicial decisions and stipulated evidence demonstrate that even the U.S. Department of Justice and the I.R.S. were burgled by OSA ’s predecessor as the B1 Division of Department 20 , where Scientology attorney Kendrick L. Moxon was an Assistant Guardian and active participant .
See generally : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Special_Affairs .
OSA is now the home of Scientology ’s Department 20 and its B - 1 and B - 2 divisions .
In 1993 DM and OSA made fraudulent material misrepresentations to the IRS concerning all this , as part of DM and Moxon ’s coercion and corruption of this branch of the U.S. Department of the Treasury .
However , since January 13 , 2008 things have been going from bad to worse for OSA and its faux religious front , the churches and corporations of Scientology .
As a direct consequence of your own copyright abuses in trying to remove scientology related documents and videos from the Internet , your own OSA Legal Unit has angered and activitated tens of thousands of people around the globe .
Fatally , you have responded by unmasking and attacking hundreds of these young Anonymous picketers , accusing them in false police reports of fabricated wrong - doings , and now by attacking their more visible representatives such as Tory Christman .
See , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory_Christman and http://www.torymagoo.org/
Similarly , and just a few days earlier , you publicly served me with a subpoena really intended to chill my first amendment rights as a citizen and my professional duties as one of the pro bono counsel to the global Anonymous group .
And what is the net result of all this continued racketeering activity by the Scientology enterprise ?
It includes , within just three months : ( 1 ) an over 50 % drop in Scientology ’s gross income ( “ g.i. ” ) ; ( 2 ) an over 50 % drop in those “ on course ” or being “ processed ” by the cult ; ( 3 ) staff , including very senior executives , leaving Scientology in record numbers such that Scientology ’s “ Gold Base ” at Gilman Hot Springs is now down from about 1,200 staffers to about 400 staffers , of whom some forty senior executives are under guard in the “ SP Hall ” or “ hole ; ” ( 5 ) major unhandled PR “ flaps ” worldwide ; ( 6 ) the posting of the entire Scientology ‘ Bridge to Total Freedom ’ on Wikileaks where it will likely remain available to “ the Free Zoners ” and merely curious alike .
Ironically , Hubbard ’s ‘ Bridge to Total Freedom ’ does not include freedom of thought , word or deed .
However , we know that DM and TC are nervous .
They know they are surrounded by subordinates who are potential traitors to them personally and who are daily betraying them with a flood of organizational leaks never seen before in this totalitarian and paramilitary organization which is strictly compartmentalized into operating units with information on a “ need to know ” basis only , and with strongly enforced rules against “ nattering ” and “ doubt ” among the ranks .
Any moment a disgruntled senior executive , perhaps badly battered and violently beaten by DM , may escape from the “ SP Hall ” or “ hole ” at the “ Gold Base ” in Gilman Hot Springs , run like Rinder , and turn state ’s evidence .
After all , “ the first [ of you ] to testify will get immunity and the rest [ of you ] will get federal prison . ”
Neither DM nor TC would do very well there .
Last week alone the following events also occurred : ( 1 ) Scientology schools were shut down in Israel and Denmark for not meeting the State ’s curriculum and student performance requirements ; ( 2 ) Scientology facilities were raided and shut down by the Government in Belgium ; ( 3 ) Scientology closed it ’s doors in Düsseldorf , Germany and in several locations in the U.S. ; ( 4 ) Scientology encountered even more problems in Russia ; ( 5 ) Tom Cruise ’s 32 year old German driver became another “ suicide ” victim [ as did Clearwater , FL . scientology critic Shawn Lonsdale several weeks ago ] ; ( 6 ) Germany , France and Belgium continued working on a plan to ban Church of Scientology International ( and OSA ) as a foreign headquartered terrorist group ( in California , USA ) ; and ( 7 ) Jenna Miscavige , the niece of Scientology ’s supreme leader , picketed against her former church with Anonymous in Los Angeles , standing right outside the doors of OSA .
There the following telling encounter occurred .
Amy Zack asked your security guards to request her sister Kelly to come down and speak with her on the sidewalk .
Amy wanted to tell her older sister Kelly that she was pregnant , and that Kelly was about to be an Aunt .
Kelly , a member of your Sea Organization , was working upstairs and near your own offices as Amy spoke to the Church of Scientology International security guards in the OSA building lobby .
The Church of Scientology and OSA representatives refused to permit even this shred of humanity and family to exist between the two sisters ; one a Scientology OSA staffer and one a former Scientologist .
This week has not been any better for your OSA - Legal Unit .
By way of example only : ( 1 ) Former Scientology celebrity actor Jason Beghe has left the church and labeled it “ brainwashing ” and “ dangerous ” in media appearances ; ( 2 ) another Scientology - related “ suicide ” occurred , this time involving the daughter of a parliamentarian in Norway [ see generally , http://whyaretheydead.net ] ; ( 3 ) Boston school officials expressed concern about the curriculum of Scientology “ Applied Scholastics ” schools in Boston ; and ( 4 ) OSA ran an unsuccessful “ op ” to shut down the You Tube account of former 30 year Scientologist , OT VII and OSA volunteer Tory Christman ( so beloved by the Anonymous young ) .
Your response , only three days earlier , was to attack me as though I am the only “ Who ” and “ Why ” in all that has happened to much diminish and expose Scientology since I filed the upper level ( OT ) materials in the Fishman & Geertz case .
As you know , this OT filing ultimately freed Xenu from his captivity as a religious “ trade secret , ” which OSA had successfully argued in the Vien case and in the civil R.I.C.O. cases OSA ironically filed in RTC v. Scott .
These defeats that Scientology has regularly suffered since the Yanny I and Yanny II cases of 1989 - 1991 are the ‘ end product ’ of OSA ’s very own R.I.C.O. activities .
David Miscavige , Tom Cruise , OSA and the Church have “ pulled it in themselves ” to use their own vernacular .
Consequently , the “ state of emergency ” that has existed in the Church for nearly ten years is entirely of DM ’s and TC ’s own making .
For example , just look at the current “ end product ” of the many million dollars of celebrity tax exempt dollars that the Church of Scientology has spent just to destroy me , since February 1994 .
Both Church of Scientology Secretary and OSA Internet Unit C.O. Rev. Lynn Farny , and the OSA Legal Unit ’s Kendrick L. Moxon , have testified that in February 1994 they directed disgraced former LAPD Sergeant Ingram to , in essence , “ utterly destroy ” me .
As evidenced by the documents and the witnesses , they then blackmailed and bribed Robert Cipriano ( and along with Aznaran , Scarff , Hurtado , Apodaca and Brooks ) , and obstructed justice and corrupted courts on an amazing scale , even for the notorious and infamous Church of Scientology .
In February 1994 I had not spoken about Scientology outside of the court room , and I would not picket the cult for another five years .
All I had done was to successfully participate in the Yanny I and Yanny II cases , the Armstrong II case , the Fishman - Geertz case , and to provide material assistance to Floyd Abrams , Esq. in the Time magazine case .
Of course , until I came along no lawyer had ever used former senior scientologists as expert witnesses against the Church of Scientology in litigation , for example , the Aznarans , the Tabayoyons , the Youngs and the Whitfields .
The evidence establishes all this R.I.C.O. crime and corruption beyond any reasonable doubt .
Hence , the need for ‘ posting ’ Gerald Chaleff , Esq. and your own husband Paul Paquette , Esq. to their respective R.I.C.O. supervisory positions at the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles City Attorney ’s office .
Indeed , if eminent pro bono counsel were to volunteer representation , I would promptly move to set aside all of the relevant and related orders your OSA - Legal Unit obtained through frauds upon the court and corruption in the Berry case ( s ) before Judge Alexander Williams , III , and obtained using the fruits of those frauds and that corruption in this Michael Pattinson v. Church of Scientology case before Federal Judge Snyder .
The “ end product ” of all that you have spent on “ utterly destroying ” me has only made things progressively worse for the Church of Scientology and its well documented criminal conduct and civil rights abuses .
Ordinarily , some one should be doing Scientology “ lower conditions ” for such a massive ‘ operation foot bullet . ’
Of course , this cannot happen because it was David Miscavige ’s own orders , “ crossing corporate lines , ” that had triggered the start of Scientology ’s R.I.C.O. activity against me in 1994 , in an arrogant and lawless continuing material breach of Miscavige ’s 1993 secret tax settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury / IRS .
This is also a matter that my pro bono client Anonymous is preparing to take to appropriate forums for investigation .
I am sure that “ Scientology [ still ] welcomes a public investigation .
” As an aside , it has been reliably reported to me that from time to time David Miscavige has bull sessions with some of his senior executives .
At those bull sessions he has reportedly disclosed and discussed the contents of customers / parishioners confidential pre-clear folders [ written confessionals ] .
For example , it is reported that David Miscavige has said that “ something has to be done about TC ’s gay thoughts and about JT ’s gay encounters . ”
That is disgraceful duplicity and breach of confidences !
Now that I have put your abusive litigation and hypocrisy into their proper context , within the totality of the circumstances of the on- going R.I.C.O. enterprise ( that the manner in which you obtained the various court orders herein were a part of ) , I shall address the deficiencies and defects in the document demand attached to your subpoena of me obtained April 2 , 2008 and blatantly held for harassing public service on April 12 , 2008 .II .

$ 27,000 owed me by Lumin - Oz , Inc. which you received in connection with an earlier Examination Under Oath .

Accordingly , I shall be bringing my own volunteer videographer to video tape the May 5 travesty of justice herein .

Ava , even you should know that neither Coca - Cola nor the Church of Scientology can lawfully restrain the mere mention of their names in a non-commercial and non-exploitative context .
In all of the circumstances , there can be little wonder as to why various European governments are now seeking to ban the Hollywood headquartered Church of Scientology International ( and it ’s OSA ) as a “ foreign headquartered terrorist organization .
Accordingly , on behalf of my pro bono client ( s ) the various participants in Anonymous , and in my own behalf , I express my outrage at such Orwellian violations of the First Amendment and all of our civil rights .
Are you first an officer of the California and Federal Courts , or are you first a Scientologist complying with Keeping Scientology Working # 1 and the handling orders being screamed and belted down by Captain David Miscavige and his best vacation buddy TC ?
Obviously you cannot be both and by the above - described conduct both you and your various co-counsel have shown that you are loyal to David Miscavige and Scientology first , and to your oath as an officer of the court last !

John McCain Refuses to Release his Wife ’s Tax Records
In a move that seems quite a bit John Kerry - esque , John McCain has refused to release his wife ’s tax records .
This is a man who claims he wants to bring “ transparency ” back to Washington .
John McCain on Friday faced accusations of hypocrisy for failing to disclose his wife ’s tax records , despite his promise to bring greater transparency and accountability to government .
Transparency and accountability indeed , but only when it applies to other people it seems .
McCain has released his own tax records , he files separately from his wife , but refuses to release his wife ’s to protect the privacy of their children .
This excuse does n’t fly when it comes to Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington who said :
“ McCain has been the most outspoken about ethics so he is held to a particularly high standard of transparency , ”
If John McCain wants to put his money , pardon the pun , where his mouth is then it is time for him to do what John Kerry finally did , and what Hillary Clinton finally did and release the tax records .
This whole do as I say not as I do attitude makes John McCain come off as a lecturing parent figure and not a leader of the free world .
In a move years ago that was also John Kerry - esque John McCain left his wife for a rich heiress and joined the senate .
The parallels are striking .
Not releasing his wife ’s tax records shows us an elitist attitude , the same elitist attitude he is trying to pin on Obama and Clinton .
The same elitist attitude of John Kerry .
But their records have been made public , when will yours be Senator McCain ?
Picture , if you will , a tree - lined plaza in Baghdad 's International Village , flanked by fashion boutiques , swanky cafes , and shiny glass office towers .
Nearby a golf course nestles agreeably , where a chip over the water to the final green is but a prelude to cocktails in the club house and a soothing massage in a luxury hotel , which would not look out of place in Sydney harbour .
Then , as twilight falls , a pre-prandial stroll , perhaps , amid the cool of the Tigris Riverfront Park , where the peace is broken only by the soulful cries of egrets fishing .
Improbable though it all may seem , this is how some imaginative types in the US military are envisaging the future of Baghdad 's Green Zone , the much - pummelled redoubt of the Iraqi capital where a bunker shot has until now had very different connotations .
A $ 5 bn ( £ 2.5 bn ) tourism and development scheme for the Green Zone being hatched by the Pentagon and an international investment consortium would give the heavily fortified area on the banks of the Tigris a " dream " makeover that will become a magnet for Iraqis , tourists , business people and investors .
About half of the area is now occupied by coalition forces , the US state department or private foreign companies .
The US military released the first tentative artists ' impression yesterday .
An army source said the barbed wire , concrete blast barriers and checkpoints that currently disfigure the 5 sq mile area would be replaced by shopping malls , hotels , elegant apartment blocks and leisure parks .
" This is at the end of the day an Iraqi - owned area and we will give it back to them with added value , " said the source , who requested anonymity .
Potential investors are being encouraged to take a punt that years ahead , Baghdad 's fortunes may mirror former war - torn cities such as Sarajevo and Beirut that have risen from the ashes .
Marriott International has already signed a deal to build a hotel in the Green Zone , according to Navy Captain Thomas Karnowski , the chief US liaison .
Also in the pipeline is a possible $ 1bn investment from MBI International , a hotel and resorts specialist led by Saudi sheikh , Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber .
One Los Angeles - based firm , C3 , has said it wants to build an amusement park on the Green Zone 's outskirts .
As part of the first phase , a skateboard park is due to open this summer .
American officials stress that final decisions about reconstruction and development rest with the Iraqi government .
Karnowski added that as well as the benefits of renovating and demilitarising an important area of Baghdad , the blueprint would help to create a " zone of influence " around the massive new US Embassy compound being built on the eastern tip of the Green Zone .
The $ 1bn project to move the embassy from Saddam 's old presidential palace is planned for completion later this year .
" When you have $ 1bn hanging out there and 1,000 employees lying around , you kind of want to know who your neighbours are .
You want to influence what happens in your neighbourhood over time , " Karnowski told Associated Press .
He acknowledged that any project would face formidable difficulties : " There is no sewer system , no working power system .
Everything here is done on generators .
No road repair work .
There are no city services other than the minimal amount we provide to get by . "
There is also the not insignificant matter of the dire security situation .
Shia militants under attack from US and Iraqi forces elsewhere in the capital have been launching volleys of rockets on the Green Zone for much of the last month .
Despite the apparent Pentagon enthusiasm , other US officials in Baghdad seemed more sceptical .
" We approach this with perhaps a dose of realism , " offered one .
" These are issues for the Iraqis to discuss .
We do not own the International Zone , and its future is really up to the Iraqis . "
For many Baghdad residents , the Green Zone has been a no - go area for years , first under Saddam and now under the occupation .
" What do I care ? " shrugged one , Ahmed Hussein .
" I do n't have electricity , I do n't have fresh water and I do n't have a job . "

So called " doctor " Dr. Phil continues to give bad advice to millions of families across the nation when it comes to the subject of sexual orientation and gender identity .
His current advice column suggests how to " fix " a gender variant child and another part of his website paints LGBT marriage as " extreme " .
Whether it 's giving a platform to transphobia , bi-phobia or anti-gay voices there seems to be a fairly consistent message that paints our community in a damaging and inaccurate way .
Dr. Phil has been most inaccurate and down right offensive when it comes to the transgender and gender variant community .
His current online advice column called " My 5 year old son prefers girls clothes and toys " encourages a mother to modify her child 's behavior .
" Direct your son in an unconfusing way .
Do n't buy him Barbie dolls or girl 's clothes .
You do n't want to do things that seem to support the confusion at this stage of the game ...
Take the girl things away , and buy him boy toys .
Support him in what he 's doing , but not in the girl things . "
( Dr. Phil )
Dr. Phil operates under the premise that gender variance is abnormal and that the child must be confused when it is really the adults in this situation who are confused because they are faced head on with their own internal misconceptions of gender identity / expression .
Dr. Phil also has a section of his website called " Extreme Marriages " where he talks about marriages involving LGBT individuals .
Scary right ?
If he wants to convey unusual or challenging circumstances there are different words that can be used to express that .
There have been changes in recent months that indicate that perhaps he is softening his heart and standing with the LGBT community .
He has spoken out against gay bullying and admits that being gay is not a choice .
We must continue to pressure him to accept our transgender brethren and eliminate all forms of queerphobia .
Send your comments to Dr. Phil demanding he stop his anti-LGBT commentary .
Demand he pull these and other offensive columns and segments .

Giuliani Defends , Employs Priest Accused of Molesting Teens
The disgraced priest is accused of abusing two former students and an altar boy .
Oct. 23 , 2007  --
Presidential candidate Rudolph Giuliani hired a Catholic priest to work in his consulting firm months after the priest was accused of sexually molesting two former students and an altar boy and told by the church to stop performing his priestly duties .
The priest , Monsignor Alan Placa , a longtime friend of Giuliani and the priest who officiated at his second wedding to Donna Hanover , continues to work at Giuliani Partners in New York , to the outrage of some of his accusers and victims ' groups , which have begun to protest at Giuliani campaign events .
" This man did unjust things , and he 's being protected and employed and taken care of .
It 's not a good thing , " said one of the accusers , Richard Tollner , who says Placa molested him repeatedly when he was a student at a Long Island , N.Y. Catholic boys high school in 1975 .
At a campaign appearance in Milwaukee last week , Giuliani continued to defend Placa , who he described to reporters as a close friend for 39 years .

" I know the man ; I know who he is , so I support him , " Giuliani said .
" We give some of the worst people in our society the presumption of innocence and benefit of the doubt , " he said .
" And , of course , I 'm going to give that to one of my closest friends . "
The accusations against Placa were made in testimony before a Suffolk County grand jury in 2002 .
Tollner , now a mortgage broker in Albany , N.Y. , says he was one of three people to testify about Placa .
" This man harmed children .
He still could do it .
He deserves to be shown for what he was , or is , " says Tollner .
Appearing publicly for the first time today on ABC News ' " Good Morning America , " Tollner says the abuse started when he and Placa were in the high school making posters for a Right to Life march .
" As he started to explain how these posters should be done , I realized that something was rubbing my body , " Tollner said .
" After a minute or two , I realized that he 's feeling me , feeling me in my genital area . "
The grand jury report concluded that a Priest F , who Tollner says is Placa , abused the boys sexually " again and again and again . "
" Priest F was cautious , but relentless in his pursuit of victims .
He fondled boys over their clothes , usually in his office , " the report said .
Click here to see photos of Giuliani and the Priest .
The report concluded that Priest F , and several other priests under investigation from the same Long Island , N.Y. diocese , could not be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had expired .
Several former students from the same high school say they were asked by the " Giuliani organization " to contact ABC News and vouch for Placa .
" There was absolutely not a hint of rumor of a speculation or a whisper , in four years , or in decades after of any sexual predatoriness on the part of Rev. Placa , " wrote Matthew Hogan in an e-mail to ABCNews.com .
Hogan says he recalls that Placa did give " special attention " to his former schoolmate Richard Tollner and remembers seeing Tollner in Placa 's office " laughing , on opposite sides of a desk with Mr. Tollner happily animated sitting up on the couch talking . "
But Hogan says the school area where Tollner says he was molested " was CONSTANTLY trafficked even on off days and hours . "
" I will gladly help take apart in public anything that seriously overlooks the above .
I 'll be watching The Blotter like a hawk , " Hogan wrote .
In addition to the allegations that Priest F was personally involved in the sexual abuse , the grand jury also said that Priest F became instrumental in a church policy that used " deception and intimidation " to keep the church scandal quiet .

Placa served as a lawyer for the diocese in dealing with allegations of abuse against other priests and , according to the grand jury report , claimed he had saved the church hundreds of thousands of dollars in his handling of possible litigation .
Lawyers for alleged victims say Placa would often conduct interviews , in his priest garb , without making it clear he was the church lawyer .
" He was a wolf in sheep 's clothing , " said Melanie Little , a lawyer for several alleged victims of sexual abuse by other priests in the diocese .
" He was more concerned with protecting the priests , protecting the reputation of the diocese and protecting the church coffers than he was protecting the children , " said Little .
Since going to work for Giuliani Partners , the former mayor and the priest have continued to be close .
Placa accompanied Giuliani and his wife Judith on a trip to Rome earlier this year .

Diets high in fast food can be highly toxic to the liver and other internal organs , but that damage can be reversed , says one of the country 's leading experts on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , who offers four steps to undo the effects of a ' super - size me ' diet .
It was probably enough to make many Americans lose their appetite : A recent study from Europe showed that eating too much fast food -- a diet high in fat and sugar -- could cause serious damage to your liver .
Yet for those who overdo it with too many trips to their favorite burger joint , there 's good news .
You can likely reverse the damage to your liver and other vital organs if you simply give up the unhealthy lifestyle , according to a leading liver specialist at Saint Louis University who conducted a similar study with mice .
" There 's strong evidence now that a fast - food type of diet -- high in fat and sugar , the kind of diet many Americans subsist on -- can cause significant damage to your liver and have extremely serious consequences for your health , " says Brent Tetri , M.D. , professor of internal medicine at the Saint Louis University Liver Center and one of the country 's leading experts on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .
" The good news is that most people can undo this damage if they change their diet and they keep physically active , " Tetri says .
" If they do n't , however , they are asking for trouble . "
Particularly alarming , says Tetri , is that physicians are starting to see children and teenagers with cirrhosis , a serious liver disease once seen mostly in adults with a history of alcohol abuse or hepatitis C. Tetri suspects this is because many kids today eat far too much fast food or junk food and get far too little exercise -- the kind of behaviors that can lead to liver damage .

" The fact we 're starting to see kids with liver disease should really be a wake - up call for anyone eating a diet high in fat and sugar and who 's not physically active , " Tetri says .
Tetri last year studied the effects on mice of a diet that mimicked a typical fast - food meal .
The diet was 40 percent fat and replete with high - fructose corn syrup , a sweetener common in soda and some fruit juices .
The mice were also kept sedentary , mimicking the lifestyle of millions of Americans .
The result : Within four weeks , the mice displayed an increase in liver enzymes -- a key indicator of liver damage -- and the beginnings of glucose intolerance , a marker for type II diabetes .
Similarly , in February researchers in Sweden published the results of a study in which 18 healthy and slim adults ate fast food and restricted their physical activity for a month .
The result : an average weight gain of 12 pounds and , within as little as a week , a sharp rise in liver enzymes .
Tetri is quick to emphasize that fast food per se does n't causes liver damage .
Rather , he says , the harm comes from eating too many calories and too much fat and sugar -- which happens with a steady diet of burgers , fries , sodas and most other items on the typical fast - food menu .
" The big issue here is caloric content , " says Tetri .
" You can put away 2,000 calories in a single fast - food meal pretty easily .
For most people , that 's more calories than they need in an entire day . "
For adults and children who 've repeatedly indulged in fast food , Tetri urges four key steps to help reverse the damage they 've done to their liver .
Limit yourself to no more than one fast - food meal a week .
For some people , that 's going to be a major downshift .
But for the sake of your health , a visit to a fast - food restaurant should be considered a treat -- not a regular event .
When you do eat fast food , eat as healthfully as possible .
Try the burger without mayo and cheese , and avoid fries and sugary soft drinks .
Better yet , go for a grilled chicken sandwich , a salad with a lower - fat dressing and bottled water or a diet soft drink .
Get active .
If you do n't already exercise at least three times a week , start now .
Regular exercise helps keep your weight down and helps your body better metabolize and process the food you eat .
Ask your doctor to do a blood test to check your level of liver enzymes , a key measure of the health of your liver .
Many doctors now order test this routinely when doing blood work on adults , but kids who eat a lot of fast food especially need to have their liver enzymes checked .
" Even for those people with the worst kind of diets , it 's not too late to start exercising and eating right , " Tetri says .
This is an update to post below on Rep. Laura Richardson 's foreclosure woes .
Gene Maddaus of the Daily Breeze kindly forwarded today 's additions to the saga .
There are not two , but three homes owned by Richardson in foreclosure .
And yes , she appears to have cashed out her primary residence back in 2006 to fund her campaign for State Assembly .
So it looks like a pattern .
* * * * * *
I have been watching the story of Representative Linda Laura [ Oops ! -- Ed. ]
Richardson and her foreclosure woes for a while now , while heretofore hesitating to post on it .
For one thing , the original story - - a member of Congress losing her expensive second home to foreclosure -- had that kind of celebrity car - crash quality to it that I 'm not especially interested in for the purposes of this blog .
For another thing , posting about anything even tangentially related to politics invites the kind of comments that personally bore me to tears .
All that is still true , but the story has taken such an unfortunate turn that I feel obligated to weigh in on it .
Specifically , Rep. Richardson is threatening us :
Richardson , 46 , makes nearly $ 170,000 as a member of Congress and was paid $ 113,000 during the eight months she served in the state Assembly in 2007 before her election to Congress .
She also received a per diem total of $ 20,000 from California , according to a financial disclosure form she filed with the House of Representatives clerk .
" I'm Laura Richardson .
I 'm an American , I 'm a single woman who had four employment changes in less than four months , " Richardson told the AP .
" I had to figure out just like every other American how I could restructure the obligations that I had with the income I had . "
She likes the Realtors , and they like her .
She filed financial disclosure forms with the House Ethics Committee reporting the National Assn. of Realtors flew her to Las Vegas in November to help swear in the new president of the association , Realtor Dick Gaylord of Long Beach .
In suggested remarks * at the NAR gathering , also filed with the House , Richardson 's script read : " I might be one of the newest members of Congress but I am not a new member of the REALTOR Party .
When I needed help to win a tough primary , REALTORS stood up and backed me even though I was the underdog . "
-- Real estate industry professionals have given her $ 39,500 in campaign contributions in the current election cycle , according to Open Secrets .
* * * * * * * * * * The story was originally reported in the Sacramento Capitol Weekly , and picked up by the Wall Street Journal , and thence covered by a number of blogs , with the storyline being that Rep. Richardson " walked away " from her home , a second home she purchased in Sacramento after being elected to the State Assembly .
The " walk away " part came from a remark made by the real estate investor who purchased the home at the foreclosure auction , not Rep .
Richardson or anyone who could be expected to understand her financial situation , but that did n't stop the phrase " walk away " from headlining Rep.
Richardson has variously claimed at different times that the house was not in foreclosure , that she had worked out a modification with the lender , and that the lender improperly foreclosed after having agreed to accept her payments .
Frankly , unless and until Rep. Richardson gives her lender , Washington Mutual , permission to tell its side of the story -- I 'm not holding my breath on that -- we 're unlikely to be able to sort out this mess of claims to my satisfaction , at least .
It 's possible that WaMu screwed this up -- that it accepted payments on a workout plan with the understanding that foreclosure was " on hold " and then sold the property at auction the next week anyway .
It 's possible that Richardson 's version of what went on is muddled , too .
Without some more hard information I 'm not inclined to assume the servicer did most of the screwing up , if for no other reason that we did n't find out until late yesterday , courtesy of the L.A. Land and Foreclosure Truth blogs , that Richardson 's other home -- her primary residence -- was also in foreclosure proceedings as recently as March of this year , a detail that as far as I can tell Richardson never disclosed in all the previous discussion of the facts surrounding the foreclosure of her second home .
What part of this I am most interested in , right now , is the question of what in the hell exactly Richardson was thinking when she bought the Sacramento home in the first place .
Since the story is quite complex , let 's get straight on a few details .
Richardson was a Long Beach City Council member who was elected to the state legislature in November of 2006 .
In January of 2007 she purchased a second home in Sacramento , presumably to live in during the Assembly session .
In April 2007 , the U.S. Congressional Representative from Richardson 's district died , and Richardson entered an expensive race for that seat , winning in a special election in August of 2007 .
By December 2007 the Sacramento home was in default , and it was foreclosed in early May of 2008 .
The consensus in the published reports seems to be that Richardson spent what money she had on her campaign , not her bills .
According to the AP
It seems to me that all this focus on what happened after she bought the Sacramento home -- running for the suddenly - available Congressional seat , changing jobs , etc. -- is obscuring the issue of the original transaction .
In November of 2006 , Richardson already owned a home in Long Beach .
As a newly - elected state representative , she would have been required to maintain her principal residence in her district , but she would also have had to make some arrangements for staying in Sacramento during Assembly sessions , given the length of the commute from L.A. County to the state capitol .
She seems to have told the AP reporter that " Lawmakers are required to maintain two residences while other people do n't have to , " which is not exactly the way I 'd have put it .
Lawmakers are required to maintain one primary residence ( which need not be owned ) in their district .
They are not required to buy a home at the capitol ( of California or the U.S. ) ; many legislators do rent .
Richardson is a single woman with no children , yet she felt " required " to purchase a 3 - bedroom , 1 1/ 2 bathroom home in what sounds like one of Sacramento 's pricier neighborhoods for $ 535,500 , with no downpayment and with $ 15,000 in closing cost contributions from the property seller .
( The NAR median price in Sacramento in the first quarter of 2007 was $ 365,300 . ) I have no idea what loan terms Richardson got for a 100 % LTV second home purchase in January 2007 , but I 'm going to guess that if she got something like a 7.00 % interest only loan ( without additional mortgage insurance ) , she got a pretty darn good deal .
If she got that good a deal , her monthly interest payment would have been $ 3123.75 .
Assuming taxes and insurance of 1.50 % of the property value , her total payment would have been $ 3793.13 .
The AP reports that Richardson 's salary as a state representative was $ 113,000 in 2007 , and she received $ 20,000 in per diem payments ( which are , of course , intended to offset the additional expense of traveling to and staying in the Capitol during sessions ) .
I assume the per diem is non-taxable , so I 'll gross it up to $ 25,000 .
That gives me an annual income of $ 138,000 or a gross monthly income of $ 11,500 .
The total payment on the second home , then , with my sunny assumptions about loan terms , comes to 33 % of Richardson 's gross income .
I have no idea what the payment is for her principal residence in Long Beach .
I have no idea what other debt she might have .
I am ignoring her congressional race and job changes and all that because at the point she took out this mortgage , that was all in the future and Richardson did n't know that the incumbent would die suddenly and all that .
I 'm just trying to figure out what went through this woman 's mind when she decided it was a wise financial move to spend one - third of her pre-tax income on a second home .
( There 's no point trying to figure out what went through the lender 's mind at the time .
There just is n't . )
Now , Richardson has this to say about herself :
Yeah , well , I 'm Tanta , I 'm an American , I 'm a single woman , and I say you 're full of it .
You need to show us what your plan for affording this home wasthe job changes , girlfriend .
You might also tell me why you felt you needed such an expensive second home when you had no money to put down on it or even to pay your own closing costs .
As it happens , the Mercury News / AP reported that by June of 2007 - - five months after purchase -- you had a lien filed for unpaid utility bills .
You did n't budget for the lights ?
But what are we going to get ?
We 're going to get Richardson all fired up in Congress about tinkering with foreclosure notice timing , which is last I knew a question of state , not federal , law , and which has as far as I can see squat to do with why this loan failed .
Quite honestly , if WaMu did give Richardson some loan modification deal , I 'd really like to know what went through the Loss Mit Department 's collective and individual minds when they signed off on that .
Sure , Richardson 's salary went up to $ 170,000 when she became a member of the U.S. Congress , but what does she need a home in Sacramento for after that ?
Where 's she going to live in Washington , DC ?
And , well , her principal residence was also in the process of foreclosure at the same time .
I suppose I might have offered a short sale or deed - in - lieu here , but a modification ?
Why would anybody do that ?
Because she 's a Congresswoman ?
I 'm quite sure Richardson wants to be treated like just a plain old American and not get special treatment .
Well , I was kind of hard on a plain old American the other day who wrote a " hardship letter " that did n't pass muster with me .
I feel obligated to tell Richardson that she sounds like a real estate speculator who bought a home she obviously could n't afford , defaulted on it , and now wants WaMu to basically subsidize her Congressional campaign by lowering her mortgage payment or forgiving debt .
And that 's . . . disgusting .
At the risk of sounding like Angelo .
I know some of you are thinking that maybe poor Ms. Richardson got taken advantage of by some fast - talking REALTOR who encouraged her to buy more house than she could afford .
According to Pete Viles at L.A. Land
No wonder she 's blaming the lender .
The Gang Tax
A few days ago , New York ’s State Senate passed a bill making it illegal to recruit someone into a street gang .
In the never - ending fight by city officials and legislators to combat gangs , this is one of the latest efforts to outmaneuver gang members .
Other similar initiatives have included : city ordinances that limit two or more gang members from hanging out in public space ; school codes that ban the use of hats , clothing , and colors that signify gang membership ; and public housing authorities that evict leaseholders who allow gang members ( or any other so - called “ criminal ” ) to live inside the housing unit .
These laws rarely lead to reductions in gang membership , gang violence , or gang crime .
In fact , police officers I know find these ordinances and statutes a waste of time .
Cops would much rather “ control and contain ” gang activity .
Most officers who work in inner cities understand that you cannot eliminate gang activity entirely — arrest two gang members and you will find a dozen others waiting in line to take their places .
Police know that gang members have great knowledge about local crimes , so they rely on a trade off : keep gangs isolated to particular areas , do n’t let their criminal activities spill over into other spaces , and use high - ranking gang members for information .
This strategy actually prevents membership from expanding , at least in big cities where gangs are economically oriented .
Beat cops who run the streets make sure that gang leaders do n’t prey upon too many kids for recruiting purposes .
In effect , this kind of policing limits the reach of gangs .
It may not be socially desirable policing , but it works if you measure effectiveness by reductions in gang membership .
I called a few gang leaders in Chicago and asked them what the greatest obstacles to recruiting and retaining members are .
Here are a few answers :
Michael ( 30 years old , African - American ) was insistent that today ’s gangs are mostly “ drug crews , ” i.e. , businesses .
We always lose people to jobs .
If a n–er in my crew gets a good job , he ’s gone .
So , as long as there ai n’t no work for a brother , then we have no problem .
Most of us have families , we ’re not in school beating each other up , acting stupid .
We ’re out here on the streets trying to make our money .
You got all these people telling us to get an education — I ’m making thousands of dollars each month .
Why do I need to go to school ?
Darnell ( 32 years old , African - American ) said police should be more creative .
Let ’s say you catch one of us —
I ’d make the boy wear a dress and makeup .
Maybe for two weeks .
Let the boy go to school looking like a girl .
Let him walk the streets looking like he ’s gay .
I guarantee you , we ’d have a hard time holding on to n–rs if you do sh–t like that !
Jo -Jo ( 49 years old , half Puerto Rican , half black ) said the cops should do :
… what they did when I was younger .
Drop a Disciples off in Vicelords territory late at night .
Let him get his a– kicked .
And keep doing it !
I remember growing up and all these cats used to get beat up .
You know what ?
This would actually help me because it would get rid of a lot of these folks who do nothing for us except cause trouble .
In fact , I ’d be willing to work with the cops if they want to call me .
Maybe we could help each other out ?
My good friend Dorothy never ran a gang , but as an outreach worker who helps young people in the ghetto turn their lives around , she has pretty good insight .
She recalled some of her own gang - intervention efforts in the 1990 ’s and came up with the following suggestion :
Tax the n–rs !
That ’s what I would do if I was the mayor .
Do n’t put them in jail , but take 50 percent of their money .
You know what I mean ?
Find them on the streets if they ’re misbehaving , grab half of their cash , and put it into a community fund .
Let the block clubs have it , let the churches have the money .
I guarantee you that a lot of brothers will think twice if you get to their pocketbooks .
Interesting thought .
I wonder whether market forces might exert the kind of discipline required to limit the involvement of young people in gang - controlled drug economies .
If , as Treasury Secretary Paulson reminds us , “ market discipline ” is sufficient to regulate the financial markets , perhaps it could be effective in the underground .
Oh , yes , I forgot about Bear Stearns .
( Sorry , could n’t resist . )
Mr. Paterson reiterated his support for a gay marriage bill .
“ Some of those dizzy legislators who think I ’m doing an end run , maybe they should go into the Legislature and actually work on it , ” he said .
The policy revisions are most likely to involve as many as 1,300 statutes and regulations in New York governing everything from joint filing of income tax returns to transferring fishing licenses between spouses .

In a videotaped message given to gay community leaders at a dinner on May 17 , Mr. Paterson described the move as “ a strong step toward marriage equality . ”
And people on both sides of the issue said it moved the state closer to fully legalizing same - sex unions in this state .
“ Very shortly , there will be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds , and probably thousands and thousands and thousands of gay people who have their marriages recognized by the state , ” said Assemblyman Daniel O’Donnell , a Democrat who represents the Upper West Side and has pushed for legalization of gay unions .
Massachusetts and California are the only states that have legalized gay marriage , while others , including New Jersey and Vermont , allow civil unions .
Forty - one states have laws limiting marriage as a union between a man and a woman .
Legal experts said Mr. Paterson ’s decision would make New York the only state that did not itself allow gay marriage but fully recognized same - sex unions entered into elsewhere .
The directive is the strongest signal yet that Mr. Paterson , who developed strong ties to the gay community as a legislator , plans to push aggressively to legalize same - sex unions as governor .
His predecessor , Mr. Spitzer , introduced a bill last year that would have legalized gay marriage , but even as he submitted it , doubted that it would pass .
The Democratic - dominated Assembly passed the measure , but the Republican - led Senate has refused to call a vote on it .
Short of an act by the Legislature , the directive ordered by Mr. Paterson is the one of the strongest statements a state can make in favor of gay unions .
Who Hires During a Recession ?
The economy appears to be in recession , and while most industries are shedding jobs , consumer debt councilors , conservation consultants and green energy suppliers have ramped up hiring , the Christian Science Monitor reports .
The Monitor also points out that the leading edge of the recession overlaps with the start of the baby boomer retirement wave .
This has sparked a government hiring binge as Uncle Sam scrambles to replace outgoing workers .
Who else hires during a recession ?
Private security firms .
They ’re seeing a spike in demand these days , according to the Indianapolis Star .
Lusi , the world ’s fastest - growing mud volcano , is collapsing and could subside to depths of more than 140 meters with consequences for the surrounding environment , according to new research .
As the second anniversary ( May 29 ) of the eruption on the Indonesian island of Java approaches , scientists have also found that the center of the volcano is collapsing by up to three meters overnight .
Such sudden collapses could be the beginning of a caldera - a large basin - shaped volcanic depression - according to the research team , from Durham University UK , and the Institute of Technology Bandung , in Indonesia .

Lusi first erupted on May 29 , 2006 , in the Porong sub - district of Sidoarjo , close to Indonesia ’s second city of Surabaya , East Java , and now covers seven square kilometres and is 20 metres thick .
In January 2007 Durham University published the first scientific report into the causes and impact of Lusi , revealing that the eruption was almost certainly manmade and caused by the drilling of a nearby exploratory borehole ( 1 ) looking for gas .
Fourteen people have been killed and 30,000 people have been evacuated from the area .
More than 10,000 homes have been destroyed while schools , offices and factories have also been wiped out and a major impact on the wider marine and coastal environment is expected .
The researchers say the subsidence data could help determine how much of the local area will be affected by Lusi .
Their research used GPS and satellite data recorded between June 2006 and September 2007 that showed the area affected by Lusi had subsided by between 0.5 meters and 14.5 meters per year .
The scientists found that if Lusi continued to erupt for three to 10 years at the constant rates measured during 2007 then the central part of the volcano could subside by between 44 metres and 146 metres – 26 metres longer than a football pitch .
They propose the subsidence is due to the weight of mud and collapse of rock strata due to the excavation of mud from beneath the surface .
Their study has also found that while some parts of Sidoarjo are subsiding others are rising suggesting that the Watukosek fault system has been reactivated due to the eruption .
Co-author Professor Richard Davies , of Durham University ’s Centre for Research into Earth Energy Systems ( CeREES ) , said : “ In the two years since she first erupted Lusi has continued to grow .
Our research is fundamental if we are to understand the long - term effects of the mud volcano on the local and wider environment and population .
“ Sidoarjo is a populated region and is collapsing as a result of the birth and growth of Lusi .
This could continue to have a significant environmental impact on the surrounding area for years to come .
“ If we establish how long the volcano will continue to erupt for then the subsidence data will allow us to assess the area that will ultimately be affected by this disaster .
This could have implications for future plans aimed at minimising the volcano ’s overall impact . ”
Their findings , based on Global Positioning System ( GPS ) and satellite measurements , are due to be published in the journal Environmental Geology .

On a recent drizzly gray afternoon , Wenzday Jane straps on gaiters to keep tire spray from soaking her socks .
Then she hops onto a ruby - red three - wheeled cycle van with a silver - winged " NAP " monogram emblazoned on its cargo hold – and pedals smoothly into thick Boston traffic .
Her mission : Deliver 150 pounds of gourmet chocolates and cheeses from industrial kitchens in Cambridge , Mass. , to shops and restaurants across Boston , while emitting zero pollution .
In a city choked with diesel - spewing delivery trucks , the fledgling New Amsterdam Project ( NAP ) , a Cambridge - based cargo - hauling company , is pedaling toward profits aboard an emissions - free fleet of urban " cargo trikes . "
China , India , and other developing nations have long utilized bicycle - based delivery for many goods – but are shifting toward engine - powered vehicles .
Across North America , bicycle delivery services exist in several cities .
Yet pedal - powered hauling for cargo has been largely a no - show in the United States .
That makes NAP stand out for its sole focus on human - powered cargo delivery , says Andrew Brown , the company 's founder and CEO .
A psychiatrist by training and lover of all things bicycle - related , Mr. Brown launched the company last fall and now finds himself dividing time between cycling to companies where he counsels workers – and making deliveries .
" We 're getting trucks off the road , that 's one of our goals , " says Brown .
" Each time we make a delivery , we demonstrate ... that there 's a better way – a system that is less expensive , better for their products , better for the environment , and for their community . "
Actually there are many goals for this windmill tilter .
An encounter in an Amsterdam coffee shop in 2005 – in which a local man regaled him with stories about his nation 's bicycle culture , a place where politicians and even the queen ride regularly – set the wheels in motion .
The gentleman bluntly said the US had made a " bad habit " out of driving cars too much – when bicycling was so much more pleasant , Brown recalls .
An expert in helping people leave bad habits , he began pondering how he might help America quit its addiction to the " automobile habit . "
He might have a chance , he reasoned , if he could demonstrate for a capitalist society that it can be highly profitable to keep people fit , lessen dependence on oil , and help the environment .
Research led him to a British company , Cycles Maximus , that makes commercial trikes used by the government to deliver the Royal Mail .
One of their trikes ' key features is an electric - assist .
It allows even diminutive riders to haul 800 pounds up hill – and zip away from a stop at the pace of a car .
It does n't replace pedaling : the driver must pedal for the assist to work .
That effort is a key point for Brown .
Whether delivering pies , chocolates , organic produce , or green building products , NAP 's ultimate motive is to show people bicycles are a great way to stay fit , as well as break the internal - combustion stranglehold .
" It 's almost like cars are the sea within which we live and we 're so attached to them , it 's so habitual , " he says .
" We are trying to lead the way , to set an example about how to get away from cars altogether . "
As utopian as that might sound , there are a few tentative signs that Brown might be onto something .
High gasoline prices and rising concerns over climate change do seem to be opening the door to interest in cycling to work – and just perhaps , a new way of delivering many goods in crowded urban settings .
Signs include rising numbers of bike commuters , especially in places like Portland , Ore ; Boston ; Boulder , Colo . ; San Francisco ; and Washington , D.C. , says Andy Clarke , president of the League of American Bicyclists , an advocacy group based in Washington .
" Gas prices are making people think twice about how they get around , " he says .
" What NAP is doing is in the vanguard of this movement .
Even if it is n't common yet , it 's definitely coming .
It just makes good sense . "
Perhaps so , but even Brown admits there is " a huge cultural hurdle " to overcome in the land of the pickup truck .
" People do laugh , " he says .
" They can't understand how a bicycle can possibly function in a way commensurate with an automobile , much less a light truck . "
But there are signs some do get it .
Pedal Express in Berkeley , Calif. , and Revolution Rickshaws in New York City are two companies specializing in bicycle - based delivery and pedicab operations that will also deliver heavy loads by cargo cycle .
Greg Zukowski , president of Revolution , sells cycle vans from Cycles Maximus , including five sold to Brown for around $ 12,000 each .
" We 're mainly a courier messenger service that uses these trikes , " Mr. Zukowski says .
" But [ cargo delivery ] is something we 're doing more of every day . "
There 's also been a surprising , if somewhat elusive , endorsement of the cargo - cycle concept by a big industry player : United Parcel Service .
UPS tested the cargo - cycle concept over the 2007 Christmas holidays in several Vermont communities with bicycles pulling small trailers , according to Seven Days , a weekly based in Burlington .
Just how much UPS likes the idea is n't something the company is talking about right now , however .
" It 's something I 've been told is not public at this time , " says Heather Robinson , a UPS spokesperson .
Brown admits NAP is n't making money just yet .
Both he and Ms. Jane , the company general manager , are still working to get the word out .
Yet for a half - dozen companies like Taza Chocolate , Brown 's concept of cycle - based delivery for their " fair trade " chocolate matters a lot .
" We believe our customers are quite interested in lowering their carbon footprint , " says Alex Whitmore , a Taza co-founder .
" We think NAP 's approach to delivery does that for us , which is pretty sweet . "
The genetic split in Africa resulted in distinct populations that lived in isolation for as much as 100,000 years , the scientists say .
This could have been caused by arid conditions driving a wedge between humans in eastern and southern Africa .
Details have been published in the American Journal of Human Genetics .
It would be the longest period for which modern human populations have been isolated from one another .
But other scientists said it was still too early to reconstruct a meaningful picture of humankind 's early history in Africa .
They argue that other scenarios could also account for the data .
At the time of the split - some 150,000 years ago - our species , Homo sapiens , was still confined to the African continent .
The results have come from the Genographic Project , a major effort to track human migrations through DNA .
The latest conclusions are based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA in present - day African populations .
This type of DNA is the genetic material stored in mitochondria - the " powerhouses " of cells .
It is passed down from a mother to her offspring , providing a unique record of maternal inheritance .
" We do n't know how long it takes for hominids to fission off into separate species , but clearly they were separated for a very long time , " said Dr Spencer Wells , director of the Genographic Project .
" They came back together again during the Late Stone Age - driven by population expansion . "
Although present - day people carry a signature of the ancient split in their DNA , today 's Africans are part of a single population .
The researchers compiled a " family tree " of different mitochondrial DNA groupings found in Africa .
A major split occurred near the root of the tree as early as 150,000 years ago .
On one side of this divide are the mitochondrial lineages now found predominantly in East and West Africa , and all maternal lineages found outside Africa .
On the other side of the divide are lineages predominantly found in the Khoi and San ( Khoisan ) hunter - gatherer people of southern Africa .
Many African populations today harbour a mixture of both .
The scientists say the most likely scenario is that two populations went their separate ways early in our evolutionary history .
This gave rise to separate human communities localised to eastern and southern Africa that evolved in isolation for between 50,000 and 100,000 years .
This divergence could have been related to climate change : recent studies of ancient climate data suggest that eastern Africa went through a series of massive droughts between 135,000 - 90,000 years ago .
Lead author Doron Behar , from the Rambam Medical Center in Israel commented : " It is possible the harsh environment and changing climate made populations migrate to other places in order to have a better chance of survival .
" Some of them found places where they could and - perhaps - some did n't .
More than that we cannot say . "
Dr Wells told BBC News : " Once this population reached southern Africa , it was cut off from the eastern African population by these drought events which were on the route between them . "
Modern humans are often presumed to have originated in East Africa and then spread out to populate other areas .
But the data could equally support an origin in southern Africa followed by a migration to East and West Africa .
The genetic data show that populations came back together as a single , pan-African population about 40,000 years ago .
This renewed contact appears to coincide with the development of more advanced stone tool technology and may have been helped by more favourable environmental conditions .
" [ The mixing ] was two - way to a certain extent , but the majority of mitochondrial lineages seem to have come from north - eastern Africa down to the south , " said Spencer Wells .
But other scientists said different scenarios could explain the data .
Dr Sarah Tishkoff , an expert on African population genetics from the University of Pennsylvania , said the Khoisan might once have carried many more of the presumed " East African " lineages but that these could have been lost over time .
" Although there is very deep divergence in the mitochondrial lineages , that can be different from inferring when the populations diverged from one another and there can be many demographic scenarios to account for it , " she told BBC News .
She added : " As a general rule of thumb , when mitochondrial genetic lineages split , it will usually precede the population split .
It can often be difficult to infer from one to the other . "
The University of Pennsylvania researcher stressed it was not possible to pinpoint where in Africa the populations had once lived - complicating the process of reconstructing scenarios from genetic data .
The Genographic Project 's findings are also consistent with the idea - held for some years now - that modern humans had a close brush with extinction in the evolutionary past .
The number of early humans may have shrunk as low as 2,000 before numbers began to expand again in the Late Stone Age .

AVONDALE , Ariz . -- Sprint Cup drivers Kevin Harvick ,
Tony Stewart , Jimmie Johnson and Kasey Kahne say they never have undergone a drug test as NASCAR competitors .
" In the 10 years that I 've raced , I 've never been drug - tested , " Harvick said .
" To me , that 's not a proper drug policy for a professional sport .
We have n't made any headway whatsoever on the drug - testing policy . "
Harvick and Stewart were reacting to an ESPN The Magazine story this week in which former driver Aaron Fike said he competed in Craftsman Truck Series races while he was on heroin .
" I have been in a race with him and I know for a fact that he's not the only one , " Harvick said .
" There 's another driver that was suspended that I can almost guarantee you was in the race car while he was under the influence , and that pisses me off .
" I 'm sure I 'll be blasted for saying what I feel , but I do n't want to be on a race track with people like that .
It 's irresponsible more than anything . "
All four Cup drivers said they are in favor of regular testing .
" I would love it , '' Stewart said .
" I 've never been asked to take one yet .
I think it should be mandatory to have random drug testing .
I think it 's a great idea .
The Fike situation shows that as an organization , we 're not doing a good job of seeing this before it happens . "
NASCAR 's substance - abuse policy includes the right to test any driver at any time , but officials only do so if they believe a competitor might have a problem .
" The responsibility here rests across the board -- with the drivers and competitors , owners , teams and NASCAR , " said Kerry Tharp , NASCAR 's director of communication .
" We test an individual when we have reasonable suspicion .
A positive test results in severe consequences and is a career - changing moment for that person .
" NASCAR 's policy is also supported by the various policies that the teams have in place that are required under the driver / owner agreements .
No system is flawless , but we believe our zero tolerant policy that is in place has served the sport well . "
Fike was arrested last year in Ohio for possession of heroin .
" I had a long talk with NASCAR about this last year , "
Harvick said .
" It almost seems like it fell on deaf ears .
They were more mad that I had a reaction to the situation than they were about trying to move forward .
" They heard what I said , but my name 's not Jeff Gordon .
I 'm disappointed that we have to react and answer all these questions again . "
Tharp said NASCAR officials always take it seriously when drivers come to them with questions or complaints .
" Let me assure you that no issue or conversation that we have with a driver , owner or team member ever falls on deaf ears , " Tharp said .
" Now , they might not always come out of the meeting with the answer they 're looking for , but we listen . "
Harvick wants to see NASCAR test drivers and crew members several times a year .
" I 'm sure I 'll have to do it for speaking my mind , "
Harvick said .
" But if I have to pee in a cup 15 times a year , I 'm happy to do it .
" The bad part is it is n't fair to the 95 percent of his garage that is clean .
But I want everybody in the world to know our sport is clean .
I want fans and sponsors to know this garage is clean . "
Harvick and his wife , DeLana , own truck series and Nationwide Series teams at Kevin Harvick Inc .
Harvick does not conduct drug tests for his employees .
" I do n't right now and maybe we need to change the way we look at it , too , " he said .
" But in the end , it 's the responsibility of [ NASCAR ] to make sure all the drivers are clean . "
Harvick said Fike drove a couple of races for KHI several years ago .
" There was no reason to think something was wrong , "
Harvick said .
" I do n't know about drugs , to tell you the truth .
But I want to know about the guy racing next to me and not have to wonder if he was out the night before and is n't clean . "
Kahne said he had suspicions about Fike .
" I definitely wondered about Aaron , so I 'm sure others did , " Kahne said .
" When he said he did heroin before a race , that 's incredible that no one knew .
As much money as there is in this sport , I think we should take a little more effort to make sure every driver is clean . "
Harvick believes NASCAR should have changed its substance - abuse policy long ago .
" You can tell I 'm a little bit frustrated about the situation , " he said .
" As someone who respects the sport and respects my sponsors , I 'm upset that I have to answer questions about Aaron Fike .
It really ticks me off , because every driver in this garage should be taking random drug tests . "
Johnson , who has won the last two Cup championships , said he was shocked to learn about Fike 's admission .
" I cannot believe it , '' Johnson said .
" It 's absurd .
I do n't know where things go from here .
I 've not been testing , but I 'm confident every driver is willing to do whatever NASCAR decides to do . "
Harvick believes NASCAR needs to do a better job of staying ahead of the curve .
" It 's just like the safety thing back in 2001 , " he said .
" We did n't react until that situation happened [ with Dale Earnhardt 's death ] .
With drug - testing , there 's no reason in the world today not to be proactive .
" This is about forward thinking about how the drivers are perceived from a public standpoint .
If I 'm a fan , I do n't want to think , ' Are they really clean ? '
This always has been perceived as a clean sport .
Let 's not let that change now , because it is .
But let 's prove it . "

JERUSALEM — President Bush used a speech to the Israeli Parliament on Thursday to denounce those who would negotiate with “ terrorists and radicals ” — a remark that was widely interpreted as a rebuke to Senator Barack Obama , the Democratic presidential contender , who has argued that the United States should talk directly with countries like Iran and Syria .
Mr. Bush did not mention Mr. Obama by name , and the White House said his remarks were not aimed at the senator , though they created a political firestorm in Washington nonetheless .
In a lengthy speech intended to promote the strong alliance between the United States and Israel , the president invoked the emotionally volatile imagery of World War II to make the case that talking to extremists was no different than appeasing Hitler and the Nazis .
“ Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ We have heard this foolish delusion before .
As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : “ Lord , if I could only have talked to Hitler , all this might have been avoided . ”
We have an obligation to call this what it is — the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . ”
Did I help them or harm them ?
Probably not much of either .
They 've forgotten me , and I have forgotten most of them .

The image from a computer animation shows a neutron star sucking in gas from a companion star ’s atmosphere .
The gas spirals onto the neutron star , slowly building up on its surface until it heats up to a critical temperature for an explosion .
Astronomersare now able to predict when a certain type of star will let loose a powerfuleruption .
Theexplosions occur on a neutron star , a city - sized remnant of a giant star thatexploded in a supernova long ago and collapsed into a hyperdense ember .
It nowsiphons material from a companion star while the two objects orbit each otherevery 3.8 hours .
Theneutron star has incredibly strong gravity , so it sucks in some of the gas fromthe companion star ?s atmosphere .
The gas spirals onto the neutron star , slowlybuilding up on its surface until it heats up to a critical temperature .
Suddenly , the gas at one small spot on the neutron star ?s surface ignitesa powerful explosion , and the flame quickly spreads around the entire star .
" Wefound a clock that ticks slower and slower , and when it slows down too much , boom !
The bomb explodes , " said team leader Diego Altamirano of the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands .
Theexplosion appears as a bright flash of X - rays .
Thenew study was done using NASA ?s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) satellite .
Theneutron star produces about 7 to 10 bursts per day .
These explosions releasemore energy in 100 seconds than our sun radiates in an entire week .
The energyis equivalent to 100 hydrogen bombs exploding simultaneously over eachpostage - stamp - size patch of the dying star ?s surface .
Scientistshave observed thousands of similar bursts from about 80 different neutronstars , according to a NASA statement today .
But until now , they had no way topredict when they would occur .
Asgas gradually builds up on the neutron star ?s surface , the atoms that make upthe gas slam together to form heavier atoms in a process known as fusion .
Sometimes , the fusion occurs in a stable and almost perfectly repetitivefashion , producing a nearly regular X - ray signal known as a quasi- periodicoscillation ( or QPO for short ) .
Think of the QPO as a clock that ticks withnear - perfect precision .
Scientistsexpect that the QPO clock should tick about once every two minutes ( 120seconds ) .
This is what Altamirano ?s team found when the astronomers observedthe system with RXTE .
But the team also found that the QPO clock starts tickingslower and slower as gas builds up on its surface .
Whenever it slows down toone cycle every 125 seconds , the neutron star lets loose a powerful explosion .
" Wecan predict when these explosions are happening , " Altamirano said .
Thisdouble - star system is called 4U 1636 - 53 and is about 20,000 light - years away .
Of course that means the " predictions " involve explosions thatactually occurred 20,000 years ago ; the light is justnow arriving .
" It 'san exciting discovery , " adds Tod Strohmayer of NASA ?s Goddard Space FlightCenter in Greenbelt , Md. Strohmayer is an expertin neutron stars who was not involved in this study .
He notes that the tickingof the QPO clock depends on the size and weight of the neutron star .
" Itgives us a new tool to study these fascinating objects , " Altamirano said .
10 Ways History ’s Finest Kept Their Focus at Work
Post written by Albert van Zyl from the blog HeadSpace .
The lives of great people give us interesting clues about how to organise our days .
All of them attached great value to their daily routines .
This is because they saw it as being part of ‘ becoming who they are ’ , as Nietzsche puts it .
For the same reason they were also highly individual in their routines .
They had the courage to go against popular opinion and work out often strange daily plans that suited them .
This is perhaps the first lesson that we can learn – that it takes courage and resolve to design and stick to a routine that suits you .
But as Emerson reassures us : ‘ The world makes way for the man who knows where he is going ’ .
There are at least 10 other lessons that the daily routines of the great can teach us :
1 . Do n’t work long hours
Despite the modern obsession with physical presence at offices ( also known as ‘ presenteeism ’ ) , very few of the great worked long hours .
Philosopher Michel Foucault would only work from 9 am to 3 pm .
Beethoven only worked from sunrise until the early afternoon .
No 12 hour days here .
Author Tom Robbins schedules only 3 hours of writing at his desk per day .
2 . Take breaks
Even during these short days , the great took plenty of breaks .
Socrates would sometimes simply stop and hold completely still for several minutes .
Beethoven was known to punctuate his mornings by running outside and walking around – he called it ‘ working while walking ’ .
3 . Take even longer breaks
The great all spent a single long period away from their desks every day to give their minds time to recover and regain its creative poise .
Beethoven started work at daybreak , but wrapped up by two or three in the afternoon which left him a good 14 hours away from work .
Victor Hugo wrote in the mornings and took afternoons off entirely .
Churchill would do nothing work - related between noon and around 11 at night .
4 . Stop work and sit down for meals
Churchill would even have a bath and dress for meals .
For us mere mortals , this injunction could simply mean sitting down with your sandwich away from you desk , on a bench in the park or somewhere else .
Or resolving to chew and taste your food properly .
5 . Do n’t work in the afternoons
There are some exceptions , but very few of our heroes did any serious work in the afternoon .
After writing in the morning , Victor Hugo spent his afternoons riding around Paris in double decker busses , watching his brethren about their work .
For us this might mean blocking off afternoons for long tea breaks and non-essential tasks .
6 . Mix it up
The days of the great contain a surprising variety of activities .
It seems that we do n’t have to focus on a small range of things to succeed .
Even the grim German philosopher , Immanuel Kant went for afternoon walks and sat down for lunch with friends each day .
Gandhi walked , spun , had a long bath and massage .
Churchill painted , fed his fish , played card games and constructed buildings all over Chartwell farm .
He famously claimed that our minds do n’t need rest as much as they need variety .
7. Aim low
Do n’t schedule every minute of your day .
Leo at Zenhabits suggests that we have morning and evening routines , and leave the middle of the day open for completing key tasks and other things that come up .
Daily routines are supposed to make things easier , not more complicated .
Micro managing every minute of your day does not work .
8 . Take time to relax
The great all reserved time to relax .
And this does n’t mean engaging in some semi-productive activity like reading a book or washing the dishes .
No , they blocked out time to do nothing at all .
Gandhi would often spend time just staring at the horizon .
Churchill would sit down to smoke a cigar after lunch and Beethoven would stop off for a few beers after his afternoon walk .
In his recent autobiography , Alan Greenspan mentions that he too makes time to reflect each day .
9. Get up early ( ? )
This one is the subject of hot debate .
Samuel Johnson , Churchill and Dylan Thomas got up late .
Gandhi , Franklin and Mandela all got up early .
But whether they were early birds or night owls , the great all make sure that they had long periods of uninterrupted quiet time ; whether late at night or early in the morning .
10 . Exercise !
Al Gore interrupts his work day at 3 pm to go for a run .
Emerson , Beethoven , Nietzsche , Victor Hugo and Gandhi all went for walks .
Nietzsche said that he ‘ scribbled ’ notes while he took his walk and claims that some of his best thoughts came in this way .
Mandela ’s 5 am walks are legendary .
The story goes that he once invited a persistent journalist to interview him during this morning walk – but she ended up being too out of breath to ask any questions .

PITTSBURGH - Pittsburgh - area sports radio host Mark Madden has been permanently taken off the air by ESPN .
The Pittsburgh Post - Gazette quoted Madden as saying that he had hoped Sen. Edward Kennedy " would live long enough to be assassinated . "
The Massachusetts Democrat has a malignant brain tumor .
Madden made the remark during his show Wednesday .
The show has aired weekdays from 3 to 7 p.m. on 1250 ESPN .
Madden was last heard on the air Thursday , the day before his comments appeared in the newspaper .
ESPN spokesman Josh Krulewitz said the network removed Madden from the air " pursuant to our contractual rights . "
He said the comment was inappropriate and that ESPN and Madden had apologized to listeners .
Madden could not be reached for comment Tuesday night .
Famous anarchist Emma Goldman once said , " If voting changed anything , they would make it illegal . "
Following last weekend ’s presidential elections in Serbia , the party of the incumbent Boris Tadic must be wishing they had made voting illegal .
It appears that " democratic moderate reformers "  epithets Western press routinely uses when describing Tadic and his followers  have badly overestimated their popularity .
Looking at the mainstream media in Serbia  either lavishly sponsored or owned outright by Western corporations , governments and NGOs  it is not hard to see how they may have acquired this misguided perception .
It is unlikely that the outcome of the February 3 runoff vote could actually change Imperial policy towards Serbia ; Washington and Brussels remain committed to carving out the Albanian - occupied and UN / NATO - administered Kosovo .
Yet , lacking political , legal and even military means to impose its will , the Empire needs Serbia ’s acquiescence , even if it ’s tortured and threadbare .
It has been openly speculated in the mainstream Western press that Tadic would provide such acquiescence .
This is the real reason why Washington and the European capitals watch Serbia with bated breath ; a victory by Nikolic would derail their already precarious project .
Shock and Irony
The real shock in the aftermath of Sunday ’s vote was not Nikolic ’s lead ; a similar situation , in which the Radicals would poll well in the first round but lose the runoff , has happened before .
There were , however , two surprises that upset both the campaign managers and the pollsters and analysts close to the establishment .
First of all , the turnout in the election was substantially greater than expected .
Recent parliamentary elections and the constitutional referendum barely rose above the necessary census ; this time , over 60 % of the voters took to the polls .
Secondly , and contrary to conventional wisdom , a high turnout did not hurt the Radicals .
For years it was assumed that the Radicals had a stalwart but stagnant core of voters , while any larger turnout would include fickle voters more sympathetic to the Democrats .
Last Sunday proved this assumption wrong .
A little bit of background is crucial for understanding the extent of panic in Tadic ’s camp .
The vote was scheduled in mid-December by speaker of the parliament Oliver Dulic  member of Tadic ’s Democratic Party  without any consultations with the Democrats ’ coalition partners in the cabinet .
In fact , the vote was a big bone of contention within the coalition , with the current Prime Minister , Vojislav Kostunica , opposed to elections in the midst of the ongoing crisis over the occupied province of Kosovo .
Dulic ’s decision to ignore Kostunica ’s objections was deemed sufficiently insulting by the Prime Minister that his Populist Bloc ran their own candidate  Velimir Ilic  rather than support Tadic .
Ilic made a relatively modest showing with only 7 % of the vote .
However , that percentage puts Kostunica in position to rescue Tadic on February 3  or bury him .
Nikolic got 39.4 % of the vote , leading Tadic ( at 35.4 % ) by a whole four percent .
Assuming the supporters of Milutin Mrkonjic ( of the late Milosevic ’s Socialist Party , with 6 % of the vote ) throw their support behind Nikolic in the runoff , and the 5 % favoring Cedomir Jovanovic , leader of the belligerent Liberal Democratic Party ( which is neither liberal nor democratic ) , support Tadic , the incumbent president absolutely needs Ilic ’s seven percent to scratch out a win .
Once again , he is at the mercy of the partner he so openly scorned .
‘ Pro-Westerner ’ and ‘ Ultranationalist ’
Typical reporting about the election went along the lines of the AP , which reported Nikolic ’s lead on January 21 with trepidation .
The agency called Nikolic an " ally of late autocrat Slobodan Milosevic " and even alleged ( erroneously ) that he " ruled alongside " Milosevic in the 1990s .
Elsewhere , Nikolic has been called an " ultranationalist " and a " hardliner . "
The " pro-Western " Tadic , on the other hand , was presented as a progressive advocate of " Western - style reforms and integration into the European Union . "
News and analysis in the West have largely echoed the claims of the Tadic campaign ( or is it the other way around ? ) that a victory for the Democrats would mean " progress " and prosperity within the European Union , while the Radicals ’ triumph would cause a regression into the horrible darkness of the 1990s  the age of sanctions , bombing and wholesale demonization of Serbs and Serbia .
However , these are not the 1990s .
Demonization of Serbs never really stopped .
The seven - plus years of various " democrats " in charge ( from the October 2000 coup onwards ) has failed to change Empire ’s policy of pressure , extortion and humiliation in any appreciable way .
With the U.S. economy tanking and Washington bogged down in Mesopotamia and the Hindu Kush , Imperial officials may make noises about dismembering Serbia , but it is n’t clear how much they can actually do .
Tadic presents himself as the " European " choice , and threatens the Serbian voters with the loss of their European future , which is supposedly just around the corner .
From vague promises about a better life , his message is now that of fear  fear that if Nikolic wins , the bright Eutopian future just around the corner will be lost .
Now , the EU is scheduled to sign the Stabilization and Association Agreement  the ponderously named document marking the first step in Brussels ’ process of swallowing up a country  with Serbia on January 28 .
Yet with Kosovo a key bone of contention between Belgrade on one side , and Washington and Brussels on the other , it is apparent that a large portion of the electorate is wondering whether Tadic ’s Europhilia is at the expense of his own nation .
True Colors ?
In May 2007 , after months of acrimonious talks between Tadic and Kostunica ’s parties , they formed an uneasy coalition government .
Kostunica remained Prime Minister , but Tadic ’s people took over the money , the military , and foreign affairs .
This last post was filled by Tadic ’s protégé and former advisor , Vuk Jeremic .
Jeremic had previously been suspected of clandestine talks with certain Western governments to acquiesce in the separation of Kosovo ; his appointment caused diplomat Leon Kojen to refuse a cabinet post overseeing Kosovo affairs .
Yet his conduct as Belgrade ’s top diplomat has been downright exemplary , compared to his predecessors .
Given that Vuk Draskovic was a raving lunatic and Goran Svilanovic sold out to the Empire openly , that ’s not saying much  but Jeremic stayed faithful to Belgrade ’s official position on Kosovo , even if he did not share it personally .
When election returns from the first round became public , however , Jeremic sounded panicked .
During a visit to Greece , he downright pleaded for EU to support his party boss :
" The most critical decision that Serbia is going to be making in the next few weeks is strategically which path to take , " Jeremic said .
" Will it continue with European integration or will it choose another path ? …
We very much hope that Serbia ’s people are going to make " the choice of European integration .
( AP )
The following day , in Bucharest , Jeremic again appealed to Brussels , now saying that the signing of the SAA could help swing the vote in Tadic ’s favor .
However , he also said this :
" Our conviction is that the EU , in accordance with the international law , or with a new U.N. resolution , will send a mission to Kosovo and this will clear off all issues linked to such an engagement ’s legal conformity . ” ( Xinhua )
Unless he was mistranslated somehow ( though he speaks fluent British - affected English ) , Jeremic just invited the EU to Kosovo !
However , Prime Minister Kostunica indicated previously that an EU mission in Kosovo , intent on shepherding Albanian independence , was absolutely unacceptable to Belgrade .
If the EU gets to decide what is legal , then anything the EU wants to do can be declared legal .
It is extremely unlikely that Kostunica agreed to a EU mission ; odds are that , in his eagerness to prop up his embattled patron , Jeremic has finally overstepped his bounds .
What Tomorrow Brings
It is apparent that electoral results have shocked and shaken Tadic and his allies , to the point where they ’ve begun to stumble in the rhetorical minefield that is Serbian politics .
While Nikolic calmly thanked his voters for supporting him through a " difficult campaign , " Tadic gave an impassioned speech pleading for support , and pledging he would " not allow " Nikolic to become president .
Only , that really is n’t up to him , but rather to the voters , right ?
What a pesky thing , democracy .
Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology have finally explained a mystery that fishermen in the California current of the Pacific Ocean have monitored over the past 70 years .
Their discovery has resulted in the naming of a new climate pattern , one called the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation ( NPGO ) .
Fluctuations of salinity , nutrients and temperature have been taken by fishermen since 1945 , among other things , allowing them to track changes in fish populations such as anchovies and sardines .
Having studied these findings , Emanuele Di Lorenzo and his team discovered this new pattern of current .
“ We ’ve been able to explain , for the first time , the changes in salinity , nutrients and chlorophyll that we see in the Northeast Pacific , ” said Di Lorenzo , an assistant professor in Georgia Tech ’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences .
What makes this story even more interesting is its most recent intensifications at the hands of a warming planet .
“ Although the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation is part of a natural cycle of the climate system , we find evidence suggesting that its amplitude may increase as global warming progresses , ” said Di Lorenzo .
According to their research they have found that it has increased in intensity over the past few decades .
Climate scientists are continually focusing on discovering and understanding the planet ’s climate shifts , patterns and changes .
More than just trying to understand what is happening , being aware of the whole story helps see what will happen .
The more information that goes in to a computer model bent on predicting what will happen to a region , or the planet ’s climate , the more chance that the answer will be accurate .
The discovery of the NPGO has thus provided just that bit more information for computer models attempting to put a face to the future of our planets climate .

Astronomers studying star formation , like myself , use telescopes that can see though the pretty , optical exteriors of nebulae into the dark interiors where very cold dust radiates in the submillimetre and microwave regimes .
Microwaves , fall on the electromagnetic spectrum , between radio waves and infrared waves .
They are usually around the size of a few centimetres and you may well be very familiar with them as they are produced by the microwave oven that might just be sitting in your kitchen .
Microwave ovens use a particular microwave frequency to excite molecules of water .
Since water is present in lots of food and drink , this means that microwaves heat up lots of useful stuff – and they do it quickly .
The fact that microwaves are now readily available to most of us in the western world and they are only a few centimetres in length , means that you can measure the speed of light in your very own home .
What You Need :
The quickest and tastiest way to perform this little experiment is with marshmallows , but chocolate chips also work .
You ’ll obviously need a microwave oven as well , and a large , microwaveable dish .
You will need a ruler , too .
What to Do :
Get your large , microwaveable dish and place a layer of marshmallows at the bottom of it .
Remove the turntable from the bottom of the microwave oven .
If you do n’t , then this experiment will not work at all .
If your microwave does n’t have a turntable , it means that the turning mechanism is elsewhere and you ’ll need to find a regular microwave oven to try this experiment .
Cook the marshmallows on a low heat for a couple of minutes , or until you see parts of the marshmallows starting to bubble .
When you do , remove the dish and take a look at the marshmallows .
You ought to see that they have not melted evenly .
In fact you should be able to see a regular pattern has formed , drawn out in melted - mallow .
It depends on your microwave oven , but you should see a melted / unmelted pattern across the dish in some direction .
When I tried it at home , my oven created long melted strips next to long unmelted strips ( see above ) .
This regularity is caused by the same mechanism that heats up the food you place into your microwave oven .
The appliance generates microwaves which very quickly form standing waves ( see animation above ) inside the cavity inside , where you put food .
As the food rotates around , it passes through the standing wave nodes and this excites the water molecules , heating the food .
Measure the Microwaves :
Take your ruler and measure the distance between the melted parts of the marshmallows .
You should find that there is an even pattern of melting and that the distance between them is something like 5 or 6 cm .
Why ?
Because that is the distance between the nodes of the standing waves .
Without the rotating mechanism , the food does not move around and cook evenly , instead it just heats at the nodal points .
Using your marshmallows you have created a ‘ map ’ of the microwaves in your microwave oven !
Find the Frequency :
Finally you need to know the frequency at which your microwave oven operates .
It is usually written on the back somewhere in small writing .
Most standard microwave ovens operate at 2450 MHz .
If you cannot find the value on the back of the oven , you can take it for granted that 2450 MHz is about correct .
Measure the Speed of Light :
Now you have what you need to measure the speed of light .
You just need to know a very fundamental equation of physics :
Speed of a Wave ( c ) = Frequency ( f ) x Wavelength ( L )
The distance between the melted sections of the marshmallow is in fact L/2 , because there are two nodes for each wave ( see animation ) .
So if you have measured 6 cm and your oven operates at 2450 MHz , then your measured speed of light is ( 0.12 x 2450,000,000 ) 294,000,000 metres per second .
The agreed value of the speed of light through a vacuum is 299,792,458 metres per second .
See how accurately you can measure it ?
what could you do to make the experiment better , and thus get a closer answer ?
Now You Can Eat the Gooey Melted Marshmallows :
… and make yourself sick .

After looking at JavaScript programming sessions by Douglas Crockford here ) , I could n't stop but admire JavaScript .
There are many many impressive things in JavaScript but one of the eye - catchy thing was guarding operator in JavaScript .
The && operator in JavaScript can be acted in two ways .
The normal ' and ' operator which is used in determining the conditional logic results .
The other lesser known feature of JavaScript is the guard operator .
In following code - The same is with || operator too .
If the first operand is falsy then it just returns the second operand instead .

Investigation alleges ' cover - up ' attempt by immigration chief in offensive costume flap Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Update : Clinton ' appalled ' by ' racially insensitive ' immigration office
The country 's top immigration cop , Julie Myers , attempted to suppress photographs taken with a federal employee dressed in an offensive Halloween costume and oversaw a " coordinated effort to conceal " the extent of her involvement in praising the questionable garb until after her Senate confirmation , according to a new investigation .
Late Wednesday , Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) said she was " appalled " by the new report , from the House Homeland Security Committee .
The Democratic candidate reiterated her call for a change in tone to the immigration debate .
 I continue to be appalled about the inappropriate and racially insensitive activities that took place within our nations highest immigration enforcement entity , and am outraged that there was an effort to cover these incidents up , " Clinton said in a statement e-mailed to reporters Wednesday evening .
" I have consistently called for a change of tone in the immigration debate and this incident points to the urgent need for that to happen .
When the officials who are in charge of enforcing immigration laws display these kinds of prejudice , they become part of the problem instead of part of the solution .
It s time for this Administration to hold its public servants accountable .
The House Homeland Security Committee has been probing the circumstances of a Halloween party held last year for Department of Homeland Security Employees .
Myers , a DHS assistant secretary , was one of three judges who awarded " most original costume " to an employee who was dressed in skin - darkening makeup , a dreadlocks wig and prison stripes .
The Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Immigration and Customs Enforcement was photographed with the employee at the party , although it was more than three months until those photos would become public .
A 22 - page report ( .pdf ) released Tuesday night by the Homeland Security Committee 's majority staff reveals several new details about the party and the cover - up role played by Myers , who heads the Immigration and Customs Service .
The committee 's Democrats call for a full DHS investigation .
This examination indicates that Assistant Secretary Myers directed the destruction of photographs of the Halloween party , enlisted other DHS employees to destroy photographs and ordered the sanctioning and relocation of an employee in a coordinated effort to conceal the circumstances surrounding the party .
These activities were undertaken prior to the Assistant Secretarys Senate Confirmation hearing and may have been carried out to preclude or delay the public release of photographs that could have adversely impacted her confirmation hearings .
Myers ordered photos of the man in the offensive costume deleted after the party , but the report reveals for the first time that ICE learned those photos could be restored just a week later .
It took the agency two months to comply with a public records request for the photos -- more than three times longer than the law requires .
A DHS spokeswoman tells the New York Times that suggestions of a coordinated cover - up are " absolutely false . "
The Committee 's report made five recommendations : 1 . The Department of Homeland Security conduct a full investigation into any and all actions taken by ICE officials that either led to or were meant to lead to the concealment of this incident .
2 . An independent official be appointed to determine what , if any , laws may have been violated by ordering the destruction of photographs .
3 . The U.S. Office of Special Counsel examine whether the disciplinary actions taken against the employee that wore the costume were in accord with Federal personnel rules and regulations .
4 . The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determine whether the award to the employee that wore the costume created or contributed to a hostile work environment at ICE .
5 . The Department of Homeland Security publicly release the internal report commissioned by the Under Secretary for Management .
The DHS employee in the offensive costume apparently wore it to work that day prior to the Halloween party , which doubled as a charity fundraiser .
The employee , who has not been identified , appeared before Myers and the other judges to describe his costume during the party 's contest .
" I 'm a Jamaican detainee from Krome , obviously , I 've escaped , " he said , according to the committee report , prompting laughter from the judges .
Krome is a ICE detention facility in Miami that houses detainees from Jamaica , Haiti and Latin America , according to a report footnote .
It has been subject to allegations of " sexual abuse , overcrowding and mistreatment of detainees . "
A few hours after laughing with her colleagues over the costume , Myers became concerned about her " bad judgement call , " according to the report , and she ordered her chief of staff to have the photos of the man in the detainee costume destroyed .
The morning after the party , employees began to complain about the offensiveness of the costume Myers had dubbed most original .
She decided to reprimand the employee and require him to undergo counseling .
Myers also sent an e-mail to ICE employees on Nov. 2 apologizing for the costume award .
Three days later , Nov. 5 , news outlets had received word of the Halloween party and several stories containing broad details about the costume began to appear .
ICE leadership placed the employee on administrative leave , and the next day he was relocated to an ICE field office outside of Washington , according to the report .
CNN quickly filed a Freedom of Information Act Request for the photos from the Halloween party .
The freelance photographer hired by the agency told them soon after that it would be possible to restore the photos he deleted , allowing quick compliance with the FOIA request .
But ICE officials told him to wait for formal written confirmation .
It took the agency 60 days to comply with the request , a possible violation of federal open records laws , which require agencies to respond to requests within 20 days , according to the report .
Myers ' appointment as ICE chief was controversial from the start .
By the time of the Halloween party , she was nearing the end of her second year in the position after dual recess appointments from President Bush .
Several senators , including Missouri's Claire McCaskill and Connecticut 's Joseph Lieberman , raised questions about her fitness for the position , because of her complete lack of prior law enforcement experience and little management experience .
Many conservatives have also been critical of her appointment .
Myers , who is the niece of former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen.
Richard Myers , was finally confirmed by the Senate on December 19 , six weeks after the party .
It would be another six weeks until the costume photos would be released .
The men in this Wrestlemania billboard , if you look closely , have no nipples .
They were photoshopped out supposedly because of a law in Florida that prohibits the display of nipples . *
Since men's nipples are not sexualized in the same way that women's are , the authors of the law were likely thinking of women 's bodies as they penned this ban .
It may illustrate that it is women 's bodies that we think of when we think of bodies on display because of the adoption ( by men and women alike in this culture ) of a ( heteronormative ) male gaze .
Image and info found here via copyranter .
* UPDATE : The interesting follow - up to the story ( and I just realized a commenter caught this too ) is that it turns out the mayor was wrong : his city actually does n't have a law against displaying nipples .
It is unclear if he knew this at the time ( i.e. , was lying ) or really thought there was .
And apparently some posters in town DO have nipples .
What does this additional information add to an interpretation of this image ?
Things guys want us to know but ca n’t say
It is general notion that men usually kee things to themselves and just let things pass without hinting a word , that they avoid confrontations as much as possible .
These things are actually good for us , in a dominating sense , but hey , for my part , I would like a little voicing out .
It ’s pretty scary to see someone so silent and meek to just burst out in anger and lose control .
Think it will be fair ro air their sides for once .
Here are a couple of things men want to say but out of a number of reasons that they themselves only know , ca n’t let us know .
1. Chivalry ’s still alive and kicking .
Loads of men still would want to open the doors for us and pay for dinner or even pour wine for us .
So , let them do these things if they want to , as long as we can feel that they do it wholeheartedly .
2. Majority of men get annoyed when we answer our phones during a date , except when it ’s an emergency and it still bugs them what situations qualifies for us women as emergencies .
3 . Men would really appreciate if we would be more open in learning what they like to do .
Like watch baseball games or playing poker with them .
For my part , I want to learn to play poker , really .
4 . Our words are everything to them .
So they take whatever we say , if we say we ’re ok , they ’ll believe that , even though ok is our metaphor for there ’s something wrong and we need to talk .
Men are pretty straight - forward so a little degree of directness from us women wo n’t hurt as well .
5 . Like us women , they also need to bond with their friends without us barging in and looking devastatingly beautiful .
So , let ’s give them the time once in a while .
I do n’t pretend to be an expert on guys or know how to size them up perfectly .
But these are just from what I gathered from a couple of guy friends I have .
And we have a lot to be thankful to God when he created men even how independent we are .
I think it applies to all .
Women also expect the above from men but the difference is that we say it out loud .
What ’s important is that we compromise and give each other a little bit of freedom .
FOR thousands of years , people have sought substances that they hoped would boost their mental powers and their stamina .
Leaves , roots and fruit have been chewed , brewed and smoked in a quest to expand the mind .
That search continues today , with the difference only that the shamans work in pharmaceutical laboratories rather than forests .
If asked why , the shamans reply that they are looking for drugs to treat the effects of Alzheimer 's disease , attention - deficit disorder , strokes , and the dementias associated with Parkinson 's disease and schizophrenia — and that is the truth .
But by creating compounds that benefit the sick , they are offering a mental boost to the healthy , too .
Such drugs are known as cognition enhancers .
They work on the neural processes that underlie such mental activities as attention , perception , learning , memory , language , planning and decision - making , usually by altering the balance of the chemical neurotransmitters involved in these processes .
This week a report* from the Academy of Medical Sciences , a British learned society , says that a large number of such brain - affecting drugs are likely to emerge over the next few decades .
Sir Gabriel Horn , a researcher at Cambridge University who chaired the group that produced the report , reckons that scientists are working on more than 600 drugs for neurological disorders .
History suggests that most of these will fall by the regulatory wayside , but given their numbers , a fair few are likely to be approved .
And although none of the companies working on cognition - enhancing drugs designed to treat illness intends to license them for wider use , that is what is likely to happen — at least going by the growing “ off - label ” use of existing drugs such as Ritalin ( methylphenidate ) and Provigil ( modafinil ) by people who want to pep themselves up .
Provigil and Ritalin really do enhance cognition in healthy people .
Provigil , for example , adds the ability to remember an extra digit or so to an individual 's working memory ( most people can hold seven random digits in their memory , but have difficulty with eight ) .
It also improves people 's performance in tests of their ability to plan .
Because of such positive effects on normal people , says the report , there is growing use of these drugs to stave off fatigue , help shift - workers , boost exam performance and aid recovery from the effects of long - distance flights .
Earlier this year , Nature , one of the world 's leading scientific journals , carried out an informal survey of its ( mostly scientific ) readers .
One in five of the 1,400 people who responded said they had taken Ritalin , Provigil or beta blockers ( drugs that can have an anti-anxiety effect ) for non-medical reasons .
They used them to stimulate focus , concentration or memory .
Of that one in five , 62 % had taken Ritalin and 44 % Provigil .
Most users had somehow obtained their drugs on prescription or else bought them over the internet .
Given results like this , and the number of drugs of this kind that look likely to emerge , many people , including the authors of the report , believe that the use of cognition - enhancing drugs is going to grow a lot .
There are a number of approaches to cognition enhancement .
One of them , according to Trevor Robbins , a colleague of Sir Gabriel 's at Cambridge and another member of the working group , is to activate the brain 's “ off ” and “ on ” switches .
Crudely put , the brain 's neural networks can be thought of as electrical circuits .
Neurotransmitters throw the switches .
Thanks for the memory
One such neurotransmitter is glutamate .
This throws switches to the “ on ” position in memory - forming circuits .
Members of a newly discovered class of compounds , ampakines , boost the activity of glutamate and thus make it easier to form memories .
Cortex Pharmaceuticals , based in Irvine , California , is one firm that is developing ampakine drugs .
One of its compounds , code - named CX717 to disguise its exact identity , is undergoing testing for Alzheimer 's disease in elderly patients .
Early trials have already shown that the drug can make people more alert .
Unlike caffeine , amphetamines and other stimulants , CX717 causes no increase in blood pressure or heart rate .
Nor does it offer any “ high ” , so is unlikely to be addictive .
Paradoxically , another glutamate - booster , D - cycloserine , is being tested not to enhance memory , but to abolish it .
The paradox is resolved because unlearning ( or “ extinction ” , in neurological parlance ) is a process similar in its details to learning .
By binding to certain glutamate receptors , D - cycloserine selectively enhances extinction , suppressing the effects of conditioned associations such as anxiety , addiction and phobias .
According to Dr Robbins , experiments have shown that if a rat is given a cue that it previously associated with fear at the same time as it receives D - cycloserine , the bad memory can be eliminated .
Not only may this help remove unpleasant memories , such as those involved in post - traumatic stress disorder , but it may also help to return the brains of addicts to their pre-addicted states .
It may , for example , be able to remove the triggers that cause smoking .
Another approach to cognitive enhancement , says Dr Robbins , is through a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine .
Cholinergic neurons — the name for those that respond to this molecule — are involved in concentration , focus and high - order thought processes , as well as memory .
It is the cholinergic system that degenerates in Alzheimer 's disease .
Interest has thus focused on drugs that inhibit the breakdown of acetylcholine , and also on nicotine , which works by mimicking its effect .
Dr Robbins says that cholinergic drugs may offer minor cognitive benefits for things like alertness , and similar drugs could be “ potentially useful in normal humans ” .
Mind - expansion may soon , therefore , become big business .
Even though the drugs have been developed to treat disease , it will be hard to prevent their use by the healthy .
Nor , if they are without bad side - effects , is there much reason to .
And if that is so , there may be a very positive side - effect on the profits of their makers .

Some colleges said they placed more students on their waiting lists than in recent years , in part because of uncertainty over how many admitted students would decide to enroll .
Harvard and Princeton stopped accepting students through early admission this academic year ; that meant that more than 1,500 students who would have been admitted in December were likely to have applied to many elite schools in the regular round .
Many factors contributed to the tightening of the competition at the most selective colleges , admissions deans and high school counselors said , among them demographics .
The number of high school graduates in the nation has grown each year over the last decade and a half , though demographers project that the figure will peak this year or next , which might reduce the competition a little .
Other factors were the ease of online applications , expanded financial aid packages , aggressive recruiting of a broader range of young people , and ambitious students ’ applying to ever more colleges .
The eight Ivy League colleges mailed acceptance and rejection letters on Monday to tens of thousands of applicants .
Students could learn the fate of their applications online beginning at 5 p.m. on Monday , so three of the colleges said they were not ready to make public their admissions data .
But the expectation was that they would also turn out to have been more competitive than ever .
“ For the schools that are perceived to have the most competitive admissions processes , there has been this persistent rise in applications , ” said Jeffrey Brenzel , dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale .

Three people have been killed and about 10 injured in an attack on a military parade in Kabul attended by Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
Security forces whisked Mr Karzai and away and hundreds fled as shots rang out .
An MP and a 10 - year - old child were among the dead , officials said .
The parade was a celebration to mark 16 years since the overthrow of the country 's Soviet - backed rule .
A spokesman for the Taleban said the movement had carried out the attack .
He said they had not targeted Mr Karzai directly , but wanted to show how easily they could get access to such events .
The BBC's Alastair Leithead in Kabul says the fact that they were able to get so close despite such tight security is worrying for both the government and the international community .
I saw something - most likely a rocket - propelled grenade - land and explode in front of the stage

In pictures : Afghan parade attack ' Bullets , smoke and gunpowder '
The Taleban spokesman said six militants had been deployed near the parade with suicide vests and guns .
Three of them were killed and the other three arrested , he added .
In a live TV address after the incident , Mr Karzai confirmed that there had been arrests .
" Fortunately Afghan security forces quickly surrounded them , " he said .
" Some of them were captured . "
" Everything is calm , rest assured . "
Mr Karzai has frequently been the target of assassination attempts in recent years .
Later UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown phoned Mr Karzai to express his relief that he was safe and reaffirm his support for the Afghan government .
Gunpowder smell
The parade , in central Kabul , was part of Afghan National Day celebrations , marking the capture of Kabul from the Soviet - backed government by the mujahideen in 1992 .
The national anthem was being played when the attack started .
PREVIOUS ATTACKS ON KARZAI June 2007 - Taleban fire rockets at school in Ghazni province where he is speaking , no - one hurt Sept 2004 - Rocket fired at landing site of helicopter taking Mr Karzai to Gardez in the south - east , no - one hurt Sept 2002 - Militant dressed in Afghan army uniform fires at Mr Karzai 's car in Kandahar , wounding the province 's governor and a bodyguard Live TV showed President Karzai standing on a huge stage surrounded by a crowd of MPs , cabinet members , military commanders and foreign diplomats .
Automatic weapons were fired into the crowd and two people , apparently MPs , were seen slumping into their chairs .
Afghan Health Minister , Mohammad Amin Fatimie , who was sitting a few metres from Mr Karzai , described how bullets flew past the president .
" As soon as the first bullets hit , the president was covered by bodyguards , " he said .
" I could see bullets ricocheting , black smoke , and I could smell gunpowder , " he said .
" As the bullets were hitting the stage , I saw something - most likely a rocket - propelled grenade - land and explode in front of the stage , " the minister said .
Returning fire
The US and UK ambassadors and the Nato military commander were among dignitaries bundled away by security forces .
UK ambassador Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , who was in the front row , told Reuters news agency : " It was coming to the end of the 21 - gun salute .
I saw an explosion and a puff of dust to the left of the parade and then heard the crackle of small arms fire from all directions .
Live TV coverage of the event was cut off shortly afterwards , and the state channel switched to music .
Sirajudin , a police officer at the scene , told the Associated Press news agency he saw two people firing AK - 47 assault rifles from a house toward the area of the stage .
At least one explosion followed the gunfire , and security forces returned fire .
Soldiers dressed in ceremonial garb were seen running from the scene .
The event , which had been shrouded in tight security for days , was cancelled soon afterwards .
Police and army are now in control of the area .

According to Sender - Inner Stephanie D. , this kitteh 's thumbs inspired his Daddy to name him " Six - Shooter Denney - Enochs . "
Pew pew pew !
Using data recovered from a damaged computer hard - drive that was aboard the ill - fated Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003 , scientists have recently learned more about why the act of shaking a material can quickly transform it into something completely different .
One of the best examples of this phenomenon is ordinary ketchup .
Shake the bottle and the semi - solid paste becomes a runny liquid .
Food scientists do the shaking in a controlled way by putting ketchup ( and other processed foods ) into a rheometer ( rheo , meaning " flow " ) to see how its viscosity — the scientific word for stickiness — decreases when shaken .
Robert Berg and his colleagues at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg , MD. , wanted to do more than measure viscosity .
They wanted to know why the changes happen through " shear thinning , " a phenomenon in which agitation enhances a force that cuts across weak attachments among atoms or molecules .
Understanding shear thinning is a big deal in the industrial world of processed foods , polymers , and paints .
For instance , motor oil 's viscosity can be degraded by the movement of engine parts , and the application of paint to a surface can be easy or hard depending on the manner of the brushstroke .
Zero gravity
To better understand the microscopic relation between viscosity and shear thinning , the NIST scientists looked at how the thinning works in an unusual fluid — the gas xenon [ used to power some space probes ] .
The trick is , xenon 's own weight — as light as it is — still can compress the sample of the gas enough to throw off the delicate measurements that were needed .
To do a proper study , the experiment needed a zero- gravity environment .
And so up it went in Columbia .
But Columbia 's mission ended when insulation tiles on the leading edge of the left wing , damaged during launch , failed upon reentry .
The craft burned up and disintegrated , killing the seven astronauts on board .
Some of the data from the xenon experiment had been down - linked before the shuttle was destroyed , but the rest were stuck on the hard drive that fell to earth along with Columbia .
Fortunately , NASA 's recovery team found the hard drive among the debris that was scattered for hundreds of miles across Texas and Louisiana .
The data on the disk were retrieved by a company that specializes in recovering information from the kind of disk crashes that happen every day here on Earth .
The package in which the experiment itself took place was also found .
It was at the heart of a series of concentric shells , the outermost of which had burned up .
The cell containing the xenon atoms , however , was intact .
None of the atoms had escaped .
Xenon , a loner
Xenon is one of those atoms that does n't like to associate or react with other atoms .
The researchers set up the Columbia experiment to look at how xenon behaves when , under exact conditions of pressure and temperature , it exists midway between two fluid states .
Why go to the trouble of getting xenon atoms into just the right pressure conditions ?
Xenon is a gas , whereas ketchup and most interesting fluids consist of liquids and pastes .
The answer is that the shear thinning process becomes possible for even simple fluids like pressurized xenon at the special critical point .
What is learned from the simple fluid might also apply to ketchup .
While in orbit aboard Columbia , the xenon was gently stirred by a fine mesh , a sort of tiny tennis racket .
The experiment was a success .
Stirring harder decreased the viscosity , confirming a decades - long theory about the relation between shear thinning and stirring .
They published their results in a recent issue of Physical Review E .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved legislation to create a $ 300 billion mortgage - insurance fund and provide billions more in homeowner aid to stabilize a housing market shaken by a wave of foreclosures and a credit crunch .

The string of bills written by Democrats , the most aggressive government effort to date to combat the nation ’s housing woes , would give some first - time home buyers a $ 7,500 tax credit and send $ 15 billion to communities hit hard by the mortgage crisis to help them buy and fix abandoned homes .
The mortgage - insurance fund at the heart of the initiative would give the Federal Housing Administration fresh cash and a new mandate to refinance borrowers whose homes have dropped in value since they took out their mortgage .
Under the program , lenders would get an FHA guarantee on the loan if they wrote down the principal amount , an initiative that could help up to 500,000 borrowers .
The plan to retool the FHA passed 266 to 155 and notably drew the support of 39 Republicans , even though the measure faces a White House veto threat .
The homebuyer tax credit measure was approved by a margin of 322 to 94 .
CORRECTING EXCESSES
During a debate on Thursday , the key architect of the FHA plan said it would help correct excesses of an overheated housing market that for years saw Wall Street investors offer easy loan terms to risky borrowers .
“ Clearly there has been market failure with regard to mortgages , ” said Rep. Barney Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
While the legislation aims to free up $ 300 billion for the FHA , the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said the plan would affect no more than $ 85 billion in loans , in part because many mortgage investors would turn their backs on a program that requires them to record big losses .
A White House spokesman called the legislation “ a taxpayer - funded bailout for lenders and speculators , ” but the Bush administration supports some provisions and has left the door open for a compromise , even while promising a veto .
The House bill now goes to the Senate , which has yet to fully debate and vote on key elements in the House plan .
SENATE VOWS SIMILAR ACTION
The Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to begin drafting similar legislation to expand the FHA program on Tuesday .
It is also due to take up a separate provision in the House bill that would create a new regulator for housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
“ The passage of this bipartisan measure sends a clear signal to Americans -- and the White House -- that Congress is committed to helping people keep their homes and stabilize the markets , ” Sen . Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Senate panel , said after the House vote .
The Bush administration argues that it can help many borrowers by tweaking the existing FHA program , without bailing out parties it sees as undeserving .
The plan to offer federal money to local governments passed on a narrower margin than the other provisions and could be more vulnerable to critics in the Senate and the White House .
A separate provision of the housing legislation would allow municipal bond issuers to use letters of credit from the Federal Home Loan Banks instead of bond insurance .
In recent months , major bond insurance companies have been downgraded by credit ratings agencies , wreaking havoc in the market .
The director of food services for a big - city school system hatches an interesting idea :
If she changes the arrangement and display of school food , will it alter kids ’ decisions about what to eat ?
Without modifying menus , she decides to place the desserts first on the cafeteria line in one school , last in another and on a separate line altogether in others .
She varies the location of other foods as well .
The results are dramatic .
Simply by rearranging the cafeteria , the consumption of many items increases or decreases .
This example is a product of our imaginations , but we know from similar real - world experiments -- in supermarket design , for example -- that the arrangement of settings is important to the choices consumers make .
Behavior can be greatly influenced by small changes in the context .
And the influence can be exercised for better or for worse .
In the cafeteria , no doubt a careful designer could get kids to eat more healthy food and less junk .
Those who design supermarkets and school cafeterias are engaged in what we call “ choice architecture ” : the organization of the context in which people make decisions .
Choice architects are everywhere .
If you design the ballot that voters use to choose candidates , you are a choice architect .
If you are a doctor and must describe the alternative treatments available to a patient , you are a choice architect .
If you design the form that new employees fill out to enroll in the company healthcare plan , you are a choice architect .
If you are a parent , describing possible educational options to your son or daughter , you are a choice architect .
If you are a salesperson , you are a choice architect ( but you already knew that ) .

There are many parallels between choice architecture and more traditional forms of architecture .
A crucial parallel is that there is no such thing as a “ neutral ” design .
Cognitive psychology and behavioral economics have shown that small and apparently insignificant contextual details can have a major effect on people ’s behavior .
Researchers tell us that if a candidate is listed first on the ballot , he may well get a 4 % increase in votes .
If a doctor says 90 % of patients are alive five years after a certain operation , far more people will have the operation than if the doctor says 10 % of patients are dead five years after having it .
One memorable example of the power of choice architecture comes from the men ’s rooms at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam .
There the authorities have etched the image of a black housefly into each urinal .
It seems that men usually do not pay much attention to where they aim , which can create a bit of a mess , but if they see a target , their attention and accuracy improve .
Spillage at the airport decreased by 80 % !
Let ’s return to the cafeteria line .
If , all things considered , you think the arrangement of food ought to nudge kids toward what ’s best for them , then we welcome you to our new movement : libertarian paternalism .
We are keenly aware that both those words are weighted down by stereotypes from popular culture and politics .
Why combine two often reviled and seemingly contradictory concepts ?
The reason is that if the terms are properly understood , both concepts reflect common sense .
They are far more attractive together than alone -- and taken together , they point the way to a whole new approach to the role of government .
The libertarian aspect of the approach lies in the straightforward insistence that , in general , people should be free to do what they like .
They should be permitted to opt out of arrangements they dislike , and even make a mess of their lives if they want to .
The paternalistic aspect acknowledges that it is legitimate for choice architects to try to influence people ’s behavior in order to make their lives longer , healthier and better .

Private and public institutions have many opportunities to provide free choice while also taking real steps to improve people ’s lives .
* If we want to increase savings by workers , we could ask employers to adopt this simple strategy : Instead of asking workers to elect to participate in a 401 ( k ) plan , assume they want to participate and enroll them automatically unless they specifically choose otherwise .
* If we want to increase the supply of transplant organs in the United States , we could presume that people want to donate , rather than treating nondonation as the default .
A study by social scientists Eric Johnson and Dan Goldstein showed that “ presumed consent ” could save thousands of lives annually .
* If we want to increase charitable giving , we might give people the opportunity to join a “ Give More Tomorrow ” plan , in which some percentage of their future wage increases are automatically given to charities of their choice .

* If we want to respond to the recent problems in the mortgage market , and do something about credit cards and loans in general , we might design disclosure policies that ensure consumers can see exactly what they are paying and make easy comparisons among the possible options .
We find ourselves these days mired in political battles that pit laissez faire capitalism , with its reliance on unrestricted free markets , against heavily regulated capitalism , which favors government mandates and bans in an effort to ensure “ good ” outcomes .
But this opposition is false and misleading .
Any system of free markets will include some kind of choice architecture , and that means libertarian paternalism can offer a real “ third way ” around the battleground .
The most important social goals are often best achieved not through mandates and bans but with gentle nudges .
In countless domains , applying libertarian paternalism offers the most promising alternative to the tired skirmishing in the increasingly unproductive fight between the left and the right .

This talk was delivered at the Mises Circle at the University Club in New York City on September 16 , 2006 .
Since 1990 , we ’ve heard about what a low rate of inflation we ’ve experienced .
In some ways , it might appear low compared with what we experienced in the late 1970s .
The dollar of 1976 was worth only 63 cents by 1981 , once the Nixon - Carter inflation had done its work .
The cultural and economic consequences were devastating .
A generation was punished for having saved and accumulated capital .
Debtors were rewarded , with the government being biggest debtor , of course .
This period of our financial history was called the Age of Inflation .
But did it really come to an end ?
The problem is that we ’ve continued to live through the late 1970s , just stretched out over a greater period of time .
The dollar of 1990 is today worth 64 cents .
And yet we call this a low rate of inflation , though the same level of devaluation was accomplished .
Really , it is perverse that we should ever be sanguine about inflation .
It would be as if we screamed bloody murder if someone broke into our house one night and stole all our flatware , our electronics , and our precious metals .
But if the same burglar had the key and came in every day to grab just a fork , an iPod , or a Krugerrand , should we happily announce that we are experiencing a low - burglar rate ?
Whether you think prices are rising or falling depends on what you have been buying lately , because it is true that not all prices are rising .
Some are falling , and for this we can only be grateful .
Since 1996 , wireless telephone service has dropped by 40 % .
Personal computers and software accessories have fallen by more than 55 % .
Apparel in general , including women ’s clothing , has fallen by 10 % .
Furniture and bedding has fallen by 5 % .
Now , keep in mind several points .
These price declines are a reality .
They have n’t occurred despite the existence of the CPI .
Indeed , these price declines are factored into the creation of the CPI .
Now , the CPI is nothing but an index number that compares the change in one group of averages to the same group of averages at a later time .
It may or may not have anything to do with an individual consumer ’s experience .
The CPI is like a composite picture of all the pictures hanging in your living room ; such a thing can obscure more than reveal .
Murray Rothbard used to say that the main thing he bought with his money was scholarly books , one of the fastest - rising goods , and so his personal inflation rate was far above the average .
Of course , that was before the internet starting doing strange things to book prices , driving the price of new books way down , and the price of used books way up .
In any case , the CPI is not a measure of price inflation .
It is a statistical fiction that serves only the function of helping us keep track of general price movements .
There is nothing in nature called the consumer price index .
There are only consumer prices .
In the absence of government money management , prices rise and fall based on supply and demand .
Even in the presence of government management , not all prices rise at the same rate , while some prices fall .
For years ,
Fed officials and others have warned about the grave dangers associated with deflation .
Now , we praise this very thing taking place in clothing , technology , and other goods that you can buy at large discount stores .
What is the result ?
It ’s been a wonderful blessing to consumers .
Indeed , it has been our saving grace in times of soaring prices for education , energy , houses , and medical care .
If some prices had not fallen , the American economy would be in much worse shape .
Does deflation make business more difficult ?
Most certainly .
Retailers can’t hold on to inventory as long .
The maintenance of profitability involves relentless innovation , keen - eyed cost watching and cutting , and constant attention to the competition .
In a deflationary environment , consumers expect outstanding services and a big bang for their buck .
They are ready to defect to the competition over the slightest thing .
All these are facts of life in a deflationary environment .
My only question is : why should we regret this ?
If we seek an economy in which waste is held to a minimum , the people are served , the consumer is king , business operates with top efficiency and innovation , this is all to the good .
Deflation never harmed anyone except those who are not willing to work hard for their profits .
It ’s true that these industries are constantly kvetching about this supposed problem .
But I do n’t see any evidence that entrepreneurs are thereby avoiding these industries .
In fact , these industries have become increasingly competitive and robust job creators .
Deflation clarifies what kind of business people should be doing and who should be doing it .
Let me give you an example from the Mises Institute store .
Last year we considered offering specialized flash keys of memory , emblazoned with the Institute logo .
We hoped to carry sticks that held up to 1 gig of data .
Pricing them out , we found that they were running about $ 100 retail .
We could get them customized at wholesale prices .
But then we took notice of price trends for hard memory , and saw nothing but falling prices .
So we decided against it .
Sure enough , six months later , you could get a gig stick for $ 50 , less than we could have paid to have them made .
Today you can find them for $ 20 in some places .
What would have happened to our stock ?
We would have had to sell at a loss .
What this taught us is that we should leave the business of computer hardware sales to specialists .
Downward price pressure helped us understand this .
If you are in business , you understand this point too .
I was walking through an Office Max the other day and saw some gig sticks for $ 80 .
Now , either the store manager is not paying attention to price changes or he is counting on very gullible consumers .
You ca n’t make money for long with either practice .
Well , let us consider , then , some of the price increases that have skewed the CPI so as to cause the entire index to rise so dramatically over the same period of time .
Medical care has gone up 45 % since 1996 .
Education has gone up 80 % .
Housing has gone up 33 % .
Energy prices have soared more than 100 % .
Now , given these figures , and excluding the deflationary sectors , it should be clear that the CPI should be rising much more than it is .
And yet even by the standard measure , the increase of inflation in our times has led to declines in real wages over the last three years , in a period of sustained economic growth .
This is an alarming fact .
Thanks to inflation , we are not benefiting from economic growth the way we should .
If the economy turns to recession under these conditions , it ’s not going to be a pretty picture .
Take notice of the sectors in which prices are rising and those that are falling .
The markets that are relatively free are innovative and internationally competitive .
Consumers have benefited from pressure from imports .
The globalization of textiles , for example , has been a great boon to consumers , and this is despite protectionist legislation designed to keep out as many goods as possible .
These sectors are also the most innovative .
Meanwhile , the sectors in which government is heavily involved — through taxes , regulations , subsidies , protectionism , price supports , and what have you — we find prices are going up .
What is happening here ?
To some extent , the interventions themselves are keeping prices high .
But they are also immunizing these sectors against pressures that would otherwise cause them to respond to inflationary prices by cutting costs .
In other words , it is the inflationary pressure of bad monetary policy that has affected these sectors more than any other .
The relatively free market sectors are dealing with inflationary pressure by adjusting to serve consumers in the best possible way .
When I say “ bad ” monetary policy , let me be clear what I mean .
I mean all monetary policy — the very existence of monetary policy .
The free market position that Mises and his successors laid out regards money as a good like any other , one whose creation and management should be handled by the market economy .
There should be no policy at all .
That ’s the free market answer .
Most economists are happy to have the market for shoes , watches , and computers managed by the market , but they draw the line on money .
They believe that in this sector , we need socialist - style money management .
This is where the Austrians are different .
Carl Menger broke new ground in 1871 by explaining the origin of money .
It was not created by the state or by some sort of social compact .
It emerged from within the structures of the market economy .
Barter is suitable for a primitive level of development , but once societies and economies grow more complex , traders find a need for a good that they can purchase and hold to trade for other goods and services at a later time .
This good is the most highly valued good in society , also called money .
Money makes possible the emergence of cardinal numbers that permit calculation of profits and losses over time .
This is the essence of what it means to economize .
Experience suggests that the best money commodity is one that is divisible , qualitatively uniform , has a high value per unit of weight , is portable , and cannot be manufactured without end .
Precious metals , then , have served this function quite well .
One precious metal rose above the others in being the most suitable , and that is gold .
Now , there is nothing magical or mystical about gold that made it money .
It just happened to conform mostly closely to the features that make for excellent money .
That ’s why the quality of money in society is so critical to a well - functioning economy .
And how do we insure quality ?
It is the same with money and banking as it is with computers and cell phones .
We need the market to be in charge .
We need free entry and exit , rivalrous competition , consumer sovereignty , and no special privileges .
Our current monetary system has none of those features , so we should n’t be surprised to see the quality of our money slipping day by day .
As we all know , the dollar was once as good as gold .
We never had a perfect gold standard in this country , which I would define as being one that provides for perfect and instant convertibility between paper money and gold coin , one without a central bank managing it , one in which there is no government coinage but only private coinage , and one that circulated in a banking system that enjoys no government privileges whatsoever .
That ideal system has never been a reality in full .
But as a general rule , the more closely a money system reflects that ideal , the better it is .
The more it is monopolized , cartelized , managed , and papered over , the worse it is .
This was the thesis advanced by Ludwig von Mises in his 1912 book entitled The Theory of Money and Credit .
At the beginning of the age of central banking , he took us back to the beginning to show what money is , how it acquires its value , and where the attempt to monopolize it would lead .
In the intervening years , he has been proven right .
The dollar today is worth a bit less than a nickel from what it was at the founding of the Federal Reserve .
Now , this is a remarkable fact , given that prices had been on a general downward decline during the whole of the 19th century , excepting periods of war .
It is even more remarkable when you consider that one of the stated jobs of the Fed was to stabilize the value of our money .
Looking at the long trend , we can say not only that the Fed has failed to do its job but , even worse , it has produced the very opposite results of its promise .
This is especially true in the area of business cycles , which the Fed was supposed to counter with careful management of the money supply .
It was supposed to provide more money in times when business conditions supposedly required more liquidity .
It was supposed to pull back on its money creation in other times when liquidity was not necessary .
No surprise : it turns out that the Fed has never met business conditions that it deemed not to be in need of liquidity .
In many ways , the Fed is a childish institution .
I mean this in a very precise sense .
A key feature of childish behavior is that it is action taken without a thought given to how actions might affect the reactions of others .
Children always assume that they live and act in a vacuum .
They are forever shocked to see that others ’ lives are impacted by their choices .
Part of the process of maturity involves the realization that one ’s actions cause reactions from others .
But it takes many years to mature .
Childish traits can continue even into teenage and college years , when kids still imagine themselves to be autonomous actors and forget that their actions generate responses from others that might foil their plans .
Think of the typical teenage driver , buzzing in and out of lanes , zipping around cars , speeding up and slowing down based solely on his own whim .
He does n’t give a thought to how his behavior impacts the responses of other drivers , and makes the roads less safe .
He looks at traffic patterns as a given , and assumes that everyone is neutral with regard to his own driving .
So too does the Fed pursue its goal without a thought to how market actors are going to respond .
It will lower the price of credit on the market for bank lending .
This affects other interest rates by driving them down .
All of it is paid for by money created out of thin air .
In the same way that children and teens might consider their actions “ neutral ” from the point of view of others — since they are thinking only of themselves — so too the Fed considers money to be neutral with respect to the market .
The Fed figures that it is only adding liquidity , but in fact it is gravely distorting the decision - making process , particularly as it affects long - term investment .
It is because this assumption of neutral money is at the heart of the monetary model of the Fed that they can believe that its inflationary policies do not constitute intervention in the market process .
What they do not consider is that cheap credit sends signals to entrepreneurs to over - extend themselves , planning products that take a very long time to complete and presuming a more robust capital stock than exists in reality .
When the reality is revealed — usually after the rate of monetary expansion slows — the boom turns to bust .
Here we have a short description of the business cycle in its barest outlines .
The other day , the London Financial Times published an article that drew attention to the Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle .
It said that only Mises and Hayek ’s theory can account for the constant emergence of bubbles in such sectors as housing .
Having watched the press coverage of the Austrians for years , I ’ve noticed that we can almost track the business cycle based on the number of mentions of the Austrian Cycle theory in the press .
They never mention the Austrian theory in the boom times .
It is only once the bust hits , and no one can really explain why it is happening , that the Austrians come in for mention .
If you have ever wondered why the Austrians have a reputation as a school of gloom and doom , this might be why !
But let us remember that the Austrian theory is not just a theory of the bust .
It is a theory of the boom and bust .
It recognizes that there is a distinction between the appearance of prosperity and its reality .
If you really want to explain a bust , you ca n’t just look at the factors that coincided with a fall .
You have to look back to the boom period and see what artificial factors led the market to expand at an unsustainable rate .
This was the primary focus of the Austrians in the interwar period .
In a book the Mises Institute is publishing right now , we find a series of wonderful essays by Mises .
One is from 1928 in which he warns that inflationary credit has blown up many sectors beyond a sustainable rate .
He warned of a coming collapse , one that would affect banking in particular .
After that bust hit , he wrote a series of essays that reviewed its causes and pointed the way forward .
He urged a policy of laissez - faire that would let the downward adjustment take place so that the economy could again stabilize .
Of course , his advice was rejected .
This was the age of central planning .
Keynes was its prophet in England and America , while FDR was its political arm .
In the East , the future belonged to Stalin .
In Europe , it belonged to Mussolini and Hitler .
The handful of laissez - faire radicals like Mises and Hayek — along with American thinkers like Nock , Flynn , Chodorov , and Benjamin Anderson — were in an extreme minority .
There is far more at stake with this debate than merely discovering the technical causes behind the business cycle , or even in securing the monetary unit against depreciation .
What is really at stake in the debate over money is the very idea of freedom itself , which always means freedom from the arbitrary and expansionist power of the state .
After all , the real reason that government destroyed the gold standard , and why our money has been completely untied from anything real and has been reduced to nothing more than computer entries backed by pressed cotton tickets with colored printing of idealized government officials , has little to do with theoretical error .
Government found it to be in its interest to create all the money it would ever need for itself .
The power to inflate , from the point of view of government , meant that it could be liberated to some extent from the need to tax .
The power to inflate is absolutely crucial to the agenda of everyone who believes in using the government to manage the economy and society .
As Mises says , they need the power to inflate in order to finance their policy of reckless spending , lavish subsidies , and bribing voters .
They also need it for financing their wars , bailouts , and space shuttle trips , and for building their ever - larger palaces to keep comfortable the millions of bureaucrats they employ to make our lives miserable .
People talk of restraining government , but there will be no restraining government so long as the monetary system permits government to expand and spend without limit .
So long as their debt is not traded with a default premium , so long as the government and all its connected institutions are considered to be too big to fail , we are going to have a problem with the expansion of power and the loss of freedom .
Whenever the subject of monetary reform comes up , people ask many questions about the technicalities involved .
How can we get by without a Fed , without deposit insurance , without a Bureau of Engraving and Printing ?
How can we determine the gold definition of the dollar ?
What will happen to all the dollars overseas ?
How can we really know how much money there is to be covered ?
There are answers to all these questions .
You can gain them by reading two Rothbard books : What Has Government Done to Our Money ? and The Case Against the Fed .
I also highly recommend to you the most systematic study on the Austrian business cycle and its relationship to money that has ever been published : Jesus Huerta de Soto ’s Money , Bank Credit , and Economic Cycles .
But I submit to you that none of these technical issues are what is standing in the way of monetary reform .
What is really stopping a much - needed change is public ideology .
So long as the political system encourages the idea that government is the savior of mankind , the solver of all human problems , the machine that will bring freedom to the world through tanks and bombs , we are going to have the problem of monetary instability .
Sound money and freedom go together .
So long as we do not want freedom , we can never achieve the goal of sound money .
For what government is doing to our money is nothing but a microcosm of what government is doing to our freedom .
To institute sound money is to put a lock on the door so that the burglar of government cannot get in to steal from us , at either a fast or a slow rate .
Someday if you ever meet a person who is disparagingly called a goldbug , you might ask him why it is that he likes to collect and hold gold coins .
The answer is that owning and holding gold symbolizes independence and freedom .
Governments can destroy it .
They can take it away if they can find it , and they have in the past .
But so long as we are free to buy it and keep it , we are able to hold a tangible good that remains universally recognized as a standard of value .
It reminds us of what real money could be if we would ever let go of our attachments to the redistributionist state .
Thus does the goldbug understand far more about the nature of things than others who blithely assume that wealth can be created by a printing press .
The case for radical monetary reform need not be left to the goldbugs , or to the Austrians at the Mises Institute .
We are perfectly happy for anyone of any perspective to join our cause .
But by understanding the connection between liberty and money , we gain some insight into why Mises , as a great libertarian , was also a passionate advocate of sound money .
We can see why it is that his brilliant student Rothbard followed up on his cause .
It is only the libertarians who seem to fully understand the relationship between free markets in money and free markets in general .
To champion one is to champion the other .
This , I believe , is why we seem to be so alone in this battle .
Those who have a stake in statism also have a stake in its means of finance .
Those who might otherwise appreciate an economy without business cycles and inflation are unwilling to abide by the extreme limits that sound money places on state expansion .
Consider a book like Jesus Huerta de Soto ’s on money and business cycles .
This is one of the great works on money that has been published .
Why is it left to the Mises Institute to publish it ?
Because it takes a seriously radical institute to raise the fundamental questions of our age .
Our publishing arm is not afraid to push forward the boundaries of economic science to the point where the conclusions bring into question the whole of the modern political project .
And so we must .
And so we will .
We appreciate every bit of help you can provide us in this great cause .
Join us in our intellectual struggle , so that we may once again embrace the freedom that is our heritage and our destiny .

A United Nations commission has ruled that Australia can expand its continental shelf by 2.5 million square kilometres .
The UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf made the ruling after successive Australian governments sought clarification on the extent of control they had over the part of the continent that is submerged under the sea
Federal Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson says the extra area could be full of resources .
" It means for a resource - rich nation such as Australia , added resource entitlements going to issues of oil and gas , " he said .
" But also you might say additional responsibilities in terms of the floor of the seabed . "
The decision gives Australia the right to look for resources in those areas , but does not give it control over shipping or whaling .
Mr Ferguson says he will ask the Governor - General to proclaim the land .
" This is potentially a bonanza , we have got unknown capacity out there , " he said .
" It also raises questions about what potential regimes might be necessary in the future to encourage such exploration . "

List of Green Tea Beneficial Effects :
by eMedExpert staff
Medical references reviewed : August , 2018
What is green tea good for ?
Numerous modern studies have researched the useful properties of green tea .
And today scientists continue to investigate known properties and discover new health benefits of green tea .
Tea contains polyphenols which are strong antioxidants and possess numerous biochemical activities .
Tea polyphenols consist mostly of catechins , the most powerful of them is epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) .
EGCG is found only in green tea .
Since ancient times green tea has been considered a health - promoting beverage and currently researchers find more convincing proof of its healing qualities .
Based on the growing number of studies that explore health benefits of green tea , I made this article describing clear beneficial effects you can get with regular drinking .
1 Longevity
Green tea may protect against death from all causes , especially cardiovascular disease .
The findings from numerous Japanese studies might explain in part the reason why the people in Japan live longer than people in any other country .

What research says :
Green tea may reduce the risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease [ 44 ] [ 38 ]
People drinking 5 or more cups a day have a significantly lower risk of death from all causes , especially lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and stroke [ 1 ]
Green tea properties contributing to lifespan extension :
2 Memory and Learning
One of the important health benefits of regular green tea drinking is improved memory and learning ability .
What research says :
High green tea drinking maintains cognitive function [ 2 ]
Green tea consumption may enhance learning and memory ability [ 3 ]
Green tea enhances functional brain connectivity [ 36 ]
EGCG enhances hippocampal neurogenesis in adults [ 46 ]
Underlying mechanism :
The main components of green tea that are thought to work on improving brain function and neuroprotection are polyphenols , epigallochatechin - 3 - gallate ( EGCG ) , a very potent antioxidant .
High use of oxygen during the metabolic processes leads to generation of a large number of free radicals ( highly reactive molecules ) .
EGCG can decrease oxidative damage to DNA and suppress brain dysfunction [ 45 ] .
3 Weight control
There is strong scientific evidence that green tea has fat - burning and antiobesity properties .
What research says :
Drinking 4 cups of green tea daily promotes a significant weight loss and reduction of systolic blood pressure [ 47 ]
Green tea extract rich in catechins promotes reduction in body fat , total and LDL cholesterol [ 35 ]
Underlying mechanism :
Green tea polyphenols are known to increase the metabolism of fats by the liver ( thermogenic effect ) , inhibit lipase ( fat absorption enzyme ) in the digestive tract , and provide a feeling of satiety and fullness [ 4 ] .
Green tea can reduce body weight in obese persons by increasing energy expenditure and fat oxidation [ 5 ] .
4 Skin protection from Ultraviolet
Green tea polyphenols protect the skin from the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation such as UV - induced sunburn , UV - induced immunosuppression and photoaging of the skin .
Underlying mechanism :
Green tea exerts photoprotection by various cellular , molecular and biochemical mechanisms [ 6 ] .
Green tea polyphenols prevent UV - induced immunosuppression by repair of DNA damage and enhancement of nucleotide excision repair genes [ 48 ] .
Also , green tea polyphenols protect the skin by improving the elastic tissues [ 7 ] .
5 Lowering cholesterol
Green tea lowers total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels and improves the ratio of HDL to LDL cholesterol .
What research says :
People who drink green tea daily have lower cholesterol levels than those who do not drink it [ 8 ]
Underlying mechanism :
One of the underlying mechanisms by which green tea lowers blood cholesterol levels is by reducing lipids absorption in the digestive tract and promoting their excretion from the body [ 9 ] .
6 Diabetes and blood glucose levels
Green tea may help regulate the blood sugar and reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes .
What research says :
People who drink more than 6 cups per day are less likely to develop diabetes than those who drink less than 1 cup per week [ 10 ]
Daily use of green tea has favorable effect on insulin resistance [ 49 ]
Underlying mechanism :
Green tea antidiabetic properties may be partly explained by its caffeine content .
Japanese researchers [ 11 ] demonstrated that daily intake of green tea extract lowered the hemoglobin A1 c level in people with borderline diabetes , that indicates the increased body 's ability to utilize blood sugar .
Hemoglobin A1c is a test that measures the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells .
These molecules attach to glucose and so people have more of them if they have more glucose in the blood .
7 Heart protection : Asian paradox
Green tea may protect against heart disease .
Green tea consumption might explain the " Asian paradox " - when people living in Asian countries smoke cigarettes heavily , but have relatively low incidence of heart disease .
What research says :
The more green tea people drink , the less likely they are to have coronary artery disease [ 12 ]
Green tea can reduce heart muscle cells death after a heart attack ( myocardial infarction ) [ 13 ]
Underlying cardioprotective mechanisms of green tea :
Vasculoprotective
Antioxidative
Antithrombogenic
Anti-inflammatory
Cholesterol - lowering
8 Anti-hypertensive
Green tea lowers blood pressure and helps prevent hypertension .
What research says :
Among persons consuming tea regularly for at least one year , the risk of developing high blood pressure was 46 % lower among those who drank 1 / 2 cup to 2 1/ 2 cups per day , and 65 % less among those consuming more than 2 1 /2 cups per day [ 15 ]
Underlying mechanism :
Tea increases body 's production of nitric oxide , which dilates arteries and thereby reduces blood pressure [ 14 ] .
9 Stroke
Green tea shows promise in the prevention of stroke [ 1 , 16 ] .
Furthermore , the green tea polyphenols , particularly EGCG , have been shown to protect brain cells from destructive processes following stroke [ 17 ] .
10 Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases
Green tea may reduce the risk of degenerative disorders of the central nervous system , such as cognitive decline , Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's diseases .
What research says :
People who consume more than 2 cups of green tea a day may have a 50 % lower chance of developing cognitive impairment , than those who drink fewer than 2 cups a day , or who consume other tested beverages [ 19 ]
Green tea improves cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer 's disease [ 50 ]
Underlying neuroprotective mechanism :
Green tea catechin polyphenols produce several neuroprotective ( i.e. lessening the damage to brain cells ) activities like iron chelation , scavenging of radicals , activation of survival genes and cell signaling pathways , and inhibitory action on Abeta fibrils / oligomers formation [ 18 , 20 ] .
11 Atherosclerosis
Regular green tea drinking may be beneficial for the prevention of atherosclerosis , when the plaque builds up on the insides of the arteries [ 21 ] .
Underlying mechanism :
Green tea effectively reduces the risk of atherosclerosis by lowering LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , lipid peroxides ( free radicals that damage LDL cholesterol and other lipids ) and fibrinogen ( a protein in the blood involved in the formation of blood clots ) , and by reversing endothelial dysfunction .
Green tea is a powerful antioxidant and protects LDL cholesterol from oxidation [ 22 ] .
Oxidized cholesterol gets sticky and tends to cling to the walls of the arteries , leading to the development of atherosclerosis .
12 Anticlotting effect
Green tea appears to prevent the formation of blood clots ( thrombosis ) .
Green tea catechins produce potent antithrombotic effect by inhibition of platelet aggregation ( blood clot formation ) [ 23 ] .
13 Increased exercise endurance
Animal studies indicate that green tea increases exercise endurance .
Green tea catechins stimulate fatty acid utilization and improve metabolic capacity during intensive physical activity [ 24 ] .
14 Smoking harms
Regular green tea drinking may protect smokers from oxidative damages and reduce cancer risk or other diseases caused by free radicals generated by cigarette smoking ( e.g. cardiovascular diseases , atherosclerosis , asthma ) [ 25 ] .
Green tea may prevent future cardiovascular disorders in chronic smokers [ 26 ] .
Advertisement
15 Bones
Green tea may prevent osteoporosis and bone loss .
What research says :
Green tea may increase bone mineral density [ 27 ]
Bone mineral density is 2.8 % higher in people who drink green tea than in those who do not drink tea [ 28 ]
16 Tooth decay ( dental caries )
Green tea prevents tooth decay .
It kills the bacteria that cause dental plaques and halitosis ( bad breath ) and increases the acid resistance of tooth enamel [ 29 ] .
17 Arthritis
Green tea reduces inflammation and slows cartilage destruction in people with arthritis [ 30 ] .
Recently green tea was found to exert anti-rheumatic activity in rheumatoid arthritis due to EGCG anti-inflammatory properties [ 37 ] .
18 Antimicrobial activity
Green tea catechins have anti-bacterial , anti-viral and anti-fungal activities [ 31 ] .
What research says :
A component of green tea may be useful in treating severe sepsis , an abnormal immune system response to bacteria [ 32 ]
Green tea extract significantly inhibits the growth of many pathogens , including Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , Salmonella , Listeria monocytogenes , and food - poisoning bacteria Bacillus cereus [ 51 ]
19 Liver protection
Green tea appears to support healthy liver and protect it from the damage by toxic substances such as alcohol .
Men who drink more than 10 cups of green tea per day are less likely to develop disorders of the liver [ 33 ] .
20 Gastrointestinal tract
Green tea activates intracellular antioxidants , suppresses formation of procarcinogens , and reduces inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract .
Drinking more than 10 cups per day may prevent chronic atrophic gastritis [ 34 ] .
Also , it may help reduce inflammation associated with Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis .

Pressure is building in the European Union for common rules to discourage , or punish , excessive payments to top business executives .
France , which takes over the presidency of the EU on 1 July , will ask finance ministers to consider a European directive to curb disproportionate bonuses or golden handshakes to company bosses .
The Dutch government has already introduced a draft national law to punish what it describes as " unjustifiable " payments to business leaders .
The French finance minister , Christine Lagarde , said companies must put their own house in order or face a rash of national , or EU , legislation to clamp down on " excesses " .
French officials said Paris felt that , without such an EU - wide curb , large companies or highly paid executives would evade national curbs by exercising their right to move from one EU country to another .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Jean - Claude Juncker , Luxembourg 's Prime Minister , and president of the " Eurogroup " – the countries using the Euro – recently described steep increases in executive pay as a " social scourge " .
He said EU governments should consider ways of punishing disproportionate bonuses and high severance payments with windfall taxes .
The economic problems generated by the global credit squeeze and high oil prices have made executive pay a hot issue in all European countries .
Even some right - of - centre governments – such as those in France , Luxembourg and Germany – complain that self - indulgent business leaders are making it difficult to argue for low annual pay deals for lower - level employees .
The French business magazine , L'Expansion , reported on Wednesday that payments to the chief executives of France 's top companies , including salaries , share options and dividends , increased by 58 per cent last year to £ 128m .
A French law forcing companies to be more transparent about executive pay has had a perverse effect .
Instead of discouraging big payments , it has encouraged French bosses to demand parity with their highest - paid colleagues and rivals .
Mme Lagarde , herself a former top business executive in Chicago , said such high payments to the bosses of failing French companies was " perfectly scandalous " , adding : " There is absolutely no problem when people succeed ; let them earn lots of money . "
Businesses , and employer 's federations , must take action soon to curb unwarranted payouts or " there will be popular pressure for laws , or European directives to intervene " , she went on .
" A principle of fairness is at stake . "
How could governments urge low pay rises at a time of falling living standards if executives were awarding themselves 58 per cent increases in their remuneration packages ?
President Nicolas Sarkozy has already spoken out against large " golden parachutes " to failed business leaders .
Although often presented in Britain and the US as a kind of French Mrs Thatcher , he has called for the " moralisation of capitalism " , something closer to the late President Charles de Gaulle 's statist and social approach to business .
The Dutch finance minister , Wouter Bos , has proposed a draft law that would impose a 30 per cent tax on companies giving high bonuses or severance payments to top employees .
The proposed " fat cat tax " has provoked anguished protests from large Dutch companies , who say that it will ruin their ability to compete on the European , and international , market .
Some companies , including Royal Dutch Shell , have warned that they might move their headquarters to another country .
Mr Bos , the leader of the Dutch labour party , is unrepentant .
" It 's something everyone in Europe is concerned about , especially now the economic downturn is starting to bite , " he said .
" You can't expect employees to tighten their belts while those at the top are being paid ever - bigger bonuses , which are often not even linked to their performance .
Public support for entrepreneurs will plummet if this continues . "
You can only imagine how long this meeting was .
After decades of wrangling , the big brains at the Department of Defense finally got around to defining exactly what is meant by the term “ cyberspace . ”
This was distributed in an official memorandum at the Pentagon .
All I can say is “ It ’s about time ! ”
The definition :
I have a copy of the DoD Memorandum here .
It references Presidential directives for Homeland Security and National Security and helpfully clarifies the term for secretaries of the military departments .
And this is why contractors make the big bucks in Washington , DC .
If you live in San Francisco 's Bay Area and your name is Darth Vader , head to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for the hottest laser action in the galaxy .
Instead of destroying planets , however , the $ 3 - billion National Ignition Facility will be used to fuse hydrogen atoms to create a small star and , in theory , get us closer to an endless power source .
A PBS crew got into the facility to film it , and the only thing that comes to mind is " impressive .
Very Impressive . "
The process is fascinating .

It all starts with a single laser , which is split into 48 separate beams .
The beams are then redirected using mirrors into amplifiers — previously pumped by a total of 7,680 Xenon flash lamps — and , after four bounces , they are further split into 192 rays through all the facility — which is the size of three football fields .
As they travel through those endless tubes they will be amplified again at an exponential rate .

The result : from a tiny 1 / billionth of a joule laser , the scientists at the National Ignition Facility will end up with rays " a foot on the their side " with a combined " 1.8 million joules of ultraviolet energy " , 1,000 times the energy of all the power plants in the United States combined .
That 's five trillion watts ( and as any numbnuts know , a trillion is more than a million . )

The lasers will then compress the frozen hydrogen fuel cell pictured here , which will be enclosed in a gold - plated cylinder called the hohlraum .
The hohlraum — which was probably brought through a Stargate — is located inside the 32.8 - foot - diameter ignition chamber , and it will transforms the lasers into extremely intense X - rays , compressing the hydrogen at one hundred billion atmospheres in just 1/1,000,000 of a second .

This will trigger a controlled nuclear fusion reaction that will create a small star , hopefully generating more power than the energy used to fire the laser and contain the intense heat inside the chamber .

All this in theory .

Daily in countless classrooms across the U.S. , teachers are using standardized curriculum to prepare their students to take and score highly on high - stakes achievement tests .
But critics say forcing K - 12 schools to follow a single standard of education is no cure - all .
In fact , such an approach places students and teachers into a historic trend of capitalism to exert ever greater control over the workplace .
I spoke with five classroom teachers in California ’s capital city .
They have a range of opinions about the state forcing all teachers to use standardized curriculum to raise students ’ scores on achievement tests .
Bob Priestly , who currently teaches 7th - grade science at Sam Brannan Middle School in the Sacramento City Unified District , has a critique of the standard curriculum and achievement tests .
He has been a teacher for 16 years .
“ We are n’t drones now , but before standardized tests there was more freedom for teachers to create their own approaches to the subject matter such as life science , ” he said .
“ Such freedom is unwelcome now and teachers can be administratively disciplined for that .
“ The traditional middle school before standardized tests was a place where kids explored new things inside and outside the classroom in an ‘ exploratory wheel ’ of elective classes , such as art , drama , second languages , and shop .
That ’s been wiped out as a result of penalties for sub - par test scores .
If they score under the proficient level on the tests , students can lose their elective classes and have to take up to two language arts and math classes each ( per semester ) to attain proficiency the next time . ”
The test scores of Brian Laird ’s students at West Campus High School in the Sacramento City Unified School District rank among the highest in the city and California .
He currently teaches advanced placement and college prep economics and U.S. history .
His students take the state tests May 1 - 14 , the results of which he uses to find any instructional areas for possible improvement .
“ Testing helps students only in as much as it helps me to teach the standardized curriculum , ” said Laird , who began teaching in California ’s Silicon Valley city of San Jose 12 years ago , arriving at West Campus in 2000 .
In his view , the state curriculum is generally “ helpful to have ” as a “ map for instruction . ”
Rose Penrose currently teaches 6th - grade English at the Natomas Middle School in Sacramento ’s Natomas Unified School District .
In her sixth year of teaching , she instructs three 88 - minute classes of English , with 30 students in each .
Penrose and her fellow teachers , by department and grade level , create a “ pacing guide ” to help them to identify when and how to teach in conformity with state curriculum standards for achievement tests , which her sixth graders began in mid-April .
“ Having accountability and standards is good , ” Penrose said .
“ They give everybody a measure of where we want to be .
I know that my kids know the material , but the test phrasing can stump them sometime . ”
Sheryl Tolson currently teaches second grade at the Anna Kirchgater Elementary School in Sacramento ’s Elk Grove Unified School District .
The fourth - year teacher ’s 20 students took the standardized tests in mid-April .
Test scores will be ready in August to help third - grade teachers pinpoint which instructional areas to focus on , she said .
“ I will also get an idea for my next year ’s class on how to teach students more effectively .
If the students ’ reading comprehension scores are low , for example , I can work harder on that . ”
The federal No Child Left Behind ( NCLB ) Act , which Pres .
Bush signed in 2002 , mandates that American students score higher each year on the standardized tests .
In California grades 2 - 11 , 37 percent of students ’ Standardized Testing and Reporting ( STAR ) program tests scores in math and language arts must reach the proficiency level , up from 24 percent originally , said Pam Slater , spokeswoman for the state Dept. of Ed .
“ Every year the standards we teach are ratcheted up , ” said Priestly , who teaches between 26 and 35 students in five classes for which he uses the state curriculum .
The students in part learn about the processes of sex cell division and single cell division .
“ We ’re drowning in standards and tests , which are a vice squeezing students , ” he added .
“ I ’m driving students at a fast pace towards taking the tests and accomplishing so many standards . ”
The NCLB sanctions for STAR test scores weigh heavily on Priestly ’s mind and those of his fellow administrators and teachers .
“ We ’re all in this thing together , ” he said , while lamenting the inadequate means which the NCLB law provides to schools to meet the federal mandates .
Slater of the state Ed. Dept. gave a nod to this aspect of the NCLB .
“ The federal funding issue has been a criticism , ” she said .
Across town from Priestly , Debra Nordyke teaches kindergarten at the Del Paso Heights Elementary School in North Sacramento .
Her five - and six - year - old students take tests on math ( measurements and shapes ) four times a year .
Testing on language arts ( reading and vocabulary ) is three times per year .
“ Testing has benefited the kids by improving their language arts and math skills , ” she said .
Her district and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company ( a $ 2.5 - billion firm which calls itself “ the preeminent educational publisher in the United States ” ) create the curriculum and tests which Nordyke teaches to .
She has been teaching K - 4 students for 23 years in the Del Paso Heights School District , one of several others which will join the new Twin Rivers Unified School District on July 1 .
According to Nordyke , before the advent of the standardized curriculum and tests , teachers had to create their own .
In that pre-testing era , this could be a stiff task for newer teachers .
While acknowledging that standardized curriculum and tests have helped primary grade students to gain mastery of literacy and math , she noted that , before then , students and teachers had more time for art , drama , movement , music , and science .
“ That extra time improved students ’ creativity and social skills , ” Nordyke said .
California Senate Bill 376 created the Standardized Testing and Reporting ( STAR ) program in 1997 .
The California State Dept. of Education develops , reviews , and revises STAR testing and the standard curriculum , Slater said .
STAR tests for grades two through 11 have four subject areas : language arts , math , science , and social science .
Student test scores are ranked from outstanding to proficient to basic to below basic to far - below basic .
Against this backdrop , a new peer - reviewed study in the journal Educational Policy Analysis Archives by scholars at the Rice University Center for Education raises crucial questions about state - federal policy relating to standardized tests and students who score sub-proficiently on them .
Rice ’s multiple - year analysis of more than 270,000 Texas students criticized the use of a single standard to measure a student ’s achievement .
“ The degradation of the curriculum into test drills , which have little relevance beyond the state test , distances students who otherwise wish to persist to graduation , exacerbating the likelihood they will leave school , ” the study reported .
In other words , forcing schools , students , and teachers into a box of escalating standards alienates youth and thereby increases the likelihood of their becoming dropouts versus graduates .
Where is this 11 - year trend of state standards that marry school curriculum to STAR tests headed ?
In California and nationally , school districts and county education departments with tests scores below NCLB mandates face penalties pegged to the number of years in which annual progress falls below the measure of proficiency .
The penalties for being out of compliance with this NCLB mandate put such under- performers into the “ program improvement ” category .
The NCLB penalties range from replacing school staff in year three to a state takeover in year four .
And that ’s not all .
“ Once schools are in [ public improvement ] for five years they can be forced into privatization , ” write Steven Miller and Jack Gerson in their article titled “ The Corporate Surge Against Public Schools . ”
California ’s state education board approved a new approach to program improvement crafted by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and state Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell on March 13 .
As with students whose scores are sub- proficient , programs are ranked according to their need for improvement : intensive , moderate , light , or other .
Del Paso is in the category of “ other , ” having narrowly missed federal accountability targets .
The district has been placed in year three of program improvement status , said Fred Balcom , director of the accountability and improvement division at the California Education Dept .
Priestly is working with two Sacramento - area schools that are in multi-year program improvement .
He declined to name either school .
Below - level STAR test scores are hardly the lot of Laird ’s students at West Campus High School .
There , 500 students apply for 200 open slots in the 800 - member student body .
That number is roughly a third of the enrollment at high schools such as Burbank , Hiram Johnson , Kennedy , and McClatchy in the Sacramento City Unified School District .
In Laird ’s view , the state curriculum is generally “ helpful to have ” as a “ map for instruction . ”
However , Laird thinks that some of the textbooks he uses with his students are “ incredibly simplistic . ”
Maybe that helps to explain this response to standardized education .
Students dislike the STAR tests , according to Laird .
Such a stance put teachers in a dicey spot .
“ We ask students to please do their best on the tests .
That helps to keep us in the good graces of administrators and politicians . ”
There have been 11 years of momentum to unify California ’s school standards to improve students ’ test scores .
This trend of standardizing education comes from the dawn of industrial capitalism , not always easy to see , given the misleading appearances of school accountability that can fog such history .
In brief , the capitalist system spawned factories with work forces tied to the time clock to boost productivity , the amount of goods and services workers create per hour .
A class of owners sought to remove labor creativity from their hired help and replace that with uniformity for reasons of control and profit .
To be sure , private profit is not a driving force in U.S. public schools .
But forcing an industrial regimen of conformity upon the learning process can and does push youth and their teachers away from classroom time for creative discovery , thanks to the NCLB law .
What current learning standards backed up by the force of federal and state laws assume but fail to actually make is the case for one way to best measure youth ’s learning and teachers ’ instructing .
It should be no surprise that the satisfaction of students and teachers in the politically charged regimen of K - 12 schools is a mixed bag .
It should come as no surprise to long - time RT readers that I 'm fascinated with Soviet technology .
The absence of a free market created a weird alternate universe in which gadgets did n't always appear in the order you might expect .
A case in point is the digital watch industry , in which LCD technology beat LEDs to market -- unlike the rest of the galaxy .
Trustworthy dates are hard to come by , but it seems the first digital watch manufactured in the Soviet Union -- the Elektronika B6 - 02 -- featured a crude 4 - digit LCD display rather than an LED module , and was apparently produced for several years starting in 1974 .
The starting production date is somewhat suspicious , since LCD timepieces only started to appear as expensive status symbols in the west a couple of years prior .
The model pictured was ZIM 's second LCD timepiece produced in the early 1980s ( its serial number hints at a 1980 production date ) .
It offered the same incredibly basic 4 - digit LCD and appears to be housed in a modified mechanical watch case .
It was offered for export and sold under a number of brands including Sekonda and Elektronika .
Interestingly enough , the most collectible early Soviet digital watch is the stunningly beautiful LED equipped B6 - 03 Elektronika - 1 produced by NII - Zavod Pulsar in Moscow from the mid 1970s until the 1990s .
Many collectors naively assume that it predates Elektronika 's LCD models , although one can be forgiven for collecting it based on looks alone .

Putting rest to fears that the Phoenix Lander might be DOA , the lander wagged its robotic arm on Thursday .
NASA was worried that a stuck piece of plastic casing could prohibit the 7.7 ft titanium appendage from extending , making it impossible for the Phoenix to carry out crucial drilling experiments .

Given the recent rash of speeches , announcements , and other venues in which various national security types have talked up the federal government 's need to somehow involve the private sector in securing the nation 's network infrastructure , you could be forgiven for suspecting that some kind of coordinated civilian information security outreach campaign is underway .
Take Col. Jeff Kendall , who sat down earlier this month for a roundtable discussion on the new Air Force Cyber Command ( AFCYBER ) at the Council on Foreign Relations and talked about the recruiting challenges that the US military faces in the area of what the military calls " cyber warfare . "
" Perhaps we need a different kind of warrior in this domain , " Kendall told the assembled group .
" Today , all of our armed forces have a physical fitness test that requires us to do — depending on what your service is — required to meet some physical fitness standards .
Perhaps that 's not the right construct for these kinds of kids in the future — and I do n't use kids pejoratively ; they 're all just younger than I am .
So these great young American men and women , how do we attract them ?
... they 're not the same kind of folks that perhaps you want to march to breakfast in the morning . "
Kendall also implied — half jokingly , half not — that not only might some potential cyberwarrior recruits be in less than peak physical shape , but they might have broken the law in the course of acquiring the 1337 hax0r skillz that would make them useful to the military .
In other words , the military might adopt a " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy when it comes to the color of a recruit 's hat .
Kendall suggests that part of the solution to the recruiting conundrum is that these cyberwarriors could be civilian contractors — the mercenaries ( my term , not his ) of the digital age .
Another part lies in changing the military 's culture and recruiting tactics .
" We 've got to change the demographic , " Kendall said .
So we 've got to shed some of our own traditional recruiting mechanisms to go after a different crowd . "
Obviously , this is why AFCYBER was running commercials for the new command during the Final Four — to reach the huge cracker basketball fan demographic .
The USAF is n't the only branch of the armed services that 's looking to recruit crackers .
The Army is also after the same crowd , though Army Col .
Wayne Parks did n't give much detail beyond the mere fact of this shift in recruiting in his recent interview for GovernmentExecutive.com .
Parks referenced the Army 's cracker outreach in the context of its overall attempts to beef up its cyberwar capabilities .
Then there 's Department of Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff 's remarks at the RSA security conference in San Francisco this week , in which he reached out to the private sector for cooperation in securing the nation 's network infrastructure .
Reports of the speech ( see below for links ) indicate that he spent a lot of time during his speech making the case to private sector security experts that they should be helping DHS secure critical infrastructure .
It 's not clear how , exactly , Chertoff envisions civilian security professionals working with DHS on public networks .
The Miami Herald indicated that DHS is on a hiring spree with some of the billions that the president has committed to spending on cybersecurity in 2009 , and that Chertoff was hoping to fill staff positions .
I was n't at the conference , and I can't find a complete transcript of the remarks , so I can't say for certain that Chertoff was or was not talking about hiring private sector security professionals when he spoke of public - private cooperation .
My own suspicion is that he may have made his remarks with the Infragard program in mind .
If anyone can enlighten me one way or the other , though , please drop me an e-mail .

Too many people get their panties in a wad over their blog article , website copy , letters and emails being grammatically correct and without one spelling mistake .
BE WARNED :
This article will offend some people . . . it ’s meant to .
Blatant typos can and should be avoided due to having tools such as a spell checker however , even this is not 100 % fool proof .
I must admit , I am guilty of not running the Spell checker and having sales copy and email copy with errors and I do not give a toss to be honest .
Author ’s manuscripts some times go through 10 different proof readers and still the final printed version , has errors .
As for grammar , punctuation – Forget what your ‘ boring as bat poo ’ English teacher taught you about being perfect all the time .
It ’s pure Bullshit .
Give me a persuasive piece of copy with a few errors over a bland , grammatically perfect and lifeless piece of copy and I know which one will pull more sales . . .
The one with the few errors .
Here ’s 5
Myths about spelling and grammar which would make your English teacher have heart palpitations if they ever read them .
MYTH #1 :
Typos are unprofessional and cost you sales .
Absolute crap !
A few typos in anything will not cost you a sale from serious buyers .
Yes , if a serious prospect is reading your sales letter , website , email or blog article and they give you a reason for not buying as spelling and punctuation . . . it ’s lame as these tire kickers were NEVER going to buy in the first place .
MYTH # 2 :
Never use slang words .
Fair dinkum . . . the whole frigging world uses slang .
Being an aussie , we are the world champions when it come to slang words .
Even those bloody yanks ( yep , we call Americans ‘ yanks ’ ) have a book titled : ‘ The Dictionary of American Slang ’ by Robert L Chapman .
Recently a subscriber from the U.K. wrote to me telling me my use of Gidday was wrong in an email I sent .
This is what he said :
G’day would be the proper contraction for the Australian spelling .
Giddy would be correct if you expected me to be in a cheerful mood but gidday ?
WTF would he know about aussie slang ?
Gidday is simply another version . . . my version of g’day which is already slang .
MYTH # 3 :
Perfect Spelling is Critical to your sales and your success .
Pure B.S .
Look around the internet .
Websites such as www.digg.com instead of www.dig.com, www.soshable.com instead of www.socialable.com etc. etc .
Crikey , even one client when doing a keyword search , discovered ‘ surgery ’ was getting searched for as ‘ surgury ’ so he register the exact phrase as a domain and got free traffic .
This is becoming more common as people want a specific domain yet the correct spelling version is already taken .
I rest my case on this one .
MYTH # 4 :
Everyone Can Spell :
Pure B.S. yet again .
The average literacy age across the world is of a 12 year old – as a guideline .
So for all you people who want to use big fancy words to show how smart you are . . . quite frankly this is the mentality of a ‘ dumb ass ’ and you are costing yourself sales .
When you assume everyone in the world is as clever as you , can spell and knows perfect grammar , you are leaving money on the table by not catering to the masses .
People also come from different ethnic backgrounds and multi cultural background and quite simply have limited skills .
You can see this in any good keyword search tool which allows you to include mis-spelled words .
You would be amazed at how many variations there are of certain words which are spelled incorrectly , based on how they sound .
When you ASSUME . . . you make an ass out of you and me !
MYTH # 5 :
American English is the only version of English – the one to use all of the time .
This is the biggest load of elephant crap ever .
The English language was around centuries before America was even discovered .
American was n’t even a ‘ wet dream ’ when the English language was created .
America has adapted it ’s own version of ‘ English ’ and many words have one letter difference in how they are spelled .
AMERICA . . .
ENGLISH
Color . . .
Colour
Realize . . .
Realize
Humor . . .
Humour
Neighbor . . .
Neighbour
There are many more like this .
People say as a writer , it ’s unprofessional to have errors and while I agree in principle , it ’s not going to cost you a genuine sale .
I know of several high profile products where the sales letter has had a few typos for decades , it has n’t cost them sales and they refuse to fix them .
I wrote a letter many years ago for a guy from the movie ‘ THE SECRET ’ which still had typo ’s and pulled millions of dollars in sales .
I expect this article will get some heated comments and all I can say on ‘ bring them on ’ !
Dedicated to kicking your ass until you succeed !
Warmly
Trevor ‘ Toe Cracker ’ Crook

Obama hits McCain lobbyist purge ; also spoke to Kennedy
Carrie Budoff Brown reports that Obama weighed in today on Sen. John McCain losing a fifth member of his campaign team over the lobbying ties and other interests .
" It appears that John McCain is very much a creature of Washington and one of the things that we 've said from the outset of this campaign is that if we 're gonna change policies , if we 're gonna deliver on universal health care or have an energy policy that over the long term can bring down gas prices that we were gonna have to change how Washington works , " Obama told reporters Sunday at an ice cream shop in Milwaukie , Ore .
" We can't have special interests dictating what 's happening there and that 's why I said at the beginning I would n't take PAC money and I would n't take money from federal lobbyists .
And it does appear that over the last several weeks John McCain keeps on having problems with his top advisers being lobbyists , in some cases for foreign governments or other big interests that are doing business in Washington that I do n't think represents the kind of change that the American people are looking for . "
He also said he spoke with Sen. Edward Kennedy this morning and " everybody 's optimistic about the prognosis . "
" He sounded great , he sounded like his usual ol ' self , " Obama said .
" I am just thrilled that Teddy is back on the mend .
And I suspect will be on the floor of the Senate immediately , doing the people 's business . "
WASHINGTON : A military judge has disqualified the Pentagon 's top legal adviser in the Office of Military Commissions from participating in the prosecution of a detainee at Guantanamo Bay because he exerted improper influence over a team of prosecutors and may have compromised the case 's fairness .
Naval Captain Keith Allred , who is presiding over hearings in preparation for the military 's trial of an alleged driver for Osama bin Laden , determined that Air Force Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann was too closely tied to prosecutors .
He is supposed to be a neutral adviser to the official directing the commissions .
Military defence lawyers said although the ruling was limited to one case , they expected the issue to be raised in other cases , potentially delaying prosecutions , including the death - penalty prosecution of six detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , for the September 2001 terrorist attacks .
Textbook accounts of how the Americas were first populated may have to be re-written following the discovery of the oldest DNA of prehistoric humans who lived 14,300 years ago in what is now Oregon .
Scientists said that the DNA is about 1,200 years older than the previous oldest human artifacts produced by the Clovis people , who are named after the site in New Mexico where the exquisitely shaped spearheads of the first Americans were found .
However , the latest discovery suggests that the Clovis people were actually preceded by much earlier cultures who had lived along the west coast of North America when much of the continent was still in the grip of an ice age .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The data suggests that the Clovis - first hypothesis is basically dead because we find evidence of an older occupation , " said Eske Willerslev , the director of the Centre for Ancient Genetics at the University of Copenhagen .
The human DNA was extracted from coprolites – fossilised faeces – found in caves near the town of Paisley in the west coast state of Oregon .
Carbon dating confirmed that the material was more than 1,000 years older than the Clovis spearheads .
" The Paisley cave material represents , to the best of my knowledge , the oldest human DNA obtained from the Americas .
Other pre-Clovis sites have been claimed , but no human DNA has been obtained , mostly because no human organic material had been recovered , " Dr Willerslev said .
The study , published in the journal Science , went to extraordinary lengths to try to rule out the possibility that the DNA was the result of modern contamination .
The DNA of nearly 70 scientists , archaeologists and students was cross-checked to make sure that it had not inadvertently contaminated the fossilised material .
An analysis of the DNA showed that it contained two sets of genetic sequences which are shared with modern - day native Americans and people who are native to East Asia and Siberia – confirming that the first Americans came over the Bering land bridge from Asia during the last Ice Age .
Dennis Jenkins , a senior archaeologist with the University of Oregon 's Museum of Natural and Cultural History , said there is a lack of bones dating from the time of the Clovis people so extracting human DNA from coprolites is critical to understanding more about the first Americans .
" We are not saying that these people were of a particular ethnic group .
At this point , we know they most likely came from Siberia or Eastern Asia , and we know something about what they were eating , which is something we can learn from coprolites , " Dr Jenkins said .
" If our DNA evidence and radiocarbon dating hold up on additional coprolites that are now undergoing testing at multiple labs , then we have broken the Clovis sound barrier , if you will . "
We 're not at all certain what led Dell to ship European Vostro 1310s and 1510s with , ah , revised QWERTY keyboards , but it looks like the company is making good on its promise to remedy the situation .

Apparently the switch is n't too hard to make , so you 'll be able to either do it yourself , or Dell will send out a tech to do it for you at no cost .
Sounds like Dell 's doing its best to make this right -- but c'mon , how did this not raise all kinds of red flags during the design process ?

" It 's a nice dream to have , but it 's probably not going to happen , " said Marilyn Renfree , a University of Melbourne zoology professor and a member of the team .
However , the scientists say it may now be possible to reactivate genes taken from many extinct creatures , including dinosaurs and even the predecessors to modern humans , providing new insights into their biology .
Obtaining the thylacine gene , called Col2a1 , was itself a major challenge , because DNA begins breaking down after death .
Professor Renfree and the project 's team leader , Andrew Pask , also from the University of Melbourne 's zoology department , managed to extract fragments of the gene from four 100 - year - old thylacines - three pouch dwelling infants and the skin of one adult - preserved in ethanol at Museum Victoria .
The bits were combined to form a complete gene .
" Putting the pieces together is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle , " said Dr Pask .
It was then genetically modified with the addition of a bacteria gene that produces a blue colour .
Professor Richard Behringer , deputy head of the Department of molecular Biology at the University of Texas , finally inserted the reassembled thylacine gene into a mouse embryo .
Cartilage in the developing bones of the embryonic mouse turned blue , signalling that the thylacine gene was working .
A similar gene is also responsible for developing cartilage in mice , so the experiment did not produce an embryo that was part mouse , part thylacine .
" We were not trying to cause anything to switch on or off , " said Professor Renfree .
Dr Pask said scientists were already able to study genes , taken from extinct animals , in test tubes .
" We wanted to show it was possible to take a gene from an extinct animal and look at its function in a living animal . "
Future experiments may be able to extract more specialised genes - such as those that were responsible for giving the thylacine its dog - like features , or its distinctly patterned skin , into a mouse .
" We might be able to produce a striped mouse , " said Dr Pask , even one with a thylacine pouch .
" This has not been done for fun , " said Professor Renfree .
" It has been done to learn more about the biology of a creature that we , humans , made extinct . "
Experimenting with genes from dinosaurs might reveal what their skin looked like , and resolve the debate about whether they were cold or warm blooded .
Genes from the fossils of Neanderthal man may provide clues to the modern human 's evolution .
Dr Pask said that while he would like to think they had brought one microscopic part of a thylacine back to life , cloning an entire Tasmanian tiger would be immensely more complicated .
It would require recreating not just one gene , but 30,000 - which would all have to be reassembled correctly in chromosomal packages .
However , scientists should now be able to study extinct animals gene by gene , as long as they can find original DNA that has survived in fossils or museum specimen .
Their research has been published in the journal PLos One .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The granite countertop 's glory days might be over .
During the housing boom , updating a kitchen with high end materials like cherry wood cabinets and a Viking stove was a sure bet to boost a home 's value .
Homeowners often recovered about 80 % of the cost when the house was later sold .
But with so much more inventory on the market for buyers to choose from , they just are n't as impressed with the bells and whistles .
Now most upscale renovations are returning less than 70 % of their cost , according to a recent survey from the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) and Remodeling magazine .
" Pay - back for high - end projects has declined over the past few years , " said Kermit Baker , chief economist for the American Institute of Architects ( AIA ) .
" People planning to sell should n't over - improve , " he said .
" They wo n't get the money out if they sell in the next two or three years . "
NAR 's survey revealed that returns on investment for a wide range of high - end interior redecorations dropped in 2007 .
An upscale bathroom renovation cost an average of $ 50,590 , nationally , but only added $ 34,588 to house value - a 68.4 % return .
In 2006 , a high - end bath renovation returned 77.4 % of its cost .
Adding a brand new bath did n't pay off as well either , earning just a 69 % return in 2007 , compared with 72.8 % in 2006 .
High - end kitchen remodels held up better , adding value equal to 74.1 % of the cost , compared with 75.9 % in 2006 .
Many owners simply went too far amidst the mania , over - improving their homes beyond what the local market would bear , according to Darius Baker , a veteran Sacramento , Calif. , contractor .
In the past his clients were more likely to opt for expensive redos even if they were planning to move , since they knew they 'd recoup most of their costs .
" I definitely saw a lot of tract houses built in the 1970s , in developments with three basic floors plans , get expensive renovations , " he said .
" We did a lot of radical projects , moving walls around , installing granite counters instead of Formica and cherry wood cabinets instead of oak . "
The numbers made sense .
In 2005 , a fancy kitchen renovation on the West Coast returned an average of 93 % of its cost .
Even if the owner got only a year or two use of it , the close - to - break - even return made it worthwhile .
By 2007 , the return had declined precipitously to 74 % .
Today , people who are moving out soon , Darius Baker said , " are not looking to make the place a Taj Mahal . "
They 're just doing enough to make the house presentable .
In the current environment , owners are cutting back on upscale renovations , according to Fred Ugast , chief operating officer of HomeTech , which supplies cost statistics for NAR 's annual Cost vs. Value index report .
" We 're seeing a lot of pull - back in the high end , " he said .
A separate report from the AIA also found demand for luxury features waning in 2007 according to the AIA .
The popularity of high - end appliances declined from 65 % to 47 % .
Demand for larger pantry spaces went down from 64 % to 51 % and wine refrigerators fell from 53 % to 49 % .
Still , people are willing to spend on their own comfort .
Most of the high - end jobs that Darius Baker is getting are for clients staying put for a long time .
" They 're saying , '' I 'm not concerned about the price because I 'm not leaving until they carry me out , ' " he said .
And returns for high - end exterior renovations are still holding up , according to the NAR report , with better pay - offs than interior work .
For example , sprucing up a home 's look with expensive fiber - cement siding , which looks like wood but is more durable , returns 88 % on investment , more than any other renovation NAR evaluated .
" It could indicate that curb appeal is even more important than in the past , " said NAR spokesman , Walter Molony .
" It might get the home more serious looks from buyers . "
Mick De Giulio , of Chicago - based De Giulio Kitchen Design , also senses a downshift in the market .
" The high - end is still strong , but there 's something in the air , " he said .
" I just finished jobs for two very high - end clients .
We put kitchens in their new homes , but they can't sell their old ones . "
Many web designers fall into a trap by pricing their services lower than they should , which can have a serious impact on their business .
Here is a quick look at the many different ways that under pricing your services can hurt you .
Lower Income
Obviously , charging lower prices will mean that you ’ll make less from each project .
Of course , the mindset of many designers is that they can ultimately make more money by charging lower prices and attracting more business .
While that can be true in some cases , it will require you to work considerably more hours to earn the same amount that you could make with higher rates .
Attracts Bargain Shoppers
Many potential clients will contact designers based on their prices .
From my experience , if a potential client mentions that they ’re contacting you because your prices are low , this is a very bad sign .
These types of bargain shoppers can be some of the most difficult clients to deal with .
Sure , I understand that business owners need to be wise with their expenses , and that includes the amount that they pay for a website .
However , these types of clients often do n’t understand the huge gap in quality and types of services that are available .
They want an award winning website for a thrift store price .
If you are pricing your work low , be prepared for clients that are looking for something that is too good to be true .
Some clients will expect you to jump through hoops to create a site that is worth 3 times what they are willing to pay .
Personally , I ’d prefer to work for a client that has chosen me because of my abilities , my experience , or just about any other factor than my price .
Perceived Value from Clients is Lower
I ’ve noticed over a period of time that your prices have some effect on the client ’s perspective .
If a client sees a low price tag it is natural to classify you in the same category with other designers that charge similar rates .
Hopefully that is an accurate evaluation in your situation , but if your prices are too low you may be leading your clients to undervalue your work .
Sometimes by charging a little bit more you can cause clients to see your work as being a bit higher quality .
I do n’t think this really applies to the bargain shoppers , but more so to those clients that are a bit more educated on the subject of web design and what it really costs .
Your Own Opinion of Your Work is Lower
How much is your time worth ?
What price do you deserve ?
If your prices are too low you may be subconsciously convincing yourself that your work is not worth more .
Being able to charge a higher rate and having clients that are willing to pay that much may be a positive boost for your confidence .
As a creative art , web design can be affected positively or adversely by your mindset .
Your Work Suffers
If you are not making very much from a project you may rush through it so that you can finish and move on to something else .
I know I ’ve found myself in this situation before .
It ’s easy to say “ I ’m only making $ X for this work , I do n’t need to do any better than this . ”
As a result , your work will be less than your best .
If you ’re making a reasonable amount you should be able and willing to do your best work .
Attracts Tire - Kickers
Potential clients that are n’t serious or dedicated to actually going through with a project will contact designers with low prices 9 out of 10 times .
You ’ll spend your time talking to them about what you can offer , how much it will cost , how long it will take , and every other detail they want to know .
Then they still wo n’t go through with it .
Of course , not every potential client will choose you , that ’s just the nature of being a service provider .
However , you can eliminate some of these potential clients that really are n’t that serious by quoting a higher price .
You Wind Up Competing Based On Price
Competing based on a low price has worked well for Wal - Mart , but it ’s not a good idea for most designers .
If your main selling point is that your price is lower than your competition , you will attract clients that you probably wish you had n’t attracted , and you ’ll really never be able to raise your prices unless all of your competitors do .
If someone comes into the market and undercuts your price , then what do you do ?
Instead , focus on providing the highest quality work and the best service possible .
You may even want to specially if that gives you an advantage , but avoid making price your main selling point .
What ’s Your Opinion ?
Do you have anything from your experience to add to the conversation ?
Now that it 's clear we are in a recession , the question has arisen as to what shape it will take : " V " , " U " , " L " , or " W " .
Nouriel Roubini proposed the question in The US Recession : V or U or W or L - Shaped ?
and came up with " U " .
Let 's take a look .
Now that there is no doubt that the US is experiencing a recession the debate is moving towards the length , size and depth of such a recession .
Will it be a short and shallow recession or a longer and deeper one ?
The current new consensus among macro forecasters and Wall Street firms is that the recession will be V - shaped , i.e. be short and shallow .
My view is closer to a U - shaped recession as I expect that the economic contraction will last at least 12 months and possibly as long as 18 months through the middle of 2009 .
This view is based on the fact that the last two recessions – in 1990 - 91 and 2001 – lasted 8 months each and today the macro and financial conditions are worse – relative to those two previous recessions - in at least three dimensions :
1 . We are experiencing the worst US housing recession since the Great Depression and this housing recession is nowhere near bottoming out .
...
2 . In 2001 it was the corporate sector ( 10 % of GDP or real investment ) to be in trouble .
Today it is the household sector ( 70 % of GDP in private consumption ) to be in trouble .
...
3 . The US is experiencing its most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression .
This is not just a subprime meltdown .
Losses are spreading to near prime and prime mortgages ; they are spreading to commercial real estate mortgages .
They will spread to unsecured consumer credit in a recession ( credit cards , auto loans , student loans ) .
The losses are now increasing in the leveraged loans that financed reckless and excessively debt - burdened LBOs ; they are spreading to muni bonds as default rates among municipalities will rise in a housing - led recession ; they are spreading to industrial and commercial loans .
And they will soon spread to corporate bonds – and thus to the CDS market – as default rates – close to 0 % in 2006 - 2007 will spike above 10 % during a recession .
....
Finally , could the US experience an L - shaped recession , i.e. a protracted period of economic stagnation like the one experienced by Japan in the 1990s after the bursting of its housing and equity bubble ?
My view is that a protracted economic stagnation – bordering on an economic depression – is unlikely in the case of the US as the policy response of the US is already more aggressive than the one of Japan .
Japan waited almost two years after the bursting of its bubble to ease monetary policy ; and it waited two years before providing fiscal stimulus .
In the US , instead , both monetary and fiscal stimulus have started in earnest early on .
Also Japanese postponed the necessary corporate and banking restructuring for years keeping alive zombie firms and zombie banks via inappropriate forms of forbearance .
In the US both private and especially public efforts to restructure the impaired assets and firms will start faster and more aggressively .
Thus the risk of a decade - long economic stagnation is quite limited so far .
My major area of disagreement with Roubini is the severity of the recession .
I also think the recession will linger ( at least the effects of the recession ) .
And a double dip is very possible .
But to say this will be the " most severe recession " in decades suggests job losses - and a corresponding increase in the unemployment rate - that I do n't see on the horizon .
The good news is that manufacturing employment is holding up better than usual in a recession due to a combination of a weak dollar ( strong exports ) and relatively strong global growth .
This does n't mean the recession wo n't be painful for many - I think it will be .
And the recession could be severe if manufacturing contracts sharply ( probably due to a global recession ) , but I think this is less likely than Roubini .
U.S consumers are in much worse debt shape than Japan .
There is global wage arbitrage now that did not exist to a huge degree in the mid to late 1990's .
Even white collar jobs are increasingly at risk .
The savings rate in the US is in far more need of repair than what Japan faced .
This will be a huge drag on future spending and slow any recovery attempts .
Japan faced a huge asset bubble ( valuation ) problem .
The US faces both a valuation problem ( what debt on the books is worth ) and a rampant overcapacity issue as well .
Japan had an internet boom to help smooth things out .
There is no tech revolution on the horizon that will provide a huge source of jobs .
The Trillion Dollar Meltdown
$ 1 trillion is the amount of defaults and writedowns Americans will likely witness before they emerge at the far side of the bursting credit bubble , estimates Charles R. Morris in his shrewd primer , " The Trillion Dollar Meltdown . "
That calculation assumes an orderly unwinding , which he does n't expect .
Expect the landslide to cascade through high - yield bonds , commercial mortgages , leveraged loans , credit cards and -- the big unknown -- credit - default swaps , Morris says .
The notional value for those swaps , which are meant to insure bondholders against default , covered about $ 45 trillion in portfolios as of mid-2007 , up from some $ 1 trillion in 2001 , he writes .
Credit hedge funds are now the weakest link in the chain , Morris says .
Their equity stands at some $ 750 billion and is so massively leveraged that " most funds could not survive even a 1 percent to 2 percent payoff demand on their default swap guarantees , " he writes .
Morris sketches a scenario in which hedge fund counterparty defaults would ripple through default swap markets , triggering writedowns of insured portfolios , demands for collateral , and a rush to grab cash from defaulting guarantors .
The credit system would suffer " an utter thrombosis , " he says , making the subprime crisis " look like a walk in the park . "
What he fears is that the U.S. will instead follow the Japanese precedent , seeking to " downplay and to conceal .
Continuing on that course will be a path to disaster . "
So the estimate of $ 1 trillion of losses that I first presented in February has now become conventional wisdom as George Magnus , Martin Wolf , Goldman Sachs and now Charles Morris are all coming up with a similar estimate .
Liquidationist Thesis
It is my view that our economy will require a massive reallocation of resources .
We will be forced to create much less non-productive ( especially mortgage and asset - based ) Credit in the Financial Sphere , while producing huge additional quantities of tradable goods in the Economic Sphere .
In our expansive “ services ” sector , there will no choice but to “ liquidate ” labor and redirect its efforts .
Throughout finance , there will be no alternative than to “ liquidate ” bad debt , labor and insolvent institutions – again in the name of a necessary redirecting of resources .
After an unnecessarily protracted boom , there will be scores of enterprises that will prove uneconomic in the new financial and economic backdrop .
“ Liquidation ” will be unavoidable , policymaker hopes and dreams notwithstanding .
From this evening 's vantage point , recent extraordinary government measures to “ back ” U.S. finance appear likely to delay the adjustment process – what I will be referring to as a “ depression . ”
This reprieve , however , comes with a cost .
It will ensure significantly greater damage to the core of our monetary system , as well as requiring a more onerous real economy “ liquidation ” with the inevitable onset of the more serious phase of the unfolding crisis .

None of this would have happened if the laws against marijuana were reformed , or if they had been left to have their peaceful gatherings , or if government officials had shown some respect and restraint in handling this volatile situation .
But like pawns on a chessboard , the Drug Warriors had pushed Tom and Rollie into a checkmated position where they felt their only choice was liberty or death .
Obviously distraught , Crosslin decided that the government was not going to get the benefit of his many years of labor creating the Rainbow Farm .
Throughout Labor Day weekend , according to law enforcement accounts , Crosslin and Rohm systematically burned down the ten structures on their beloved farm , shot at and hit a news helicopter filming the fires , shot at and missed a police surveillance plane , and sprayed the woods bordering the 34 - acre property with gunfire to keep police at bay .
Other reports say that the two were merely firing into the air to hold police at bay and other people at the scene questioned whether the two had actually fired their guns at all , asserting that they were merely being carried around as a possible self - defense .
In any case , the two men allegedly confronted law officers with raised weapons , each to be shot dead in turn .
By mid-summer , the pressure on Crosslin and Rohm was mounting .
Crosslin faced 20 years in prison on marijuana and weapons charges , and was out of jail on a $ 150,000 bail bond as the state was moving to seize Rainbow Farm under civil asset forfeiture proceedings .
A local judge had issued an injunction barring Crosslin from holding any further marijuana - related gatherings at the campground .
And in a move that must have elevated the pair 's situation from intolerable to unbearable , Michigan child welfare authorities had taken Rohm 's 12 - year - old son , Robert , and placed him in foster care after the May raid .
Though police emphasized the traffic death ( which occurred the day after the youth was at the campground ) in justifying the bust at the time , they later revealed that it came as the result of a two - year - long investigation of Crosslin 's farm activities .
Beginning in 1996 , Tom Crosslin had sponsored marijuana reform rallies under a variety of names at Rainbow Farm .
While he was a visible and outspoken proponent of reforming marijuana laws , the rallies caused few legal problems until 2001 .
Things began to unravel in May , when local law enforcement authorities , using as a pretext the traffic death of a youth who had attended the festival , swept down on the campground , arresting Crosslin and his friend Rollie Rohm , among others , and charging them with a variety of marijuana and firearms violations .
Grover T. ( Tom ) Crosslin lived for the cause of marijuana legalization .
In 2001 , he died for it .
Crosslin , 46 , the owner and operator of Rainbow Farm , an alternative campground and concert site in Newberg Township outside of Vandalia , Michigan was shot and killed on his property by an FBI agent in the afternoon of September 3 , 2001 .
His long - time partner , Rolland Rohm , was shot and killed early morning Sept. 4 by Michigan State Police on the property .
The shootings ended a stand - off that had begun on August 31 .

This illustration shows how the Hubble Space Telescope searches for missing ordinary matter , called baryons , by looking at the light from quasars several billion light - years away .
Imprinted on that light are the spectral fingerprints of the missing ordinary matter that absorbs the light at specific frequencies ( shown in the colorful spectra at right ) .
The missing baryonic matter helps trace out the structure of intergalactic space , called the " cosmic web . "

Although the universe contains billions of galaxies , only a small amount of its matter is locked up in these behemoths .
Most of the universe 's matter that was created during and just after the Big Bang must be found elsewhere .
Now , in an extensive search of the local universe , astronomers say they have definitively found about half of the missing normal matter , called baryons , in the spaces between the galaxies .
This important component of the universe is known as the " intergalactic medium , " or IGM , and it extends essentially throughout all of space , from just outside our Milky Way galaxy to the most distant regions of space observed by astronomers .
The questions " where have the local baryons gone , and what are their properties ? " are being answered with greater certainty than ever before .
" We think we are seeing the strands of a web - like structure that forms the backbone of the universe , " Mike Shull of the University of Colorado explained .
" What we are confirming in detail is that intergalactic space , which intuitively might seem to be empty , is in fact the reservoir for most of the normal , baryonic matter in the universe . "
Hubble observations made nearly a decade ago by Todd Tripp and colleagues first reported finding the hottest portion of this missing matter in the local universe .
That study utilized spectroscopic observations of one quasar to look for absorbing intergalactic gas along the path to the quasar .
In the May 20 issue of The Astrophysical Journal , Charles Danforth and Shull report on observations taken along sight - lines to 28 quasars .
Their analysis represents the most detailed observations to date of how the IGM looks within about four billion light - years of Earth .
Baryons are protons , neutrons , and other subatomic particles that make up ordinary matter such as hydrogen , helium , and heavier elements .
Baryonic matter forms stars , planets , moons , and even the interstellar gas and dust from which new stars are born .
Astronomers caution that the missing baryonic matter is not to be confused with " dark matter , " a mysterious and exotic form of matter that is only detected via its gravitational pull .
Danforth and Shull , of the Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences at the University of Colorado in Boulder , looked for the missing baryonic matter by using the light from distant quasars ( the bright cores of galaxies with active black holes ) to probe spider - web - like structure that permeates the seemingly invisible space between galaxies , like shining a flashlight through fog .
Using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph ( STIS ) aboard NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope and NASA 's Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer ( FUSE ) , the astronomers found hot gas , mostly oxygen and hydrogen , which provide a three - dimensional probe of intergalactic space .
STIS and FUSE found the spectral " fingerprints " of intervening oxygen and hydrogen superimposed on the quasars ' light .
The bright quasar light was measured to penetrate more than 650 filaments of hydrogen in the cosmic web .
Eighty - three filaments were found laced with highly ionized oxygen in which five electrons have been stripped away .
The presence of highly ionized oxygen ( and other elements ) between the galaxies is believed to trace large quantities of invisible , hot , ionized hydrogen in the universe .
These vast reservoirs of hydrogen have largely escaped detection because they are too hot to be seen in visible light , yet too cool to be seen in X - rays .
The oxygen " tracer " was probably created when exploding stars in galaxies spewed the oxygen back into intergalactic space where it mixed with the pre-existing hydrogen via a shockwave which heated the oxygen to very high temperatures .
The team also found that about 20 percent of the baryons reside in the voids between the web - like filaments .
Within these voids could be faint dwarf galaxies or wisps of matter that could turn into stars and galaxies in billions of years .
Probing this vast cosmic web will be a key goal for the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ( COS ) , a new science instrument that astronauts plan to install on Hubble during Servicing Mission 4 later this year .
" COS will allow us to make more robust and more detailed core samples of the cosmic web , " Shull said .
" We predict that COS will find considerably more of the missing baryonic matter . "
" Our goal is to confirm the existence of the cosmic web by mapping its structure , measuring the amount of heavy metals found in it , and measuring its temperature .
Studying the cosmic web gives us information on how galaxies built up over time . "
The COS team hopes to observe 100 additional quasars and build up a survey of more than 10,000 hydrogen filaments in the cosmic web , many laced with heavy elements from early stars .

So thisgig was coming along pretty nicely .
I knew the deal .
I 'd search cable news clips until I found something that made me want to shout things at my computer .
Then I wrote those things down .
But last Wednesday , my friend Matt Tobey sent me a link that changed everything .
It was the new Kid Rock video .
We both agreed the song was grounds for murder , but it was Tobey 's idea to do it as a Hate By Numbers .
Could HBN stray from cable news ?
I was n't sure .
Would the readers be thrown ?
And what about Kid Rock fans ?
Were n't they sure to be offended ?
I could hear them now : " Screw you , Gladstone , " they 'd say while ironing a " These Colors Don't Run " decal onto their overalls .
" Kid Rock 's been nominated for three Grammys ! "
And that 's true .
But lots of people with no talent have been nominated for Grammys .
Like Kid Rock for instance .
Ultimately , I decided to just go for it , and let contempt be my guide as it leads me to fun and exciting new areas of disdain .

The chart above shows monthly unemployment rates , by educational attainment , from 2000 to March 2008 , using data from
the BLS
, obtained via
Economagic
.
The data show that almost all of the .50 % increase in the overall unemployment rate over the last 9 months from 4.6 % in June 2007 to 5.1 % in March 2008 was mostly from increases in unemployment for workers with less than a high school degree and to a lesser degree from workers with a high school degree .
Note that the unemployment rate for college - educated workers has been almost flat for the last three years , and the trend for workers with some college is almost flat as well .
It 's also interesting to see that during the 2001 recession , the jobless rate increased by about a full percentage point for ALL education levels .
Unfortunately , the data for jobless rates by educational attainment only go back to 1992 , so it 's not possible to extend this analysis back to recessions before 2001 .
But looking at unemployment rates by education in the the 2001 recession , we wo n't be in recession again until the unemployment rates for all education categories start to rise , and we have n't seen that yet .
Supermarkets and tobacco groups have illegally collaborated on prices of cigarettes and rolling tobacco , according to an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading .
The regulator has unearthed what it believes is a complex web of indirect communications between retailers and two tobacco groups on prices in supermarkets , off licences , petrol stations and convenience stores - though it stopped short of using the term price - fixing .
The allegations centre on products by Imperial Tobacco and Gallaher Group - two firms which dominate the market with brands such as Lambert & Butler , Richmond , Golden Virginia and Mayfair .
Excluding the black market , they make close to nine out of every 10 cigarettes and roll - ups smoked in the UK .
Yesterday morning both firms - together with 11 retailers , including Tesco , Asda , Sainsbury 's and Morrisons - received a 400 - page statement of objections from the competition watchdog setting out its provisional findings .
Other retailers to which the statement has been addressed include petrol stations operated by Shell UK , the convenience store group Somerfield , and First Quench , the company behind the Threshers off - licence chain .
The allegations centre on the sharing of details of future prices between the tobacco firms via various retailers acting as middlemen .
The OFT also said it had evidence to show retailers and manufacturers had put in place arrangements linking the retail price of brands made by one tobacco group to the price of the closest competitor brand , made by the rival group .
" For markets to work well for consumers it is a fundamental principle that pricing decisions should be made independently , " the OFT chief executive , John Fingleton , said yesterday .
" If we find evidence of anti-competitive activity we are prepared to use the appropriate powers to punish the companies involved to deter other businesses from taking part in such behaviour . "
He said the allegations , if proven , amounted to " a serious breach of the law " .
Firms targeted could face fines of up to 10 % of their UK turnover .
All those named said they were fully cooperating with the OFT and would respond to the statement of objections within a month .
In 2005 Gallaher said it would " vigorously defend " itself against any adverse finding ; under its new ownership of Japan Tobacco , it did not reiterate this position .
The full OFT statement will not be published , but falls short of an allegation of price - fixing , finding rather that the companies were engaged in anti-competitive behaviour between 2000 and 2003 .
The regulator said such behaviour might have the effect of increasing retail prices , but insisted the underlying behaviour was the focus of its investigation .
The provisional conclusions come after a five - year investigation and are believed to rely on mountains of confidential correspondence demanded from retailers and manufacturers in 2003 and 2005 .
The inquiry is understood to have stemmed from an initial look at the narrower market for rolling papers for cigarettes .
British American Tobacco , once linked to the inquiry , is not named by the OFT .
The average price of a packet of 20 cigarettes is now £ 5.66 , with 77 % of this going to the Treasury in excise duty and VAT , according to the Tobacco Manufacturers ' Association .
From 2000 to 2003 - the period of the inquiry focus - prices rose 16 % , driven by duty rises .
Smokers often blame tax rises , driven by a health agenda , for steep increases in prices .
Increasingly they trade down to cheaper brands , roll - ups or smuggled and counterfeit products .
Revenue & Customs estimates up to one in five cigarettes smoked in the UK is smuggled , half being counterfeit .
Meanwhile , makers stubbornly defend their UK profit pool , making it one of the most lucrative markets in the world .
Market leader Imperial Tobacco in Bristol sells 23.4bn cigarettes in the UK - where it has its highest operating margins , comfortably above those in other markets around the world .
Similarly high margins were recorded at Gallaher before it was acquired last year by Japan Tobacco .
Those pesky PLU code stickers that you have to peel off your fruit and vegetables do more than just convey prices to the cashier .
If you know how to read them , says Marion Owen at PlanTea.com , they can tell you a thing or two .
Conventional produce gets a four - digit number .
Organic produce gets a five - digit number that starts with 9 .
Genetically modified items also get a five - digit code , but that code starts with 8 .
Examples 4139 : Conventional Granny Smith apple 94139 : Organic Granny Smith 84139 : GMO Granny Smith
If you want a full list of PLU codes , hit up the International Federation for Produce Standards , where you can look up the look - up the look - up codes and find out even more info .
For instance , some PLUs are restricted to items grown in certain regions .
( 4138 , for instance , denotes a Granny Smith grown in East / Central North America . )
But if you want to decode those at the store , you 'd have some memorizin ' to do .

Pay per click campaigns are one of the best marketing tools that you and your company have at your disposal .
They allow you to push your advertisements out to the online world and only pay for those that actually act on your ads by clicking them .
That leads to a better return on investment for your small business and / or startup .
If you ’re new to the PPC world , then you might not be entirely aware of how to go about building a strategy .
Here are several PPC campaign management best practices that you should be using as you build your new brand .
1. Audit Every Year
At the end of every year , there should be a time where you prioritize auditing your pay per click efforts and campaigns .
This is the time where you learn what tactics have worked and what campaigns need to be either improved or thrown to the wayside .
One of the clearest ways to audit your campaigns is by measuring the return on investment for each technique .
Be sure to read this article to find out more about how to calculate the ROI on your pay per click initiatives .
The budget from the campaigns that performed poorly can either be poured into the more of a budget for the successful campaigns or used to launch new ones .
Remember , the marketing industry is one of the trendiest industries in the entire corporate world .
Do n’t ever put too many eggs in one basket , because that “ basket ” could be irrelevant in only a few months .
2. Keywords , Keywords , Keywords
The importance of keywords in your pay per click campaigns ( or any digital marketing campaign , for that matter ) ca n’t be understated .
In fact , the biggest difference between digital marketing and offline marketing is that keywords dictate whether or not your target audience will ever see your ad .
With the right keywords in place , your ad can be pushed out to anyone that searches for a keyword that applies to your product or service .
You can use this to direct people to your product pages , a blog post on your site , or any other form of relevant content .
Using keywords will help you see higher lead generation , sales conversion rate , and will be instrumental in building customer loyalty to your brand .
People will feel as if they “ discovered ” your brand when in reality , your hard work discovered them .
Be sure to use keyword researching tools to find the keywords within your niche that have a low keyword density and high search volume .
3. Try New Outlets Often
Again , the previously - mentioned thought process of “ never putting too many eggs in one basket ” ca n’t be stressed enough .
That certainly applies to the number of different platforms that you ’re placing your PPC ads onto .
If you ’re witnessing a high amount of clicks on one site , then be sure to invest a bit more stock into it , while branching out to other outlets .
These outlets can be things such as LinkedIn , Instagram , Facebook , Snapchat , Pinterest , Google Ads , or Bing Ads .
There are many more to choose from , but those are some of the best networks to get started on .
Be adventurous !
Try to build a passion for investing in your PPC campaigns and trying new avenues to reach different clientele .
4. Figure Out Who Your Target Buyer Actually Is
Many companies make the mistake of building an entire marketing plan without ever stopping to define their buyer personas to help them hone in on who they want to talk to .
Not doing so will most likely lead to marketing campaigns ( such as your PPCs ) that are directed at the wrong audience .
You might as well place your entire marketing budget in a pile and set the money on fire .
Because you ’ll be burning through cash .
Be sure to take the time to define who your target buyer actually is .
Who are they ?
What do they do for a living ?
What are the biggest needs in their life ?
How do they search for their products ?
What do they look for in the companies they buy from ?
Asking all of these questions will help you define your audience and modify your entire PPC strategies accordingly .
For example , if your company sells sewing machines , then your buyer persona might be Mary , who mainly uses Facebook to keep up with her kids .
From that , you would design your PPC campaigns on Facebook ( with proper keywords ) to get your ads in front of as many “ Marys ” as possible .
5. Make Them Mobile - Friendly
Did you know that more people use their smartphones than desktops to visit the internet these days ?
It ’s the first time in history that has happened .
However , that trend is only going to continue to grow due to things like Siri , phone apps , and increasing smartphone technology .
That means that your PPC ads need to be geared towards mobile users .
If they are n’t then you ’ll be missing out on more than half the users of the digital space
Simply put , if a mobile user sees an ad that does n’t contort to the size of their phone screen , they ’ll shrug it off and scroll down or exit out of the ad .
Use These PPC Campaign Management Best Practices Today !
Now that you ’ve seen several steps towards proper PPC campaign management , it ’s time to integrate these tips into your marketing strategies .
Take your time to define your target buyer , then gear up your PPC endeavors to get in front of those buyers as often as possible .
KANSAS CITY , Mo. , May 23 ( Reuters ) - Germany 's Bayer AG BAYG .DE is battling to keep thousands of U.S. rice farmers from becoming part of a massive class - action lawsuit over the contamination of commercial rice supplies by a Bayer biotech rice not approved for human consumption .
In hearings this week in federal court in St. Louis , Missouri , lawyers representing rice farmers said about 7,000 long - grain producers in Missouri , Arkansas , Louisiana , Mississippi and Texas should be allowed to seek unspecified damages against Bayer for contamination that was uncovered in August 2006 .
Farmers suffered extensive losses , both from a plunge in rice prices , and in a drop in export business as Japan and the European Union moved to restrict U.S. rice from crossing their borders .
Many farmers also were not able to plant a crop the following year because of seed shortages tied to the contamination , and had to undertake costly clean - up efforts , according to plaintiffs ’ attorneys .
Bayer is fighting the class - action move , and both sides are now awaiting a ruling from U.S. District Judge Catherine D. Perry .
“ We believe that the individual actions brought by plaintiffs are not appropriate for consolidation under the rules governing class - action proceedings , ” Bayer attorney Bruce Mackintosh said in a statement .
Plaintiffs ’ attorney Don Downing said class - action status was the best way to help farmers who lost money , markets , and in some cases , an entire season ’s crop .
“ This is their livelihood , ” Downing said .
About 700 rice farmers have filed lawsuits against Bayer following the August 2006 disclosure that the company ’s genetically altered experimental rice had somehow contaminated food supplies .
While the United States is a small rice grower , it has been one of the world ’s largest exporters , sending half of its crop to foreign buyers .
The genetically engineered long - grain rice in question has a protein known as Liberty Link , which allows the crop to withstand applications of a herbicide used to kill weeds .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration said there was no public health or environmental risks associated with the genetically engineered rice and the two agencies elected not to punish Bayer for the contamination .

" We support the troops ! "
That ’s the excuse the Democrats have given for continuing to fund Bush ’s aggression against Iraq and Afghanistan .
But , of course , war funding does n’t support the troops .
War funding supports an evil machine that chews up and spits out the lives and well being of the troops , along with that of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi and Afghan , men , women , and children .
War funding supports Bush ’s aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan and his continuing efforts to occupy both countries in order to turn them into puppet states .
Polls show that a majority of the troops and their families do not support Bush ’s aggression .
The fact that Ron Paul ’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination received the lion ’s share of contributions from military families also underlines the great divide between the troops and those who would " support " them by keeping them in Iraq and Afghanistan .
What all those ribbon decals on the back of SUVs , which proclaim " support the troops , " really mean is support Bush ’s wars of aggression against Muslims .
According to the Washington Post ( Feb. 9 , 2008 ) , Bush ’s $ 3.1 trillion federal budget provides no funding for his proposal in his State of the Union address to permit military members to transfer their unused education benefits to family members .
Bush got applause for his nationally televised words , but the troops and their families got no money in his budget .
Government analysts calculate the education benefits would cost in the range of $ 1 — 2 billion annually — the cost of funding the war for two days .
The only money that Bush and Congress want to give the troops is what is required to keep them at war .
Everyone has read the horror stories of the lack of care for the physically and emotionally wounded troops who have made it back from Iraq .
In contrast , to fund Bush ’s war , Bush and Congress have already spent in out - of - pocket and future costs at least $ 1,000 billion .
Every American can draw up lists of better uses of this immense fortune than blowing up a country ’s infrastructure and killing hundreds of thousands of its citizens .
Nothing good whatsoever has been accomplished by Bush ’s invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan .
It was obvious to anyone with a lick of sense in 2002 , six months prior to Bush ’s invasion of Iraq on March 18 , 2003 , that an invasion would be a strategic blunder .
William S. Lind , myself and others made that prediction in October , 2002 .
Three years later , Lt. Gen. William Odom , former director of the National Security Agency , vindicated us by declaring Bush ’s invasion of Iraq to be " the greatest strategic disaster in U.S. history . "
If the head of the NSA does n’t know a " strategic disaster " when he sees one , who does ?
Gen .
Odom ’s assessment is certainly correct .
Bush , Cheney , the neocons , and the sycophant media were completely wrong .
Look at the situation today .
Unable to defeat the Sunni insurgency , the US " superpower " has had to resort to paying tens of millions of dollars to insurgency leaders to bribe them not to attack US troops .
In addition , Bush is supplying the insurgents with weapons " to fight al Qaeda . "
The Sunni leaders gladly accept the money and weapons , but how long can they survive being collaborators with the American enemy that has destroyed their country and the Sunni place in the sun ?
It was obvious to everyone but Bush and the neocons that overthrowing Saddam Hussein in the name of democracy would put the majority Shi’ites , who are allied with Iran , in place as the new rulers of Iraq .
So far the Iraqi Shi’ites have bided their time and have not joined in earnest the insurgency against the US occupation .
Instead , they , like the Sunnis , have directed most of their attention to cleansing neighborhoods of one another .
The reasons that violence — although still higher than Americans could live with — is down are that most of the neighborhoods are now segregated , al Sadr has ordered his militia to stand down , and the Sunni insurgents are being paid not to attack US troops .
Bush started a war , and now to avoid losing it Bush pays Iraqis not to attack US troops !
The Sunnis and Shi’ites are stronger than ever , while the US troops are worn down and demoralized from multiple lengthy combat tours that violate traditional US military policy .
It was also obvious that Bush ’s invasions would destabilize nuclear - armed Pakistan .
On February 8 , seasoned foreign correspondent Warren Strobel reported for the McClatchy newspapers that " Pakistan is now the central front in America ’s war on terror . "
On February 9 , the Washington Post reported : " Pakistan faces a growing threat from a new generation of radicalized , battle - hardened militants who embrace jihad and have become allied with local and international terrorists intent on toppling the pro-Western government [ shorthand for paid US puppet ] , a senior U.S. intelligence official told reporters yesterday . "
US officials have been pressing Pakistan , to no effect , to allow US troops to join the Pakistani army ’s fight against Pakistani tribes allied with the Taliban .
US officials , " speaking on condition of anonymity , " are trying to muster support for an expanded US military role in Pakistan by alleging that Osama bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar are in Pakistan with their top commanders .
Bush wants to bomb Pakistan in order to win the war in Afghanistan .
With all available US troops tied down in Iraq , the US is using NATO soldiers as mercenaries to try to counter a resurgent Taliban .
Europeans are tiring of their role as a European proxy for America ’s legions , and the NATO commander speaks of a NATO defeat in Afghanistan .
NATO was an alliance created to resist a Soviet invasion of Europe .
The US has kept an unnecessary NATO alive for 18 years as a source of troops for its foreign adventures .
Europeans dislike being mercenaries for American Empire , especially one that slaughters civilians .
Desperate for troops , US Defense Secretary Robert Gates is trying to scare Europeans with the threat of " international terrorism , " but Europeans know that the best way to bring terrorism to Europe is to send troops to fight Muslims for the Americans .
Whether Gates will get the German and French soldiers that he so desperately needs depends on whether the US can give the German and French leaders , Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy , enough billions of dollars to divide among their parties to embolden them to override public opinion and send their soldiers to die for US and Israeli hegemony in the Middle East .
Gates told Europe that NATO ’s survival is at stake : " We must not — we can not — become a two - tiered alliance of those willing to fight and those who are not . "
In a rare bit of honesty for an American government official , Gates admitted at the NATO conference in Munich last week that Europeans ’ anger at the US over Iraq is the reason Europe wo n’t send enough troops to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan , thus putting what Gates disingenuously called " the international mission in Afghanistan " at risk of failure .
The Afghanistan " mission , " like the Iraq " mission , " was a mission for US and Israel hegemony .
The official reason for invading Afghanistan was 9/11 and the alleged refusal of the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden .
It had nothing whatsoever to do with Europe , NATO , or any " international mission . "
The official reason for invading Iraq was alleged , but nonexistent , weapons of mass destruction that allegedly threatened America — another , but more deadly , 9/11 in the making according to the Bush regime .
If the US now needs foreign troops to save its bacon in these two lost wars , it should demand them from Israel .
Israel is why the US is at war in the Middle East .
Let Israel supply the troops .
The neocons who dominated the Bush regime and took America to illegal wars are allied with the extreme right - wing government of Israel .
The goal of neoconservatism is to remove all obstacles to Israeli territorial expansion .
The Zionist aim is to grab the entirely of the West Bank and southern Lebanon , with more to follow later .
Remember " mission accomplished " ?
Remember all the strutting neocons with their promises of a " cakewalk war " ?
Remember all the ignorant bragging about having " defeated the Taliban " ?
All of these lies were designed to tie American down in interminable wars in the Middle East for Israel ’s benefit .
There is no other reason for Bush ’s invasions .
We know for certain that Bush and his entire administration lied through their teeth about the Taliban and about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
What a total crock of ignorance and deception the Bush regime represents .
Bush , defeated in Iraq , defeated in Afghanistan , with Pakistan crumbling in front of his eyes , is now reduced to begging the French , whom it was such grand sport for his neocon officials to denigrate , to send soldiers to save his ass in Afghanistan .
What a laughing stock Bush has made of America .
What ruination this utter idiot and his supporters have brought to America .
What total traitors the neoconservatives are .
Every last one of them should be immediately arrested for high treason .
Neoconservatives are America ’s greatest enemies , and they control our government !
All Americans have to show for six years of Bush ’s " war on terror " is an incipient police state .
Now standing in the wings is mad John " hundred year war " McCain .
Will the American electorate wipe out the Republican Party before this insane party wipes out America ?

Eating nuts five or more times a week reduces your risk of heart attack by a whopping 60 % .
And in addition to this stunning statistic , research shows that people who eat more nuts are generally thinner .
They also have lower levels of LDL cholesterol and better bones .
A new study even links eating nuts to a lower risk for cancer and inflammation .
In a study reported in the March , 2008 edition of the journal , researchers hypothesized that NB - kappaB deactivation in cellular responses may be the result of anacardic acid found in cashew nuts .
They found that anacardic acid potentiated the apoptosis induced by cytokine and chemotherapeutic agents , which correlated with the down - regulation of various gene products that mediate cell proliferation , invasion , and angiogenesis , all known to be regulated by the NF - kappaB .
They concluded that anacardic acid has a role in preventing and treating cancer through modulation of these signaling pathways .
The 1990's Adventist Health Study of a large population of California Seventh Day Adventists found that in addition to reducing the risk of heart attack by up to 60 % , eating nuts was one of the four top factors for extending longevity .
The beneficial effects were found for men , women , vegetarians , meat - eaters , fatter people , thinner people , the old , the young , those who exercise and those who do n't .
Four other large studies have since confirmed that eating nuts confers cardiac benefits and reduces risks of developing diabetes , dementia , advanced macular degeneration , gallstones and stroke .
Calculations suggest that daily nut eaters gain an extra five to six years of life free of coronary disease , and an overall longevity increase of two years .
The more frequently nuts are eaten the better , as benefits appear to increase with increased consumption .
The risk of fatal coronary disease and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes both appear to decrease steadily as nut consumption increases to once or more per day .
Nuts contain lots of fat , and many people are still operating under the food industry induced belief that fat makes you fat , so nuts are often shunned .
But research does not support this conclusion .
In the Nurses ' Health Study , the frequent nut consumers were actually a little thinner on average than those who almost never consumed nuts , and daily supplements of almonds or peanuts for six months resulted in little or no increase in body weight .
Nuts apparently satisfy hunger and provide a wealth of nutrients , creating a feeling of satiety and comfort .
This results in an overall lessening of food consumption .
A recent study shows that nuts have a fatty acid profile that favorably affects blood lipids and lipoproteins .
They are low in saturated fat and high in unsaturated fatty acids in the form of the monounsaturates oleic and palmitoleic acids .
Nuts also contain polyphenols , a type of antioxidant containing a polyphenolic substructure .
These compounds are thought to be instrumental in oxidative stress , a causative factor for neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases .
Nuts provide a good amount of magnesium , boron and zinc , so essential for bone health .
They are an excellent source of the antioxidant mineral manganese .
All nuts are a good source of the antioxidant vitamin E , folic acid , copper , and the amino acid arginine which is a precursor of human growth hormone .
Some nuts contain tryptophan , a stimulator of serotonin in the brain that alleviates depression and boosts relaxation .
Nuts are high in fiber and phytochemicals that protect against cancer and other chronic diseases .
In the Adventist Study about 32 percent of the nuts eaten were peanuts , 29 percent were almonds , 16 percent walnuts , and 23 percent other types .
The Nurses ' Study found that peanuts , which are really legumes , appeared to be just as effective in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease as tree nuts .
Experiments where volunteers were fed nuts as part of their diet for several weeks have found that walnuts , almonds , hazelnuts , peanuts , pecans , pistachio nuts , and macadamia nuts all alter the composition of the blood in ways that would be expected to reduce coronary risk .
Some nuts confer additional health benefits .
Walnuts are high in heart healthy omega - 3 fatty acids .
Almonds are particularly nutritious , with 100 grams yielding 16.9 grams of protein .
They also contain a good amount of vitamin B - 17 , known as laetrile , that many believe is nature 's most effective cancer cure .
Brazil nuts are rich in selenium , and only three of them a day will provide you with an amount in excess of the recommended daily allowance in a highly bio-available form .
It 's fine to have a snack of nuts right out of the bag , but nuts in this form are fairly difficult to digest and eating too many may strain your pancreas .
That 's because they contain phytic acid , nature 's way of making sure the nut survives the winter to sprout in the spring .
Phytate is a digestive inhibitor that interferes with mineral absorption .
So to gain the maximum nutritional value and digestibility from your nuts , its best to soak them or sprout them before they are eaten .
This can only be done with raw nuts , preferably bought in the shells .
Soaking neutralizes phytic acid .
Soaking also stimulates the process of germination , releasing the vitamin C content and increasing vitamin B content and carotenes ( precursors of vitamin A ) .
Soak your nuts in water .
Almonds and walnuts require a soaking time of between 12 and 24 hours .
Pecans and cashews require only 6 to 12 hours .
Then dry them at a temperature that does not exceed 105 degrees F .
You may want to follow the way of the Aztecs and dry them in the sun .
Be sure your nuts are completely dehydrated before you put them away .
Store dehydrated nuts in the refrigerator for up to a week .
Season them with your favorite herbs and spices for a real treat .
Some raw nuts will sprout when soaked , a true test of vitality .
They can sustain some heating , maybe up to around 118 degrees F and still sprout , although some of the enzymes will be degraded or destroyed at such a high temperature .
Sprouted almonds are truly delicious , much better than the unsprouted version .
Do n't sprout them for more than 2 days or they may become rancid .
Peanuts will also sprout .
During the soaking process , complex sugars responsible for intestinal gas are broken down and a portion of the starch in the nut is transformed into simpler sugars .
Soaking inactivates aflotoxins , a mold found predominantly in peanuts .
Pesticides abound in the production of nuts .
The way to minimize your intake of pesticide residues and to induce nut farmers to turn to organic production is to choose organic or wild nuts .
Unfortunately , only about 1 % of U.S. farmland dedicated to producing tree nuts is certified organic , and there are only a few states that produce organic tree nuts .
There are several online sites that deal in organic , soaked and sprouted nuts .

The closer we look at what happened in Basra the other day , the murkier and more suspicious the picture gets .
Two British undercover operatives fired at the Iraqi police , killing one and injuring another , and were taken into custody , then “ rescued ” as British tanks laid siege to police headquarters .
The incident culminated in a pitched battle between Iraqi and British forces , and in its aftermath a war of words is heating up that threatens to expose a widening chasm between these two ostensible “ allies . ”
We are told that our enemy in Iraq is a shadowy network of al - Qaeda - affiliated suicide bombers who will do anything to disrupt that country ’s march toward “ democracy , ” but instead we find coalition troops shooting at the very Iraqi police we are investing so much money , effort , and hope into .
What in blazes is going on ?
The two sides do not agree on even the most basic facts .
The Brits aver that the two arrested special ops soldiers  members of the Special Reconnaissance Regiment  were moved from the Basra jail to a private home during the negotiations for their release .
After British tanks knocked down a wall , troops busted into the jail , held the Iraqi police at gunpoint until they revealed the soldiers ’ whereabouts , and the pair were freed .
The Iraqis , in the person of Iraqi Interior Minister Bayan Jabr , say the soldiers never left the jail , were not handed over to a militia group , and that the whole incident was provoked by a “ rumor ” that the pair were about to be executed .
The Iraqis , for their part , have their own version of what went down , as the Washington Post reports :
“ Iraqi security officials on Monday variously accused the two Britons they detained of shooting at Iraqi forces or trying to plant explosives . ”
Of course , the two are not mutually exclusive : they could have been shooting at Iraqi forces  indeed , they killed at least one policemen , when he approached the pair  and trying to plant explosives .
But never mind
At any rate , the disagreements continue over what was found in the pair ’s possession .
In spite of initial BBC Radio reports that the car the Brits were cruising around in was packed full of explosives , the BBC News site now avers that the Iraqis found nothing more untoward than “ assault rifles , a light machine gun , an anti-tank weapon , radio gear , and medical kit .
This is thought to be standard kit for the SAS operating in such a theater of operations . ”
An antitank weapon  standard operating equipment ?
That sounds rather doubtful .
Look at this photo of what was recovered from the car , and you tell me if that haul seems rather a lot more than just your Spooks ’ Standard Issue spying kit .
On the question of what was found in the car , Sheik Hassan al - Zarqani , a spokesman for the Mahdi Army , the organization headed up by firebrand Shi’ite leader Moqtada Sadr , had this to say :
“ What our police found in their car was very disturbing  weapons , explosives , and a remote control detonator .
These are the weapons of terrorists .
We believe these soldiers were planning an attack on a market or other civilian targets , and thanks be to god they were stopped and countless lives were saved . ”
Furthermore , Sheik al - Zarqani says , the two Brits were not just in “ traditional Arab dress , ” as several news reports aver , but were disguised in the uniform worn by members of the Mahdi Army .
The Brits , says the Sheik , have some ‘ splaining to do :
“ Why were these men dressed as Mahdi Army ?
Why were they carrying explosives and where were they planning to detonate their bomb ? ”
Good questions , all  and perhaps some context will give us at least a direction to go in for some answers .
The Washington Post reports the latest attacks , attributed either to Sunni insurgents or to al - Qaeda and the network associated with Abu Musab al - Zarqawi :
“ In continuing violence elsewhere in Iraq Monday , a car bomb exploded amid Shi’ite pilgrims marching and driving to the holy city of Karbala , killing five and wounding 12 , said Capt .
Muthanna Ahmed , a spokesman for Babil province police .
Iraq ’s Shi’ites head to the holy city at this time in an annual ritual to mark the birthday of the Imam Mahdi .
“ The car bombing occurred in Latifiya , an insurgent stronghold 25 miles south of Baghdad , and was followed 10 minutes later by mortar shells that wounded four more people , Ahmed said .
One of those killed and four of the wounded belonged to the Mahdi Army , the Shi’ite militia led by Sadr , said Sahib Amiri , one of Sadr ’s aides in Najaf . ”
Okay , let ’s look at this timeline : On Sunday , a cleric associated with the local Sadrist group is arrested by the British , along with two others .
On Monday a Mahdi Army militant is killed in a “ terrorist ” bombing , leaving four others injured .
That same day , a Sadrist demonstration demanding the release of the cleric and his associates is held in the vicinity of the mayor ’s office : a white car containing two individuals who are “ acting suspiciously , ” as one Iraqi police officer put it , turns out to be undercover British soldiers who fire on police when approached .
All very suspicious  almost comically so , given the context .
Because suspicions of British involvement in terrorist attacks routinely attributed to Sunni militants and the Zarqawi network are nothing new for this area .
In April of last year , Basra was the scene of a Sadrist - led demonstration in which hundreds were out in the streets blaming the British for a recent spate of bombings :
“ ‘ We have evidence that the British were involved in the attacks , ’ said Sadr spokesman Sheik Abdul Satar al - Bahadli .
He did not elaborate .
“ ‘ You [ British occupation troops ] have failed to provide security , so leave it to the Iraqi police and militia to sort it out , ’ he told Agence France - Presse .
“ Some 800 supporters of Sadr meanwhile gathered outside his office here to protest Wednesday ’s attacks .
“ At least 68 people , including 20 children , were killed and about 100 others were wounded in the deadly series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks .
Most of the dead were from almost simultaneous suicide car bombings outside three police stations in Basra , causing carnage in the busy streets as people headed to work . ”
The Sadrist demonstrators carried banners whose slogans sketched the general outlines of a tinfoil - hat conspiracy theory that attributes all the evils befalling them to “ foreign occupiers ” :
“ ‘ The people and the police are hand in hand with our religious leaders and they will not bow to the occupiers . ’
‘ The Iraqi people say that Al - Qaeda is not involved in the attacks , which must be blamed on the criminal Tony Blair , ’ or ‘ Al - Qaeda is a US deception to justify the occupation of Islamic countries , ’ others said . ”
With the discovery of two British spies decked out in dark wigs and trying to look like just a couple of ordinary jihadis , the Sadrists have been given plenty of grist for their mill : no wonder they are often described as gaining in popularity .
Not without a little help from the Brits  and could that be what is really going on ?
The followers of Moqtada al - Sadr are by no means pro-occupation , but they are equally anti-Iranian  militant nationalists who oppose the decentralism advocated by other Shi’ite factions , which would essentially create an autonomous region in the solid Shi’ite south of the country .
Such a semi- independent republic in a loose federation would soon come under the dominating influence of Iran  which already is extending its influence at the federal as well as the local level via its sock - puppets in SCIRI , the Badr Organization , and the Da’wa Party .
The only nationalistic counterweight to the pro-Iranian Shi’ite secessionists is Sadr and his Mahdi Army .
By deliberately creating an incident that strengthens the Sadrist hand , the balance of power in the south is maintained , however precariously and momentarily .
This is , admittedly , far - fetched : but then so are the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent meltdown of the occupation , both of which strain the boundaries of probability , at least in a rational world .
But we are n’t living in a rational world anymore , not since the 9/11 terrorist attacks ripped a hole in the space - time continuum and we slipped into the Bizarro universe , where up is down , logic is illogic , and British authorities charged with keeping order in occupied Iraq deliberately provoke their charges into paroxysms of paranoia .
Alternatively , it could be that the Brits were targeting the Mahdi Army , which has fought occupation troops and is constantly causing trouble as far away as Baghdad .
Perhaps , after all , they were just handing out candy to children
It does n’t matter much in the end whether or not the Brits were engaged in some funny business in Basra : what matters is that they appear to have done so .
That may be enough to plunge a heretofore relatively quiet region of Iraq into civil war and chaos .
A British contingent that was widely believed to have been on its way home will be indefinitely delayed : the rumored withdrawal canceled , because , you see , to leave now would just make things worse .
Or so the story goes
There is a lot of nonsense floating around about the circumstances surrounding this incident , not the least of which is the canard that the Iraqi police have been “ infiltrated ” by “ insurgents ” and that ’s why the two Brit spies were supposedly in danger and had to be “ rescued . ”
The reality is that the Mahdi Army , SCIRI , and all the other Muslim party - backed militias are part of the elected government of Iraq : their representatives sit in the National Assembly , where they have a majority when they vote as a bloc .
They are n’t “ insurgents ”  they ’re supposed to be our allies !
As they stand up , George W. Bush tells us , America will stand down .
So how are they suddenly “ insurgents ” ?
The spectacle of Britain ’s defense minister , John Reid , calling on the Iraqi authorities demanding “ answers ” reflects a breathtaking arrogance .
It is the Brits who have to come up with some answers , and quickly , before the situation on the ground degenerates any further .
Already , the local government authorities in Basra , including the governor , have unanimously voted to cease all cooperation with the British occupiers .
No amount of spinning and outright lying  the British government initially denied there was even a confrontation , and claimed that the two were released as a result of “ negotiations ”  is going to let them wriggle out of this one .
London has a full - scale rebellion on its hands , and if the Iraqis are n’t sufficiently appeased , the revolt could soon spread northward , to the American sector , in which case it would become Washington ’s problem , too .
As I wrote in January 2004 , when the U.S. was holding out in support of its “ caucus ” plan , which would have forbidden the Iraqis direct elections and instead imposed a system in which America ’s favored sock puppets would come out on top , a giant awakens in the form of rising Shi’ite political power :
“ So far , the Shi’ites have stood on the sidelines , waiting for the chance to take advantage of their majority status and impose an Islamic ‘ republic ’ on the rest of the country .
Centered in the south , which has not seen , up until now , the kind of guerrilla violence that regularly erupts in the infamous ‘ Sunni Triangle , ’ such groups as the pro-Iranian Badr Brigade and the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) , have been patient , and so far refrained from violence  except against Christian merchants who sell alcohol and other un -Islamic consumer items .
The occupiers , up to this point , have had no serious trouble from SCIRI and allied groups .
That could change rapidly , and dramatically , as the Ayatollah Sistani has pointed out , if the Americans insist on their caucus plan . ”
The Ayatollah Sistani  who still refuses to meet with the Americans , by the way  swept away the caucus plan with a single fatwa .
Now the Americans are drawing another line in the sand and daring the Shi’ites to cross it .
If they do  if they demand the return of real sovereignty  the occupiers will have to either back down or fight .
The consequences of this are not hard to foresee , but may have been a bit less discernible over a year and a half ago , when I described this looming confrontation :
“ So far , the Americans have come up against those they call ‘ Saddamists ’  by which term is meant followers of Saddam Hussein , not Oscar Wilde .
These ‘ holdouts ’ and ‘ dead enders ’ are the ‘ remnants ’ of the Ba’athist Party , we are confidently assured , as if the insurgency is petering out along with the effects of Saddam ’s reign .
Yet attacks on occupation forces , in terms of ferocity , numbers , and geographical reach , are increasing .
It hardly takes a strategic genius to see that the fuel of Shi’ite fury spread over this smoldering rebellion will stoke the fires of resistance  and quite possibly flare up into a regional conflagration that could bring in Iran , and possibly others . ”
A regional war , dragging Iran and quite possibly Syria into the Iraqi maelstrom , is precisely what some elements in the administration are hoping for .
The seeds of a Middle Eastern conflagration were planted the moment U.S. and British troops set foot on Iraqi soil .
Today , in Basra , we are reaping the whirlwind .
Obama picks up 2 superdelegates ; Clinton gets 1

WASHINGTON — Close to securing the Democratic nomination , Barack Obama is lavishing attention on Florida and its wreckage of a presidential primary while minding his manners with Hillary Rodham Clinton — a rival he now can afford to praise .
Obama detoured today from the campaign for the three remaining primaries — Puerto Rico , Montana , South Dakota — to rally in a state where its renegade primary was disallowed .
" Last night , I was in Iowa because we marked a significant moment in our campaign where we achieved a majority of the pledged delegates that are assigned in this election .
And so we are at the threshold of being able to attain this nomination , " Obama told supporters at a Tampa , Fla. , rally .
Clinton , too , was in Florida , pressing to narrow her gap with Obama by having delegates counted from its contest in January .
The Illinois senator was just 64 delegates short of the 2,026 needed to clinch the nomination , after two superdelegate endorsements today and a pair of primaries the night before .
Clinton thrashed him in Kentucky ; he answered by winning Oregon .
Obama also secured a majority of the pledged delegates won in primaries and caucuses across the country — a milestone that could help him persuade more superdelegates to endorse him .
Mississippi Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Dowdy and Connecticut Rep. Joe Courtney , whose district voted for Clinton in the state 's Feb. 5 primary won by Obama , padded the Illinois senator 's lead with superdelegates by declaring their support .
Superdelegates are party insiders who are not tied to the outcome of state contests .
Obama picked up another big labor endorsement , from the United Mine Workers of America .
Clinton gained up a superdelegate , too — Craig Bashein of Ohio .
Although Obama won most groups of voters in Oregon , other recent primaries including Kentucky 's have been polarizing , with large numbers of his supporters and Clinton 's digging in behind their candidate and saying they would not vote for the other one in the fall campaign against Republican John McCain .
" If that holds true , then it is a problem , " said former Colorado Sen .
Gary Hart , who experienced devastating party divisions as Democrat George McGovern 's campaign manager in 1972 .
" But I do n't think that 's going to hold true . "
Speaking today on CNN , he said Obama is right to have turned recently to unifying the party and " he has already , wisely , I think , begun the fall campaign . "
McCain addressed an enthusiastic crowd in Miami on Tuesday , Cuba 's independence day , and pledged to hold firm against normal trade relations with Cuba until that country honors basic freedoms .
He criticized Obama for saying he would meet President Raul Castro , called the Democrat a " tool of organized labor " for opposing a Latin American trade deal and said his opponent had advocated lifting the trade embargo before shifting his position to say he would merely ease it .
The morning talk shows were barren of the usual candidates or aides trumpeting the previous night 's triumph or explaining away a loss , one sign that the rhetoric of the competition is ratcheting down on both sides despite the trio of primaries to come .
Indeed , Obama is now abundant in his praise of a Democratic rival who engaged him fiercely and often bitterly over six months .
In his Iowa rally Tuesday night , the man close to becoming the first black Democratic presidential candidate paid tribute to Clinton 's historic effort to become the first female president , saying she " has shattered myths and broken barriers and changed the America in which my daughters and your daughters will come of age , and for that we are grateful to her . "
Democratic rule - makers meet at the end of this month to decide whether to count delegates from Florida and Michigan .
Clinton won both states but Obama had his name kept off the Michigan ballot and neither candidate campaigned in those states .
With 94 percent of the vote counted in Oregon , Obama was winning by a 59 - 41 percent margin .
Clinton scored a 35 - point win in Kentucky after trouncing him by 41 points in West Virginia last week .
Obama won Oregon with the support of men and young people , but also found plenty of votes from blue - collar workers who have the staple of Clinton victories in other states , according to surveys of voters .
As a group , only those making less than $ 30,000 a year and those over 65 favored Clinton .
Women were evenly divided between Obama and Clinton , but men voted for Obama 2 - to - 1 .
Altogether , Obama scored a solid win in a heavily white state , a rare achievement in recent races in which blue - collar whites have powered his rival .
In Kentucky , Clinton won two - thirds of women and nearly as many men — altogether , seven in 10 whites , who made up nearly 90 percent of the electorate , exit polls indicated .
Clinton prevailed among all age , income and education categories , with particularly large margins among lower - earning and less educated voters .
As he closes in on the Democratic prize , Obama has been concentrating his campaign more and more on McCain rather than on Clinton .
But Clinton insists she still sees a path to the prize by winning over superdelegates , whose support will be needed for either candidate to be clinch the nomination .
Clinton won at least 56 delegates from Kentucky and Oregon and Obama won at least 43 , according to an analysis of election returns by The Associated Press .
All 51 delegates from Kentucky were awarded but there were still four of 52 to be allocated in Oregon .
Obama has an overall total of 1,962 delegates , including endorsements from superdelegates .
Clinton has 1,779 , including superdelegates , according to the latest tally by the AP .
My friend Ed Thompson was just elected mayor of Tomah , Wisconsin for the second time .
Here ’s the news release :
Charismatic Libertarian Ed Thompson won Tuesday ’s mayoral election by nearly a two - to - one margin over incumbent Chuck Ludeking .
Speaking from his Tomah supper club , the Teepee , Thompson said he found about 50 dusty yard signs in a storage shed , leftovers from his previous campaign for mayor in 2000 .
He also dug up four highway signs from his Wisconsin gubernatorial campaign of 2002 .
Thompson spent $ 10 for black and white paint to make appropriate changes to the highway signs .
He said , “ I paid my handyman , Terry Waddell , another $ 10 to clean up and paint the signs . ”
Thompson referred to his frugal $ 20 campaign as a metaphor for how government should be run .
In his previous term as mayor he cut city expenses by 13 % while improving services to the community .
Thompson says that large expenditures should be decided in referendum by the people , not by a handful of city council members .
“ The people have been left out of the political process at all levels , ” he said .
“ I want to change that . ”
He went on to say , “ We ’re going to change government at the grassroots level .
I want to show that libertarian values are American values , that we , the people , do n’t want government bureaucracies meddling in our private lives . ”
Thompson also serves as Vice - Chairman of the Libertarian Party of Wisconsin .
His 2002 Libertarian gubernatorial campaign made 3rd party history in Wisconsin when he got 10.5 % of the vote with only about 2 % of the total money spent on that election .
Thompson quipped , “ Maybe I should run for governor again some day , but it would probably take more than 20 bucks , maybe more like a couple hundred . ”
An evangelical pastor who backs John McCain tried to put his controversial remarks about the Catholic Church behind him , apologizing to the head of the Catholic League and expressing “ deep regret for any comments Catholics found hurtful . ”
Pastor John Hagee , who heads the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio , said in a letter made public Tuesday that he now knew the terms he used to describe the church , such as “ the great whore , ” were “ rhetorical devices long employed in anti-Catholic literature . ”
To win over evangelicals , McCain sought Hagee ’s support when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination .
But his campaign was caught off guard by the uproar over controversial comments Hagee has made about the Roman Catholic Church .
The Catholic League called on McCain to repudiate Hagee , saying that he had “ waged an unrelenting war ” against the church and had called it a “ false cult system , ” among other derogatory terms .
Hagee also said the damage Hurricane Katrina inflicted on New Orleans was “ the judgment of God ” on the city ’s “ sin . ”

McCain called Hagee ’s apology helpful .
“ Whenever someone apologizes for something they did wrong , then I think that ’s a laudable thing to do , ” he said .
The Arizona senator had initially waved off the criticisms , asserting that just because Hagee endorsed him did not mean that McCain embraced “ everything that he stands for and believes in . ”
He later distanced himself from the remarks and , on a recent visit to New Orleans , he called Hagee ’s comments “ nonsense . ”
McCain had also rejected any comparison with the criticism aimed at Sen. Barack Obama for controversial statements made by the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , who lead Obama ’s church for 20 years .
McCain noted that Hagee was not his pastor .
In his letter , Hagee said he had gained a better understanding in recent weeks of the Catholic Church ’s relationship to the Jewish faith .
He wrote of his “ profound respect for the Catholic people ” and said he hoped to advance “ greater unity among Catholics and evangelicals . ”
The Catholic League said in a statement that it accepted the apology .
Advertisement
“ Pastor John Hagee has demonstrated an improved understanding of the Catholic Church and its history , ” Catholic League President Bill Donohue said in a statement .
“ The tone of Hagee ’s letter is sincere .
He wants reconciliation and he has achieved it . ”
McCain said he was pleased by the exchange .
“ That ’s the kind of reconciliation that I ’ve been engaged in for many , many years , ” he said .
Asked whether he or his campaign was involved in brokering the reconciliation , McCain said : “ I certainly was n’t . ”
McCain was on the second day of his environmental tour of the Pacific Northwest .
In North Bend , Wash . , he escalated his criticism of President Bush in what is becoming a pattern of distancing himself from the president .

“ There ’s a long - standing , significant , deep and strong difference on this issue between myself and the administration , ” McCain said at the Cedar River Watershed Education Center above Rattlesnake Lake , with acres of dense forest as his backdrop .
McCain , who has sponsored a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , said his rivals had “ never , to my knowledge , been involved in legislation nor hearings nor engagement in this issue , ” even though both Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton co-sponsored his global warming legislation in 2007 and now back more aggressive measures .

Reporter reprimanded for raising hand at White House briefing Eric Brewer
Published : Thursday May 22 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Yesterday at the White House press briefing , Dana Perino asked me to lower my hand when I raised it to ask a question .
I 've been attending White House briefings for over three years first for the group blog BTC News , and since this January for RAW STORY and I 've never before seen a press secretary ask a reporter to put his or her hand down .
At the time , I thought she was winding down her answer to a question posed by April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks regarding the Secret Service 's investigation into a " noose incident " at one of its training facilities .
Dana 's response to April had begun like this : " Well , as you just said , the Secret Service is investigating the incident and as you just said also , they have not completed that investigation , so I 'm not going to get ahead of them and I 'll let them do that . "
Since the White House has a policy of not commenting on ongoing investigations , I thought she was about to move on , so at that point I raised my hand .
I was sitting in Helen Thomas 's seat ( Helen was absent ) in the middle of the front row , so I was face to face with Dana .
Although a couple of other reporters in the front row raised their hand at the same time , Dana singled me out for criticism , interrupting her answer to complain : " Can you please put your hand down for a second so I can concentrate on April . "
I complied , but continued to raise it , at appropriate times , throughout the rest of the briefing , during which Dana ignored me completely .
Dana has spontaneously called on me only two times in the four months I 've attended her briefings ( a third instance came about only because Les Kinsolving shamed her into it ) .
Her deputies , Tony Fratto and Scott Stanzel , have each called on me once .
Between the three of them , they 've ignored my attempts to ask a question on twenty occasions .
So they 've willingly called on me 16 % of the time , and ignored or tried to ignore me 84 % of the time .
That makes it hard to do my job .
Every other reporter who gets a seat in the first five rows of the briefing room ( I 've been in the first three rows all this year ) gets called on as often as he or she wants , some several times a day .
The only exception that I know of happened last year when Tony Snow ignored Kinsolving three days in a row for asking what Tony considered to be irrelevant questions .
Dana , however , calls on Kinsolving at every briefing , and he asks two questions each time .
I 've been attending White House briefings since March 2005 and have interacted with two other press secretaries : Scott McClellan and Tony Snow .
I estimate that both Scott and Tony called on me about 60 % of the time .
So why is Dana so much more intransigent than her predecessors ?
Are my questions too tough ?
Does she think I 'm not a real journalist ?
I really do n't know .
The first question that I asked during Dana 's tenure as press secretary was on January 17 of this year , when I asked her deputy Tony Fratto whether the surge had set back Iraq 's domestic security plans by five years , as statements by President Bush and Iraqi security officials seemed to indicate .
Dana must not have liked that question , because she conspicuously ignored me during my next three visits to the briefing room , relenting only on February 27 , when I asked whether President Bush 's observation on the counterproductivity of " outside forces " applied to Iraq as well as to countries in Africa .
That one must not have gone over that well with the White House either , because it was another three weeks before I got to ask another one , on March 19 .
That last question , about the President 's warning of the danger of al Qaeda taking over Iraq 's oil , got quite a bit of attention .
And Dana , who during her answer denied that that was what the President had said , got some unwelcome attention as well , when our exchange made it onto MSNBC 's Countdown .
After that , it was a whole six weeks before I got to ask another question , and then it only happened because Les Kinsolving intervened on my behalf .
That question , about the Pentagon 's recently disclosed and probably illegal secret domestic propaganda program , only seemed to alienate her further , since she 's ignored my attempts to follow up on it four times since then .
( Her deputy , Scott Stanzel , did call on me once , on May 19 . )
The question I did n't get to ask yesterday was : " Has the President ever attended a meeting with a group of TV military analysts coordinated by the Pentagon ? "
As Salon 's Glenn Greenwald first pointed out , on March 16 , 2006 , the Pentagon 's Director of the Office of Public Liaison Dallas Lawrence wrote in an email regarding the military analyst program : " I 'd love to see if we could get them in with potus as well ( I think that was submitted to karl and company from Dorrance Smith last week . "
Dorrance Smith is the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs .
" Karl " is , almost certainly , Karl Rove .
And " potus " is , of course , President Bush .
Apparently , no one else in the White House press corps is interested in asking about this issue .
I wish I could get an answer out of Dana for the millions of Americans who want one , but the only response I got from the White House on Wednesday was " put your hand down . "

The preceding article was a White House report from Eric Brewer , who will periodically attend White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first reporter to ask about the Downing Street memo and the Pentagon analysts scandal at White House briefings .
If you think that we ought to be spending more money on veterans ' benefits and health care , it 's not a very good record .
( Brandon Friedman thinks it 's part of a larger pattern .
I think he 's right , though I have n't marched through all the bills I 'd need to look at to lay it out . )
I put the wonky results , with links to all the roll call votes , below the fold .
Short version : during the last four years ( all I checked ) , McCain has supported basic appropriations for vets .
However , when there are two competing proposals , he generally chooses the cheaper one , and often , when only one proposal to increase benefits is available , he opposes it .
But , as Beutler says , this does n't seem to be because he is in general in favor of fiscal discipline : in 2006 , in particular , he voted against several bills that actually tried not just to increase spending on vets , but to pay for it , in one case voting for an identical bill that was not paid for .
I am wary of using this as a political issue if the facts are n't there .
On the other hand , if the facts are there , then it ought to be a political issue .
So , even though I trust Brian Beutler , I decided to check .
" John McCain voted against veterans in 2004 , ' 05 , '06 and ' 07 , " says Jeffrey David Cox , who spent twenty - two years as a VA nurse before moving to the American Federation of Government Employees , where he serves as secretary - treasurer ( AFGE represents employees of several federal agencies , including the VA ) .
Cox is right .
Under Bush , McCain has voted for measures that target so - called Priority - 7 and Priority - 8 veterans ( those whose injuries are not service - related and whose incomes are above a low minimum threshold ) for annual fees , higher co-pays and even suspended enrollment .
Priority - 7 veterans without dependents earn more than $ 24,644 annually .
Priority - 8 veterans without dependents earn an annual minimum of $ 27,790 . "
In September 2006 McCain voted to table an amendment to a Defense appropriations bill that would have prevented the department from contracting out support services at Walter Reed .
The amendment was indeed tabled -- by a vote of fifty to forty - eight , the sort of margin a true veterans ' senator might have been able to flip if he really cared about veterans ' healthcare .
During a March 2005
Senate budget debate , McCain voted to kill an amendment that would have " increase [d ] veterans medical care by $ 2.8 billion in 2006 . "
That amendment lacked an assured funding stream , but lest one mistake this incident for a maverick 's stance against budget - busting , there 's more .
Just a year later McCain voted against an amendment that would have " increase [d ]
Veterans medical services funding by $ 1.5 billion in FY 2007 to be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes . "
Two days after it failed , he voted to kill " an assured stream of funding for veterans ' health care that [ would ] take into account the annual changes in the veterans ' population and inflation to be paid for by restoring the pre-2001 top rate for income over $ 1 million , closing corporate tax loopholes and delaying tax cuts for the wealthy . "
That amendment died quietly , forty - six to fifty - four .
I used the following rough method : the Senate 's roll call database has little descriptions of all the bills and amendments being voted on .
So I called up the last four years , and searched for " veterans " , which ( I hope ) pulled up all the votes on bills where veterans ' issues played a significant role .
( Note : these little descriptions are , I think , the source of the quotes in Beutler 's article , in case anyone was wondering who , exactly , said that the amendment McCain voted against in March 2005 would have " increase [d ] veterans medical care by $ 2.8 billion in 2006 . " )
I omitted a couple of bills that seemed less important ( iirc , on concerned a memorial . )
Here are the results :
2005 : McCain voted for an amendment to the bankruptcy bill " clarifying the safe harbor " for low - income vets and people called to active duty , but voted against an amendment " to protect servicemembers and veterans from means testing in bankruptcy , to disallow certain claims by lenders charging usurious interest rates to servicemembers , and to allow servicemembers to exempt property based on the law of the State of their premilitary residence . "
He did vote for a subsequent amendment that disallowed means testing of disabled veterans in bankruptcy , but that did not contain the other protections in the earlier amendment .
McCain voted against two amendments that would have waived budget rules and allowed for $ 1,975,183,000 for veterans ' health care .
He then voted for an amendment that would have raised spending on veterans ' health care by $ 80 million .
When the Veterans ' appropriations bill this amendment amended came up for a vote , McCain is listed as " Not Voting " .
( It passed 96 - 0 . )
About three weeks later , another bill came up , appropriating another $ 1.5 billion for veterans ' health care .
McCain voted for it , along with 94 of his colleagues ( the rest were not there . )
He also voted for an appropriations bill for military construction and the VA , along with 97 of his colleagues .
But he voted against a bill to increase spending on mental health by $ 500 million a year for the next five years , against the bill Beutler mentioned , which would have increased spending on veterans medical care by $ 2.8 billion in 2006 , and for an alternative bill that increased spending by $ 410 million instead .
2006 : In Feb .
2006 , Chris Dodd submitted a bill that would have raised the capital gains tax and the dividend tax on people making over $ 1 million a year , and used the money to pay for $ 16 billion in increases in veterans ' health care , benefits , and the improvement of VA hospitals .
McCain voted against it .
Sen .
Grassley submitted an amendment that was exactly like Dodd's , only without including any tax increases , budget offsets , or anything else to pay for it .
Since that bill passed by unanimous consent , there is no record of McCain voting on it ; however , since that vote took place just before the recorded vote on Dodd 's amendment , McCain was certainly in the building ; had he wished to object to appropriating $ 16 billion without paying for it , he surely could have .
Likewise , he voted to instruct the Senate conferees that funding be found for this , without specifying how ; but against more specific instructions involving raising taxes on millionaires .
Later , along with all other Senators , he voted to increase the amount available for veterans ' health care spending in the budget resolution by $ 823 million , but against an amendment , offered the same day , that would have raised that amount by $ 1.5 billion , and would have paid for it by closing corporate tax loopholes .
He later voted against adding $ 430 million for outpatient care for vets , against giving the Department of Veterans Affairs an additional $ 20 million or medical facilities , and for the general Veterans Affairs appropriations bill .
2007 : McCain did not vote on a cloture motion for an emergency supplemental bill involving veterans ' funding .
( It passed 97 - 0 . )
The next day , he voted against the bill itself ; a month later , he did not vote on the conference committee report .
He voted for a later emergency appropriations bill that included funding for Veterans '
Affairs , along with Iraq war funding and a lot of other stuff .
He voted against an amendment that would have limited the VA 's ability to use contractors , and for the general VA appropriations bill .
2008 : McCain voted for a bill that would have provided ( among other things ) " tax relief to America 's troops and veterans . "
He did not vote on a cloture motion for bill that increased life insurance , housing , and other benefits for disabled veterans , on an amendment increasing the benefits in that bill , or on the bill itself .
McCain also did not vote on an amendment proposed by Lindsey Graham , which would have increased veterans ' educational benefits , but by much less than Webb 's bill .
Graham 's bill was generally seen as a way to give Republicans who voted against Webb 's bill political cover .
McCain co-sponsored it .
CouchDB Progress
For the past few weeks I 've been working on the guts of the next release of CouchDB .
Right now I 'm nearly done with a big refactoring of the core code , completely separating out the view engine from the storage engine , so the storage engine does n't know at all about the view engine .
Partially this is necessary for live compaction ( reclaiming wasted disk space while the database is running ) , and partially it 's just to make the code more manageable .
The upshot is the interaction between storage and view engine is getting simpler ( and the code smaller ) and will allow each to be coded and developed independently .
The simplification will also allow for different query and indexing engines to be integrated into CouchDB .
Once compaction is done then it's on to incremental reduce , which is something I 'm really excited about .
By storing the intermediate reductions directly in the BTree inner nodes , the index update and query costs are Olog ( N ) , allowing real - time map / reduce queries of huge databases .
And with this structure it is possible to do a " range reduce " , which allows not only to get reduce results of a single key , but also a range of keys .
So for example , if you created a map / reduce view of all purchases keyed by date , you can then query for the sum , average , min and max spent for all purchases between any 2 dates ( the range ) , and CouchDB will calculate them nearly instantly .
Not a reduced value for each unique key in the range ( that 's possible too ) , but a single reduced value of all the keys in the range .
BTW , I upgraded this blogs Movable Type installation from 3.x to 4.1 , mostly to fix a bug that 's been irritating the hell out of me , and to get better spam filtering .
But now it seems I borked my installation but good .
Since the upgrade the spam filter stopped working completely , letting in a new spam message every few minutes .
So I turned off all comments to stop the flow .
And now I can't get them to turn back on .
It says they are on .
But they are n't on .
Doh .
Update : I 've figured out why Movable Type comments were n't working , I did n't specify anonymous comments ( or any other kind ) are allowed .
Fixed .
Now if I can just get the comment spam filter working to slow down the spam deluge I 'll be happy .

Researchers retrieve authentic Viking DNA from 1,000 - year - old skeletons
Although “ Viking ” literally means “ pirate , ” recent research has indicated that the Vikings were also traders to the fishmongers of Europe .
Stereotypically , these Norsemen are usually pictured wearing a horned helmet but in a new study published in the journal PLoS ONE this week , Jørgen Dissing and colleagues from the University of Copenhagen , investigated what went under the helmet ; the scientists were able to extract authentic DNA from ancient Viking skeletons , avoiding many of the problems of contamination faced by past researchers .
Analysis of DNA from the remains of ancient humans provides valuable insights into such important questions as the origin of genetic diseases , migration patterns of our forefathers and tribal and family patterns .
Unfortunately , severe problems connected with the retrieval and analysis of DNA from ancient organisms ( like the scarcity of intact molecules ) are further aggravated in the case of ancient humans .
This is because of the great risk of contamination with abundant DNA from modern humans .
Humans , then , are involved at all steps , from excavation to laboratory analyses .
This means that many previous results have subsequently been disputed as attributed to the presence of contaminant DNA , and some researchers even claim that it is impossible to obtain reliable results with ancient human DNA .
Using freshly sampled material from ten Viking skeletons from around AD 1,000 , from a non-Christian burial site on the Danish island of Funen , Dissing and colleagues showed that it is indeed possible to retrieve authentic DNA from ancient humans .
Wearing protective suits , the researchers removed the teeth from the jaw at the moment the skeletons were unearthed when they had been untouched for 1,000 years .
The subsequent laboratory procedures were also carefully controlled in order to avoid contamination .
Analysis of the Viking DNA showed no evidence of contamination with extraneous DNA , and typing of the endogenous DNA gave reproducible results and showed that these individuals were just as diverse as contemporary humans .
A reliable retrieval of authentic DNA opens the way for a valuable use of prehistoric human remains to illuminate the genetic history of past and extant populations .
A tiny starrecently unleashed what is considered the brightest burst of light ever seen inthe universe from a normal star , astronomers announced today .
Shiningwith only 1 percent of the sun 's light and boasting just a third of the sun'smass , this run -of - the - mill star previously was nothing to write home about .
OnApril 25 , the red dwarf star , known as EV Lacertae , unleashed a mega - flare , packing the power of thousands of solarflares .
Since the star is located 16 light - years away , inreality , the flare actually occurred 16 years ago .
Theflare was first seen by the Russian - built Konus instrument on NASA ?s Windsatellite in the early morning hours of April 25 .
Two minutes later , Swift ? sX-ray Telescope caught the flare .
The star remained bright in X - rays for eighthours before settling back to normal .
It wouldhave been visible to the naked eye if the star had been easily observable inthe night sky at the time .
EV Lacertae ?s constellation , Lacerta , is visible inthe spring for only a few hours each night in the Northern Hemisphere .
" Here ? sa small , cool star that shot off a monster flare , " said lead researcher Rachel Osten , aHubble Fellow at the University of Maryland , College Park and NASA ?s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " Flares like this would deplete theatmospheres of life - bearing planets , sterilizing their surfaces . "
The star , with an estimated age of a few hundred million years , has a history of flares , though none as bright as the most recent one .
Osten saysgiant flares like this one are analogous to solar flares , but stellar flaresare hundreds and sometimes thousands of times more powerful .
The extra powerlikely comes from the stars ' magnetic fields .
For instance , EV Lacertae rotatesonce every four days , much faster than the sun 's four - week rotation .
The star ' squick rotation generates strong localized magnetic fields , about 100 times aspowerful as the sun's .
" Theseflares are ultimately related to the twisting and tangling of magnetic fieldsthat are poking out of the surface of the star , and stars like it , " Ostentold SPACE.com .
And like thesun , EV Lacertae is covered in spots , which move around during outbursts .
" If wecould look at the surface of the star as it was undergoing this flare , we wouldprobably see that the spots on the surface rearrange themselves , " Ostensaid .
" The spots on the star cover a much larger fraction of the surfacethan they do on the sun , so the resulting change of the spots would be evenmore dramatic . "
Since EVLacertae is 15 times younger than the sun , it provides a window into our solar system ?s early history , scientists say .
Younger stars rotate faster and generate more powerful flares .
So in its first billion years , the sun must have let loose millions ofenergetic flares that would have profoundly affected Earth and the otherplanets .
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A U.S. judge declared a mistrial on Wednesday for six men accused of joining forces with al Qaeda to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago as part of an Islamic jihad against the United States .

The decision was a setback for U.S. prosecutors .
It was the second mistrial declared by District Court Judge Joan Lenard in the case involving the men from Miami ’s impoverished Liberty City neighborhood .
U.S. authorities had billed the arrest of the men as a breakthrough in their efforts to detect and smash home - grown terrorism plots in their earliest stages , and said the defendants conspired to bomb America ’s tallest skyscraper , the Sears Tower , the FBI ’s Miami office and other federal buildings .
But after 13 days of deliberations , and three notes from the jury members to the judge saying they were unable to reach a verdict , Lenard declared a mistrial .
The defendants were filmed swearing an oath of allegiance to Osama bin Laden ’s militant al Qaeda group , but their lawyers argued that they were only playing along in the hope of getting money out of a man claiming to have links to al Qaeda but who was actually an FBI informant .
Lenard scheduled a status conference for next Wednesday to decide whether there will be another trial for the men , who faced four terrorism - related conspiracy charges that carried a combined maximum of 70 years in prison .
The first trial in the so - called “ Liberty City Seven ” case ended in a mistrial in December when jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict for the same six defendants .
A seventh man won acquittal at that trial .
At the time of their arrests in June 2006 , federal agents said the men , who operated out of a ramshackle warehouse in Liberty City , had terrorist plans that were “ aspirational rather than operational ” because they had neither al Qaeda contacts nor the means of carrying out actual attacks .
Nevertheless , the arrests were presented as a major blow against terrorism .
U.S. officials denied there was any political link between the Miami case and the midterm U.S. congressional election in November 2006 .
But the election came against the backdrop of a slump in President George W. Bush ’s popularity and in public support for the Iraq war , and critics of the administration frequently accuse it of exploiting fear of a repeat of the September 11 attacks .
Federal prosecutors did not immediately comment on the outcome of the case on Wednesday .
Lawyers for the defendants said they were unable to comment because of a gag order imposed on the case by the judge .
You can dress in white and have a traditional church wedding with rice , candles , and flowers , if that 's what you want .
But do n't expect anyone outside the family to remember it years from now .
Or you can make it a daringly different production that no one will ever forget .
Like these people .
Zombies
Christopher Downs and Amber Nolin were married in Kansas City on February 29th .
The couple own a film company , and got all the details down for a complete zombie wedding at the Macabre Cinema .
The bride was wheeled in on a gurney .
" Christopher , you may now take your corpse bride and devour her . "
Watch the video , if you do n't scare easily !
World War II
Jo Rowell and Tony Cox of Hartlepool , England used a 1940s theme for their wedding last fall .
The groom , a veteran , wore a vintage lieutenant 's uniform , and the bride wore a handmade period dress .
Around 100 guests also wore authentic clothing from the World War II era .
The ceremony began with a simulated blackout , and the bride entered to Glen Miller 's Moonlight Serenade .
Hello Kitty
A chain of hotels in Japan offers Hello Kitty wedding packages .
However , it would be easy to put one together yourself with all the Hello Kitty merchandise available , but it would be difficult to get the groom and the rest of the family on board with the idea .
You can see a video of a Hello Kitty wedding in Hong Kong , but be warned , it 's very pink .
Science Fiction
Terry and Liz dressed as Darth Vader and a Jedi for their wedding in January .
It was n't just a Star Wars wedding , but a general sci - fi theme .
Terry 's father dressed as Ming the Merciless .
His mother was a time lady from Dr. Who .
The bride 's mother appeared as Professor McGonnagle from Harry Potter .
Other guests were Jack Skeleton , Arthur Dent , Dracula , and a ghostbuster .
Goth
Goth weddings are more common than ever , but still draw attention .
Julie Williams and Dylon Holroyd got married last month in style , with the bride arriving in a coffin delivered by a hearse .

Kosovo :
First they came for the Jews ?
" History will prove this to be a correct move to bring peace to the Balkans , " he told reporters in Dar Es Salaam , Tanzania .
The recognition " presents an opportunity to move beyond the conflicts of the past and toward a future of freedom and stability and peace , " he said .
Unemployment in Kosovo hovers at 50 percent and the average wage is $ 350 a month .
" We all worry how we will get by , " says Quono , a university student , wife and mother of a toddler .
The future of Quono and her family is uncertain , as they decide whether their destiny is in Israel or in southeastern Europe , where their roots go back to the 15th - century Spanish Inquisition , when thousands of Sephardic Jews fled to the Balkans .
There are some 50 Jews left in Kosovo .
Belonging to three families , or clans , they all live in the city of Prizren , a rare gem of ancient architecture amid a landscape devastated by war , poverty and Communist - era concrete .
...
Distressed by a war they watched from the sidelines and facing an uncertain future , the Jews of Prizren are gloomy .
When the war started , the other Jews in Kosovo - the 50 living in the capital city of Pristina - fled to Serbia , where they spoke the language and felt a part of the culture .
But those in Prizren , where Jews speak Albanian and Turkish - there is a large Turkish population there - stayed .
Now , with Kosovo having broken away from Serbia , those like Votim Demiri , Quono 's father , who made a decent living under communism , find it hard to leave the homes they built , despite fears of growing tensions with their neighbors .
" There was not anti-Semitism in the past , but with the Saudi charities here now we are seeing a Wahabi influence for the first time , " Demiri said , referring to the fundamentalist Islamic ideology Saudi Arabian clerics have tried to export , with little success , in the Balkans . " I think the newspapers these days are not portraying Jews in such a positive light . "
...
" Our spiritual life , like our economic life , is a disaster , " Demiri said , pointing to his rotting roof .
His children , it seems , are preparing for an eventual move to Israel .
Quono's sister , Teuta Demiri , 22 , recently spent a year at a kibbutz , where she studied Hebrew .
A bank teller in Prizren , Teuta is thinking about aliyah but is not confident she can find work in Israel .
Her brother is studying Hebrew and also is nervous about his job prospects .
" I have been thinking for eight years whether to go or not to go to Israel , " their father , Votim Demiri said .
Gaza
Hamastan
Article 1 of the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States lists four characteristics necessary for statehood :
a ) a permanent population ; b ) a defined territory ; c ) government ; and d ) capacity to enter into relations with the other states .
In summary both Gaza and Palestine probably fail the government condition , which deprives them of statehood under this treaty and they do not consistute a state under the Montevideo Treaty .
Besides the Montevideo Treaty , there is also a theory that recognition is a necessary and sufficient condition for statehood .
International law distinguishes between the recognition of statehood and the recognition of a government .
A state can recognize the former without recognizing the latter .
Most countries that recognize the state of Palestine recognize the Palestinian National Authority , though not all .
Moreover , well over 100 countries have accorded recognition to Palestine over the last 60 years .
In my mind the constitutive theory of statehood is flawed because it allows the creation of states that do not fulfill the most basic conditions of statehood .
A state cannot exist if it does n't have a government or territory .
Palestine and Gaza probably have the latter , but not the former .
So if either Hamas or Palestine declared independence tomorrow , I do n't think they would be a state under international law .
Strong American support for the independence of Kosovo is detrimental to Israeli interests .
The US position is based on the view that a solution to long - standing conflict can and should be imposed on the parties by outside powers .
In addition , the new state 's creation seeks to award part of a nation ’s territory to a violent ethno- religious minority ; futilely hopes to curry favor with the Islamic world through appeasement ; effectively gives a fresh impetus to the ongoing growth of Islamic influence in Europe ; and denies the fact that the putative state ’s leaders are tainted by terrorism , criminality , and well - documented links with global jihad .
Most importantly , it betrays a cynically postmodern contempt for all claims based on the historical rights and spiritual significance of a land to a nation .
It is in Israel ’s interest to reiterate its already - stated position that any solution to Kosovo should be based on the agreement of both parties in dispute .
In addition , the Israeli government should declare that it will not extend recognition to any self - proclaimed “ state ” unless its independence is approved by the UN Security Council .
Apparently YouTube is on the verge of making a big announcement since there seems to have been an announcement about the announcement ( nice way to get double the press ) .
And search engine Mahalo has already created a page dedicated to news on “ YouTube High Quality ” with a video ( embedded below ) showing an example of how it would work .
All I can say is finally !
Here ’s hoping that ’s the big announcement .
I love YouTube , but man , can you think of a place online to watch lower quality video ?
Scriba , NY - A 34 - year - old Fulton woman is facing a felony charge and is accused of using a crowbar to smash a car parked outside a town bar , Oswego County Sheriff 's deputies said .
Stardust K. Pittsley , of 2580 county Route 45 , was arrested Thursday night on a charge of third - degree criminal mischief .
Deputies characterized the situation as a domestic incident .
Pittsley allegedly smashed the windows and lights of a car parked outside Grace O'Malley 's bar .
She was arraigned in Volney Town Court and sent to the Oswego County jail in lieu of $ 500 cash or $ 1,000 bond .
Pittsley is scheduled to appear Thursday in Scriba Town Court .
A world with 6.7 billion people , a third of whom cook on dung or firewood and the rest depending on fossil fuels , needs far more energy options than it currently has , almost everyone agrees .
But consensus dissolves when it comes to the question of how best to identify , develop and spur the diffusion of new energy choices that do n’t come with climate or security risks .
The main focus for years has been on a climate bill or climate treaty that would cap emissions and cut the cost with trading of pollution credits so the cuts could be made by companies or countries that could do the job most cheaply .
The cap would encourage conservation , drive innovation , and raise some money for basic research .
A significant chorus of economists and technology experts has insisted , however , that with or without a binding restriction on emissions , an epic energy quest is needed — and not being pursued .
I have a piece in the Week in Review section on what these experts say is a gaping technology gap that cannot be filled by raising the price of polluting .
They fear the focus on passing legislation or trying to negotiate a new climate treaty to cut emissions is distracting from the need to pursue an aggressive , sustained , variegated portfolio of energy research , mainly financed by government .
Their critics say their stance , however well intentioned , will produce the real delays , given how much can be done now simply by cutting energy waste with tools already on the shelf — ranging from strengthening efficiency standards to eliminating billions of dollars in persistent fossil - fuel subsidies that continue to make coal and oil much cheaper than they really are when all their hidden costs are revealed .
My impression is that the tugging between the two camps masks a lot of agreement on the need , really , to pursue all of the above .
It ’s just that the people involved in the discourse are most familiar with , or comfortable with , particular philosophies ( regulatory , exploratory , top down , bottom up ) .
[ INSERTED 4/6 , 12:45 p.m. ]
There clearly is a vast array of low - hanging fruit ready to be harvested — much at a profit — by cutting the energy used in buildings , transportation , appliances and the like , as the McKinsey Global Institute has repeatedly pointed out .
I ’m going to post comments that came in from a variety of experts and advocates involved in the energy and climate challenges but did not fit in my story or my earlier blog post on this question .
I ’d be happy to see yours , too , of course .
Here ’s one to prime the pump , from Paul Hawken :

It ’s the only response a high - ranking neocon can provide , considering all the evidence and questions unanswered : anybody who believes 9/11 was an inside job , or for that matter questions the official fairy tale version , is insane .
And this is precisely what Newt Gingrich told Matt Lepacek of We Are Change — he is insane .
No debate , no further conversation .
He ’s crazy and so are millions of other people , from the guy who has questions about the irrationality of fires toppling steel buildings to the full - blown 9/11 truth activist .
Nuts .
Bonkers .
Not worth more than a few dismissive words .
Matt asked Sir Gingrich about his membership in the CFR , if he is indeed a 33 degree Mason , and if he ever visited Bohemian Grove .
Nope , said Newt .
He is not a Mason .
And nope , he never visited Bohemian Grove .
He did n’t answer the question about the CFR .
Because he ranks high on the CFR totem pole .
Newt Gingrich at the Grove , published in the Annals of the Bohemian Club ( vol 7 ) , 1987 - 1996 .
Newt was telling a fib .
Because he did indeed attend Bohemian Grove .
He was in attendance back in 1995 when Dubya and Senior gave “ lakeside talks . ”
A photo ( at right ) was published in the Annals of the Bohemian Club ( vol 7 ) , 1987 - 1996 .
Bet Newt did n’t know we knew about that one .
Oops .
See more photos and a write - up at Infowars .
When not lounging at the Grove , Newt has a prestigious and very relevant position over at the Council on Foreign Relations .
He is on the “ Terrorism Task Force , ” and it figures of course because he is a full - blown neocon .
In addition to the CFR , Gingrich rubs elbows over at the American Enterprise Institute — when Bush mentions his “ minds , ” picked from AEI , he is talking about guys like Newt .
The AEI is a primo neocon organization , counting as members other sinister figures , such as John Bolton , Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Perle , John Yoo , and David Frum .
So upset was Frum the other day , he physically attacked Stewart Howe and his camera for asking what Newt would likely characterize as insane questions , questions Mr. Frum , who should be arrested for assault , did not want to answer because he is guilty as sin .
In fact , Newt Gingrich is a war criminal at large .
He was Bush ’s Defense Policy Board — along with other war criminals , such as Richard Perle ( as chairman ) , James Woolsey , Ken Adelman , Eliot Cohen , and the pathetic Dan Quayle — and this coterie of hand - picked neocons set in motion the invasion of Iraq and the ultimate murder of more than a million Iraqis .
Gingrich compounded his crimes by working with the now - defunct Committee for the Liberation of Iraq and the recently revived Committee on the Present Danger .
The former was a PNAC contrivance run by former Lockheed Martin vice president Bruce Jackson and stinking with perfidious neocons , including William Kristol , Robert Kagan , Joe Lieberman , and the above mentioned Richard “ Prince of Darkness ” Perle and James Woolsey .
All serious war criminals of Nuremberg caliber .
Well , at least Newt did n’t attack Matt , not like David Frum would have probably done in the same situation .
Instead , he refused to make eye contact , dismissed his questioner as insane , and denied two out of three accusations pointing to his position in the New World Order , neocon division .
Newt can play both sides of the fence , though .
No doubt , come January of 2009 , he will play with Hillary ’s team as well .
But then Hillary says the sort of things Newt wants to hear .
She wants to bomb Iran – the word she used , I believe , was “ obliterate ” — and that ’s precisely the next objective of the neocons .
I bet they realize their objective before Hillary gets anywhere near the White House .

Purely Functional Retrogames , Part 2
( Read Part 1 if you missed it . )
The difficult , or at least different , part of writing a game in a purely functional style is living without global , destructive updates .
But before getting into how to deal with that , anything that can be done to reduce the need for destructive updates is going to make things easier later on .
Back when I actually wrote 8 - bit games , much of my code involved updating timers and counters used for animation and special effects and so on .
At the time it made a lot of sense , given the limited math capabilities of a 6502 .
In the modern world you can achieve the same by using a single clock counter that gets incremented each frame .
Ever notice how the power pills in Pac - Man blink on and off ?
Let 's say the game clock is incremented every 1/60th of a second , and the pills flop from visible to invisible -- or the other way around - - twice per second ( or every 30 ticks of the clock ) .
The state of the pills can be computed directly from the clock value :
pills_are_visible ( Clock ) -> is_even ( Clock div 30 ) .
No special counters , no destructive updates of any kind .
Similarly , the current frame of the animation of a Pac - Man ghost can be computed given the same clock :
current_ghost_frame( Clock ) ->
Offset = Clock rem TOTAL_GHOST_ANIMATION_LENGTH , Offset div TIME_PER_ANIMATION_FRAME .
Again , no special counters and no per frame updates .
The clock can also be used for general event timers .
Let 's say the bonus fruit appears 30 seconds after a level starts .
All we need is one value : the value of the clock when the level started plus 30 * 60 .
Each frame we check to see if the clock matches that value .
None of this is specific to functional programming .
It 's common in C and other languages .
( The reason it was ugly on the 6502 was because of the lack of division and remainder instructions , and managing a single global clock involved verbose 24 - bit math . )
There are limits to how much a single clock value can be exploited .
You can't make every enemy in Robotron operate entirely as a function of time , because they react to other stimuli in the world , such as the position of the player .
If you think about this trick a bit , what 's actually going on is that some data is entirely dependent on other data .
One value can be used to compute others .
This makes a dynamic world be a whole lot more static than it may first seem .
Getting away from clocks and timing , there are other hidden dependencies in the typical retro-style game .
In a procedural implementation of Pac - Man , when Pac - Man collides with a blue ghost , a global score is incremented .
This is exactly the kind of hidden update that gets ugly with a purely functional approach .
Sure , you could return some special data indicating that the score should change , but there 's no need .
Let 's say that each ghost has a state that looks like this : { State_name , Starting_time} .
When a ghost has been eaten and is attempting to return to the box in the center of the maze , the state might be {return_to_box , 56700} .
( 56700 was the value of the master clock when the ghost was eaten . )
Or it might be more fine - grained than that , but you get the idea .
The important part is that there 's enough information here to realize that a ghost was eaten during the current frame : if the state name is " return_to_box " and the starting time is the same as the current game clock .
A separate function can scan through the ghost states and look for events that would cause a score increase .
The same technique also applies to when sounds are played .
It 's not something that has to be a side effect of the ghost behavior handling code .
There 's enough implicit information , given the state of the rest of the world , to make decisions about when sounds should be played .
Using the example from the preceding paragraph , the same criteria for indicating a score increase can also be used to trigger the " ghost eaten " sound .

Blast from the past : Should Tires Have An Expiration Date ?
This post originally appeared nearly three years ago , on June 2 , 2005 .
It 's just as relevant today , and follows .
....................
Should Tires Have An Expiration Date ?
Sure , we know that when they wear down it 's time to replace them .
But what about people who do n't drive much , and consequently have low –mileage but long–ago–purchase–date tires ?
Are they living — and driving — on borrowed time ?
Dare I say it ... hanging by a tread ?
My interest in this subject was piqued by this past Tuesday 's Wall Street Journal article by Timothy Aeppel on this very subject .
So I instructed my crack research team to look a bit more deeply into the subject and see what turned up .
Turns out that on May 1 of this year Tim Nelson of ABC News in Raleigh–Durham , North Carolina did a story on this same topic .
Ford has begun urging consumers to replace tires six years after their date of manufacture , regardless of wear .
Toyota has long warned drivers that tires are perishable .
Daimler –Chrysler 's Mercedes division had been telling drivers that tires last only six years ; last fall the Chrysler group began including such a warning in its 2005 owner 's manuals .
General Motors so far has not taken a position .
The information needed to determine the age of your tires is present on the tires — but it 's very difficult to determine .
( Scroll down to the final paragraph of this Federal Register link ) .
First , you find the line of print beginning DOT ; read to the end of that sequence of data and you 'll come to a final three or four digits .
They tell you the week and year a tire was produced .
If there are four digits then the tire was made in 2000 or after .
4805 means the 48th week of 2005 ; 0401 means the 4th week of 2001 .
If there are ony three digits then the tire was made in the 1990s .
347 means the tire was made in the 34th week of 1997 .
And so on and so forth .
The Wall Street Journal story noted , " Not only are the numbers difficult to interpret , but they can be hard to locate : the numbers are printed on only one side of the tire , which sometimes is the one facing inward when the tire is mounted on the wheel . "
I went out and checked my car and learned that all four tires were made in 2000 .
Then I checked the spare : it read 143 .
That means it was made in the 14th week of 1993 .
That 's 12 years ago — 6 years past its expiration date .
Next year when I replace the four on the car I 'm going to buy a fifth and replace the spare as well .
And if I should happen to need the spare before then , well , I 'm gonna get it replaced ASAP .
A mechanic I used to go to in LA , when I drove terrible cars , giant old American–made aircraft carriers , once told me that only two things will kill you outright if they go wrong while you 're driving : brakes and tires .
So it seems to me that updating my rubber is well worth the expense .
Here 's the ABC News story .
Dangers of Old Tires Angelo Womack walks along I - 40 and his thoughts are never far from what happened 10 years ago along the same stretch of highway .
" They veered off to the left and went down an embankment and the truck went into a flip and it flipped twice , and each time it flipped it landed on my father 's side . "
Womack says his father , Roger , died after a tire on his truck blew out .
Angelo 's been extra careful ever since .
" You could get a blow - out at anytime . "
Tires can blow out for many reasons , not just simple wear and tear ; some believe age is the key .
Sean Kane [ president of Safety Research & Strategies ] says he 's tracked 65 cases nationwide where tires with good tread have failed catastrophically , causing crashes .
He says tires can age and treads can separate even when they 're not used .
He says that any tire at least six years old can be dangerous .
His solution is to put expiration dates on all tires , just like a bottle of beer or gallon of milk – to keep drivers safe .
Right now you can find out how old your tires are but it 's not easy .
Each tire comes with a Department of Transportation code , but it 's kind of an alphabet soup .
First , find the series of letters and numbers following the letters D - O - T .
The last three or four digits are the important ones .
They tell you the week and year a tire was produced .
It will read the number of the week and the year .
An example would be the 485 , or the 48th week of 1995 .
Tires made before the year 2000 only have three last digits – if it said 4805 , for example , it would be the 48th week of 2005 .
We wanted to know just how common aging tires are on the road , so we went to some parking lots across the Triangle .
We were surprised to find at least a half dozen tires were probably too old to drive on .
The owner of one BMW may want to consider getting new tires — they were made the 48th week of 1998 , about 7 years ago .
The oldest tires we found , made the 38th week of 1993 , are almost 12 years old [ picture at top : it reads 383 ] .
Not everyone is sold on the idea that age alone causes danger , and some think an expiration date would be more of a hindrance than a help .
The Rubber Manufacturers Association tells us there 's no scientific data that says tires will no longer perform beyond a certain date .
We also took the idea of an expiration date to the head of the Governor 's Highway Safety Program .
He says he's not against the idea but sees several potential problems with trying to tell consumers exactly when their tires are too old .
" If you dated two tires the same date and one 's being used and one had n't been sold yet , then obviously the tire being used is gonna have more wear and tear and deterioration than the one that 's still on the shelf , so how do you , when do you end it ? "
Those may be legitimate questions , but they 're not the ones that concern Angelo Womack .
He wants to know why expiration dates are n't on tires now .
" It would be helpful because it would give people a general idea of the time I have left on these tires . "
And that , he believes , could be the difference between life and death .

Sadly what is missing from the articles above is any mention towards maintaining proper air pressure in the tires , and how much more likely you 'll experience sidewall damage and tread separation if your tires regularly run 5 - 10 psi low ; direct damage aside , any age or manufacturing - related material defects become vastly magnified when coupled with improper air pressure levels .
That is by far the cheapest , easiest , and most effective method to prevent tire blow - outs , and admittedly was something that I did n't become a true practitioner of until I spent 4 months on a case study of the 2000 Firestone recall , which strongly convinced me otherwise .

The post here gives 65 incidents .
Www.safetyresearch.net has data for 108 incidents .
I think some of the 108 did not result in a crash .
The 108 incidents go back to 1992 .
So there may be on the order of 7 incidents per year .
Safety Research states that many incidents are not reported because they are not sufficiently expensive to result in litigation .
I did not read of a justification for the assertion that there are many unreported incidents .
And some of them do n't result in a crash and some are n't expensive .
So it is n't clear that replacing old tires is more important than attaching a grounding strap in the event the car is struck by lightning .
Dropping your speed to the posted limit would do much more to improve your safety ( and decrease wear on the tires ) .
Improving safety is important but it is also important to not put usable tires on the mountain of old tires that we have .
Cracks on the sidewall and incipient belt separation can be observed by inspection .
Tires that have been in hot sunlight are likely to have aged more than tires that have been in a cool garage .
Tires that have been driven hard while underinflated will have been stressed more than otherwise .
The environment and use that the tires have seen should be considered when deciding whether to replace a tire .
Moving an older tire to the spare position , where it is unlikely to be used , and , if used , unlikely to fail , is a better option than throwing it out .
Instead of focusing on six years , take your car to a mechanic and have a safety review done on the tires , brakes , steering and suspension .

( NewsTarget ) Environmental and farm worker groups have now sued the Bush administration for allowing the continued use of four pesticides .
They claim that the government brushed aside its own evidence that the chemicals are toxic to workers , children , and animals .
The suit challenged the Environmental Protection Agency 's 2006 decision to reauthorize the four pesticides used on fruit and vegetable fields in California .
A 1996 federal law required the EPA to reassess the safety of all pesticides used on foods .
Based on this reassessment , the EPA was to decide whether to approve their use .
The EPA found that four substances posed substantial risks to human health but they concluded that the cost savings to growers outweighed the dangers to humans .
These four pesticides reportedly put thousands of farm workers and their families at risk of serious illness .
EPA spokesman Tim Lyons stated that the agency would review the lawsuit and respond in court .
However , they did say : " Our mission is to protect the environment and human health .
" California officials have officially classified one of the pesticides ( ethoprop ) as a carcinogen .
The state requires manufacturers to disclose this risk on any product label but cannot outright ban the pesticide because it has the EPA 's approval .
The suit said the pesticide , which is mainly used on potatoes , sugarcane , and tobacco , has been linked to fish deaths and has also begun to drift from fields into nearby rural communities .
Another pesticide ( methidathion ) has been listed as an air contaminant by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation due to the potential health hazards associated with it .
This chemical is used on artichokes , oranges , almonds , peaches and olives in California .
The other two pesticides are methamidophos ( used mostly on potatoes and cotton ) and oxydemeton - methyl ( used on broccoli , lettuce , cauliflower , corn , cabbage and Brussels sprouts ) .
The suit stated that both have been associated with bird deaths .
Methamidophos has been banned or severely restricted in several countries in recent years .
Oxydemeton - methyl is now linked to birth defects .
The basis for the lawsuit is the EPA 's own findings about the risks associated with these four pesticides .
Federal law allows the agency latitude to approve the continued use of risky pesticides such as these based on offsetting benefits .
The main benefit preventing the EPA ban of these chemicals is , not surprisingly , cost savings .
However , the EPA has failed to address the specific dangers each pesticide poses to children .
It has also not taken into adequate account the potential adverse effects on farm workers or to wildlife .
The suit is seeking a court order requiring the agency to re-evaluate once again the use of these pesticides .
Plaintiffs in the suit include the United Farm Workers , the Teamsters , Pesticide Action Network North America , Beyond Pesticides and the Natural Resources Defense Council .

You hate your old outdated keyboard and all the wires that come with it .
Maybe it ’s time to try a wireless keyboard .
Like with anything , using wireless keyboards comes with pros and cons :
Pros
There are many pros to wireless keyboards and even wireless mice .
Bluetooth compatibility for mice is easy to find because there are different types of wireless mice .
Wireless Mice
A pro to using wireless keyboards is that it can easily work with a wireless mouse .
Bluetooth is one of the best ways to go when it comes to wireless because it can provide some level of security protection .
Wireless mice and wireless keyboards can both have Bluetooth compatibility .
Space
Wireless keyboards can provide more space by reducing the clutter .
Space for keyboards is something we all wish we had .
A clear space often equals a clean mind .
Your office or home desks could do away with all of those unwanted wires .
The amount of clutter can even be further reduced with the addition of a wireless mouse .
Less Time Consuming
Let ’s be honest , connecting all of those wires can be time - consuming .
When you are finally done figuring it out , you may not even be in the mood to do any work .
Without wiring , there is less confusion and more time to be spent being productive .
A wireless keyboard can also allow people to access the same computer at a time .
This benefit can also be less time - consuming .
Wireless keyboards can be found and purchased at Keyboard Kings .
Cons
Nothing can be perfect , including wireless keyboards .
There are notable drawbacks that wireless computers have that can become a big issue if you ’re in a busy office or working with sensitive information .
Battery Life
Wireless keyboards often have small radio transmitters that need the power to operate .
The power usually comes from batteries .
Wireless keyboard battery life is not the greatest .
If the batteries you are using for your wireless keyboard go dead , you wo n’t be able to use it .
You ’ll have to keep extra batteries with you or have a backup traditional keyboard in case you run into this problem at an inconvenient time .
Interference
You ’re adding another radio signal to the environment when using wireless keyboards .
In a busy office , your keyboard may not be working that well .
This could be because of the interference from Wi -Fi signals , Bluetooth , other wireless keyboards , and even metal furniture .
All of these things cause radio congestion that makes it hard for the keyboard to communicate well with your computer .
If you ’re working at home alone this wo n’t be that much of an issue .
Security Issues
Some wireless keyboards can cause security threats .
Intercepting signals from a wireless keyboard is easier because it only requires radio and software to download and decrypt data .
Almost all wireless keyboards are unencrypted , so everything you type is fair game .
This problem can be avoided by using a wired keyboard or one that uses Bluetooth .
Start Using Wireless Keyboards
It does n’t hurt to try using wireless keyboards as long as you are aware of all the pros and cons .
The wireless way could be just right for you .

Two new studies conducted by researchers at Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center point to the negative impact of parental job loss on children 's healthcare and the importance of having continuous health insurance coverage to meet children 's healthcare needs and reduce healthcare disparities .
" These studies describe a situation that should be of grave concern to parents , health care providers and policymakers , " says Gerry Fairbrother , Ph.D. , a researcher in the division of health policy and clinical effectiveness at Cincinnati Children 's who was an author of both studies .
" The impact of not having insurance coverage in place year - round hurts children in many ways , including not being able to get the prescribed medications they need , and not having a regular source of health care -- and that puts their health at risk . "
The first study shows that children whose parents lose or change jobs were twice as likely to lose their health care coverage as children whose parents did not lose or change jobs .
In addition , children with private insurance were more than three times as likely to lose coverage .
" This is a particularly disturbing finding , coming at a time when job loss is becoming more common due to the economy , " says Dr. Fairbrother , Ph.D. , the study 's lead author .
" As unemployment rises , more and more children are likely to experience a break in coverage that affects their health care .
Our study showed that most of these children are eligible for public coverage but are not getting the coverage to which they are entitled .
Much more needs to be done to reach out to children with private coverage when their parents experience job loss or change . "
Dr. Fairbrother 's study examined data collected over two years from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey , a set of large - scale surveys of families and individuals , their medical providers , and employers across the United States .
She examined the effect of parental job loss in an early round of data collection with children 's insurance coverage in a later round .
Children who lost insurance when their parents lost or changed jobs were more likely to be poor , black , from Spanish - speaking homes and reside in the southern United States , according to Dr. Fairbrother .
The second study examined children who did not have continuous coverage -- insurance in place consistently year - round -- and found that they had unmet health care needs similar to the chronically uninsured .
These children were three times as likely to have unfilled prescriptions and 14 times as likely not to have a usual source of health care as insured children .
The studies will be presented Saturday May 3 at the annual meeting of the Pediatric Academic Societies in Honolulu .
The lead author of the study was Joseph Schuchter , an epidemiologist at Cincinnati Children's .
Dr. Fairbrother was senior author .
This study used data on 15,447 children up to the age of 17 from the Ohio Family Health Survey , which was conducted from Oct. 2003 to July 2004 .
Pelosi : Bush comments ' beneath the dignity of the office '
Democratic
House leaders are calling out President Bush for a speech in Israel in which he seemed to suggest that Sen. Barack Obama wants the United States to " negotiate with terrorists . "
In his speech , Bush said : “ Some seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along . "
The White House insists that Bush was " referring to a wide range of people , not any single person . "
But Obama 's campaign says it appeared to be a swipe at him , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Bush 's remarks were " beneath the dignity of the office of the president and unworthy of our representation " at the celebration of Israel 's 60th anniversary .
Referring to Sen. John McCain , Pelosi said : " I would hope that any serious person that aspires to lead the country , would disassociate themselves from those comments . ”
As Pelosi was speaking , House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rahm Emanuel issued a statement in which he said : " The tradition has always been that when a U.S. president is overseas , partisan politics stops at the water 's edge .
President Bush has now taken that principle and turned it on its head : for this White House , partisan politics now begins at the water ’s edge , no matter the seriousness and gravity of the occasion .
Does the president have no shame ? ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Democratic Party on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Federal Elections Commission seeking to force the group to investigate whether Sen. John McCain has violated federal spending limits for his primary campaign .
The lawsuit , which was filed in the United States District Court in Washington , is the latest move by the Democratic National Committee that seeks to prove the Arizona senator locked himself into campaign spending limits earlier this year .
The DNC claims McCain did so when he used the prospect of $ 6 million in federal matching funds as collateral for a December bank loan to his campaign .
But after it became apparent he would be the Republican presidential nominee , McCain notified the FEC in early February that he was not claiming federal matching funds .
Claiming those funds would limit his spending on the primary campaign to $ 54 million .
Watch more on the public financing controversy »
The DNC then filed a complaint with the FEC in February , arguing that McCain should be forced to accept the matching funds -- and the spending limits that come with it .
DNC Chairman Howard Dean said that McCain not only used the prospect of the funds as loan collateral , but he also accepted automatic ballot access in every state -- an advantage given to those who accept federal matching funds .
Those who do not accept federal matching funds are forced to gain ballot access themselves -- a task that can cost millions of dollars .
McCain , a chief advocate of campaign finance reform , sought the option of public financing last fall when his campaign was in dire need of money .
The primary campaign officially lasts through the party 's convention at the end of the summer .
FEC filings show McCain spent close to $ 60 million through the end of February , meaning a ruling in DNC 's favor would essentially leave McCain unable to campaign for the presidency over the next five months .
" Despite Sen . McCain 's apparent belief that the reforms he championed apply to everyone but himself , there is a compelling public interest in determining whether Sen.
McCain agreed to participate in the matching funds program so he could get a loan for his campaign , then violated the terms of that agreement so he could ignore the spending cap and raise unlimited money from lobbyists and special interests , " Tom McMahon , the DNC 's executive director , said in a statement Monday .
The Republican National Committee called the lawsuit " total nonsense . "
" It is now clear that the trial - lawyer Democrats ' idea of campaigning for president is to hire lawyers and file frivolous lawsuits , " RNC spokesman Alex Conant said .
" It 's unfortunate the DNC is now trying to drag the federal courts into their circus as well . "
According to FEC rules , the body has 120 days to act after a complaint is filed before court action can be taken .
Less than half that amount of time has passed since the complaint was filed in February .
But the FEC is currently hamstrung by vacancies -- four of the commission 's six seats are empty , and a deadlock between President Bush and the Senate has stalled nominees for those posts .
With the absence of a quorum , the body is unable to act on any complaints filed .
The DNC says it hoped the lawsuit will compel the FEC to take action , but in the likely event the commission continues to lack a quorum , it will seek to sue McCain 's campaign directly .
The lawsuit comes just days after McCain criticized Sen. Barack Obama for appearing to back away from his initial indication he would accept public matching funds for his general election campaign .
McCain himself has left the option open of accepting matching funds this fall .
Watch more on where the candidates are getting their money »
" He committed to it , " McCain told reporters on Friday .
" So in direct contradiction to his rhetoric , he 's now saying well he may not do it .
So facts are facts .
Facts are stubborn things .
" I repeat my commitment to public financing if he will , and I call on him to keep his commitment that he made a year ago , and not flip - flop .
Obama has raised more than $ 230 million from about 1.3 million donors on the Internet since his campaign began last year .
McCain has raised approximately $ 80 million in the same period .
Should Obama and McCain accept public financing , they would be granted $ 84 million by the federal government and would be unable to spend any more .

If you 're already starting to feel pangs of anxiety about the nearing conclusion of sci- fi soap opera * Battlestar Galactica , * rest assured – this fall , you can expect your TiVo to be working overtime .
Fox is stepping up to try and fill that programming void with a series of sci - fi sagas slated to hit the airwaves .
Here 's a quick run-down of the fall fantasy fare :
Virtuality : Penned by Battlestar Galactica creator Ronald D. Moore , this show revolves around the plight of a crew aboard a 10 - year mission to a distant solar system .
The ship is equipped with virtual - reality equipment that lets them " travel " to other destinations – which is fine until a mysterious bug infects the system .
Moore has reportedly written the two - hour pilot ; production is set to begin in July .
__Fringe : __Lost creator J.J. Abrams was reportedly given $ 10 million dollars to shoot a two - hour pilot episode for Fringe , a drama about an investigative unit specializing in otherworldly mysteries .
Long - time Lost scribe Jeff Pinker recently signed on to run the show , which Abrams has described as a cross between The X - Files , Altered States and The Twilight Zone .
__
Dollhouse : __Joss Whedon 's dystopian drama about killer assassins living in a futuristic lab will star Eliza Dushku ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Tru Calling ) .
Whedon has described the show as " The Bourne Identity meets Stepford Wives
meets boarding school meets Los Angeles neo -noir meets the
Whedonverse . "
Shooting is slated to begin on the first of seven episodes at the end of April .
__Boldly Going Nowhere : __From the creators of the under - repped comedy team behind It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia , this show follows the misadventures of a space crew – sort of a campy take on Star Trek .
Shooting for the pilot is set to begin in October .

The British Government is considering a proposal to end the automatic right of Commonwealth nationals to live in the UK using ancestry visas .
The visas allow people whose grandparents were born in Britain to live and work there for four years and eventually apply to stay .
The permit has allowed thousands of young Australians to use Britain as a base for travel .
British Labour MP
Austin Mitchell says the proposal is a slap in the face for Commonwealth countries .
" Here you have a long - standing historical and emotional ties , ties of kith and kin , and indeed supporting each other through two World Wars and events afterwards , " he said .
" You ca n't just kick away historical obligations like that . "
NASA ’s competitions arose , in part , from a desire to return to the moon , as well as to hand off part of NASA ’s old mission to the private sector — that mission being to make low - orbit space travel a mere extension of planes , trains and automobiles .
Of course , the competitions are also a sign of a bureaucracy trying to revive itself .
From tragic shuttle explosions to diapered astronaut stalkers , NASA has n’t had a good decade since “ I Dream of Jeannie ” was canceled .
Congress has appropriated for NASA a $ 12 million contest budget , nearly all of which — $ 10.9 million — is prize money .
The competitions themselves are organized and run by private nonprofits like Volanz Aerospace .
The winners retain the rights to their inventions .
So if it works out as planned , everybody wins : the inventors make money , the companies get good publicity and NASA gets its technology .
So far this has not been easy .
Even as Gary Harris and his Russian colleague were brainstorming at Harris ’s house in Florida , not a single one of these contests had had a winner , and NASA had not paid out its first dollar — not an easy thing to pull off for a government bureaucracy under pressure to make a show of success .
Some contests have been achingly close .
Last year ’s beam - power competition came within seconds of having a winner .
And this May , a contest known as the Regolith Excavation Challenge attracted another diverse mix of entrants : two graduate students at the University of Missouri at Rolla ; a guy who runs the boilers for the Detroit public schools ; and a programmer for Pacific Gas and Electric named Jim Greenhaw , who wore a cap promoting an organization of his called Technology Ranch .
The contest was particularly tough : you had to dig and move 330 pounds of simulated regolith ( the powdery dirt that covers the moon ) from a large sandbox to a scale in less than 30 minutes using only 30 watts of power — roughly the energy needed to light one of those small bulbs in the back of refrigerator .
Most of the machines failed immediately , digging into the particulate and grinding to a halt .
But Greenhaw ’s device , a souped - up conveyor belt fitted with little scoops , managed to haul a lot of regolith .
( When I asked Greenhaw where Technology Ranch was located , he smiled and pointed to his forehead .
“ Right here , ” he said . )
Unfortunately , Greenhaw ’s digger lacked sidewalls along a chute that carried the regolith , and as a result much of the dirt was pushed off the side and onto the ground .
With just a few pieces of duct tape and a couple more scoops fitted to the belt , Greenhaw might well have won the $ 125,000 .
“ One of the reasons Congress was telling us they were n’t giving us any more money , ” Ken Davidian , the NASA administrator of the challenges , told me , “ was because we had not awarded any money . ”
Davidian is a small compact man with a bit of a Dudley Do-Right chin and a swift , busy manner .
At any of the contests , he can be found setting up his traveling triptych ( actually five panels , a pentatych ) of promotional material .
“ I was n’t disappointed we were n’t giving money away , ” he said , “ because we had good company , and it shows that the prizes were hard to win . ”
The “ good company ” Davidian refers to is the recent surge in prize offerings from government and private sponsors alike .
Perhaps the most well known is the Ansari X Prize , which offered $ 10 million to the first designer to build a vehicle capable of making a round trip into suborbital space twice in two weeks .
( The legendary engineer Burt Rutan won it in 2004 . )
The unlikely sponsor of a robot - car race started in 2004 was the Pentagon ’s own lab , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , or Darpa .
In 2005 , a Stanford team won that competition ’s $ 2 million purse with “ Stanley , ” an unmanned car that finished a 132 - mile desert course in a first - place time of just less than seven hours .
This fall , contestants in the robot - car race will compete on an urban race course .
Congress is also currently considering the H - Prize Act , a bill that would provide purses of up to $ 10 million in six contests for breakthroughs related to hydrogen energy .
All of these contests probably owe their origins to an influential 1999 report by the National Academy of Engineering , whose recommendation can be deciphered from its clunky title , “ Concerning Federally Sponsored Inducement Prizes in Engineering and Science . ”

Americans , perhaps more so than people of other nations , have great faith in the idea of the outsider inventor .
The stories of inventors who made it out of their garages ( Steve Jobs ) and those who stayed there ( Philo T. Farnsworth ) are part of the national mythology .
Ever since Benjamin Franklin broke with his apprenticeship in Boston as a teenager and recreated himself as a freethinker and fearless inventor ( a narrative , some say , he simply repeated and wrote large with the founding of the nation ) , amateurism has taken on different connotations in this country .
Old World use of the word “ amateur ” intimated lower - class status , even incompetency , but in America , the land of second acts , “ amateur ” has accrued some of the more positive meanings we associate with the concept of the autodidact .
Americans seem drawn to the story of the outsider - made - good with an intensity that has riveted the nation from the earliest amateur contests featured regularly in Vaudeville to the latest versions of such shows , like “ American Idol . ”
In America , the self - made citizen is a kind of superhero .
The message was printed in capital letters on the bill
Ten friends found the abusive and sexually - explicit message on their bill at Joe Delucci's Italian restaurant in Bird Street , Lichfield , Staffordshire .
Diner Clare Watkin said she thought it was written after they complained about poor service .
The party from Walsall had gone to the restaurant on Friday .
Owner Nigel Langsdon has begun an investigation .
Ms Watkin said : " I could n't believe it .
The bill read ' fish cakes ' , which one of us had for a starter , and it was written right above it - absolutely disgusting language .
I think that the way that we 've been spoken to is absolutely outrageous
Clare Watkin
" We actually booked the table for 8 o ' clock in the evening , by the time they had taken our order it was quarter to nine and we did n't actually receive our food until quarter past 10 . "
She added : " I 'd like a written apology from the restaurant and I 'd also like some compensation .
" I think that the way that we 've been spoken to is absolutely outrageous . "
TV chef Gordon Ramsay 's foul - mouthed diatribes on his Channel 4 show The F Word have given viewers an insight into the type of language often used in the restaurant kitchen .
Joe Delucci's owner Mr Langsdon said the message had been meant to be seen only by kitchen staff and he did not know how it ended up as an item on the receipt .
He said : " That should n't come out on the bill , so we 've got to find out what 's gone wrong there .
" But we have apologised unreservedly to the girls concerned and said that they 're very welcome to come back and have a free meal and we'd like them to . "
He has also offered to donate the bill for their meal to charity .
The cost of the meal came to £ 284.68 , including a 10 % service charge .

To rupture this taboo , to smash the icon , and so to liberate America from its thrall required a special type of man … "
At the beginning of 1776 , New England was ready for independence .
So were such leading radicals as Richard Henry Lee and Patrick Henry of Virginia , Christopher Gadsden of South Carolina , and army leaders such as George Washington and Charles Lee .
But the bulk of the colonies and the Continental Congress were not .
One of the main stumbling blocks to a commitment to independence was personal loyalty to the British crown .
There has always been a political taboo of almost mystical force against attacking the head of state , and always the convenient though emasculating custom of attributing his sins to his evil or incompetent advisers .
Such long - standing habits impeded a rational analysis of the deeds of King George III .
Furthermore , the old and obsolete
Whig ideal of virtual independence under a figurehead king of both Britain and America could only be shattered if the king were to be attacked personally .
To rupture this taboo , to smash the icon , and so to liberate America from its thrall required a special type of man , a man fearless , courageous , and radical , an intellectual with a gift for dramatic and exciting rhetoric and unfettered by the many ties that bind a man to the existing system .
At this strategic hour America found just such a man : Thomas Paine .
Unlike most of the other eminent leaders of his day , there was nothing in the least aristocratic in the background of Tom Paine .
The son of a poor English corset maker , he was forced to educate himself for lack of schooling .
After serving a checkered career as corset maker , sailor , and petty bureaucrat , he finally rose to the status of a minor English tax collector .
He was soon characteristically in trouble with the authorities .
Chosen by his fellow excise collectors in 1772 to petition Parliament for higher wages , he was curtly dismissed from the service by the authorities .
Unemployed , bankrupt , the unhappy Paine began his life again at the age of thirty - seven by emigrating to America , armed only with a letter of introduction he had managed to obtain from Benjamin Franklin in London .
Landing in Philadelphia toward the end of 1774 , he got a job with a Philadelphia printer and soon rose to the editorship of the printer 's insignificant Pennsylvania Magazine .
He quickly proved himself an outstanding writer and publicist and quickly made his reputation as a libertarian by publishing a blistering attack on the institution of slavery .
In " African Slavery in America , " written shortly after his arrival and published in early March 1775 , Paine pointed out that the African natives were often peaceful and industrious farmers brought into slavery either by European man - theft or by outsiders inducing the African chieftains to war on each other and to sell their prisoners into slavery .
He also riddled the common excuse that purchase and ownership of existing slaves was somehow moral , in contrast to the wickedness of the original enslavement :
Such men may as well join with a known band of robbers , buy their ill - got goods , and help on the trade ; ignorance is no more pleadable in one case than the other … and as the true owner has the right to reclaim his goods that were stolen , and sold ; so the slave , who is proper owner of his freedom , has a right to reclaim it , however often sold .
The slaves , being human , have not lost their natural right to their freedom , and therefore , concluded Paine , " the governments … should in justice set them free , and punish those who hold them in slavery . "
Shortly after this article was published , the first abolitionist society —
The Society for the Promotion of the Abolition of Slavery — was established at Philadelphia .
Largely Quaker , it included the deist Paine as one of its members .
Lexington and Concord moved Paine to turn his talents to the radical revolutionary cause .
In July he urged upon the Quakers the justice of taking up arms in defense of liberty so long as disarmament is not universal .
He denounced the British government as highwaymen setting forth to plunder American property ; therefore , in self defense , " arms like laws discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe . "
For the British , " nothing but arms or miracles can reduce them to reason and moderation . "
And in October he combined his antislavery and proindependence views to castigate Great Britain for trafficking in human flesh , and he looked forward to an independence that would end the slave trade and , ultimately , all of slavery .
All this culminated in Paine 's tremendous blow for American independence .
His fiery and brilliant pamphlet Common Sense , off the press in early January 1776 , spread like wildfire throughout the colonies .
A phenomenal 120,000 copies were sold in the space of three months .
Passages were reprinted in newspapers all over America .
All this meant that nearly every literate home was familiar with the pamphlet .
Tom Paine had , at a single blow , become the voice of the American Revolution and the greatest single force in propelling it to completion and independence .
Charles
Lee wrote jubilantly and prophetically to Washington that " I never saw such a masterly , irresistible performance .
It will … in concurrence with the transcendent folly and wickedness of the ministry , give the coup de grace to Great Britain . "
And Washington himself endorsed " the sound doctrine and unanswerable reasoning " of Common Sense .
Common Sense called squarely and openly for American independence , and pointed to the choice for Americans as essentially between independence and slavery .
But what was more , Paine boldly smashed the icon , directing his most devastating fire at King George himself .
For the first time , the king , " the Royal Brute of Great Britain , " was pinpointed as the major enemy — the king himself , not just his wicked advisers ( the king 's advisers were attacked as being in thrall to him ) .
Paine had quashed the taboo , and Americans flocked to imbibe his liberating message .
Not stopping at indicting George III , Paine pressed on to a comprehensive attack on the very principle of monarchy .
The ancient Jews had prospered without kings and had suffered under them , he wrote , following the great English tradition of Milton and Sidney ; and Holland flourished as a republic .
But more important , the division between kings and subjects is unnatural , and bears no relation to the natural distinction between rich and poor on the market .
How , indeed , had the natural equality of men before the law become transposed into subjection to a monarch ?
We should find the first of them [ kings ] nothing better than the principal ruffian of some restless gang ; whose savage manners or pre-eminence in subtilty obtained him the title of chief among plunderers ; and who by increasing in power and extending his depredations , overawed the quiet and defenseless … .
And now the kings were but " crowned ruffians . "
In this way , Paine not only laid bare the roots of monarchy , but provided a brilliant insight into the nature and origins of the State itself .
He had made a crucial advance in libertarian theory upon the social - contract doctrine of the origin of the State .
While he followed Locke in holding that the State should be confined to the protection of man 's natural rights , he saw clearly that actual states had not originated in this way or for this purpose .
Instead , they had been born in naked conquest and plunder .
Another vital contribution of Common Sense to libertarian thought was Paine 's sharp quasi-anarchistic distinction between " society " and " government . "
Indeed , Paine opened his pamphlet with these words :
Some writers have so confounded society with government , as to leave little or no distinction between them ; whereas they are not only different , but have different origins .
Society is produced by our wants and governed by our wickedness … .
The one encourages intercourse , the other creates distinctions .
The first is a patron , the last a punisher .
Society in every state , is a blessing , but government , even in its best state , is but a necessary evil ; in its worst state an intolerable one : for when we suffer … the same miseries by a government , which we might expect in a country without government , our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer .
Government , like dress , is the badge of lost innocence ; the palaces of kings are built upon the ruins of the bowers of paradise .
In addition to limning brilliantly the nature and origins of monarchy and the State , calling boldly for independence , and attacking George III , Paine set forth the proper foreign policy for an independent America .
Here he argued that the connection with Great Britain entailed upon Americans burdens rather than rewards .
The Americans should not be tempted by the prospect of Anglo - American domination of the world ; on the contrary , America would vastly benefit from throwing open its trade and ports freely to all nations .
Further , the alliance with Britain " tends directly to involve this continent in European wars and quarrels , and set us at variance with nations … against whom we have neither anger nor complaint . "
As Europe is our market for trade , we ought to form no partial connection with any part of it .
It is the true interest of America to steer clear of European contentions , which she can never do while " she is made the make - weight in the scale of British politics . "
Thus , Paine adumbrated for America what was later to be called a foreign policy of " isolationism , " but which might also be called neutrality or neutralism .
Whatever it is called , it is essentially the libertarian policy of free trade and peaceful coexistence with all nations ; it is an America that acts as a moral beacon for mankind rather than as judge or policeman .
In addition to all these achievements , Paine managed to outline in this brief pamphlet the internal political program of the libertarian wing of the American Revolution : the new democratic system naturally created by the Revolution .
This consisted of rule by democratically elected legislatures established by proportionate representation and responsible to checks upon them by the people .
The aim of such government was simply to protect every man 's natural rights of liberty and property : " Securing freedom and property to all men , and above all things , the free exercise of religion …. "
He saw that the superficially plausible lucubrations of such Tory writers as Montesquieu and Blackstone , with their talk of mixed constitutions and checks and balances , masked the repression and hobbling of the democratic element by unchecked aristocracy and oligarchy .
Human reason , he implied , must be brought to bear on the myths and accretions of government itself .
The much - vaunted British constitution was a tangle of complexities , and hence vague and devoid of a focus of responsibility .
In effect , he charged , the so - called checks and balances have led to the aggrandizement of monarchical tyranny over the other branches of government .
Indeed , at any given time , for government to act at all , one of the branches must predominate and outweigh the checks and balances .
This argument is reminiscent of Edmund Burke 's blast against the idea of mixed and balanced government in his anarchistic first work , The Vindication of Natural Society .
Paine concluded the bulk of his magnificent pamphlet with these stirring lines :
O ! Ye that love mankind !
Ye that dare oppose not only the tyranny but the tyrant , stand forth !
Every spot of the old world is overrun with oppression .
Freedom hath been hunted round the globe … .
O !
Receive the fugitive , and prepare in time an asylum for mankind .
Sounding the clarion call for the democratic - libertarian cause as the party of hope , the party of progress , in short , the party of a secular , rational messianism , he eloquently hailed the impending future : " We have it in our power to begin the world over again … .
The birthday of a new world is at hand … .
The explosive success of Common Sense emboldened the radicals to follow with pamphlets and articles extolling the goal of independence , excoriating King George as " a full - blooded Nero , " and anticipating the great benefits of free trade with all the world that would flow from an independent status .
That the Tories , and quasi Tories , and conservatives who opposed independence should abominate Common Sense was , of course , to be expected , reviling it as that " artful , insidious and pernicious " work of sedition and " phrenzy . "
Several Tories hastened to publish pamphlets of rebuttal , warning of the " ruin , horror , and desolation " that would stem from abandoning the happy and peaceful status of a colony to pursue the romantic chimera of independence .
Independence was roundly denounced as absurdly impractical and " Utopian , " a project of " ambitious innovators " who " are attempting to hurry … into a scene of anarchy ; their scheme of independence is visionary … . "
Conservative landed oligarchs such as Landon Carter and Henry Laurens considered the Paine pamphlet as " indecent , " " rascally , " and " dangerous . "
But the Tories and conservatives soon found that their attacks on independence were in vain , that " there is a fascination belonging to the word Liberty that beguiles the minds of the vulgar … . "
Palestinian fuel distributors in the Gaza Strip agreed today to provide an emergency shipment to a UN aid agency that cautioned it would have to halt food distribution unless its trucks received petrol .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mahmoud al - Khuzundar of the Association for Petrol Station Owners in the Gaza Strip said 50,000 litres of diesel would be delivered to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) .
UNRWA said yesterday it would be forced to suspend food distribution to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians today , citing a shortage in fuel supplies in the Hamas - controlled territory .
UNRWA said the 50,000 litres should be enough to last about a week .
An Israeli official estimated storage tanks on the Palestinian side of the Nahal Oz crossing - the only border terminal used to pump fuel to the Gaza Strip - contained about a million litres of fuel .
He accused Hamas of preventing their distribution .
The petrol station owners ' association has been on strike , refusing to collect the fuel near Nahal Oz in protest at Israel 's cutbacks in supplies to the territory .
Following UNWRA 's warning , the European Union called on Israel today to ensure deliveries of fuel to Gaza .
" It is unacceptable that the UN should find itself having to consider suspending its humanitarian operations simply for a lack of fuel for its vehicles , " EU aid commissioner Louis Michel said in a statement .
" It is also unacceptable that public services , such as garbage collection , sewage treatment , or hospitals are on the brink of collapse for the same reason , " he said .
" It 's essential that the fuel supply to Gaza is resumed , and in particular that fuel provision for the United Nations agencies , as well as basic services be guaranteed immediately . "

Israel tightened border restrictions , while pledging to allow humanitarian aid to continue to flow to the Gaza Strip , after Hamas Islamists violently took over the territory in June .
Palestinian militants attacked the Nahal Oz fuel terminal two weeks ago , killing two Israeli civilians .
Israel allowed one million litres of EU - funded diesel fuel to be pumped to Gaza 's only power station yesterday after Kanan Abaid , deputy chairman of the Palestinian Energy Authority in the Gaza Strip , warned the plant would have to shut down unless supplies resumed .
A European Commission official said there was enough fuel at the plant for about three days , but that it would have to shut down on Sunday if no new deliveries were allowed through .
The former Soviet Union has a complicated history that is told in part through some of its deserted infrastructure .
From mining towns to oil - rig cities , many of these structures , towns and areas were abandoned suddenly and thus provide a kind of snapshot of Soviet life frozen in time .
Others tell stories of economic and political upheaval and even nuclear events .
From oil rig cities and deserted industrial towns to dazzling island fortresses and once - luxurious estates of the Soviet elite here are seven more amazing Soviet abandonments .
For more Soviet abandonments ( from gruesome gulags to submarine bases ) check out part one of this series .
Abandoned Island Fortress : Fort Alexander sits abandoned on a man-made island off the shore of St. Petersburg .
Constructed in the 1800s , the fort has over 100 cannon ports providing 360 - degree defense .
After the Crimean War it was initially used as a military storehouse before being converted by the Soviets into a dangerous plague research center due to its physical isolation from the mainland .
The fort is now deserted and most of its interior objects have been stripped and metal has been melted down for other uses .
Even now , however , visitors coming by boat ( or snowmobile ) are advised to wear a respirator and rubber boots .
Abandoned Sea City :
In 1949 the world changed forever as oil was struck for the first time in the sea off the coast of Azerbaijan .
Before long the first oil platform was built around this site but that was n’t all : dorms , schools , stores and other structures were all built up around this rig forming a virtual city on the water .
Ships were brought out and sunk to form the basis of a series of man-made islands .
Connected by a network of bridges and other structures this community has dwindled and is now all but deserted with buildings falling back into the sea .
Abandoned Mine Complex : Unlike other Soviet mines in the Kyshtym region the ones in the photographs above at least are n’t radioactive .
The ones shown here date back to the days of the Gulags and have been abandoned since the 1960s .
A cooling tank explosion around that time contaminated almost 20 square miles around this and other local mines and caused the evacuation of nearly 300,000 residents .
This incident was long hidden by the Soviet government before a scientist leaked the information in 1980 .
Other intrepid urban explorers , however , have braved even the nearby radioactive mines at their own risk .
Abandoned Industrial Town : Pyramiden is a classic model Soviet small blue - collar coal - mining town with a long history that was quickly and suddenly snuffed out .
In the early 1990s it was concluded that Pyramiden was no longer profitable and its citizens were given a few short hours to pack and leave .
Much like Chernobyl the result has been sad but fascinating : virtually everything was left behind from house plants to books on library shelves .
Though there are plans to potentially renovate this ghost town for now it provides a picture of local life two decades ago .
Abandoned Soviet Estate :
There are many abandoned estates scattered throughout Russia that are simply too remote to warrant restoration .
As photographer Jason Grant points out , though , these are provide in many ways a more real experience of history for those who visit and photograph them .
This particular estate in Belogorka survived the revolution and was only moderately damaged by a bomb in WWII .
It was subsequently used as a scientific research institute and is now strewn with bottles and chemicals from these last tenants .
Abandoned Transportation : Throughout Russia and the former Soviet Union one can find a vast number of abandoned air , sea and land vehicles that have simply been left to rust rather than repurposed or recycled .
In other parts of the world one would imagine they could find other uses for giant ships , disused fighter jets and entire train networks but here these things seem to fall through the cracks .
Figures next to the planes and boats shown above bring home the enormous scale of these abandoned relics of Soviet transportation .
Other Abandoned Areas :
The region known as Abkhazia is a semi- independent zone within Georgia in which a great deal of transportation and other infrastructure has been deserted in recent decades due to a lack of funds .
Shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union the region came into conflict with the rest of Georgia as Georgians pushed toward independence from Russia .
Today , Russia issues passports for Abkhazians , pays their retirement pensions and provides citizenship to many of the people .
Nonetheless , since the fall of the USSR the local budgets have not been enough to maintain many buildings and train networks as illustrated by the images above .

President Bush 's recently announced climate - change strategy has been met with muted applause .
Mr. Bush called for stabilizing US greenhouse - gas emissions by 2025 , a goal many scientists say is far less than what 's needed to turn around Earth 's warming trend .
Global - warming activists and many Democrats in Congress blasted it as too little , too late .
No surprise there .
But criticism came from around the world as well .
The Financial Times quotes Japan 's environment minister as saying that Bush 's announcement " fell far short " of expectations :
" Truthfully , I want the US to tackle the issue of global warming more proactively , " said Ichiro Kamoshita .
South African Environment and Tourism Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk was harsher in his criticism :
" There is no way whatsoever that we can agree to what the US is proposing , " said Van Schalkwyk .
" In effect , the US wants developing countries that already face huge poverty and development challenges to pay for what the US and other highly industrialized countries have caused over the past 150 years . "
German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel was downright insulting .
Green Business reported that :
" In a statement entitled ' Bush 's Neanderthal speech , ' Mr. Gabriel said that the White House ' showed not leadership but losership , ' and expressed relief that there are ' other voices in the United States ' that take action on climate change seriously . "
Some of Bush 's fellow Republicans were critical as well :
" ' I commend the president for acknowledging that we have a climate change problem and a responsibility to address it , but … the time for real action is now , ' California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
" ' Targets for reduction are important , but I 'd like to see the federal government follow the lead many states have taken on this issue and approve California 's request for a waiver that would enable 17 states to clean their own air of greenhouse gases . ' "
Bush 's announcement came just as new concerns about global climate change were being voiced .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration last week reported new warming levels :
" Last month was the warmest March on record over land surfaces of the world and the second warmest overall worldwide … .
Overall land and sea surface temperatures for the world were second highest in 129 years of record keeping , trailing only 2002 , the agency said . "
Also last week , geoscientists meeting in Vienna reported that glaciers and mountain snow are melting earlier in the year than usual .
This is stored water needed by millions of people in the summer when there 's less rainfall , according to Reuters :
" Daniel Viviroli , from the University of Berne in Switzerland ... says the earth 's subtropic zones , which are home to 70 percent of the world 's population , are the most vulnerable .
" And with the global population expected to expand rapidly , there may not always be enough water to drink , let alone to water crops , which use about 70 percent of melt - water . "
They were Darth Vader 's feared henchmen and some of the most recognisable figures in cinematic history .
Now the imperial stormtroopers of the Star Wars films are at the centre of a new epic battle .
The British prop designer who created their famous white helmets and body armour is being sued by director George Lucas for £ 10 m in a case starting at the high court tomorrow .
Andrew Ainsworth was sued by the director 's company , Lucasfilm , after reproducing the outfits from the original moulds and selling them for up to £ 1,800 each .
Ainsworth is countersuing Lucasfilm for a share of the £ 6bn merchandising revenue generated since the first film in the series premiered in 1977 .
The row centres on who actually owns the copyright to the stormtrooper uniforms .
Ainswoth said : " As far as I am concerned I am the original maker and I 'm using the original moulds . "
The prop designer was recruited to design the outfits in 1976 and sold the firsts 50 helmets to Lucas for £ 35 each .
But in 2004 he discovered one of the original helmets in a cupboard in his home in Twickenham , south - west London and began to manufacture the uniforms .
A message on his website said : " Now 's your chance to own your own piece of movie history . "
A California court has already ruled in favour of Lucas who was awarded £ 10 m in damages .
But because Ainsworth lives in Britain Lucas needs the high court in London to enforce the order .
A spokesman for Lucas Licensing said : " We would never want to discourage fans from showcasing their enthusiasm for the movies .
However , anyone who tried to profit from using our copyrights and trademarks without authorisation ... we will go after them . "
Oh wow -ee , a V8 Mustang !
a new El Camino !
a new Dodge Challenger !
a new C( n+1 ) Corvette !
How innovative !
Ooh , ooh , looka there , if you give some Italians a half million dollars they 'll make you a super nice luxury GT in fire - engine red , who 'd ever have imagined they could do that ?
Oh boy , the thousandth iteration of another ridiculously overpowered V8 sports sedan with not a single speck of design in it ( excepting the stereo system and sat nav ) that was n't in mass production thirty or forty years ago is so awesomely exciting !!!1 !
Yeah ( yaaaawn ) sure .
You suckers would n't know a really slick piece of modern engineering if it bit you on the ass .
Look at the Prius 's exotic three - way transmission , or its bizarro Atkinson - cycle engine , or its regenerative braking , or its drivetrain - control electronics if you want to see a few things you wo n't find all over 1960s and 70s back issues of Road - n - Track and Car - n - Driver .
Nor are these hand - built one - of - a - kind prototypes that cost more than your house , so you can only look at them from afar , but all that badass technology is packed in a mass production car at a price Joe Median can actually afford to buy and drive himself .
And oil is $ 120 a barrel
and it 's there to stay , too , yet still all you guys can do is dis , dis , dis Toyota .
The stupidest part of the argument is how it's not enough for Toyota to have designed and built and promoted and mass - produced the Prius , no !
- where , because millions upon millions of teevee - addicted Americans insist on buying three - ton V8 pickup trucks and SUVs primarily to carry one ( 1 ) person from suburbia to office parking lot and back , Toyota , a car manufacturer , is to be censured without cease for not righteously refusing all their nasty , eco-unfriendly trade .
Better that the tainted profits to be extracted from all those blockheads should go exclusively to all the other car manufacturers who for decades refused to even consider making any high - quality , high - tech , high - mileage cars at all .
The Eighth Annual Media That Matters Film Festival , presented by Arts Engine , kicked off on Wednesday night , its mission to use the short film medium to engage audiences and inspire them to take action about a range of important issues .
One of our favorites of the bunch , the Meerkat Media Collective ’s Every Third Bite , tackles a topic we ’ve heard a lot about in recent months but still find a bit hard to understand : colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) , the unexplained phenomenon of worker bees abruptly disappearing from hives in Europe and the United States .
This could make for a very alarmist narrative , of course — without bees we ’d pretty much all starve .
But Every Third Bite takes a different approach .
After giving us a brief overview of CCD , it introduces us to a number of individual beekeepers who are doing their part to battle CCD , some in the most unlikely places .
Of particular interest to readers will be David Graves , who operates twelve hives on the rooftops of New York City and sees the city as an untapped resource for beekeeping .

Life is unfair .
We are all being tested , all the time , on things that " are not on the curriculum " that nobody may have taught us .
How unfair !
Often we are tested on things that we have no way of knowing !
Scary , but true .
But the sooner we realize those facts of life , the better off we will be !
The results of the tests in life are not merely whether you get an A , B or C in school .
In life , the tests will have far more significant consequences , and may determine if you become wealthy enough to effectively help others , or go bankrupt and have to start all over again , or worse .
Today , everyone in the world who has any money or wealth is being tested on their own knowledge of the nature and value of paper money , and on how much paper money there might be ; and on the nature and value of silver and gold as money , and on how much silver and gold there might be .
We are being tested on things that nobody teaches , and on things that are , frankly , impossible to know , although estimates exist , and I do try to share some of the professionally compiled estimates on those subjects .
Here 's a bit of the curriculum on money : Archive : http://silverstockreport.com/ssrarchive.htm
The Money Chart : The Fundamentals of Gold & Silver Feb 25 , 2006
Speech given at the Silver Summit September 26 , 2006
Why Silver Will Soar May 23 , 2007
Today , I 'd like to talk a little bit about the facts of hyperinflation .
Everyone will be tested on this in this market , so pay attention , because these facts are not widely taught .
If you understand this , you can get a serious advantage over other people .
Back in 2003 , I wrote :
Inflation & Deflation During Hyperinflation Nov 6 , 2003
Back when I was selling individual essays , that was a best seller .
I identified a monumental sea change situation that changed in 2001 .
In 2001 , an amazing thing happened .
Hyperinflation started in the U.S. , and has continued ever since , and gotten worse .
In 2001 , the purchasing power of money in the banks ( the gold value ) peaked , and then started going down faster than the rate of increase of new dollars .
Whereas before 2001 , both the number and the value of dollars increased at the same time .
June 1998 : M3 5,711 billion / gold price $ 296 / oz . = 19.3 ( billion oz . gold value )
June 1999 : M3 6,221 billion / gold price $ 260 / oz . = 23.9 ( billion oz . gold value )
June 2000 : M3 6,809 billion / gold price $ 288 / oz . = 23.6 ( billion oz . gold value )
June 2001 : M3 7,628 billion / gold price $ 270 / oz . = 28.2 ( billion oz . gold value )
June 2002 : M3 8,178 billion / gold price $ 318 / oz . = 25.7 ( billion oz . gold value )
June 2003 : M3 8,761 billion / gold price $ 345 / oz . = 25.4 ( billion oz . gold value )
Sept 2003 : M3 8,909 billion / gold price $ 390 / oz . = 22.8 ( billion oz . gold value )
Money value peaked in 2001 , with M3 being worth 28.2 billion ounces of gold .
That 's a fact that " paper money value " peaked in terms of the amount of gold it could theoretically buy .
But hey , you know what ?
Experts claim there are only about 5 billion ounces of gold ever mined in the history of humanity !
This shows that there are probably a few too many fraudulent dollars out there .
Today , the value of M3 is still bloated and terribly over valued , and M3 is still increasing in number , while shrinking in value .
Nowandfutures shows that M3 is $ 14 trillion .
What a vast increase over $ 7.6 trillion in 2001 !
Nearly double in 7 years !
http://www.nowandfutures.com/key_stats.html
The gold price today is $ 912 / oz .
So , for April , 2008 : M3 14,000 billion / gold price $ 912 / oz . = 15.3 ( billion oz . gold value ) !
That 's 15.3 billion oz .
of gold , in theory , that all U.S. money in the banks can buy .
U.S. dollars ( Fed notes ) are very over valued still , and going down in value , still !
And hyperinflation continues , as inflation of the money supply is now 19 % !
INFLATION IS 19.5 % !
( Inflation of the money supply ! )
What 's inflation ?
The U.S. is diluting the value of the dollar by making too many .
It 's like adding an extra can of water to the juice .
It 's like adding a bunch of cold water to the hot bath .
It 's like trying to make Jello with too much water .
The inflation rate is the amount of extra dollars that they are adding each year , that are destroying the value of the dollar .
But since 2001 , the value of the dollar is being destroyed FASTER than the inflation rate -- that 's the hyperinflation that started in 2001 .
You are being tested on your knowledge of that , right now .
To pass the test , you need to own physical silver or physical gold .
If you fail the test , you are happy to own paper money , paper bonds , or paper silver and gold certificates .
The Consumer Price Index , ( CPI ) inflation rate is said to be 4 % .
http://www.bls.gov/cpi/
The CPI is under counting , as it uses hedonic adjustments , and excludes " unimportant " things like gold , silver , food , housing , and energy ( what else is there ? ! ) , and the true inflation rate must be higher .
Experts seem to suggest that the true consumer inflation rate is between 8 - 12 % , but a housewife who pays attention to grocery prices might know more .
This is another unknowable part we all get tested on .
Now , the difference between what bonds pay you ( 2 - 4 % ? ) , and what inflation takes from you ( 12 - 19 - 22 % ? ) , is the cost of owning bonds , and while I do n't know exact numbers , as nobody can , what I do know , and I guarantee you , is that this is a negative number .
What the number is , who knows .
Let 's say it 's negative 15 % or so .
That 's the price you pay , the money you lose each year , for owning bonds , now days , and this has been the penalty since about 2001 .
Do n't pay attention to people who claim there is deflation , or worry about deflation .
There is inflation , a lot of inflation , so much inflation that we have hyperinflation .
The thing that is deflating is the value of money , because there is hyperinflation .
Why is there hyperinflation ?
Because there is " never enough money " to avoid bankruptcy of the major institutions , because they are printing money for the war in Iraq , and for too much government .
The money printers are fearing deflation because other people might be taking money out of the banks ( which is said to be deflationary ) to hold it in the mattress , spend it overseas , or use it to buy silver and gold .
But that 's not deflation , it 's the result of hyperinflation .
Hyperinflation makes people take their money out of the banks , and spend it as fast as possible .
The point is that there is no monetary incentive for people to hold cash or bonds right now ; as they are losing money because of the high money creation rate , and the gold rate increases .
Another main point that follows is that gold will continue to go up as long as current conditions exist , as they have , since 2001 .
Since 2001 , gold has been going up by about 22 % per year .
That 's from $ 250 to a high of $ 1000 , over 7 years .
Now then .
Where are the economic incentives today when owning gold pays 22 % per year , and owning bonds costs 15 % per year ?
The incentive is to sell bonds and buy gold .
The world economic conditions are paying people to move into gold .
There is no reason to think that anything will change , until it does .
The required change is for bonds to pay more than the annual gold value increases .
Until bonds pay more than owning gold , then gold will continue to rise .
How far will this process be likely to go ?
How long ?
Until when ?
Until bonds pay more than owning gold , then gold will continue to rise .
That 's not a misprint ; it 's a repeat of the main point .
Here 's another clue :
The size of the U.S. Bond market might be about $ 25 trillion , and the world bond market might be $ 50 trillion .
The size of the world gold market might be about $ 5 trillion .
Right now , an extremely tiny portion of the $ 50 trillion market is trying to buy into the $ 5 trillion market .
I think about $ 0.115 trillion is going into gold annually right about now .
( 4000 tonnes x $ 900 / oz . )
That 's about 1/5th of 1 % of the money is going into gold .
And yet 91 % of the people are now concerned about inflation .
Selling gold to people should be the easiest job in the world right now , the easiest pitch ever .
Everyone should want it , yet virtually nobody is buying it , the demand has barely started , and the demand for silver is like 100 times less .
This might be another clue as to how long the gold market will go , but is no guarantee : Jan.
1980 : M3 1,822 billion / gold price $ 850 / oz . = 2.1 ( billion oz . gold value )
Gold will go up at least until the gold value of paper money is 2 billion gold ounces , or significantly less , as that was the condition in 1980 , and it should probably continue further than that .
After all , the U.S. government does not have 2 billion ounces of gold ; it only has 0.261 billion ounces of gold .
Be prepared for gold prices to continue to rise about 22 % per year or more , at least until bond interest payments rise to over 22 % per year , or whatever the gold price increases might be at the time .
Now , I want to address people who will inevitably ask me , " What will happen if there is deflation " .
I will respond , " There is n't any deflation " .
They will respond , " But so - and - so thinks there is deflation . "
I will respond , " Well , so - and - so is wrong . "
They will respond , " But what if things change , and we actually have deflation ? "
OK , there 's a real question .
I will respond , first of all , there is no deflation , the money supply is soaring .
Before the money supply can actually shrink , it has to slow down growing , and we 'd see that first .
Then , the money supply would have to be stable .
Then , the money supply would have to actually stop .
Bankruptcies would vastly increase .
Bankruptices are one of the only things that can actually cause deflation , as that destroys credit and money in the banks when banks go belly up .
When banks start going bankrupt , how confident will people be to let their money sit in bonds in the banks ?
Not very .
They will start to buy gold even faster than they do today , since gold is not anyone 's liability .
If that happens , gold will go up until bonds start paying more than gold is going up each year , AND until banks stop going bankrupt .
So , if there is deflation , gold will go up more , and for longer , until people trust banks again , which could be a very long time .
This is why the Fed is doomed .
Printing more will not work .
Printing less will not work .
Printing nothing will not work .
All the inflation of all the years from 1913 until now is beginning to crash down on our heads , and it will keep crashing until it stops .
And when will that be ?
Until bonds start paying more each year than gold is going up each year .
As always , silver trumps gold , in my opinion , since so much silver has been consumed in jewelry and flatware and industry .
If the silver to gold ratio returns to the historic 15:1 , we will make 3 times as much money in silver , than in gold .
But due to the rarity of silver , because it has been used up , because it is hard to find , and because only about 8 times as much silver is mined than gold each year , silver will probably exceed the value of the historic 15:1 .
To get an A + on one of the tests of life today is real simple .
You do n't need to know any of what I just said , but it might help .
All you need to do is buy silver .

We 're going to assume that Washington University 's Gargoyle Club in St. Louis did n't have a " No Moshing " sign with a footnote warning that doing so naked would be punishable by Taser .
But that was the case during Friday night 's sold - out Girl Talk show , when a student resisted security 's attempts to eject him from the club for being disruptive , according to a police report on the incident .
The 22 - year - old man , whose name has not been released by authorities , was escorted outside and told to leave , after which he allegedly shoved a security guard and pulled down his own pants and underwear .
That 's when the cops were called in to deal with the ruckus outside the basement venue , which is booked and run by students .
When cops arrived at around 10:45 p.m. , they repeatedly told the man , who the report said appeared intoxicated , to pull up his pants or face arrest .
He refused , and when an officer tried to handcuff him , he struggled , prompting the police to threaten him with the Taser if he did n't calm down .
The man continued to resist , according to what one witness told St. Louis ' Riverfront Times .
" He was Tasered in the a -- for a prolonged period of time , " the female witness said .
" It was terrible . "
He was arrested and taken to the hospital — standard procedure following a Tasering — before being booked at the St. Louis County Jail .
Police are recommending he be charged with sexual misconduct and resisting or interfering with arrest .
Several people claiming to be eyewitnesses to the incident have posted comments on the Times Web site .
" I saw this happen , " wrote one commenter .
" The guy was definitely high or something , and he had been pushing and threatening people all night .
There was one point when several concertgoers chanted to get him out .
The bouncers were trying to get him to leave ( physically pushing him through the door ) when he dropped his pants . "
After the incident , the lights in the venue were brought up and concertgoers were instructed to leave , with no explanation .
Some shouted , " Do n't Tase me , bro ! " to police officers standing near the exits , in reference to a University of Florida student who was Tased at a John Kerry speech in September , according to the Times .
Gregg Gillis , the man behind Girl Talk , said he had no idea what was going on either .
" It was kinda toward the end of the show , and I did n't see anything , " Gillis said Monday ( November 12 ) when asked to re-create the scene .
" Every show I do is crazy , and this one was no different .
There was a little bit of pushing , and there 's always one guy who is drunker than anyone else , but there was no one I noticed who appeared to be more out of control than anything else I 've seen .
I just wish someone would have told me , so I could have made sense of why I had to bring the show to a close . "
Gillis said that about 15 minutes before he was going to wrap things up , the student promoters told him he needed to stop playing immediately .
He took that as a five - minute warning and tried to talk to the promoters , but at no point did anyone inform him about the Tasering .
" If someone would have said , ' There 's a guy out there being Tasered by police , and they need you to stop this , ' I would have felt obliged to wrap it up , " Gillis said .
A spokesperson for the venue referred all calls to the school 's administration .
Once it was clear he was going to have the plug yanked , a sweaty Gillis grabbed the mic after the lights went up and yelled , " What the f--- , St. Louis ?
That was a really uncool way to end the show .
How late can I play till ? "
Gillis wrote about the incident on his MySpace page the next day , thanking some campus frat boys for helping him salvage the fiasco .
" I have n't played a free afterparty in a year , " he later told MTV News .
" I asked the audience if there was anywhere we could take the show , and some frat dudes [ members of Sigma Alpha Mu ] proposed their basement , so we rounded everyone up , and the show moved directly to their basement .
" That [ free ] show was [ better ] attended than the real show , " Gillis said .
" The basement was packed , and there were 200 or 300 people all over the house .
There was no shoving , and everyone was having a good time .
It was like a classic college scene :
No one standing still , people making out with their girlfriends , people shotgunning beers and crowd - surfing , all with the lights on the whole time .
I hope someone has video of that show . "
Steve Givens , Washington University 's associate vice chancellor for public affairs , would not give any more details about the man who was arrested but said he will have to go in front of a judicial administrator and could face sanctions ranging from a warning to possible expulsion .
By now , most people know they should be eating more vegetables .
But are there ways to get more from the vegetables you already eat ?
A growing body of research shows that when it comes to vegetables , it ’s not only how much we eat , but how we prepare them , that influences the amount of phytochemicals , vitamins and other nutrients that enter our body .
The benefits are significant .
Numerous studies show that people who consume lots of vegetables have lower rates of heart disease , hypertension , diabetes , eye problems and even cancer .
The latest dietary guidelines call for 5 to 13 servings  that is two and a half to six and a half cups a day .
For a person who maintains her weight on a 2,000 - calorie - a- day diet , this translates into nine servings , or four and a half cups a day , according to the Harvard School of Public Health .
But how should they be served ?
Surprisingly , raw and plain vegetables are not always best .
In The British Journal of Nutrition next month , researchers will report a study involving 198 Germans who strictly adhered to a raw food diet , meaning that 95 percent of their total food intake came from raw food .
They had normal levels of vitamin A and relatively high levels of beta carotene .
About 1,100 people have been executed in the United States in the last three decades .
Harris County , Tex. , which includes Houston , accounts for more than 100 of those executions .
Indeed , Harris County has sent more people to the death chamber than any state but Texas itself .
Yet Harris County ’s capital justice system has not been the subject of intensive research  until now .
A new study to be published in The Houston Law Review this fall has found two sorts of racial disparities in the administration of the death penalty there , one commonplace and one surprising .
The unexceptional finding is that defendants who kill whites are more likely to be sentenced to death than those who kill blacks .
More than 20 studies around the nation have come to similar conclusions .
But the new study also detected a more straightforward disparity .
It found that the race of the defendant by itself plays a major role in explaining who is sentenced to death .

tex_wrap ( version 1.00 ) tex_wrap.py Implements TeX 's algorithm for breaking paragraphs into lines .
This module provides a straightforward implementation of the algorithm
used by TeX to format paragraphs .
The algorithm uses dynamic
programming to find a globally optimal division into lines , enabling
it to produce more attractive results than a first - fit or best - fit
algorithm can .
For a full description , see the reference .
The module provides the ObjectList class , which is a list of Box ,
Glue , and Penalty instances .
The elements making up a paragraph of
text should be assembled into a single ObjectList .
Boxes represent
characters of type , and their only attribute is width .
Glue
represents a space of variable size ; in addition to a preferred width ,
glue can also stretch and shrink , to an amount that 's specified by the
user .
Penalties are used to encourage or discourage breaking a line
at a given point .
Positive values discourage line breaks at a given
point , and a value of INFINITY forbids breaking the line at the
penalty .
Negative penalty values encourage line breaks at a given
point , and a value of - INFINITY forces a line break at a particular
point .
The compute_breakpoints ( ) method of ObjectList returns a list of
integers containing the indexes at which the paragraph should be
broken .
If you 're setting the text to be ragged - right ( or
ragged - left , I suppose ) , then simply loop over the text and insert
breaks at the appropriate points .
For full justification , you 'll have
to loop over each line 's contents , calculate its adjustment ratio by
calling compute_adjustment_ratio( ) , and for each bit of glue , call its
compute_width ( ) method to figure out how long this dab of glue should
be .

Explanation : Snow - capped stratovolcano Mt. Damavand climbs to 5,670 meters ( 18,598 feet ) near the left edge in this panoramic view of the world at night .
In the sky to the left of Damavand 's peak are the stars of the Big Dipper in Ursa Major .
Pan to the right and your gaze will sweep across the arch of our Milky Way Galaxy above the Alborz Mountain Range bordering the Caspian Sea .
Near the center of the panorama , recorded in the predawn hours of April 4th , bright stars Deneb and Altair lie close to the curve of the Milky Way , above the glow of the Haraz valley .
Farther right , brilliant Jupiter dominates the sky near the stars , nebulae , and dark dust clouds toward the bulging galactic center .
Finally , the horizon glow at the right edge , below bright yellowish giant star Antares , is from the city of Damavand , named for the legendary mountain peak .
On the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day and a week before Israel marks its 60th Independence Day , a group of over 100 British Jews comprised of well - known academics , writers , actors and other public figures has launched a scathing attack against the Jewish state .
' We 're not celebrating Israel 's anniversary , ' proclaimed the letter carried by the Guardian newspaper on Wednesday .
Among the signatures of those claiming Israel forced 70,000 Palestinians into a Death March in 1948 are Prof .
Haim Bresheeth , a professor at the University of East London who organized the call for an academic boycott against Israel , playwright Harold Pinter , Attorney Daniel Machover , who filed a lawsuit against Maj.
Gen. Doron Almog , and Stephen Fry .
" We cannot celebrate the birthday of a state founded on terrorism , massacres and the dispossession of another people from their land , " say the letter writers .
" We cannot celebrate the birthday of a state that even now engages in ethnic cleansing , that violates international law , that is inflicting a monstrous collective punishment on the civilian population of Gaza and that continues to deny to Palestinians their human rights and national aspirations .
We will celebrate when Arab and Jew live as equals in a peaceful Middle East . "
" In July 1948 , 70,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes in Lydda and Ramleh in the heat of the summer with no food or water .
Hundreds died .
It was known as the Death March .
We will not be celebrating , " the letter continues .
" In all , 750,000 Palestinians became refugees .
Some 400 villages were wiped off the map .
That did not end the ethnic cleansing .
Thousands of Palestinians were expelled from the Galilee in 1956 .
Many thousands more when Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza .
Under international law and sanctioned by UN resolution 194 , refugees from war have a right to return or compensation .
Israel has never accepted that right .
We will not be celebrating . "
' Israel responsible for attacks on Sderot '
In an interview with Ynet Prof .
Haim Bresheeth rejected any claim that the letter was in any way anti-Semitic .
" I do n't understand why the signatories are being accused of anti-Semitism and support of terrorism .
None of those who attached their names to the letter supports harming civilians or senseless victims on both sides , " he said .
" We want Israel and the Palestinians to live side by side in peace , without missiles , without Qassams and without warplanes hovering above .
I want to live in Palestine , without killing on both sides .
" Israel is unwilling to talk to Hamas , which won the democratic elections .
Hamas on the other hand , is willing to talk to Israel so long as it withdraws from all the territories . "
Bresheeth accused Israel as being responsible for the situation in the territories : " The real terror is the one Israel has inflicted on the Palestinians for 40 years now , the terrorism of a strong state against a relatively weak organization .
We are pushing the Palestinians into a corner where they have no choice by the attacks .
We must not do this , the fact that the government of Israel cannot ensure the safety of its residents and the safety of Sderot is solely its own fault . "
Israel 's ambassador to Britain , Ron Proser , responded to the letter : " Israel is a democratic nation where anyone can speak their mind and freely criticize anything with virtually no restraints , but when a group
such as this one , of Jews and former Israelis , sums up 60 years of Israeli existence with hate slogans like these – they deserve to be denounced and even ostracized .
" We are proud of the marvelous achievements Israel and the Jewish people have accomplished in our 60 years of existence and we will not allow this harebrained group to spoil our celebration . "
LONDON ( Reuters ) - The British entrepreneur who sold a football Web site at the age of 17 for $ 40 million ( 20 million pounds ) has switched his attention to help launch a social networking site on Sunday designed to fight malaria .

Tom Hadfield set up Soccer.net in his bedroom before selling it to U.S. sports network ESPN , but now hopes the power of sites such as Facebook can curb a disease that kills an estimated one million people a year , many of them in Africa .
“ I believe in the power of friends telling friends telling friends , ” self - styled part - time student and full - time entrepreneur Hadfield told Reuters in an interview .
“ Our dream is tens of thousands of people will use social networking tools to build a movement that eradicates malaria . ”
Now 25 and a fourth - year political science student at Harvard university , Hadfield came up with the idea for www.MalariaEngage.org after a trip to Zambia last summer that gave him a close - up look at the mosquito - born disease .
“ Travelling across Africa and seeing the devastation caused by malaria made me realise there was more to life than putting up soccer scores , ” said Hadfield .
“ Everyone I met at an aid project making mosquito nets in Zambia had either lost a child to malaria or knew someone who had . ”
Hadfield then travelled to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania where he met researchers working on malaria treatments and discovered that their efforts were being held back by a lack of resources .
“ It ’s shocking that thousands of people are dying every day from a preventable disease , ” said Hadfield , who was honoured as Global Leader of Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , in 2001 .
“ When I came back from Africa last summer , a lot of people asked me what they can do to help . ”
The site encourages people to donate $ 10 or more to help support seven different research projects in Tanzania , such as developing plants like lemongrass to repel mosquitoes .
But Hadfield sees MalariaEngage.org as more than a fundraising tool .
“ MalariaEngage.org increases the return on investment of donors by connecting them directly with researchers working on malaria prevention treatment , ” said Hadfield .
“ It ’s about more than about giving money -- it ’s about creating connections .
By encouraging individual participation and involvement , we will create international communities of common interest .
This is the essence of social networking . ”
The seven projects were recommended by Tanzania ’s National Institute for Medical Research and once those have been funded , MalariaEngage.org will look to support new schemes across developing countries .
Due to marry in November , Hadfield co-founded the site with health professors Peter A. Singer and Abdallah S. Daar at Canada ’s McLaughlin - Rotman Centre for Global Health at University Health Network as well as the University of Toronto .
“ We feel young African scientists have very good ideas that end up in the dustbin , ” said Singer .
“ This is about helping committed young researchers with good ideas to help themselves create a better future . ”
April 29 , 2008  -- Dennis Staples , a radio announcer in Toledo , Ohio , slipped into a coma the day before his 60th birthday .
He had been on dialysis for more than two years because of kidney failure , but had fared well with treatment .
Then one day , while on dialysis at the doctor 's office , Staples went into cardiac arrest .
Despite a quick medical response , he never recovered .
Today , his wife Johanna attributes his death to the blood - thinner drug heparin that he received to prevent clotting during treatment .
" My husband and many other ailing patients who received that drug suffered needlessly , " Staples said .
Dennis Staples may be one of at least 81 patients who died from bad heparin between January 2007 and March 2008 , in addition to hundreds of others who have experienced severe allergic reactions like low blood pressure , vomiting and shortness of breath .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is now investigating whether the drug 's ingredients that came from China became contaminated on purpose or by accident , and where in the supply chain that contamination occurred .
Staples was among several people who provided emotional testimony Tuesday at a Capitol Hill hearing on how the medication became tainted and whether the FDA 's inspection procedures for foreign drug plants fueled the problem .
Drug Makers Say Deliberate Contamination Happened Early in Supply Chain
Both the CEO of heparin manufacturer Baxter and the CEO of Scientific Protein Laboratories , the U.S. firm that operates the Chinese plant from which Baxter and others got their heparin , suggested the contamination was deliberate and happened before the drug 's ingredient reached the lab .
" We are greatly concerned that our heparin product appears to be the target of a deliberate adulteration scheme , " Robert L. Parkinson , Jr. , chairman , CEO and president of Baxter International , Inc. , said in a written statement to the House Energy and Commerce Committee 's oversight and investigations panel .
David Strunce , CEO of Scientific Protein Laboratories , likewise said , " It seems to us that it 's an intentional act upstream in the supply chain . "
" This is thuggery , " said Rep. Michael C. Burgess , R - Texas .
" This is thievery .
This is high crimes and a direct assault on the American public .
I mean , this is not just testing for normal product manufacture , in my opinion , for what it 's worth .
Someone did this deliberately .
They found a product much cheaper than the active ingredient . "
Still subcommittee chairman Bart Stupak , D - Mich. , pointed fingers at those companies for not ensuring the product that passed through their hands was safe .
" Make no mistake about it : Both Baxter and SPL have failed the American public , " Stupak said .
Inspections Aim To Monitor Complex Supply Chain
Derived from pig intestines , often from farms in rural China , heparin is processed and manufactured in various plants in China , the United States and abroad before it is finally administered to patients .
Experts have since created a new test to detect the previously undetectable contaminant in that complex supply chain .
The FDA has also ramped up efforts to test heparin shipments coming from overseas to find out whether they 're safe .
Deborah M. Autor , director of the FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research 's Office of Compliance expressed confidence in that effort .
But Stupak said without immediately recognizing the names of the 12 companies still in the contaminated heparin supply chain , officials monitoring heparin at the border would be ineffective .
Meantime , the Hubley family , too , told lawmakers heparin was responsible for their losses .
Leroy Hubley , also from Toledo , lost both his wife , Bonnie , and his son , Randy , after they received heparin during dialysis for a genetic kidney disease .
Bonnie Hubley died in December 2007 and Randy died in January 2008 .
Both experienced symptoms associated with the contaminated heparin after receiving Baxter 's heparin .
Other members of the Hubley family continue to receive dialysis for their kidney disease .
" As a nurse , I thought that I would be there to save my husband from any errors , but I guess I was naïve , " Randy Hubley 's wife , Colleen Hubley , a dialysis nurse , told lawmakers .
" I never thought the lifesaving medication we were relying on might be contaminated . "
Last week , the same panel blasted FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach in regard to contaminated heparin at a hearing on the broader issue of the agency 's foreign drug- inspection program .
Though estimates suggest more than 80 percent of all active ingredients used by U.S. drug manufacturers come from abroad , the FDA only inspects foreign drug plants about once every 13 years , according to the Government Accountability Office .
The GAO finds that China 's drug plants are inspected once every 30 to 40 years .
The FDA plans to establish permanent overseas offices in numerous countries , including China , to help address the problem .
The House Energy and Commerce panel is considering ways to better ensure that food and drug imports are safe .
The panel is considering proposing that drug and drug device makers be required to register annually with the FDA .
The committee is also thinking of proposing that drug labels be required to include details about drugs ' country of origin , source of the ingredients and place of manufacture .
What is life like when all effective law enforcement breaks down ?
Hobbes had an answer : life is solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short .
And all empirical evidence suggests he was right .
When the police go on holiday , the nasties come out to play .
Hobbes then set himself the task of explaining why it is that life is n’t so nasty in the civilized state .
He said it ’s because there is One Big Bully to rule us all – the State – and calculated self interest tells us we ’re better off obeying and cooperating than either battling the Bully or reverting back to the dog - eat - dog state of nature .
Self interest is the key .
The Hobbesian view of human nature is pervasive .
Political scientists employ it when trying to ground the obligations of political citizenship , and behavioral scientists use it to try to explain a wide range of human behavior .
Asking “ Why is it rational for humans to do that ? ” is automatically understood by everyone to mean “ What ’s in it for them ? ”
What are we then to say about the wiki phenomenon ?
On Wikipedia there are over a hundred thousand contributors , and over five thousand editors , who have all volunteered to create history ’s largest encyclopedia , with ten million articles in over two hundred languages .
It gets used at least twenty thousand times each second .
And the users / editors are vigilant ; an MIT study found that “ an obscenity randomly inserted on Wikipedia is removed in an average of 1.7 minutes ” ( Tapscott & Williams , Wikinomics , p. 75 ) .
What ’s in it for these people ?
Tapscott and Williams suggest it is partly the geeky thrill of working on a task , and partly self - interest – since somebody might notice the fine work a wiki - person is doing and , I do n’t know , throw them a party or something .
The self - interest motivation sounds like a reach to me .
I think it must be 99 % geeky thrill .
It ’s fun to be part of an unimaginably massive epistemological project – Wikipedia is just Hegel ’s Encyclopedia in the flesh , so to speak ( topic for a future post ) – and to see your work made available to millions .
You could call this self - interest , but only in the sense that whatever we do on purpose is something we ’d like to see done .
More informatively , wiki work is motivated by a desire to see a project flourish .
It ’s done for the same reason kids work together on a really cool sand castle .
It ’s fun to build .
Call this the wiki motivation .
To what extent is the wiki motivation a component of human nature ?
My bet is that it is as much a component as the self - interest motivation .
Long , long before the computer , people were building , creating , and making just for the sake of doing it .
People have always liked creating stuff – along with all the other well - known projects like eating and sex and getting power .
And this is true even when the creating does n’t do anything more for the creator than it does for the “ free - riders ” who get to make use of it .
The wiki and the self - interest motivations apply at different junctures , though : when survival is at stake , count on self - interest to call the loudest ( but with interesting exceptions , note well ) .
Once survival is secured , then the wiki motivation speaks up ( though self - interest continues to growl ) .
But if this is true , then that means political science and behavioral sciences need to start complicating their models of human nature .
Economics , in particular , needs to start making models which incorporate the wiki motivation .
( Tapscott & Williams stop just short of this ; they try to sell “ wikinomics ” as a strategy any modern , self - interested person should take up . )
Indeed , the biggest innovations of the late 20th century – the internet , followed then by the web – are stellar examples of wiki motivation .
Their inventors could have acted in a much more self - interested way , to put it mildly .
And the creators of all the stuff web work requires ( XML , SOAP , FTP , etc ) mostly made what they did just for the sake of making a cool thing work .
The whole thing makes no sense whatsoever , from a self - interested standpoint .
Yet they did what they did , and here we are .
The whole open source movement is what happens when you let the wiki motivation go unbridled , and it is without question the lynch - pin holding the entire IT world together .
So Hobbes did n’t have all the answers .
He accurately described how nasty life can get when threatened , but could n’t account for why life gets as civilized as it does when safety is secured .
The nobility of human civilization consists in a transition from “ what ’s in it for me ? ” to “ Whoa , is n’t that cool ? ”
最近、「 Introduction to Information Retrieval」というStanfordの大学院向け教科書のドラフトを読んでいます。id:naoyaあたりが勉強会で読んでいる教科書です。この教科書には、効率のいい全文検索システムを作るにはどうすればいいか、という(まさに)教科書的手法が網羅的に書いてあり、そのあたりに興味がある人には、非常に興味深く読めるお勧めの本です。
ただ、面白い面白いと言っているだけでは、エンジニアとしては価値半減ですので、GW中にrubyで一日かけて実装してみました。
さすがに実装は、一日で作ったものですから、非常に素朴です。マルチバイト文字はbi-gramで、シングルバイトはスペースなどの区切り記号で認識しています。インデックスは、rubyの処理系のHashやArrayで保持しており、外部にMarshallで書き出す、というものです。検索エンジン自体はdrubyで外部から検索ができるようになっており、数百ぐらいの文書なら、それなりに動いています。
コードは以下に晒してますので、よかったら見てみてください。
http://github.com/stanaka/one-day-fulltext-search/
全文検索エンジンの肝となる、事前準備のIndexingと検索の二つを軽く解説します。二つの機能ともTokenizeというクラスに実装してみました。まず、Indexingは以下の二つのメソッド(だけ)で実装しています。マルチバイトだったら、bi-gramでtokenをどんどん切り出していき、シングルバイトだったら区切り文字でtokenを切り出しています。切り出したtokenをハッシュに突っ込んでいます。
def add_token ( token , docid , position ) @tokens [ token ] ||= Hash .new @tokens [ token ] [ docid ] ||= Array .new @tokens [ token ] [ docid ] .
push position end def tokenize ( str , docid ) last_char = nil sb_word = nil position = 0 str.each_char do | char | position += 1 if char.mbchar ? if sb_word add_token ( sb_word , docid , position ) ; sb_word = nil end add_token ( last_char + char , docid , position ) if last_char last_char = char else last_char = nil if char =~ /[ !@\# \$ \ % ^&* \( \ ) \[ \ ] \s \'\ " \;\ : \. \ , \/\\\| \~\>\< ]/ then if sb_word add_token ( sb_word , docid , position ) sb_word = nil end else sb_word = '' unless sb_word sb_word += char end end end end
検索は、search , recuresive_search , merge_resultsの三つのメソッドで実装しています。searchで検索を受けつけ、マルチバイトの文字だったら、bi-gramで分割し各tokenをrecursive_searchで再帰的に検索し、merge_resultsで各tokenが連続していることを確認しながら、結果のANDを取得しています。シングルバイトだったら、単純にハッシュで引いた中身をそのまま返しています。
def merge_results ( result_set , new_result , offset ) new_result_set =
Hash .new merged_keys = result_set.keys & new_result.keys merged_keys.each do | key | positions = result_set [ key ] & new_result [ key ] .map {| v | v - offset} if positions .
length > 0 new_result_set[key ] = positions end end return new_result_set end def recursive_search ( words , result_set = nil , offset = 0 ) word = words .
shift if @tokens [ word ] if result_set then result_set = merge_results ( result_set , @tokens [ word ] , offset ) else result_set = @tokens [ word ] end result_set = recursive_search ( words , result_set , offset + 1 ) if words .
length >
0 end return result_set end def search ( word ) results =
Array .new result_set = nil if word .
mbchar ? && word.
jlength > 2 then last_char = nil words =
Array .new word.each_char do | char | words .
push ( last_char + char ) if last_char last_char = char end result_set = recursive_search ( words ) else result_set = @tokens [ word ] end if result_set result_set .
each do | docid , positions | results .

作ってみたところ、(素朴な)全文検索エンジンを作るのは簡単で、教科書を読んだだけで作ることができます。ただ、ここから億単位の文書を読みこませても十分に早いスケールする全文検索エンジンを作るのは、当たり前ですが、相当に大変だと思います。でも、地道にやれば十分手の届くところにある、と感じます。
ともあれ、検索順位のアルゴリズムを考えるのは楽しいです。今回はブックマーク数とスター数と、記事の投稿時間をパラメータとして使ってみました。全文検索でヒットした記事に、それらの三つのパラメータから重み付けをして順位を決め、検索結果を出すというのは、非常に興味深いです。
検索順位については、普 段Google 「様」 がPageRankをベースとしたアルゴリズムで順位を決定しているものを見ているわけですが、はてなのデータを使えば、はてなブックマークやはてなスターによって日々蓄積されている、人為的なデータをベースとして順位を決定できます。実際、はてなダイアリーの記事を対象として、両者の検索結果を比較してみると、なかなか興味深いです。
検索エンジンを自前で持つ意味というのは、Google様の価値観とは異なる自分独自の価値観を持つことができ、かつ、それが有益な場合だと思います。実際、Googleの初期のころ他の検索エンジンを圧倒してきたのは、PageRankという価値観が圧倒的に支持されたからです。それに対抗できる価値観を持つことができたら、まだ新しい検索エンジンの存在価値が出てくると思います。
ちなみに、パラメータの重み付けを少し変える度に、検索結果順がころころ変わって、日々それに一喜一憂しているSEO業者の人は大変だなぁ、と思いました。「見ろ!SEO業者がゴミのようだ!」と思ったのは、ここだけの話です。
An Absolut vodka advertising campaign that ran in Mexico continued to generate intense reaction Saturday from Times readers and across the Internet .
By Saturday night , hundreds of comments had been posted on the La Plaza blog on latimes.com .
The ad was created by TeranTBWA agency and the vodka maker , which depicts what a map of North America might look like “ In an Absolut world . ”
The map shows the Mexican border extending , roughly , to its position in the 1800s before the Mexican - American War .

Back then , California was part of Mexican territory and was known as Alta California .
The area eventually became U.S. territory .
An item posted last week on La Plaza generated positive and negative responses .
Some readers were offended and said they planned to boycott Absolut , while others said they liked the ad and vowed to purchase the product .
Many weighed in on whether the ad was funny or stupid .
A company spokesman said the ad , which ran for about two months in Mexico and did not run in the United States , was never intended to be insulting to the U.S .
1780 : In the midst of the Revolutionary War , darkness descends on New England at midday .
Many people think Judgment Day is at hand .
It will be remembered as New England 's Dark Day .
Diaries of the preceding days mention smoky air and a red sun at morning and evening .
Around noon this day , an early darkness fell : Birds sang their evening songs , farm animals returned to their roosts and barns , and humans were bewildered .
Some went to church , many sought the solace of the tavern , and more than a few nearer the edges of the darkened area commented on the strange beauty of the preternatural half - light .
One person noted that clean silver had the color of brass .
It was darkest in northeastern Massachusetts , southern New Hampshire and southwestern Maine , but it got dusky through most of New England and as far away as New York .
At Morristown , New Jersey , Gen. George Washington noted it in his diary .
In the darkest area , people had to take their midday meals by candlelight .
A Massachusetts resident noted , " In some places , the darkness was so great that persons could not see to read common print in the open air . "
In New Hampshire , wrote one person , " A sheet of white paper held within a few inches of the eyes was equally invisible with the blackest velvet . "
At Hartford , Col. Abraham Davenport opposed adjourning the Connecticut legislature , thus : " The day of judgment is either approaching , or it is not .
If it is not , there is no cause of an adjournment ; if it is , I choose to be found doing my duty . "
When it was time for night to fall , the full moon failed to bring light .
Even areas that had seen a pale sun in the day could see no moon at all .
No moon , no stars :
It was the darkest night anyone had seen .
Some people could not sleep and waited through the long hours to see if the sun would ever rise again .
They witnessed its return the morning of May 20 .
Many observed the anniversary a year later as a day of fasting and prayer .
Professor Samuel Williams of Harvard gathered reports from throughout the affected areas to seek an explanation .
A town farther north had reported " a black scum like ashes " on rainwater collected in tubs .
A Boston observer noted the air smelled like a " malt - house or coal - kiln . "
Williams noted that rain in Cambridge fell " thick and dark and sooty " and tasted and smelled like the " black ash of burnt leaves . "
As if from a forest fire to the north ?
Without railroad or telegraph , people would not know :
No news could come sooner than delivered on horseback , assuming the wildfire was even near any European settlements in the vast wilderness .
But we know today that the darkness had moved southwest at about 25 mph .
And we know that forest fires in Canada in 1881 , 1950 and 2002 each cast a pall of smoke over the northeastern United States .
A definitive answer came in 2007 .
In the International Journal of Wildland Fire , Erin R. McMurry of the University of Missouri forestry department and co-authors combined written accounts with fire - scar evidence from Algonquin Provincial Park in eastern Ontario to document a massive wildfire in the spring of 1780 as the " likely source of the infamous Dark Day of 1780 . "

Yesterday I argued that the Powers Beyond Science are actually a standard and necessary part of the social process of science .
In particular , scientists must call upon their powers of individual rationality to decide what ideas to test , in advance of the sort of definite experiments that Science demands to bless an idea as confirmed .
The ideal of Science does not try to specify this process — we do n't suppose that any public authority knows how individual scientists should think — but this does n't mean the process is unimportant .
A readily understandable , non-disturbing example :
A scientist identifies a strong mathematical regularity in the cumulative data of previous experiments .
But the corresponding hypothesis has not yet made and confirmed a novel experimental prediction — which his academic field demands ; this is one of those fields where you can perform controlled experiments without too much trouble .
Thus the individual scientist has readily understandable , rational reasons to believe ( though not with probability 1 ) something not yet blessed by Science as public knowledge of humankind .
Noticing a regularity in a huge mass of experimental data , does n't seem all that unscientific .
You 're still data - driven , right ?
But that 's because I deliberately chose a non-disturbing example .
When Einstein invented General Relativity , he had almost no experimental data to go on , except the precession of Mercury 's perihelion .
And ( AFAIK ) Einstein did not use that data , except at the end .
Einstein generated the theory of Special Relativity using Mach's Principle , which is the physicist 's version of the Generalized Anti-Zombie Principle .
You begin by saying , " It does n't seem reasonable to me that you could tell , in an enclosed room , how fast you and the room were going .
Since this number should n't ought to be observable , it should n't ought to exist in any meaningful sense . "
You then observe that Maxwell 's Equations invoke a seemingly absolute speed of propagation , c , commonly referred to as " the speed of light " ( though the quantum equations show it is the propagation speed of all fundamental waves ) .
So you reformulate your physics in such fashion that the absolute speed of a single object no longer meaningfully exists , and only relative speeds exist .
I am skipping over quite a bit here , obviously , but there are many excellent introductions to relativity — it is not like the horrible situation in quantum physics .
Einstein , having successfully done away with the notion of your absolute speed inside an enclosed room , then set out to do away with the notion of your absolute acceleration inside an enclosed room .
It seemed to Einstein that there should n't ought to be a way to differentiate , in an enclosed room , between the room accelerating northward while the rest of the universe stayed still , versus the rest of the universe accelerating southward while the room stayed still .
If the rest of the universe accelerated , it would produce gravitational waves that would accelerate you .
Moving matter , then , should produce gravitational waves .
And because inertial mass and gravitational mass were always exactly equivalent — unlike the situation in electromagnetics , where an electron and a muon can have different masses but the same electrical charge — gravity should reveal itself as a kind of inertia .
The Earth should go around the Sun in some equivalent of a " straight line " .
This requires spacetime in the vicinity of the Sun to be curved , so that if you drew a graph of the Earth 's orbit around the Sun , the line on the 4D graph paper would be locally flat .
Then inertial and gravitational mass would be necessarily equivalent , not just coincidentally equivalent .
( If that did not make any sense to you , there are good introductions to General Relativity available as well . )
And of course the new theory had to obey Special Relativity , and conserve energy , and conserve momentum , etcetera .
Einstein spent several years grasping the necessary mathematics to describe curved metrics of spacetime .
Then he wrote down the simplest theory that had the properties Einstein thought it ought to have — including properties no one had ever observed , but that Einstein thought fit in well with the character of other physical laws .
Then Einstein cranked a bit , and got the previously unexplained precession of Mercury right back out .
How impressive was this ?
Well , let 's put it this way .
In some small fraction of alternate Earths proceeding from 1800 — perhaps even a sizeable fraction — it would seem plausible that relativistic physics could have proceeded in a similar fashion to our own great fiasco with quantum physics .
We can imagine that Lorentz 's original " interpretation " of the Lorentz contraction , as a physical distortion caused by movement with respect to the ether , prevailed .
We can imagine that various corrective factors , themselves unexplained , were added on to Newtonian gravitational mechanics to explain the precession of Mercury — attributed , perhaps , to strange distortions of the ether , as in the Lorentz contraction .
Through the decades , further corrective factors would be added on to account for other astronomical observations .
Sufficiently precise atomic clocks , in airplanes , would reveal that time ran a little faster than expected at higher altitudes ( time runs slower in more intense gravitational fields , but they would n't know that ) and more corrective " ethereal factors " would be invented .
Until , finally , the many different empirically determined " corrective factors " were unified into the simple equations of General Relativity .
And the people in that alternate Earth would say , " The final equation was simple , but there was no way you could possibly know to arrive at that answer from just the perihelion precession of Mercury .
It takes many , many additional experiments .
You must have measured time running slower in a stronger gravitational field ; you must have measured light bending around stars .
Only then can you imagine our unified theory of ethereal gravitation .
No , not even a perfect Bayesian superintelligence could know it !— for there would be many ad - hoc theories consistent with the perihelion precession alone . "
In our world , Einstein did n't even use the perihelion precession of Mercury , except for verification of his answer produced by other means .
Einstein sat down in his armchair , and thought about how he would have designed the universe , to look the way he thought a universe should look — for example , that you should n't ought to be able to distinguish yourself accelerating in one direction , from the rest of the universe accelerating in the other direction .
And Einstein executed the whole long ( multi - year ! ) chain of armchair reasoning , without making any mistakes that would have required further experimental evidence to pull him back on track .
Even Jeffreyssai would be grudgingly impressed .
Though he would still ding Einstein a point or two for the cosmological constant .
( I do n't ding Einstein for the cosmological constant because it later turned out to be real .
I try to avoid criticizing people on occasions where they are right . )
What would be the probability - theoretic perspective on Einstein 's feat ?
Rather than observe the planets , and infer what laws might cover their gravitation , Einstein was observing the other laws of physics , and inferring what new law might follow the same pattern .
Einstein was n't finding an equation that covered the motion of gravitational bodies .
Einstein was finding a character - of - physical - law that covered previously observed equations , and that he could crank to predict the next equation that would be observed .
Nobody knows where the laws of physics come from , but Einstein 's success with General Relativity shows that their common character is strong enough to predict the correct form of one law from having observed other laws , without necessarily needing to observe the precise effects of the law .
( In a general sense , of course , Einstein did know by observation that things fell down ; but he did not get GR by backward inference from Mercury 's exact perihelion advance . )
So , from a Bayesian perspective , what Einstein did is still induction , and still covered by the notion of a simple prior ( Occam prior ) that gets updated by new evidence .
It 's just the prior was over the possible characters of physical law , and observing other physical laws let Einstein update his model of the character of physical law , which he then used to predict a particular law of gravitation .
If you did n't have the concept of a " character of physical law " , what Einstein did would look like magic — plucking the correct model of gravitation out of the space of all possible equations , with vastly insufficient evidence .
But Einstein , by looking at other laws , cut down the space of possibilities for the next law .
He learned the alphabet in which physics was written , constraints to govern his answer .
Not magic , but reasoning on a higher level , across a wider domain , than what a naive reasoner might conceive to be the " model space " of only this one law .
So from a probability - theoretic standpoint , Einstein was still data - driven — he just used the data he already had , more effectively .
Compared to any alternate Earths that demanded huge quantities of additional data from astronomical observations and clocks on airplanes to hit them over the head with General Relativity .
There are numerous lessons we can derive from this .
I use Einstein as my example , even though it 's cliche , because Einstein was also unusual in that he openly admitted to knowing things that Science had n't confirmed .
Asked what he would have done if Eddington 's solar eclipse observation had failed to confirm General Relativity , Einstein replied : " Then I would feel sorry for the good Lord .
The theory is correct . "
According to prevailing notions of Science , this is arrogance — you must accept the verdict of experiment , and not cling to your personal ideas .
But as I concluded in Einstein 's Arrogance , Einstein does n't come off nearly as badly from a Bayesian perspective .
From a Bayesian perspective , in order to suggest General Relativity at all , in order to even think about what turned out to be the correct answer , Einstein must have had enough evidence to identify the true answer in the theory - space .
It would take only a little more evidence to justify ( in a Bayesian sense ) being nearly certain of the theory .
And it was unlikely that Einstein only had exactly enough evidence to bring the hypothesis all the way up to his attention .
Any accusation of arrogance would have to center around the question , " But Einstein , how did you know you had reasoned correctly ? " — to which I can only say :
Do not criticize people when they turn out to be right !
Wait for an occasion where they are wrong !
Otherwise you are missing the chance to see when someone is thinking smarter than you — for you criticize them whenever they depart from a preferred ritual of cognition .
Or consider the famous exchange between Einstein and Niels Bohr on quantum theory — at a time when the then - current , single - world quantum theory seemed to be immensely well - confirmed experimentally ; a time when , by the standards of Science , the current ( deranged ) quantum theory had simply won .
Einstein : " God does not play dice with the universe . "
Bohr : " Einstein , do n't tell God what to do . "
You 've got to admire someone who can get into an argument with God and win .
If you take off your Bayesian goggles , and look at Einstein in terms of what he actually did all day , then the guy was sitting around studying math and thinking about how he would design the universe , rather than running out and looking at things to gather more data .
What Einstein did , successfully , is exactly the sort of high - minded feat of sheer intellect that Aristotle thought he could do , but could n't .
Not from a probability - theoretic stance , mind you , but from the viewpoint of what they did all day long .
Science does not trust scientists to do this , which is why General Relativity was not blessed as the public knowledge of humanity until after it had made and verified a novel experimental prediction — having to do with the bending of light in a solar eclipse .
( It later turned out that particular measurement was not precise enough to verify reliably , and had favored GR essentially by luck . )
However , just because Science does not trust scientists to do something , does not mean it is impossible .
But a word of caution here :
The reason why history books sometimes record the names of scientists who thought great high - minded thoughts , is not that high - minded thinking is easier , or more reliable .
It is a priority bias :
Some scientist who successfully reasoned from the smallest amount of experimental evidence got to the truth first .
This can not be a matter of pure random chance :
The theory space is too large , and Einstein won several times in a row .
But out of all the scientists who tried to unravel a puzzle , or who would have eventually succeeded given enough evidence , history passes down to us the names of the scientists who successfully got there first .
Bear that in mind , when you are trying to derive lessons about how to reason prudently .
In everyday life , you want every scrap of evidence you can get .
Do not rely on being able to successfully think high - minded thoughts unless experimentation is so costly or dangerous that you have no other choice .
But sometimes experiments are costly , and sometimes we prefer to get there first ... so you might consider trying to train yourself in reasoning on scanty evidence , preferably in cases where you will later find out if you were right or wrong .
Trying to beat low - capitalization prediction markets might make for good training in this ?— though that is only speculation .
As of now , at least , reasoning based on scanty evidence is something that modern - day science cannot reliably train modern - day scientists to do at all .
Which may perhaps have something to do with , oh , I do n't know , not even trying ?
Actually , I take that back .
The most sane thinking I have seen in any scientific field comes from the field of evolutionary psychology , possibly because they understand self - deception , but also perhaps because they often ( 1 ) have to reason from scanty evidence and ( 2 ) do later find out if they were right or wrong .
I recommend to all aspiring rationalists that they study evolutionary psychology simply to get a glimpse of what careful reasoning looks like .
See particularly Tooby and Cosmides 's " The Psychological Foundations of Culture " .
As for the possibility that only Einstein could do what Einstein did ... that it took superpowers beyond the reach of ordinary mortals ... here we run into some biases that would take a separate post to analyze .
Let me put it this way :
It is possible , perhaps , that only a genius could have done Einstein 's actual historical work .
But potential geniuses , in terms of raw intelligence , are probably far more common than historical superachievers .
To put a random number on it , I doubt that anything more than one - in - a - million g- factor is required to be a potential world - class genius , implying at least six thousand potential Einsteins running around today .
And as for everyone else , I see no reason why they should not aspire to use efficiently the evidence that they have .
But my final moral is that the frontier where the individual scientist rationally knows something that Science has not yet confirmed , is not always some innocently data - driven matter of spotting a strong regularity in a mountain of experiments .
Sometimes the scientist gets there by thinking great high - minded thoughts that Science does not trust you to think .
I will not say , " Do n't try this at home . "
I will say , " Do n't think this is easy . "
We are not discussing , here , the victory of casual opinions over professional scientists .
We are discussing the sometime historical victories of one kind of professional effort over another .
Never forget all the famous historical cases where attempted armchair reasoning lost .

Despite the dramatic expansion of viewing and listening options for consumers today , traditional radio remains one of the most widely used media formats in America .
Arbitron , the national radio ratings company , reports that more than 90 percent of Americans ages 12 or older listen to radio each week , “ a higher penetration than television , magazines , newspapers , or the Internet . ”
Although listening hours have declined slightly in recent years , Americans listened on average to 19 hours of radio per week in 2006 .
Among radio formats , the combined news / talk format ( which includes news / talk / information and talk / personality ) leads all others in terms of the total number of stations per format and trails only country music in terms of national audience share .
Through more than 1,700 stations across the nation , the combined news / talk format is estimated to reach more than 50 million listeners each week .
As this report will document in detail , conservative talk radio undeniably dominates the format :
Our analysis in the spring of 2007 of the 257 news / talk stations owned by the top five commercial station owners reveals that 91 percent of the total weekday talk radio programming is conservative , and 9 percent is progressive .
Each weekday , 2,570 hours and 15 minutes of conservative talk are broadcast on these stations compared to 254 hours of progressive talk — 10 times as much conservative talk as progressive talk .
A separate analysis of all of the news / talk stations in the top 10 radio markets reveals that 76 percent of the programming in these markets is conservative and 24 percent is progressive , although programming is more balanced in markets such as New York and Chicago .
This dynamic is repeated over and over again no matter how the data is analyzed , whether one looks at the number of stations , number of hours , power of stations , or the number of programs .
While progressive talk is making inroads on commercial stations , conservative talk continues to be pushed out over the airwaves in greater multiples of hours than progressive talk is broadcast .
These empirical findings may not be surprising given general impressions about the format , but they are stark and raise serious questions about whether the companies licensed to broadcast over the public airwaves are serving the listening needs of all Americans .
There are many potential explanations for why this gap exists .
The two most frequently cited reasons are the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 and simple consumer demand .
As this report will detail , neither of these reasons adequately explains why conservative talk radio dominates the airwaves .
Our conclusion is that the gap between conservative and progressive talk radio is the result of multiple structural problems in the U.S. regulatory system , particularly the complete breakdown of the public trustee concept of broadcast , the elimination of clear public interest requirements for broadcasting , and the relaxation of ownership rules including the requirement of local participation in management .
Ownership diversity is perhaps the single most important variable contributing to the structural imbalance based on the data .
Quantitative analysis conducted by Free Press of all 10,506 licensed commercial radio stations reveals that stations owned by women , minorities , or local owners are statistically less likely to air conservative hosts or shows .
In contrast , stations controlled by group owners — those with stations in multiple markets or more than three stations in a single market — were statistically more likely to air conservative talk .
Furthermore , markets that aired both conservative and progressive programming were statistically less concentrated than the markets that aired only one type of programming and were more likely to be the markets that had female - and minority - owned stations .
The disparities between conservative and progressive programming reflect the absence of localism in American radio markets .
This shortfall results from the consolidation of ownership in radio stations and the corresponding dominance of syndicated programming operating in economies of scale that do not match the local needs of all communities .
This analysis suggests that any effort to encourage more responsive and balanced radio programming will first require steps to increase localism and diversify radio station ownership to better meet local and community needs .
We suggest three ways to accomplish this :
Restore local and national caps on the ownership of commercial radio stations .
Ensure greater local accountability over radio licensing .
Require commercial owners who fail to abide by enforceable public interest obligations to pay a fee to support public broadcasting .
In the pages that follow , we believe our analysis of the talk radio marketplace merits serious consideration of the remedies we then present .

crazy things from my depth using the language of the ordinary ones like you and me
It seems that plans are in the works for a slimmed down , condensed version of the German Wikipedia to be made into a printed encyclopedia book and it will be sold in bookstores for 20 Euros ( $ 32 ) .
As many people have said , it ’s “ reverse publishing ” .
I say it ’s a bit of a scam on the part of the German publisher Bertelsmann .
I am a nitty - gritty practical kind of guy and my initial thought was this : if Wikipedia is made up of voluntary user contributions , does Wikipedia first of all have legal permission from the writers to print the material ?
Did they get legal waivers from each contributor saying it was fine to use their work ?
If so , is Bertelsmann allowed to make any money from it ( seeing that the contributions were voluntary ) ?
If so , should n’t some of that money make its way back to the writers who wrote the articles in the first place ?
I mean , every writer is entitled to a royalty .
By denying the writer their royalty , Wikipedia is ripping them off big - time .
No , in fact , let ’s not beat around the bush here .
Let ’s say it for what it really is .
Wikipedia is SHAFTING THEM .
The whole point of Wikipedia is to provide a voluntary online source of information .
That is why people voluntarily gave up some of their time to write the articles for free in the first place .
It is a noble project , the writer believed in the project and so they participated in it .
Had they known that Wikipedia would then use their work in a commercial printed venture , I ’m sure they would have had second thoughts about writing those articles .
At the very least they would have demanded a contract and perhaps a guarantee of financial compensation later .
It really is a damn cheek to be honest .
The writers are asked to write articles under the guise of voluntary acts of kindness , they are not credited in any way and then later on , Wikipedia decides to publish that work , charge 20 Euros a pop and pockets all the money !
Wikipedia has told the media : “ It is not about the money .
It is a very good example of the power of free knowledge ” .
If the money really does n’t matter , then why is the book so expensive ?
Why not give it away ?

Day of violence in Johannesburg suburb
In pictures
South Africa 's President Thabo Mbeki has approved the deployment of the army to quell violence against foreigners .
The announcement from his office came after xenophobic attacks spread outside Johannesburg to the city of Durban .
It is the first time troops are being ordered out onto the streets to quell unrest since the end of apartheid .
The violence , which began last week , has left more than 20 people dead and is estimated to have driven 30,000 people from their homes .
The Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation says many of the people were sheltering in mosques and churches around Johannesburg .
There are believed to be between three and five million foreigners living in South Africa , most of them Zimbabweans fleeing poverty and violence at home .
SOUTH AFRICA Foreign population : 3 - 5 m Majority from Zimbabwe , also Mozambique , Nigeria Total population : 49 m Unemployment rate : 30 %
Tensions erupt in city of promise Bloggers want end to violence The Durban attack prompted about 700 African migrants to seek refuge in a nearby church while in Cape Town a safety forum has been set up to try to prevent violence .
Police say a group armed with sticks and bottles attacked Nigerians drinking in a tavern overnight .
In Johannesburg , police fired rubber bullets to disperse mobs in one area on Tuesday .
' Political '
There are fears that politicians are exploiting the situation in Durban .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement " A mob of plus / minus 200 were gathering on the streets carrying bottles and knobkerries ( wooden clubs ) busy attacking people on the streets , " Provincial police spokeswoman Superintendent Phindile Radebe told AFP news agency .
" They attacked one of the taverns there believed to be owned by Nigerians , " she said .
KwaZulu - Natal 's Community Safety Minister Bheki Cele blamed Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party members for being behind the Durban violence .
" These are purely criminal activities and they will be dealt with decisively in ensuring that xenophobic attacks are not used as scapegoats for criminals who want to serve their own selfish interests , " he said in a statement .
The attacks on foreigners began a week ago in the township of Alexandra , north of Johannesburg , before spreading to the city centre and across the Gauteng region .
Mobs have been roaming townships looking for foreigners , many of whom have sought refuge in police stations , churches and community halls .
Some South Africans say foreigners are taking jobs from locals and contributing to crime .
Earlier , President Mbeki urged South Africans to welcome foreigners .

Hey — you know how photos from your phone are really crappy ?
Well , that ’s because it ’s a phone .
Sorry , you knew that anyway , but apparently Greenhouse Japan did n’t , so they went ahead and built a jumbo zoom lens just for cell phones .
The 8,800 - yen GH - ML8 is available online and comes with a mini tripod that holds the whole Heath Robinson - esque contraption together when you stick the lens in front of the tiny aperture of your phone ’s camera .
There ’s even a focusing ring on the barrel of the lens allowing you to get loads more tightly focused , washed out , blurry snaps .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - China and Russia have faced repeated U.S. sanctions for their arms sales , but a largely unheralded player in what Washington considers the troubling proliferation game is Israel , one of the closest U.S. allies .
The Jewish state , recipient annually of $ 3 billion in U.S. aid , is second only to Russia as a weapons provider to China , U.S. congressional investigators say .
Some experts fear sensitive U.S. technology may show up via Israel in systems sold by China to Iran and North Korea , which President Bush termed " axis of evil " states after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
" Israel ranks second only to Russia as a weapons system provider to China and as a conduit for sophisticated military technology , followed by France and Germany , " according to a recent report by the U.S. - China Security Review Commission , a panel established by Congress to examine security and economic relations between the two countries .
" Recent upgrades in target acquisition and fire control , probably provided by Israeli weapons specialists , have enhanced the capabilities of the older guided missile destroyers and frigates " in the Chinese navy 's inventory , it said .
The commission , which holds hard - line views on China , cited Israel as a supplier to Beijing of radar systems , optical and telecommunications equipment , drones and flight simulators .
" Israel has established itself as an important exporter of high - technology niche weapons containing more sophisticated technology than what is provided by Russia , " it said .
WORRYING RELATIONSHIP
" Among the people who are aware of this ( Israel - China ) trade , there is a consensus that this is not a healthy relationship , " commission chairman Richard D'Amato told Reuters .
" There is a growing consensus that transfers of these technologies is worrisome given the balance of power in the Taiwan Straits , " he said .
D'Amato referred to the fact that Israel - China cooperation persists even as Washington has sold increasingly sophisticated weapons to Taiwan as a defense against China .
Beijing considers the island a renegade and has pledged to use force , if needed , to achieve eventual reunification .
This creates an ironic possibility :
In the event of war , China , with weapons supplied or enhanced by Israel that may have been supplied or enhanced by the United States , would face Taiwan , armed with U.S. - made jets and other military hardware .
In November 2000 , China promised not to assist any country in developing ballistic missiles that could be used to deliver nuclear weapons and to enact strict export - control rules .
But Beijing only just now published the export rules and in the interim , the CIA said Chinese firms provided dual - use missile - related items , raw materials , and / or assistance to several countries of proliferation concern , including Iran , North Korea , and Libya .
Two senior U.S. officials told Reuters there has been little attention given to China - Israel arms ties since Bush took office .
Issues that could draw criticism of Israel are sensitive in America , where pro-Israel interests wield considerable clout .
" It is a concern when anybody sells the Chinese advanced systems -- and the Israeli systems are very advanced -- that we might , at one point , find ourselves opposite those systems in the hands of the Chinese , " said one senior U.S. official .
But , he added , " I 'd be more concerned about it if there was more evidence of ( recent ) activity " between Israel and China .
The Washington Times in July said U.S. intelligence identified an Israeli - made anti-radar weapon , the unmanned " Harpy " drone , deployed with Chinese forces opposite Taiwan .
A U.S. government source confirmed to Reuters that Israel provided the weapon to China .
He called the transfer " astounding " because it is a key weapon that , in China 's hands , could impair the effectiveness of U.S. Aegis cruisers .
China , a rising economic and military power , has embarked on a major military modernization and some U.S. officials and analysts view Beijing as a serious potential threat .
BUT DOUBTS PERSIST Despite the U.S. - China Security Review Commission 's concerns , some analysts doubt Israel made any significant recent transfers to China .
Two years ago , under U.S. pressure , Israel suspended the sale to Beijing of four $ 250 million - a- copy advanced early warning Phalcon aircraft , similar to U.S. AWACS planes .
The proposed deal alarmed the Pentagon and infuriated some members of Congress , who threatened to cut U.S. military aid to Israel if the lucrative deal went through .
U.S. officials and other knowledgeable sources say Israel was stunned at the vehement U.S. reaction and this made Israel even more cautious about future deals with China .
The proposed Phalcon deal " involved indigenous Israeli technology and would have provided lots of jobs for our defense industries , " an Israeli official told Reuters .
But it was canceled " because Israel has an understanding with the United States that we will not act in a way that will endanger U.S. national security interests , " he said .
" I think Phalcon was a watershed .
It showed the level of our commitment " to the United States , said the Israeli official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Added a senior U.S. official , " Before the Israelis get in another situation where they are crosswise with us , they 'll think twice about it -- the last flap still reverberates . "
But D'Amato disagreed .
" We still think they are involved in this in a serious way , " including high - tech intelligence exchanges and a sharing of missile technology .
Israel began an arms relationship with China in the Cold War with U.S. backing as a means of balancing off the Soviet Union .
But the ties have increasingly troubled Washington .
Six years ago , U.S. government reports accused Israel of illegally transferring U.S. technology from the largely U.S. - funded Lavi fighter plane program to China .
China 's new F - 10 fighter jet is said to be nearly identical to the Lavi .
Analysts said that in addition to reaping profits and lowering defense production costs , Israel believes arms sales to China raises its influence with Beijing and gains it vital intelligence about its enemies , with whom China does business .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Celebrity British chef Gordon Ramsay said restaurants should be fined if they serve out - of - season fruit and vegetables .
“ I do n’t want to see asparagus in the middle of December .
I do n’t want to see strawberries from Kenya in the middle of March .
I want to see it home - grown , ” he said after raising his concerns with Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
“ Fruit and veg should be seasonal .
Chefs should be fined if they do n’t have ingredients in season on their menu , ” he told the BBC on Friday .
Ramsay , whose London restaurants include Petrus and The Savoy Grill , said Britain had become a nation of lazy eaters who followed trends and fads rather than substance .
“ There should be stringent laws , licensing laws , to make sure produce is only used in season and season only , ” he added .
Domestic violence is typically thought of as something that happens only to women , but men suffer it too , a new survey suggests .
The telephone survey of more than 400 adult male Group Health patients found 29 percent had been victims of domestic violence during their lives .
The researchers defined domestic violence to include slapping , hitting , kicking or forced sex as well as nonphysical abuse — threats , chronic disparaging remarks or controlling behavior .
" Domestic violence in men is understudied and often hidden — much as it was in women 10 years ago , " said study leader Dr. Robert J. Reid , associate investigator at the Group Health Center for Health Studies in Seattle .
" We want abused men to know they 're not alone . "
Other previous studies support the new research and have found that men often can be reluctant to strike back in self defense and are unlikely to report the abuse .
Some famous cases — such as an NFL wife stabbing her husband in 2006 during an argument — have brought the issue to the attention of police and researchers in recent years .
The new survey found younger men were twice as likely as men age 55 or older to report recent abuse .
" That may be because older men are even more reluctant to talk about it , " Reid said .
The survey results , detailed in the June issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine , are said to debunk five myths :
Myth 1 : Few men experience domestic violence .
In fact , many do , the in - depth phone interviews suggests .
Five percent said they had experienced domestic violence in the past year and 29 percent said it had happened to them at some point in their lives .
Myth 2 : Abuse of men has no serious effects .
The researchers instead found domestic violence is associated with serious , long - term effects on men 's mental health .
Women are more likely than men to experience more severe physical abuse , Reid said , " but even nonphysical abuse can do lasting damage . "
Symptoms of depression were nearly three times as common in older men who had experienced abuse than in those who had n't , with much more severe depression in the men who had been abused physically .
Myth 3 : Abused men do n't stay , because they 're free to leave .
In fact , men may stay for years with their abusive partners .
" We know that many women may have trouble leaving abusive relationships , especially if they 're caring for young children and not working outside the home , " Reid said .
" We were surprised to find that most men in abusive relationships also stay , through multiple episodes , for years . "
Myth 4 : Domestic violence affects only poor people .
The study actually showed it to be an equal - opportunity scourge .
" As we found in our previous research with women experiencing domestic violence , this is a common problem affecting people in all walks of life , " Reid said .
" Our patients at Group Health have health insurance and easy access to health care , and their employment rate and average income , education level , and age are higher than those of the rest of the U.S. population . "
Myth 5 : Ignoring it will make it go away .
Not so , the survey suggests .
" We doctors hardly ever ask our male patients about being abused — and they seldom tell us , " Reid said .
" Many abused men feel ashamed because of societal expectations for men to be tough and in control . "
Group Health is a Seattle - based nonprofit health care system that coordinates care and coverage and researches various major health problems .
The group has done several studies that document domestic violence on women .
" We do not want to downplay the seriousness of domestic violence as experienced by women , " Reid said .
The new research was funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as well as Group Health .
The National Domestic Violence Hotline , open to women and men , is 1-800- 799 - SAFE ( 7233 ) .
Bloomberg slams Clinton , McCain gas tax plan Associated Press
Published : Thursday May 1 , 2008
|
Print This Email This NEW YORK  Mayor Michael Bloomberg called a summer - long suspension of the gas tax favored by Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican John McCain a dumb idea .
The New York mayor , who flirted with the idea of an independent presidential bid , praised Democrat Barack Obama for opposing the plan to suspend the 18.4 cent federal gas tax and 24.2 cent diesel tax during the peak driving months of the summer .
All three candidates covet Bloomberg 's endorsement .
The mayor has spoken highly of Obama and McCain in introducing the two at recent events in New York .
Speaking to reporters at City Hall , Bloomberg said of the gas tax holiday , " It 's about the dumbest thing I 've heard in an awful long time , from an economic point of view .
We 're trying to discourage people from driving and we 're trying to end our energy dependence ... and we 're trying to have more money to build infrastructure . "
He cited those three reasons for opposing the gas tax holiday favored by McCain and Clinton .
Obama has said the savings would not be significant for the average individual , and Bloomberg agreed .
" The 30 bucks is not going to change anybody 's lifestyle , " he said .
" The billions of dollars that we would otherwise have in tax revenues can make a big difference as to what kind of a world we leave our children . "
The billionaire mayor said in February that he had decided not to run for president but has dangled the possibility of his endorsement .
The Democrat - turned - Republican - turned - independent has ties to all three candidates .
A new library in Casanera , Colombia shows us what humankind might have built with sticks and stones if they 'd never discovered bricks , steel , and electricity .
The Villanueva Public Library was built on a modest budget , designed by a bunch of university students in Bogota .
And instead of importing fancy , expensive materials , builders used local timber and stones from nearby rivers to lower transportation costs .
Then , instead of hiring experienced construction workers , they trained local people to build it .

The building consists of 32,000 square feet including a reading room , an auditorium , a children 's library , offices , and open space for hanging out .

The patients at Louisa Guidotti hospital said there were eight men , one carrying a shotgun , another with an AK - 47 , others with pistols , and they went from bed to bed forcing out anyone who could walk .
Nurses were dragged away from the sick .
Motorists driving by the hospital , 87 miles north - east of Harare , were stopped and taken from their cars .
About 70 people were gathered in the grounds .
Then the lecture began .
" This is your last chance , " said one of the armed men .
" You messed up when you voted .
Next time you vote you must get it right or you will die . "
One of the men selected people to stand and shout slogans of Zimbabwe 's ruling Zanu - PF party and to sing songs from the liberation war .
Those who did not do so enthusiastically were beaten .
Another cocked his gun and told the crowd to point out opposition supporters .
Sandati Kuratidzi lives on the hospital grounds because his wife is a physiotherapist there .
He is an activist with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change which stunned Zanu - PF by apparently defeating Robert Mugabe in the presidential election , although the electoral commission has still to release the official result 12 days later .
When Kuratidzi saw the pick - up with the armed men draw up , he knew what was coming and hid on top of a cupboard .
" They warned people that if they voted for the opposition they would be killed .
They had AK - 47s , shotguns , guns in their belts .
People were very afraid , " he said .
" They were saying they were going to show an example to anyone supporting MDC and they asked the people to point out who they were but no one did .
Their behaviour was inhuman . "
Then the men piled back into their truck and set off for the next village .
Mugabe has unleashed his shock troops , Zanu - PF 's militias and those who call themselves liberation war veterans even though most are too young to have fought it , in an undeclared campaign of terror against rural voters in advance of an expected second round of presidential elections .
The violence and intimidation that helped deliver perverted election victories to Zanu - PF three and six years ago were absent from the presidential and parliamentary ballot on March 29 , and Mugabe lost .
Now they are returning with a vengeance and the ruling party is using results from the first round as a guide to where to exert pressure .
Across provinces such as Mashonaland , Manicaland and Matabeleland , where the opposition campaigned freely for the first time and made strong inroads into Zanu - PF 's support , armed gangs move from village to village , forcing people to meetings and threatening dire consequences if the vote goes against Mugabe again .
Opposition supporters are identified and beaten or driven from their homes .
The MDC said Mugabe , who during the election campaign said he regarded it as a war , was delaying the release of the presidential ballot in order to wage his terror campaign before a run-off is formally declared and foreign monitors return .
The opposition said it feared the threats were working .
The intimidation is following a pattern seen in earlier elections .
It began with assaults on scores of white - owned farms at the weekend .
War veterans drove white families from their land as Mugabe once again sought to characterise the election as a struggle against British imperialism .
But the assault on the white farmers is a cover for a broader campaign against black voters .
The MDC has made public a document it said was from a disaffected senior military officer listing the deployment of 200 army officers to coordinate the strategy on the ground .
Louisa Guidotti hospital is in Mutoko East constituency in Mashonaland East , once a Mugabe stronghold where Abel Samakande was the MDC 's parliamentary candidate .
Samakande lost but made strong inroads into traditional Zanu - PF territory , picking up about 42 % of the vote .
Now that achievement is coming back to haunt those who supported him .
He said the first indication he had of the return of the terror tactics was when he was tipped off by friends in Zanu - PF that he was being hunted .
" They told us there was a meeting at which it was decided to eliminate one of the local MDC leaders .
Our friends in Zanu - PF warned us not to sleep in our houses , to move in groups , " he said .
Then he had a call telling him that armed men had descended on the village of Matsande .
" When we heard about these armed men we went to the police for assistance .
The officer in charge said he could not help , " said Samakande .
The MDC candidate headed to Matsande , but by the time he reached it , the men with guns had done their work and moved on to the hospital and then the village of Mushimbo .
" On the way they got to a township where they forced all the shops to close and forced everybody to a meeting , " he said .
" When I got home I was told by my wife there were men who came to the place .
She kept the door locked and they left .
We decided not to sleep there for fear of our lives . "
Yesterday , other armed men backed by Zanu - PF activists went to Mutoko and forced people to a meeting .
A man in the crowd identified two MDC supporters .
They were marched to the front and beaten so badly that they were left with broken bones .
The group then went to the houses of known MDC supporters and chased them from the town .
It is a pattern repeated across Mashonaland in the north to parts of Matabeleland in the south , where about 60 families were expelled from their homes in Insiza yesterday after Zanu - PF identified them as having voted for the MDC from the election count for their local polling station .
In Gweru , opposition supporters have been attacked by soldiers , according to the Zimbabwe Peace Project .
" Soldiers descended on unsuspecting revellers in bars and late night shoppers , beating them up .
The soldiers were allegedly saying the people 's crime among other things was that they did not vote correctly , " said the ZPP .
In Mutare , gangs armed with whips and knives have been going house to house in search of MDC supporters .
In Manicaland , at least one activist has been killed .
In Chimanimani East , opposition supporters have been burned from their homes .
Milton Kanomakuyo , the MDC parliamentary candidate for Mudzi South in Mashonaland , was taking his nine - year - old daughter to hospital on Tuesday when he was stopped by a friend .
" He told me he saw Zanu - PF milling around , stopping people , hunting for known MDC activists , " Kanomakuyo said .
" In the evening a guy who works for the ministry of education who was an election officer in Mudzi South came to my shop and told me about these people : eight war vets with AK - 47s in Mazda pick - up trucks . "
The armed men had already visited Kotwa .
" They ordered people out of buses , out of shops , gathered them together , " he added .
" One of the men was cocking a rifle to scare people .
They told the people they 'd messed up by voting MDC and they were n't going to let people make that mistake again .
They said they would n't entertain even one opposition vote .
They told people to shout slogans and those who could n't do it were slapped .
" When they were campaigning , they were telling people over and over again that if Zanu - PF loses there will be a war .
Now they are reminding them . "
Samakande said the threats to kill opponents showed the MDC as powerless and would cost its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , in a second round election .
" When they give you a warning people take it seriously .
If we are going to have a run - off we will not win and it's going to be bloody because they know in a free and fair environment they will not win . "
Kanomakuyo agreed : " A friend in the police said to me that if we go for the run - off the villagers will be afraid to vote for the MDC .
I think they will be .
I 'm sure they are going to do this for quite some time .
By the time the results come out people will be terrified .
It 's going to be difficult to stop this .
If we try to do mass action definitely it will be crushed . "
Watching Supreme Master TV turns him into a pure vegan and rewards him with inner change
Hallo , Supreme Master TV , I would like to share a joyful story with everyone .
There was one time I went out for dinner .
I met a loyal audience member of Supreme Master TV and chatted with him .
He said that last year when he was surfing the Internet , he accidentally discovered Supreme Master TV .
With curiosity , he entered the website and saw Master .
He felt that Master was amazing ( he said he felt something … ) .
Since then , for more than one year , every time when watching the shows , he would have different ideas and rewards .
Since the first time he watched Supreme Master TV , he naturally turned to a pure vegan diet .
Even until now , he has never wanted to eat meat , and his spirit and body are much better than before .
He used to be a homebody , and people did n't like to be with him and never invited him to go out to eat and drink tea .
Now , people around him feel that he is slowly changing .
His friends attribute it to Supreme Master TV .
They even laugh heartily .
It seems that his friends are really happy to see his changes .
For a long time , his temper was not good and he had no patience .
He had unpleasant relations with his family and colleagues .
He often kept animosity in his heart , making life difficult for others and himself .
The more he discovers that he really has changed , the more cheerful he is .
He does n't care too much about small things and treats others well easily .
He used to think that others are obliged to treat him well , while he did n't treat people around him or even animals nicely .
After watching the animal anchors on Supreme Master TV , he felt that they are cute and lovely and would make people love them .
Now , when seeing stray animals , he no longer has bad thoughts towards them , but hopes that there will be good people to take care of them for life .
He explained in particular : Now when mentioning animals , he will not use the word " animal , " but uses he or she ( pronouns for human beings ) instead , because he feels that animals are even more kind and loving than people .
Although he has only been a vegan for over a year , one can feel while conversing with him that he is a true vegan from the inside , and has received spiritual inspiration .
The endeavor and efforts by Master and the TV staff let people really change from the heart through watching Supreme Master TV , to become gentle , vegan and treat all sentient beings more lovingly .
People 's souls are touched , sparking their inner goodness and compassion .
The existence of Supreme Master TV is more touching and gratifying than anything else .
From Xiao Ning in Taipei , Taiwan ( Formosa ) who loves Supreme Master and all the working staff .
In addition to responding to letters from the fools who write to Entertainment Weekly and People , I 'm happy to answer letters from readers ( and if those readers happen to be fools as well , so much the better ) .

Amid the continuing brouhaha about issues of race and gender in the US presidential campaign , we may be in danger of losing sight of the most important question that has arisen in the candidates ' skirmishing over international affairs .
That relates to John McCain 's advocacy of the establishment of a " league of democracies " , and the mounting clamour for Barack Obama to espouse the same idea as his own .
McCain says he'd establish the league in his first year in office : a close - knit grouping of like - minded nations that could respond to humanitarian crises and compensate for the UN security council 's tendency to be hamstrung by the likes of Russia and China when it needs to take decisive action against the world 's evil - doers .
Neocon guru Robert Kagan , an avid proponent , says : " The world 's democracies could make common cause to act in humanitarian crises when the UN security council cannot reach unanimity . "
The league 's strength would be that it " would not be limited to Europeans and Americans but would include the world 's other great democracies , such as India , Brazil , Japan and Australia , and would [ therefore ] have even greater legitimacy " .
The idea has also been embraced by many Obama supporters , notably Ivo Daalder , a foreign policy adviser to the Illinois senator , and Anthony Lake , his senior international affairs adviser .
" Crises in Iran , North Korea , Iraq and Darfur , " Lake writes , " not to mention the pressing need for more efficient peacekeeping operations , the rising temperatures of our seas and multiple other transnational threats , demonstrate not only the limits of American unilateral power but also the inability of international institutions designed in the middle of the 20th century to cope with the problems of the 21st . "
In other words , the institutions so painstakingly built up out of the ashes of the second world war have passed their use - by date , and it 's time to move on .
One does n't have to be a starry - eyed devotee of the UN to ask everyone to take a deep breath before the runaway popularity of this idea becomes consensual in Washington .
No one disagrees that our international institutions need reform to make them reflect the realities of a post - American world , but that 's not where the advocates of an alternative are coming from .
The world has just , less than two decades ago , come out of a crippling cold war .
We are moving fitfully to a world without boundaries , one in which America 's biggest potential geopolitical rival , China , is also its biggest trading partner .
If we were to create a new league of democracies , who would we leave out ?
China and Russia , for starters - a former superpower and a future one , two countries without whom a world of peace and prosperity is unimaginable .
Instead of encouraging their gradual democratisation , would n't we be reinforcing their sense of rejection by the rest ?
Might the result be the self - fulfilling prophecy of the emergence of a league of autocracies with these two at the helm ?
But would all democracies even join such a league ?
Not if the price were the alienation of vital trading partners , resource suppliers or simply neighbours who happen to be non-democracies .
Democracies like India and France have proved prickly in the past about countries like the US or Britain assuming that their internal political arrangements would necessarily govern their foreign policy choices .
Many democracies have other affinities that are as important to them .
India , for instance , may count solidarity with other former colonies , or with other developing countries , as more important than its affiliation with a league of democracies ; southeast Asian democracies might prefer their regional alliance with autocracies in Asean .
The American notion that a collection of democracies would inevitably be an echo - chamber for an American diagnosis of global problems is a fantasy .
The claim that a league of democracies would be less likely to be paralysed into inaction over , say , sanctions on Iran , than a security council with the likes of Russia or China on it , overlooks the basic fact that it is in the nature of democracies to differ , to argue among themselves , and to be responsive to the very different preoccupations of their own internal constituencies .
Had a league of democracies existed during the apartheid years , would Washington have been persuaded by a democratic majority to intervene against Pretoria ?
The very question points to the risibility of its premise .
The advocates of a league of democracies argue that it would intervene more effectively in cases like Darfur or the cruel indifference of the military regime in Burma to the sufferings of its cyclone victims .
That is a delusion .
Such interventions have not occurred because they are impracticable .
Humanitarian aid could not have been delivered effectively in the Irrawaddy delta in the teeth of active resistance by the Burmese junta , or in Darfur by going to war with the Sudanese army , unless the countries wishing to do this were to be prepared to expend a level of blood and treasure that democracies rarely risk for strangers .
It is one thing to march into a chaotic , government - less Somalia to protect the delivery of aid , quite another to confront the organised military force of a sovereign state defending its own territory .
It is also specious to argue that collective action by a group of democracies ( when the UN is unable to act ) would enjoy international legitimacy .
The legitimacy of democracies comes from the consent of the governed ; when they act outside their own countries , no such legitimacy applies .
The reason that decisions of the UN enjoy legitimacy across the world lies not in the democratic virtue of its members , but in its universality .
The fact that every country in the world belongs to the UN and participates in its decisions gives the actions of the UN - even that of a security council in urgent need of reform - a global standing in international law that no more selective body can hope to achieve .
This is the time to renovate and strengthen the UN , not to bypass it .
As the post - cold war " unipolar moment " slowly but surely makes way for a world of multiple power centres and a rising new superpower , there has never been a greater need for a system of universally applicable rules and laws that will hold all countries together in a shared international community .
We all hope that , in an era of instant communications and worldwide information flows , this community will be an increasingly democratic one .
Subtracting today 's democracies from it will have the opposite effect .

The latest advertising campaign in Mexico from Swedish vodka maker Absolut promises to push all the right buttons south of the U.S. border , but it could ruffle a few feathers in El Norte .
The billboard and press campaign , created by advertising agency Teran \TBWA and now running in Mexico , is a colorful map depicting what the Americas might look like in an " Absolut " -- i.e. , perfect -- world .
The U.S. - Mexico border lies where it was before the Mexican - American war of 1848 when California , as we now know it , was Mexican territory and known as Alta California .
Following the war , the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo saw the Mexican territories of Alta California and Santa Fé de Nuevo México ceded to the United States to become modern - day California , Texas , New Mexico , Utah , Colorado and Arizona .
( Texas actually split from Mexico several years earlier to form a breakaway republic , and was voluntarily annexed by the United States in 1846 . )
The campaign taps into the national pride of Mexicans , according to Favio Ucedo , creative director of leading Latino advertising agency Grupo Gallegos in the U.S. , which was not involved in the Absolut campaign .
Ucedo , who is from Argentina , said : “ Mexicans talk about how the Americans stole their land , so this is their way of reclaiming it .
It ’s very relevant and the Mexicans will love the idea . ”
But he said that were the campaign to run in the United States , it might fall flat .
“ Many people are n’t going to understand it here .
Americans in the East and the North or in the center of the county -- I do n’t know if they know much about the history .
“ Probably Americans in Texas and California understand perfectly and I do n’t know how they ’d take it . ”
Meanwhile , the campaign has been circulating on the blogs and generating strong responses from people north of the border .
“ I find this ad deeply offensive , and needlessly divisive .
I will now make a point of drinking other brands .
And ' vodka and tonic ' is my drink , ” said one visitor , called New Yorker , on MexicoReporter.com .
Reader Paul Green goes into a discussion on the blog Gateway Pundit of whether the U.S. territories ever belonged to Mexico in the first place , and the News12 Long island site invited people to boycott Absolut , with one user , called LivingSmall , writing : “ If you drink Absolut vodka , you can voice your approval or disapproval of this advertising campaign with your purchases .
I know I will be switching to Grey Goose or Stoli and will never have another bottle of Absolut in my house .
“ Hey Absolut ... that 's my form of social commentary . ”

Tell us what you think by voting here :
Former Rep. Bob Barr says a number of Republicans have been trying to persuade him not to run for president on the Libertarian Party ticket , but none has given him a convincing reason .
The former Republican congressman from Georgia formed an exploratory committee last month and told The Washington Times that he has since been subjected to the behind - the - scenes pressure from Republicans not to run .
Mr. Barr says even people who have tried to dissuade him understand why he thinks it important to raise issues from what he calls a “ genuinely conservative ” perspective and to offer alternatives to the positions of the two major - party candidates .
“ In the month since we formed our exploratory committee , not a single Republican who has spoken with me to try and convince me not to seek the Libertarian nomination has disagreed with my reasons for considering a run , ” Mr. Barr told The Times yesterday in an e-mail exchange before leaving London on a flight to Atlanta .
Most Republicans who asked him not to run “ also said they understand why I ’d run and why John McCain is not conservative and will not seriously tackle the growth in government power and spending , ” he said .
“ Some said they would vote for me if I ran , but for the sake of the Republican Party , they would prefer I did n’t . ”
Mr. Barr will speak today at the National Press Club .
But Republicans , both publicly and behind the scenes , are saying a Barr run could hurt him financially and sink Mr. McCain ’s Republican candidacy in the general election , likely against Sen. Barack Obama .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told The Times yesterday that “ Bob Barr will make it marginally easier for Barack Obama to become president .
That outcome threatens every libertarian value Barr professes to champion . ”
Russ Verney , an adviser to the 1992 Ross Perot presidential campaign and his 1996 campaign manager , has been working with the Mr. Barr ’s exploratory committee “ to help put together the infrastructure for his presidential run , ” Libertarian Party spokesman Andrew Davis said .
Mr. Barr , a former federal prosecutor , was a conservative Republican before he became a Libertarian in 2006 .
“ In 1992 , Ross Perot took rather obscure issues like government spending and national debt and made them clear for the public , ” Mr. Verney said .
“ Sixteen years later , the public inherently knows the country is headed in the wrong direction , something has to be done , and ca n’t be done through Republicans and Democrats . ”
The Libertarian Party says it “ is on track to achieve ballot access in at least 48 states . ”
If he wins nomination at the Libertarians ’ May 22 - 26 national convention in Denver , it could financially burden his law practice and consulting firm in Atlanta , while enlivening discussion at organizations with which he has been associated , including the American Conservative Union , the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Rifle Association .
To the dismay of some Republicans who consider the ACLU a champion of liberal causes , he has consulted for the civil liberties group on informational and data privacy issues on which many liberals and conservatives see eye to eye .
In a debate last week at Oxford University , Mr. Barr argued that in some ways the end of freedom predicted in George Orwell ’s “ 1984 ” has arrived , “ not in the form of a brutal dictatorship but in the guise of modern governments using the tools of digital technology and the fear of terrorism to take away what vestiges of privacy remain to our citizens . ”
He said the debate topic would be a major part of his platform if he runs .
A poll paid for by his exploratory committee found that 36 percent of likely voters recognized his name and that 9 percent said they would vote for him over Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain .
But a Zogby poll released last month found 45 percent of likely voters favoring Mr. Obama , 42 percent for Mr. McCain , 3 percent for Mr. Barr and 1 percent for Ralph Nader , with 8 percent undecided .

Climbers on Mount Everest 's south side are surreptitiously blogging a standoff with Nepalese soldiers ahead of China 's Olympic torch run on the opposite side of the mountain next week .
With a news blackout in effect since Monday at the Everest base camp – and no news media at camps farther up the mountain – the situation is being chronicled only by a smattering of international climber / bloggers .
" We saw lots of military staff and one solider carrying a very sophisticated sniper type of gun , " Jim Curtin wrote on his blog Monday .
Curtin has been blogging his ascent of Everest for several weeks but is now stuck at Camp 2 , at 21,000 feet .
Over the last several days his blog has chronicled the frustrating wait as Nepalese soldiers block climbers from ascending the mountain .
Nepalese soldiers have closed the summit until the Chinese torch run is made , which is expected between May 1 and May 10 , depending on the weather .
Italian bloggers captured a picture of Nepalese soldiers on the 27th , seen above .
Soldiers have posted a hand - drawn sign , saying , " Dear Climbers .
All of you are not allow to go forward from this point till 10 May 2008 .
Thank you for your cooperation , " according to Curtin , who posted a picture ) .
PeakFreaks also noted the existence of the sign .
" Should someone blow past the sign and start climbing the Lohtse face , the skilled sniper may come into play , " Curtin wrote .
Mountain teams are supposed to be under a communications blackout , but a group called Climbers Without Borders have set up an anonymous information service that allows climbers to posts updates to MountEverest .
net .
In addition , several climbers have their equipment stashed away , according to a climbing - equipment salesman who requested anonymity to protect clients in the field .
Nepalese soldiers arrived at the mountain on the 20th with the orders from Nepal 's Home Ministry to stop pro-Tibet protests by " any means necessary " according to the Associated Press .
One young American climber , William Brant Holland , was found carrying a sign that read " Free Tibet , Fuck China " last Friday , and deported back to the United States .
Despite the presence of soldiers , Holland said that he was not scared .
" The soldiers are just plainclothes .
They 're not carrying machine guns , maybe just have one side - arm , " Holland told Wired.com by cellphone Tuesday .
" They 're not gonna shoot anybody . "
A combination of small , high - tech gadgets powered by solar panels are enabling wired climbers to keep blogging and remain in touch with their loved ones .
Luis Benitez , a climber who has ascended Everest six times , said that all the technology necessary to run a blog could be stowed in a tiny bag .
" You need a satellite phone , a PDA , special compression software , one cable and a solar panel and that 's it , " Benitez said .
Benitez said that despite the blackout , he continues to receive phone calls from friends at Camp 1 , where Nepalese authorities do not have a military presence .
" People are hiding sat phones in their socks , " he said .
While the bloggers on the mountain have generally refrained from directly criticizing the Nepalese or Chinese governments , Benitez , who has previously run afoul of the Chinese government , was more open .
" The Chinese bribed the Nepalese to make the mountain a police state , " Benitez said .
" I 've been a mountaineer my whole life and I 've never seen anything like it . "

What to do when gems.github.com breaks gems FOREVAR UPGRADE YOUR GEM SYSTEM TO V 1.1.1 BEFORE ADDING gems.github.com TO YOUR SOURCES !!!
That is the message that needs to be displayed in an H1 tag across gems.github.com , not some tiny note saying " if you get this error , you should " and then a message that essentially amounts to " go back in time and not have done this . "
They 'll tell you to update your gem system , but if you 're experiencing the problem , gem ca n't update itself .
For those of you lacking time machines , you need to remove github.com from your gem sources so the system update will run .
The command to remove a source is not documented anywhere¹ , but if you promise not to tell anyone , here it is : sudo gem sources -r http://gems.github.com/
Once you 've done this you can now do sudo gem update -- system sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com/
and you 're back in business .
¹ EDIT : A reader pointed out that it IS documented .
" gem help sources " will get you what you need , and " gem help commands " is listed from the main " gem help " screen so you can navigate to it .
Thanks !

Now it 's worse .
They 've removed any hint or indication of what might be wrong if you made the mistake of installing sources without upgrading gems .
Granted , for people who have n't installed this , the instructions are better .
But for those who are already broken , they 've removed what little lifeline / hint was already there .
This is EPIC FAIL , guys .
There 's no indication that not following these directions precisely WILL BREAK YOUR GEMS INSTALLATION COMPLETELY .

Do n't get me wrong .
I love git and I really like what the guys at github are doing .
This is n't their fault , this is n't really their problem to fix , and I certainly do n't think they need to document every possible thing that could go wrong if you do something other than what they tell you .
But .
I lost 2 hours to this today because :
a ) this open manhole cover was n't labeled with any kind of warning ,
b ) the mechanism for getting out of the manhole was added recently to gems and the public docco for it has not yet been updated , and
c ) the error messages I was getting did n't even indicate that I 'd fallen into a manhole in the first place
Anyway .
The new instructions are good , yes .
Hopefully anybody who 's already broken their gems install will find this blog post .

JERUSALEM  President Bush used a speech to the Israeli Parliament on Thursday to liken those who would negotiate with “ terrorists and radicals ” to appeasers of the Nazis  a remark widely interpreted as a rebuke to Senator Barack Obama , who has advocated greater engagement with countries like Iran and Syria .
Mr. Bush did not mention Mr. Obama by name , and White House officials said he was not taking aim at the senator , though they were aware the speech might be interpreted that way .
The comments created an angry tussle back home , as Democrats accused Mr. Bush of breaching protocol by playing partisan politics overseas .
The episode placed Mr. Bush squarely in one of the most divisive debates of the campaign to succeed him , as Republicans try to portray Mr. Obama as weak in the fight against terrorism .
It also underscored what the White House has said will be an aggressive effort by Mr. Bush to use his presidential platform to influence the presidential election .
The Russians stunned Canadian fans in Quebec City
Russia have won the ice hockey World Championship , dethroning the hosts Canada 5 - 4 in a dramatic final .
With the game tied 4 - 4 after three periods , Ilya Kovalchuk scored the winner in the overtime to end Russia 's 15 - year gold medal drought .
The loss denied Canada their bid to become the first host nation to capture the title since the Soviet Union 's victory in Moscow in 1986 .
Finland defeated Sweden 4 - 0 on Saturday to claim the bronze .
Kovalchuk got the winning goal with 2:42 played in the overtime , firing a shot past Canadian goalkeeper Cam Ward during the final in Quebec City .
The Russian forward also earlier scored the game - tying goal late in the third period .
" We have a great team with great players and we believed in each other , " Russian defender Andrei Markov was quoted as saying by AFP .
It is Russia 's first world title since 1993 .
" It sucks but you know it was a great hockey game , " Canada 's Ryan Getzlaf said after the final .
Guerilla marketing is often a risky business , skirting the edge of ethical ( or even legal ) acceptability .
Some guerilla marketers who have crossed the line have caused everything from Olympic belly - flops to city - wide bomb scares in Boston and have been punished with anything from modest jail time to millions of dollars in fines .
All the same , some of these are probably ( secretly ) considered successes because subsequent media attention to the debacles probably raised more awareness than the guerilla campaigns alone ever could have .
Some guerilla marketing is even done to support good causes though much of it is created to line the pockets of giant corporations .
Know of other great examples of guerilla marketing gone wrong ?
See also : Subversive Marketing and Culture Jamming .
The Olympics are n’t games to be toyed with apparently , as one tutu - wearing prankster learned the hard way .
In an effort to guerilla market an online gaming site a Canadian man leapt into an Olympic pool at the 2004 Athens games .
He was convicted of various counts of trespassing and creating a disturbance and was sentenced to multiple months in a Greek prison but then released with a fine of just a few hundred dollars .
Some divers were apparently put off by the intervention and subsequently failed to complete their dives .
The Microsoft Zune arguably has more haters than fans , apparently including some police officers in Austin , Texas .
A person postering guerilla advertisements for the Zune was detained and handcuffed by authorities at SXSW last year .
According to one eyewitness the police were overheard saying something like “ We ’ll have none of your advertising for your DRM “ crippleware ” crappy MP3 player littering our town . ”
Now that is an interesting reason to state for arrest if ever there was one .
There are many fans of the new movie Forgetting Sarah Marshall – unfortunately , most women named Sarah Marshall are n’t among them .
Guerilla - style scrawled ads posted around the country have featured disparaging phrases like “ You Suck Sarah Marshall ” leading up to the film ’s release .
Perhaps it never occurred to the guerilla marketers behind these campaigns that there are , in fact , many real - life women with that name .
Responses have ranged from frustration to raging retaliation ( with comparable “ You Suck ” signs aimed at the film ’s director ) .
The lucky woman , however , who owns SarahMarshall.com was relatively pleased with the tens of thousands of visitors her website received .
We ’ve all heard of subtle guerilla marketing campaigns aimed at mentioning products casually so that passers - by will overhear a name - drop and it should be no surprise that this kind of marketing has found its way online as well .
Nvidia is one of a number of companies that has been accused of seeding online forums with fake - fan support for their products .
Of course , when the truth comes out real forum users are often none - too - pleased with the deception and the lame excuses provided by the marketers or companies accused .
Of course , no discussion of guerilla marketing gone wrong could possibly be complete without the 2007 Boston bomb scare .
A number of LED signs designed to promote the television program Aqua Teen Hunger Force were mistakenly identified as explosive devices .
At the time , these cute little blinking cartoon figures probably seemed like a brilliant way to raise curiosity .
In retrospect , in this post - 911 world installing a series of complex wire - filled devices with their own power sources on public structural elements like bridge supports was probably a tremendously terrible idea .
Worse yet , the marketing company and device designers failed to notify the police of the devices ’ true purpose even after learnings that they were being treated as bombs by authorities .
Though no jail sentences resulted from the incident Turner Broadcasting paid millions of dollars to city police and Homeland Security to resolve the matter .
YouTube is owned by search giant Google A one billion dollar lawsuit against YouTube threatens internet freedom , according to its owner Google .
Google 's claim follows Viacom 's move to sue the video sharing service for its inability to keep copyrighted material off its site .
Viacom says it has identified 150,000 unauthorised clips on YouTube .
In court documents Google 's lawyers say the action " threatens the way hundreds of millions of people legitimately exchange information " over the web .
The search giant 's legal team also maintained that YouTube had been faithful to the requirements of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act and that they responded properly to claims of infringement .
In papers submitted to a Manhattan court , Google said it and YouTube " goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works " .
Viacom disagreed that either firm had lived up to that standard and said that they had done " little or nothing " to stop infringement .
Abuse
In a rewritten lawsuit filed last month , Viacom claimed YouTube consistently allowed unauthorised copies of popular television programming and movies to be posted on its website and viewed tens of thousands of times .
It said it had identified more than 150,000 such abuses which included clips from shows such as South Park , SpongeBob SquarePants and MTV Unplugged .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The company says the infringement also included the documentary An Inconvenient Truth which had been viewed " an astounding 1.5 billion times " .
Viacom , which is asking for damages for the unauthorised viewing of its programming , said its tally represented only a fraction of the content on YouTube that violates its copyrights .
" The availability on the YouTube site of a vast library of the copyrighted works of plaintiffs and others is the cornerstone of defendants ' business plan , " Viacom said .
Viacom originally started legal action last year and filed an amended version last month .
Earlier this month Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone told Dow Jones : " When we filed this lawsuit , we not only served our own interests , we served the interests of everyone who owns copyrights they want protected . "
He added : " We cannot tolerate any form of piracy by anyone , including YouTube ... they can not get away with stealing our products . "
For its part , Google said the only way the legal action would be resolved was in court .
Google 's vice president of content partnerships David Eun has said : " We 're going all the way to the Supreme Court .
We 've been very clear about it . "
After the legal action was first started , YouTube launched an anti-piracy tool that checks uploaded videos against the original content in an effort to flag piracy .

What are these ?
For a bright - eyed teenager in 1976 that had high hopes of becoming a journalist one day , the satirical film Network was a revelation suggesting maybe choosing another profession would be a wise move .
( Ed : Look at where that got you . )
After years of intense investigative coverage of Watergate and the resulting rise in credibility of the journalistic profession , it seemed the right - maybe even honorable - field of study during the college years ... until that fateful New Year ’s Day in 1976 .
In 1976 , the country was celebrating its bicentennial , trying to put Watergate and the Vietnam War out of our minds , and looking forward to an election that would chart a new direction in American politics .
( These subjects sound familiar 32 years later . )
Top films of that year really did represent what we were going through , and to some degree what we would become in the near future .
Rocky found us in love with the underdog who never gave up .
All the President ’s Men gave us a short synopsis of the Watergate scandal from the perspective of the journalistic team ( Bernstein / Woodward ) that broke the story and proved that journalists were sexy , provided you resembled a young Robert Redford .
The Bad News Bears allowed us to take a humorous look at sports obsessed parents realizing that winning at any cost had taken the joy out of playing the game for many kids ( kids who would become today ’s Soccer Moms and Dads ) .
I enjoyed many other movies that year with my friends , which more or less fit in with our very sarcastic yet humorous personalities .
Some were dark like Taxi Driver , Marathon Man , The Omen , Obsession , and Carrie , while others were on the lighter side such as Silent Movie , The Pink Panther Strikes Again , Silver Streak , and Mother , Jugs & Speed .
Of course , we also had the breakout science fiction films , Logan ’s Run and Futureworld .
( Told you we were sarcastic . )
All told , it was a decent year for film , and some thirty years later we still have Rocky , Pink Panther , and King Kong remakes .
However , there was one film that year that left a lasting impression on us ; that film was the aforementioned and critically acclaimed Network .
What All the President ’s Men did to glorify the journalistic profession ; Network succeeded in displaying the dark and seedy side of media .
In retrospect , it also provided a fairly accurate glimpse of where TV / Print media was headed along with society .
Sensationalism - some would say yellow journalism - sells and is what a large cross-section of society enjoys , whether they openly admit it or not .
In Network , Peter Finch played the aging news anchor , Howard Beale , who at one point in the film makes an impassioned speech that resulted in an extremely popular catch phrase of the time .
He persuaded his watching audience to step outside and shout , “ I ’m mad as hell , and I ’m not going to take this anymore ! ”
This phrase struck a chord with mainstream America during that year and with us now .
It has been a couple of rough weeks for the motherboard team .
Our best laid plans have been thwarted for a variety of reasons , most of which have us shouting the above phrase , and we are sure some of you feel the same way .
Since the news and review sections are fairly quiet over the weekend , we thought it would be a good time to discuss those items that put a burr under our saddle - to address issues that our readership is having with the technology and companies that we cover on a periodic basis .
Believe it or not , we rarely get to rant ( and for very good reasons as you will see ) , but sometimes it 's necessary to say what one thinks .
So here is Rant Session # 1 for your weekend enjoyment .
Ask anyone down the pub what happens when you drink and they ’ll have the answer : you cheer up and loosen up .
Yet until now no one has explored what happens in the brain during intoxication .
Jodi Gilman and her colleagues at the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda , Maryland , used MRI to observe the brain activity of 12 healthy “ social drinkers ” both when sober and after they had been given alcohol intravenously and their blood alcohol levels had reached nearly 0.08 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood – the legal limit for driving …
Incentives matter in all areas of human endeavor .
When people gather to develop and deploy new medicines , for example , they are more incentized by the prospect of personal gains - reputation , profit , feeling good by doing good , and so forth - than by the benefits brought to people they have never met .
This is simple , hardwired human behavior .
Exceptions are few and far between .
That we instinctively work to improve our own lot first is why progress for all happens so much faster in free , open marketplaces under the rule of law .
There , everyone can trade to make themselves better off : specialization and comparative advantage means that trade benefits both sides .
Trade is not zero - sum ; we grow the whole pie by specializing and trading the results of our work .
You go off and work to make the medicine I want , and many people like myself give some our our resources to purchase the end result .
Both sides benefit , exchanging - what is for them - lesser value to receive greater value .
There is no open marketplace for medical technology in the developed world , however .
Instead , we see a very different set of incentives dominating the state of research and development .
Regulatory bodies like the FDA have every incentive to stop the release of new medicine : the government employees involved suffer far more from bad press for an approved medical technology than they do from the largely unexamined consequences of heavy regulation .
These consequences go far beyond the obvious and announced disapproval of specific medical technologies : the far greater cost lies in all the research , innovation and development that was never undertaken because regulatory burdens ensure there would be no profit for the developer .
Personal gain for the regulator is thus to destroy the gains of people they will never meet , the exact opposite of what occurs in an open marketplace .
An article that looks at one small part of the destruction caused by the FDA caught my attention , and particularly these snippets :
Since 2005 the FDA has approved 18 new cancer drugs , many of them breakthrough products .
But the pipeline contains hundreds more that will never get to market because corporate developers are n't able , or willing , to come up with the money , time , and patients necessary to establish acceptable data .
...
The clinical trial process now is a three - part , years - long effort that effectively kills off all but a handful of once - promising drugs .
...
It would have been the first new drug for prostate cancer in 20 years
Twenty years !
Just stop a moment and think about how far and fast biotechnology and medical science has moved in the past twenty years .
Think about what the far less regulated computing industry has achieved in the same timeframe .
We live in the early years of the biotechnology revolution , with something amazing and new demonstrated in laboratories every week .
Yet the dominant regulatory body for one of the most advanced regions of the world has managed to stop the clock at 1988 for a major disease , the subject of research in a hundred laboratories worldwide .
This sitation exists in every field of medicine , and all participants labor under the crushing burdens imposed by regulators incentivized to stop progress from happening .
The same will be true of the future of longevity medicine , unless we do something about it .
The insanity of this all is quite staggering - that people largely accept and defend the need for regulation that achieves this sort of result , that is .
I have heard it said that the failure of libertarianism , of the urge to freedom and personal responsibility , is a failure of imagination on the part of those who have been brought up knowing nothing other than government and regulation on a massive scale .
The majority cannot make the leap to see an unregulated marketplace for medical development that works in the same way as the unregulated marketplace for computers - enormous choice , low barriers to innovation , efficiency and low cost , competing review organizations , accountable sellers , rapid progress and responsiveness to customers driven by fierce competition , and so forth .
What is , is , and to propose another way is already an uphill battle regardless of merits .
That is also hardwired into the human condition .
But the present dismal state of affairs must be changed if we are to see the defeat of degenerative aging in our lifetime - nothing short of a revolution is called for , given just how far in the hole we find ourselves .
The technologies needed to repair aging will take only a few decades to develop , and indeed some already exist in prototype , but the present regulatory burden placed upon medical technology will ensure we are all dead and buried , that wondrous potential squandered .
In 2005 , DVDr - core was the first BitTorrent site that was targeted by the MPAA outside the US .
A classic story : Man runs site , man gets sued over site , nothing more is ever heard .
Whilst in most cases , this means that the defendant bowed to pressure , paid an out of court settlement , and promised not to do it again , that is not the case here .
For those that do n’t remember , lets recap .
It was a little over three years ago that Hollywood took their first blast against a BitTorrent site in Europe with a lawsuit against DVDr - core .
The notification ( see end ) , served at the home address of the domain owner one Saturday morning in March 2005 , led to more than a few anxious nights for fellow torrent site admins and users , wondering who would be next to get a knock at the door .
The site , which closed in December 04 , after Hanff and the site ’s administrators heard about raids in Holland , was not administered by Hanff , but by some online friends of his .
Shortly after this dawn raid by a process server , Hanff - who had just started a new job - appeared on an episode of the BBC show “ News Night ” .
The day after it aired , he was fired , for having views on copyright that the company felt were incompatible with its own , and for not disclosing the case .
That was the situation at the end of 2005 anyway .
And now , more than two years have passed and he has heard nothing new .
Despite the claims in the letters he has received , Hanff does n’t think the case went any further , and was quietly dropped .
“ The last thing I had was a letter from the MPAA lawyers with a copy of a motion for a default [ judgment ] ” , he told Torrent Freak .
“ That was November 2005 , had that motion been granted I should have heard from the courts . ”
The hearing in question would have been around the middle of December 2005 .
“ I have n’t even received anything from the court about that hearing , which I should have done , so I am sceptical as to whether or not it actually went ahead ”
Perhaps the MPAA felt they did n’t need to proceed any more , after all , thanks to the case , Mr Hanff lost his job , and they did n’t have to run the risk of an adverse judgment in court .
As has been discussed in the past , the anti-filesharing litigation campaigns seems to be less about compensating the artists , and more about harassment , and manufacturing cases to boost lobbying efforts .
It would appear that this is just more of the same , mudslinging in lieu of any actual case .
The document received by Mr. Hanff is certainly full of accusations , threats , and exaggerations , something that recently cost a French Lawyer her ability to practice law .
It does bring into some doubt the ability or the desire for the MPAA to litigate outside the cozy confines of the US .
It also seems to indicate the way the oink case will go , as it just had it ’s bail date extended again , although it is a criminal case , whilst dvdr - core is a civil case .
Nevertheless , the extension of the case with no action except the initial accusation does draw the similarities closer .
In the meantime , Mr Hanff has been spending his energies tacking Phorm , the illegal and widespread invasion of browsing privacy to target adverts via deep packet inspection in association with UK ISPs .
His dissertation on the subject can be read here .
" Science without religion is lame , religion without science is blind . "
So said Albert Einstein , and his famous aphorism has been the source of endless debate between believers and non-believers wanting to claim the greatest scientist of the 20th century as their own .
A little known letter written by him , however , may help to settle the argument - or at least provoke further controversy about his views .
Due to be auctioned this week in London after being in a private collection for more than 50 years , the document leaves no doubt that the theoretical physicist was no supporter of religious beliefs , which he regarded as " childish superstitions " .
Einstein penned the letter on January 3 1954 to the philosopher Eric Gutkind who had sent him a copy of his book Choose Life : The Biblical Call to Revolt .
The letter went on public sale a year later and has remained in private hands ever since .
In the letter , he states : " The word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses , the Bible a collection of honourable , but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish .
No interpretation no matter how subtle can ( for me ) change this . "
Einstein , who was Jewish and who declined an offer to be the state of Israel 's second president , also rejected the idea that the Jews are God 's favoured people .
" For me the Jewish religion like all others is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions .
And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people .
As far as my experience goes , they are no better than other human groups , although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power .
Otherwise I cannot see anything ' chosen ' about them . "
The letter will go on sale at Bloomsbury Auctions in Mayfair on Thursday and is expected to fetch up to £ 8,000 .
The handwritten piece , in German , is not listed in the source material of the most authoritative academic text on the subject , Max Jammer 's book Einstein and Religion .
One of the country 's leading experts on the scientist , John Brooke of Oxford University , admitted he had not heard of it .
Einstein is best known for his theories of relativity and for the famous E=mc2 equation that describes the equivalence of mass and energy , but his thoughts on religion have long attracted conjecture .
His parents were not religious but he attended a Catholic primary school and at the same time received private tuition in Judaism .
This prompted what he later called , his " religious paradise of youth " , during which he observed religious rules such as not eating pork .
This did not last long though and by 12 he was questioning the truth of many biblical stories .
" The consequence was a positively fanatic [ orgy of ] freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is being deceived by the state through lies ; it was a crushing impression , " he later wrote .
In his later years he referred to a " cosmic religious feeling " that permeated and sustained his scientific work .
In 1954 , a year before his death , he spoke of wishing to " experience the universe as a single cosmic whole " .
He was also fond of using religious flourishes , in 1926 declaring that " He [ God ] does not throw dice " when referring to randomness thrown up by quantum theory .
His position on God has been widely misrepresented by people on both sides of the atheism / religion divide but he always resisted easy stereotyping on the subject .
" Like other great scientists he does not fit the boxes in which popular polemicists like to pigeonhole him , " said Brooke .
" It is clear for example that he had respect for the religious values enshrined within Judaic and Christian traditions ... but what he understood by religion was something far more subtle than what is usually meant by the word in popular discussion . "
Despite his categorical rejection of conventional religion , Brooke said that Einstein became angry when his views were appropriated by evangelists for atheism .
He was offended by their lack of humility and once wrote .
" The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility . "

Cannibalism may have killed Neanderthals
Neanderthals who practiced cannibalism may have spread a mad cow - like disease that weakened and reduced populations , thereby contributing to their extinction , according to a new theory .
The theoretical model could resolve the longstanding mystery of what caused Neanderthals , which emerged about 250,000 years ago , to disappear about 30,000 years ago .
" The story of Neanderthal extinction is one of the most intriguing in all of human evolution , " says Simon Underdown , a lecturer in the anthropology department at Oxford Brookes University and author of a paper in the journal Medical Hypotheses .
" Why did a large - brained , intelligent hominid that shared so many traits with us disappear ? "
To resolve that question , Underdown studied a well - documented tribal group , the Fore of Papua New Guinea , who practiced ritualistic cannibalism and linked that to what could have happened to the Neanderthals .
Evidence of cannibalism
Gory evidence uncovered in a French cave in 1999 reveals Neanderthals probably practiced cannibalism too .
The 100,000 - 120,000 year - old bones discovered at the cave site of Moula - Guercy near the west bank of the Rhone river suggests a group of Neanderthals defleshed the bones of at least six other individuals and then broke the bones apart with a hammer stone and anvil to remove the marrow and brains .
It 's not clear why Neanderthals may have eaten each other .
But research on the Fore determined that maternal kin of certain deceased Fore individuals used to dismember corpses and regarded some human flesh as a valuable food source .
Beginning in the early 1900s , anthropologists also began to take note of an affliction among the Fore named kuru .
By the 1960s , kuru reached epidemic levels and killed over 1100 people .
Subsequent investigations determined that kuru was related to the Fore 's cannibalistic activities and was a form of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or TSE .
TSEs , of which mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy is one , have been around for possibly millions of years , Underdown says .
TSEs cause brain tissue to take on an almost sponge - like appearance , caused by the formation of small holes during the development of the disease .
The disease 's latter stages often result in severe mental impairment , loss of speech and an inability to move .
How many could the disease kill ?
Underdown created a model , based on the kuru findings , to figure out how the spread of such a disease via cannibalism could reduce a population 's size .
For example , he calculated that within a hypothetical group of 15,000 individuals , such a disease could reduce the population to non-viable levels within 250 years .
When added to other pressures , this type of disease could therefore have wiped out the Neanderthals , Underdown believes .
" TSE 's could have thinned the population , reducing numbers and contributing to their extinction in combination with other factors [ such as climate change and the emergence of modern humans ] , " he says .
Such diseases have very long incubation periods , he says , so affected individuals may not show symptoms for a very long time .
Similarly , people who eat people with a TSE may not exhibit signs of illness immediately after eating .
" Neanderthals would have been unlikely to spot any causal relationship between cannibalism and TSE symptoms , " Underdown says .
Infection via stone tools
Modern clinical tests show that medical instruments can carry infectious prions , which spread TSEs , even after such tools have been sterilised .
So , sharing stone tools could have also spread the disease among Neanderthals , even those that did not practice cannibalism .
Professor Nick Barton , director of the Institute of Archaeology at the University of Oxford , thinks the new paper presents " an extremely novel and very interesting theory " .
" Most scholars now believe that the demise of the Neanderthals was not down to a single causal factor , " Barton says .
" However , if genetic studies eventually show that Neanderthals were susceptible to TSE , or other empirical evidence emerges for persistent cannibalism and consumption of brain tissues in late Neanderthal populations , then we may have to rethink our ideas on extinction . "
Although the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. has treated us to nutty and racist rants , which included saying that the even more bigoted Minister Louis Farrakhan is one of the greatest voices of the 20th and 21st centuries , and that the U.S. government was capable of having used the AIDS virus to commit genocide against minorities , his equally shocking views on U.S. foreign policy are largely true .
Wright has said that the U.S. has committed terrorist acts overseas , and he quoted Edward Peck , a former U.S. ambassador during the Reagan administration , as saying that the United States ’ " chickens have come home to roost . "
Presidential candidate Barack Obama lumped all of Wright ’s views into one basket and denounced them as being offensive , but he should have taken a second look at Wright ’s analysis of terrorism .
Not all terrorism experts agree on the definition of terrorism , mostly because , as Wright argues , it might incriminate the U.S. government .
Another trick among such experts to exclude U.S. government actions is to use the term " terrorism " to apply only to attacks by small , non-governmental groups , rather than the much more potent terrorist attacks by governments .
That ploy is a curious twisting of the term " terror , " because the term originated during the French Revolution to describe the slaughter of the revolutionary French government .
Over the centuries , governments have had many more resources than the relatively poor ragtag groups and thus have slaughtered on a much grander scale .
Finally , these groups , like governments , sometimes perpetrate terrorist attacks and sometimes commit non-terrorist attacks .
A good analytical working definition of terrorism is the purposeful targeting of civilians in the adversary ’s country to get them to put pressure on their government to change policy .
After all , if a group or government is targeting an adversary ’s government or military , we probably should call this a " war , " not terrorist strikes .
Of course , the term " terrorism " is never neutral ; it ’s always politically charged .
Although it may be politically incorrect to say so , by the aforementioned analytical definition , only two - thirds of the successful attacks on 9/11 could be properly labeled as terrorist attacks .
Since the goal of al - Qaeda was to kill civilians in the two World Trade Center towers , these attacks could rightly be labeled terrorism .
The third attack was aimed at the Pentagon , the national command center of the U.S. military .
Since Osama bin Laden had declared war on the United States , this attack might be described as a diabolical surprise attack , but not terrorism per se .
Similarly , any attacks  whether against Israeli military or civilian targets  by Hamas and Hezbollah , groups that do not recognize Israel ’s right to exist , are incorrectly bundled together by the U.S. government and media as terrorist strikes .
By the prior analytical criterion , is Wright ’s accusation correct that the U.S. government ( notice I did not use the words " we " or " America " here ) has committed terrorist attacks ?
Wright mentioned the attacking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic bombs at the end of World War II .
( One might also add the conventional fire - bombings of German and Japanese cities . )
The primary goal of these attacks was to purposefully attack the adversary ’s civilian population in order to damage morale and motivate the enemy ’s citizens to pressure their government to sue for peace .
Proponents of such bombing will say that the enemy was nefarious , and in the case of Japan , dropping the atomic bombs obviated the need for a U.S. invasion , thus saving the lives of many U.S. military personnel .
Nevertheless , by the analytical definition , these attacks were terrorist strikes that were questionable when the war had already been won , when the United States knew that the Japanese had made overtures to surrender , and when exchanging the lives of civilians to save military combatants was morally dubious .
Furthermore , because Japan is an island , instead of an invasion , the United States simply could have blockaded the Japanese into surrender  which would have been much more humane , especially if emergency food and medical supplies were allowed to transit the quarantine .
Although Wright does not mention these added examples , the U.S. also bombed dams in North Korea during the Korean War to flood the fields and starve the population , and President Richard Nixon , during the Vietnam War , carpet - bombed North Vietnam ( unlike the graduated bombing campaign of President Lyndon Johnson ) and scolded Henry Kissinger that Kissinger was excessively worried about civilian casualties .
In the Philippine insurrection after the U.S. " liberated " the islands during the Spanish - American War of 1898 , the U.S. military burned villages and crops , committed many atrocities against civilians , and engaged in torture .
But what about Wright ’s implication that U.S. foreign policy causes blowback terrorism against the United States ?
Again , the facts are on his side .
Poll after poll in the Arab / Islamic world indicates that U.S. political and economic freedoms , technology , and even culture are popular in these countries , but U.S. interventionist foreign policy toward the Middle East is not .
Bin Laden has repeatedly said that he attacks the United States because of its occupation of Muslim lands and its support for corrupt Middle Eastern governments .
Finally , empirical studies have linked U.S. foreign occupation and military interventions with blowback terrorism against U.S. targets .
The upshot of Wright ’s remarks is that if the United States militarily intervened less overseas , the chickens would not be roosting as much in the U.S. henhouse .
It is too bad that Wright ’s largely correct analysis of U.S. foreign policy is being thrown out along with his wacky and bigoted ravings .
Abyssal adjective 1 . of or like an abyss ; immeasurable ; unfathomable from Dictionary.com
When I look at past economic downturns , I look at five key components to determine how bad they were and what the capabilities and challenges were in terms of getting the country out of the negative cycle .
Those five key components are :
Consumer savings and spending / ability to spend Corporate income , health and spending / ability to spend Government financial health and ability to spend
The lending and banking system and its ability to extend credit Inflation & scarcity of resources
Some people will look at my list and wonder why I do n't talk about unemployment or the price of stocks or other indicators but those items are all symptoms of issues with the five primary items I listed .
When corporate income is down affecting corporate health this affects stock prices , causes corporations to reduce spending and also results in layoffs and increasing unemployment .
Layoffs and rising unemployment typically cause consumer ability to spend to go down , obviously among the people who are laid off but also among those who fear that they might be laid off and thus need to save their money to prepare just in case they lose their jobs .
The most recent recession of 2001 - 2002 was a result of problems primarily with # 2 and a slight resultant hit on # 1 .
Businesses were struggling and thus were not spending money on non essential items and as a result most firms that rely on corporate customers lost money .
When they lost money , they laid people off .
Unemployment rose , but those consumers who were not laid off kept spending and this kept the economy from experiencing much more serious issues .
Throughout this period , the government was solvent , the lending and banking system lent huge amounts of money to businesses and individuals and prices were flat .
With the more severe downturn of 1979 , known as a global stagflation , items # 1 , # 2 and # 5 were the issues .
You had double digit inflation and unemployment , corporate spending was down , it was a real mess .
The great depression of 1929 featured massive problems with items # 1 , # 2 and # 4 .
Banks failed en masse , unemployment reached 25 % with obvious implications on consumers ' ability to spend .
If 1/4 of the country 's consumers did n't have money to spend , business income went way down and many companies failed completely .
As bad as some of these bad economic times were , none of those historic downturns compare with what is coming .
The depression of 1929 was eventually cured by government spending .
There is an argument as to whether peacetime government spending and programs before the outbreak of war officially ended the depression or whether government wartime spending ended it , but there is no argument as to where that spending originated .
The government went into the red to spend money on employing people and buying goods and services .
That got the economy going again .
But the government was solvent going into the depression and was not saddled by trillions of dollars in deficits .
Making it easier was that the depression , along with recessions like the one in 2001 - 2002 were more traditional downturns in that they did not have an inflationary component .
Economists once thought that stagflation , the combination of rising prices and a recession economy , was not possible .
The 1979 stagflation proved that it was possible .
It creates an entirely new set of issues in trying to get the economy started again because the worry is that any steps that are taken may fuel additional inflation1 .
Our current economic picture features serious issues with all five of my key components .
Consumers have had a negative savings rate over the last 6 - 8 years , grew massive credit card and lending debts and have no more money to spend2 .
Corporate income is down thus corporate spending is down3 .
Corporations have generally stopped hiring and some have started to lay people off , the unemployment rate is higher this year in almost every state than it was last year at this time4 .
The government is running at huge deficits and is hemorrhaging money on two wars after giving several massive tax cut giveaways 5 6 7 8 .
The government does n't have the ability to spend us out of a major crisis .
The lending and banking system is reeling from the mortgage and credit crises and as a result has very little money to lend to fund new ventures .
Examples of this are the collapse of Bear Stearns and UBS ' & Deutsche Bank 's flirtation with insolvency9 .
When major Swiss banks like UBS flirt with failing , it 's hard to argue against the idea that the economic sky is falling .
Finally , inflation is on the rise , most people know about the huge rise in the price of oil and all the downstream price increases that this causes , but few in the US so far are aware that the entire world is experiencing a food shortage and thus food prices are rising separate from the fact that the price of transporting food is also increasing due to increasing fuel prices .
We have experienced the beginnings of serious food price increases here in the US , but in the three month period from December 2007 to February 2008 , France experienced a more than 40 % increase in food prices .
US consumer prices were up 4.1 % in 2007 , the sharpest increase in prices in 17 years ( since 1990 ) .
1
That is just the beginning of the inflationary problems , particularly if the government starts throwing stimulus money at the situation .
When you have negative pressures from several of the key components , they reinforce each other and work together to drive the economy down .
When it is all of them , the combined downward pressure on the economy has got to be immense .
We do n't know for sure how bad it is going to get because nothing like this has ever happened before .
The only things that are better right now versus any other downturn is that if you compare our current issues with the 1929 - 1939 depression , we have n't had a major crash in stock prices and we have better regulations on the banking and financial markets ( particularly on margin buying ) as well as some governmental banking insurance like the FDIC .
But how much ability does the FDIC / Federal government have to bail out the banks if they start failing with the severe deficits the federal government is already running ?
The economy is going to be at least bad enough so that we need a new name to call it .
A recess is a small indentation while a depression is a larger hole , so I think this new worse economic crisis should by called an Abyssal , and since it comes with inflation , it will be a Stagflationary Abyssal .
How bad could this Abyssal get ?
It 's always risky to try and predict things like this but I expect to see major corrections in the equity markets .
I see a Dow in the 7000 - 9000 range , the S&P 500 struggling to stay over the 1000 mark and a NASDAQ in the 1400 - 1600 range .
I see unemployment and inflation both between fifteen to twenty five percent .
I see many consumers defaulting on their credit cards and the major crisis in the banking and lending industry will be compounded by hordes of consumers defaulting on their credit cards .
As a result of these credit card defaults , more banks will fail and major banking insurers will fail as a result as well as investment funds and securities that are based on credit card debt .
I believe there will be consumer and corporate bankruptcies on a massive scale .
My next article will discuss in depth things that could be done to mitigate this coming crisis .

Other stuff I 've reluctantly liked in the past three years :
-- Posted Monday , 26 May 2008 | Digg This Article | Source : GoldSeek.com
The story you are about to read is true .
The names have not been changed to protect the innocent .
But first , a little background material is called for .
The Federal Reserve System was granted a monopoly over monetary policy on December 23 , 1913 , when the Senate voted to pass the House 's bill , which had been passed on December 22 .
President Wilson signed the bill into law that evening .
Ever since that fateful day , economists have done their best to get their opinions on monetary policy accepted by the FED .
The only exception to this generalization is the Austrian School of economics .
Their members , who are few in number and are generally without influence , do not believe that a government - licensed monopoly is capable of setting monetary policy without distorting the free flow of capital , especially the most crucial form of capital : information .
So , they do not attempt to influence staff economists at the FED .
They know it is a waste of time .
RIVAL SCHOOLS OF OPINION
There are several views of how monetary policy should be conducted .
The most famous view is that of Milton Friedman .
He argued for decades that the gold standard is a waste of gold , since governments must store gold in vaults .
This valuable commodity could be used for productive purposes .
He wanted every nation 's central bank to produce money at all times at a constant rate .
He never decided on a rate .
He suggested a range : 3 % to 5 % per annum .
This view was the conservative opinion when I was in graduate school .
Keynesian economists argue for monetary policy to accompany fiscal policy .
It must be subservient to fiscal policy .
The central bank should partially finance government deficits in times of economic recession , when governments are supposed to run massive deficits .
The central bank should buy government debt with newly created money .
Its staff economists should decide which rate of inflation is the best at any given time .
This is also pretty much the view of supply - side economists , who argue that government deficits do n't matter .
They recommend reduced marginal income tax rates and corporate tax rates , but they almost never argue in public during a recession that the government should also cut spending to match reduced taxation .
They also do not argue that the central bank is unwise to expand money in a recession .
As long as marginal tax rates are cut , they do n't care much about monetary policy .
A few of them call for a strange kind of gold standard , one which does n't issue money that allows everyone to demand payment in gold by the Federal government at a price fixed by law .
Why , I do n't know .
It is a pseudo - gold standard .
These groups agree on one thing : there should never be a central bank policy of monetary contraction .
This means that the central bank should never sell government debt without purchasing an offsetting asset of some kind .
This is the monetary ratchet .
The money supply never falls .
Whenever it rises , due to central bank policy , this increase becomes permanent .
Austrian School economists are in fundamental opposition to all three majority schools of opinion .
They believe that money should be private , that contracts promising to pay in a monetary unit of account should be enforced , that no bank should be given a monopoly by the government , and that the public should decide what constitutes money through their dealings , not through legislative fiat .
The civil government should get out of money production altogether .
To illustrate the conflict between the Austrian School and the Chicago School , Mark Skousen designed a test .
I was present when he conducted this test � or , as the case may be , sprang the trap .
I reprint the following without alteration .
I sent this document to Skousen on the day I wrote it .
He agreed with me at the time that this account is an accurate summary of what he did and why .
SKOUSEN'S TEST OF MONETARY THEORY I am writing this on October 17 , 1998 On the evening of October 15 , I went out to dinner with Mark Skousen , Van Simmons , and Milton and Rose Friedman .
It was at Mark 's invitation .
We went to the Commander 's Palace in New Orleans .
We were in town for the annual Blanchard Seminar .
Mark had arranged to have Van Simmons bring a U.S. gold coin , dated 1912 , which was Milton Friedman 's year of birth .
He is in the rare coin business .
It had been hard to locate .
The year is rare .
He had it sent from Switzerland by Federal Express overnight that same day .
The Swiss contact had only one such coin .
Before the evening had gone more than a few minutes , Friedman brought up the issue of our ( the Austrians ' ) ideological commitment to the gold standard .
The fact is , there is no ideological commitment to the gold standard among Austrian economists , since they do n't think the government should have any monetary standard except for tax payments .
They do not think governments should be in the money - production business .
Mises believed in free banking .
Rothbard believed in 100 % reserve banking , as does Friedman 's economist brother - in - law , Aaron Director .
As to which metal the free market adopts as its monetary standard , the Austrian does n't care , although he thinks gold is the most likely for international trade .
Silver is second .
The important thing for the Austrian is that there be no legal tender laws and no price control schemes setting the exchange rate of one currency or metal in relation to another .
There should be no legal compulsion over money , other than to enforce contracts .
The Rothbardians do argue that the fractional reserve system is fraudulent and therefore should be prohibited .
But their problem is : Prohibited by whom ?
They do not believe in the State .
Friedman had said at least twice that he did not understand why there is an ideological commitment to gold by us , meaning Mark and me .
Perhaps 15 minutes later , Mark brought out an old $ 20 gold paper note , issued by the government ( pre-1913 ) .
It was a written contact : to pay gold to the bearer .
He asked Milton to pull out a $ 20 bill and read the contact .
It makes no such promise .
Then Mark took Friedman 's bill and tore it up .
Milton looked at the bill 's remains , lying on the table .
He was silent at first .
Mark then handed him the $ 20 gold piece .
But Friedman pushed it away .
" I do n't want it .
I want the $ 20 .
I did n't authorize you to tear it up . "
This was of course true .
But there had been compensation economically , at about 30 to one .
Mark was trying to make a point about broken contracts : the government 's abandonment of gold pre-1934 gold contracts .
The point was lost on Friedman .
Friedman then said it was wrong to tear up a $ 20 bill , because doing so passed some appreciation to all other holders of paper money .
In theory , this is correct .
Empirically , it would be impossible to measure or prove .
After a few minutes , Friedman calmed down .
Mark had to give him a replacement $ 20 bill to calm him down .
Friedman did like the coin , with his birthdate on it .
He decided to keep it .
What struck me after the dinner was over was Friedman 's ideological commitment to paper money .
A $ 600 coin was nothing ; that lost $ 20 bill was everything .
The tearing up of that bill was almost like an act of sacrilege in his eyes .
The coin did not compensate him .
Only a replacement bill did .
He has spent his career arguing for paper money and against a metallic standard .
Before the coin incident , he had repeated several times his old argument that digging up metal is a waste of scarce resources .
He has never understood that the costs of digging up metal � that portion of gold used for money rather then jewelry or industry � in the legal world of a gold standard is a very cheap way for society to restrict governments from inflating .
If governments are in the money production business , then they should be limited by the costs of producing the money metals .
These costs chain their lust for spending fiat money and avoiding direct taxation .
Men often do not see their own ideological commitments .
They see only their opponents ' ideologies .
I shall not publish this report in Friedman 's lifetime .
He has done yeoman service in battling price controls and taxation .
No need to embarrass him .
But in money matters , he was ideologically committed to the State as the final arbiter of money .
He just wanted the bureaucrats to run the system by his recommended 3 % to 5 % increase in money per year .
They refused .

WHAT IS THE SOLUTION ?
The solution is freedom .
I have outlined the solution in my 1987 book , Honest Money .
You can download it here .
The free market can be trusted in monetary affairs .
Anyone who defends the free market in most areas of the economy and then insists that the civil government can be trusted to conduct a fair and efficient monetary policy needs to explain his reasons .
I have found that the economists who defend central banking do not explain why a cartel in banking is in the public interest but cartels in every other area of the economy are not in the public interest .
The most free market oriented of all first - year college economic textbooks is the one written by Gwartney and Stroup .
This is the only one written by members of the " public choice " school of economics , which is famous for arguing that every government employee is governed by the same self - interest as anyone else , including capitalists .
In the 4th edition ( 1987 ) , we read : Central banks are charged with the responsibility of carrying out monetary policy .
The major purpose of the Federal Reserve System ( and other central banks ) is to regulate the money supply and provide a monetary climate that is in the interest of the entire economy ( p. 281 ) .
The authors then devote ten pages of text to a description of the operations of the FED , without one word of criticism , and openly denying the private legal status of the system : " In reality , it would be more accurate to think of the Fed and the executive branch as equal partners in the determination of policies designed to promote full employment and stable prices " ( p. 283 ) .
Equal partners ?
I have a few questions .
What happened to Congress , which the Constitution assigns exclusive power over the purse ?
What happened to the laws of economics ?
What happened to self - interest ?
What happened to the economic analysis of monopoly , which the authors apply to every other area of the economy ?
The authors do not even hint at the possibility that any of these issues is relevant .
They continue .
Public enterprises can thus be expected to use at least some of their monopoly power , not to benefit the wide cross-section of disorganized taxpayers and consumers , but as a cloak for inefficient operation and actions to advance the personal and political objectives of those who exercise control over the firm .
Government ownership , like unregulated monopoly and government regulation , is a less ideal solution .
It is not especially surprising that those who denounce monopoly in , for instance , the telephone industry seldom point to a government - operated monopoly � such as the Post Office � as an example of how an industry should be run ( pp. 466�67 ) .
The authors by this stage in their textbook had already pointed to just such a government monopoly ( as they incorrectly and misleadingly defined it ) , the most powerful and profitable monopoly of all , the monopoly over money creation and monetary policy : central banking .
They discussed the FED in Chapter 12 , " Money and the Banking System " before they presented Chapter 19 , " Monopoly and High Barriers to Entry . "
The authors expect the reader to fail to notice this theoretical discontinuity , as if there were some economic justification of the inapplicability of Chapter 19's analysis to Chapter 12 .
This is a safe assumption .
Most students do not notice .
Neither does Congress .
If there is any area of the economy that cannot safely be trusted to the government or a government - licensed central bank it is monetary affairs .
This is licensed counterfeiting .
The authority to counterfeit money to increase government purchases � through the sale of government debt � will be misused .
The best book on this is by Jesus Huerta de Soto , Money , Bank Credit , and Economic Cycles ( 2006 ) , published by the Mises Institute .
You can download it for free here , but it 's wise to buy it in hardback .
SOVEREIGNTY
The intellectual battle over monetary theory is ultimately a battle over the issue of sovereignty .
Which agency possesses lawful sovereignty � a final say � over the operation of the monetary system ?
The answer of the vast majority of economists is this : the state .
They believe that sovereignty over money is an inherent aspect of civil government .
But they never admit to their readers that sovereignty is the supreme issue , nor do they admit that they have taken a stand in favor of state sovereignty .
They never discuss the reasons for their commitment to state sovereignty in monetary affairs .
They also do not use the argument for efficiency .
Why not ?
Because in the rest of their writings , they have exposed the fallacy of the concept of government efficiency .
It would be difficult for them to make the case for a cartel as the preferred engine of efficiency .
What remains ?
Ethics .
They must show that , because of the issue of right and wrong , of good vs. evil , the state must have a monopoly over money , and not just a monopoly , but a transferable monopoly .
They must show that the cartel of profit - seeking counterfeiters has a moral claim of this delegated sovereignty over money .
They never do this .
They never raise the issue of ethics in money .
There is one exception : Murray Rothbard .
He placed ethics front and center in his discussion of monetary policy .
His textbook on money and banking , The Mystery of Banking , is the only textbook by an economist that does this .
This is one reason why no college or university has assigned it in over two decades .
You can download it here .
Rothbard showed why the cartel over money is immoral .
He also showed why it is inefficient , if by " efficient " we mean " not inflating , not creating recessions , and not redistributing wealth from the those who trust the government to skeptics who know the game is rigged against the common man . "
CONCLUSION
We do not have a free market in money .
We have a self - interested cartel .
This cartel will do whatever it can to protect its lucrative monopoly over money .
You would be wise to assume , as in all other areas of the economy , that the following offer is suspect : " I 'm from the government , and I 'm here to help you . "

Arthur Simpson , a professional forester , always thought that everyone likes a tree .
Then he moved to New York .
“ It ’s not unusual for people to say they do n’t want it , ” said Mr. Simpson , the “ it ” referring to whatever tree the city has resolved to plant in a swatch of sidewalk or other public space .
Mr. Simpson is privy to some of those objections because he works for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation , one of 40 or so foresters helping to execute Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ’s million - tree initiative , a plan the mayor announced ( one year ago this week ) to blitz the city ’s five boroughs with a million trees by the year 2017 .
If you ’re a forester perversely inclined to ply your trade in New York City , the initiative makes now a pretty good time to make a go of it .
The city hired 24 foresters in the past year , a good majority of them hailing from places where trees are not exactly controversial .
Mr. Simpson , 32 , lived and worked in the open spaces of Montana , Oregon and , most recently , Arizona , before hitting it off with a New York - based opera singer whom he met at a party .
Now he lives in Queens .
All told , Mr. Simpson has adjusted well to his new urban habitat :
He ’s got some family in the area , and in the past year he ’s even been to five operas , five more than he ’d ever seen before moving to the city .
A laid - back , fleece - wearing , barely shaven kind of guy , your typical central - casting kind of forester , Mr. Simpson has been really surprised by only one aspect of New York City life , and that ’s the unwelcome reception he sometimes get at the site of an imminent tree - planting .
Editor 's Note :
This is an extended version of the story that original ran in the June 2008 issue of Scientific American .
The recent surge in world food prices is already creating havoc in poor countries , and worse is to come .
Food riots are spreading across Africa , though many are unreported in the international press .
Moreover , the surge in wheat , maize and rice prices seen on commodities markets have not yet fully percolated into the shops and stalls of the poor countries or the budgets of relief organizations .
Nor has the budget crunch facing relief organizations such as the World Food Program , which must buy food in world markets , been fully felt .
The results could be calamitous unless offsetting policy actions are taken rapidly .
The facts are stark .
A metric ton of wheat cost around $ 375 on the commodity exchanges in early 2006 .
In March 2008 , it stood at over $ 900 .
Maize has gone from around $ 250 to $ 560 in the same period .
Rice prices have also soared .
The physical inventories of grain relative to demand are also down sharply in recent years .
Several factors are at play in the skyrocketing prices , reflecting both rising global demand and falling supplies of food grains .
World incomes have been rising at around 5 percent annually in recent years , and 4 percent in per capita terms , leading to an increased global demand for food and for meat as a share of the diet .
China ’s economic growth , of course , has been double the world ’s average .
The rising demand for meat exacerbates the pressures on grain and oil - seed prices since several kilograms of animal feed are required to produce each kilogram of meat .
Feed grains have risen from around 30 percent of total global grain production to around 40 percent today .
Land that would otherwise be planted to the main grains is shifting to soya bean and other oil seeds used for animal feed .
It is forecast , for example , that U.S. farmers will cut maize plantings by 8 million acres , while raising soya - bean production by about the same amount .
The grain supply side has also been disrupted by climate shocks , such as Australia ’s massive droughts .
An even bigger blow has been the U.S. decision to subsidize conversion of maize into ethanol to blend with gasoline .
This wrong - headed policy , pushed by an aggressive farm lobby , gives a 51 - cent tax credit for each gallon of ethanol blended into gasoline .
The 2005 Energy Policy
Act mandates a minimum of 7.5 billion gallons of domestic renewable - fuel production , which will overwhelmingly be corn- based ethanol , by 2012 .
Consequently , up to a third of the U.S. mid-Western maize crop this year will be converted to ethanol , causing a cascade of price increases across the food chain .
( Worse , use of ethanol instead of gasoline does little to reduce net carbon emissions once the energy - intensive full cycle of ethanol production -- including the energy - intensive fertilizer and transport needs -- is taken into account . )
The food price increases are pummeling poor food - importing regions , with Africa by far the hardest hit .
Several countries , such as Egypt , India and Vietnam , have cut off their rice exports in response to soaring prices at home , thereby exacerbating the effects on rice - importing countries .
Even small changes in food prices can push the poor into hunger and destitution : as famously expounded by Nobel laureate Amartya Sen , some of the greatest famines in history were caused not by massive declines in grain production but rather by losses in the purchasing power of the poor .
At a time when hundreds of billions of dollars each year veer to war rather than peaceful development , and when media attention is riveted on the U.S. financial crises , it is hard to raise even a few billion dollars for desperately hungry people .
Still , it is urgent to do so .
At least four measures should be taken in response to soaring food prices .
First , the world should heed the call of U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon to fund a massive increase in Africa ’s own food production .
The needed technologies are available — high - yield seeds , fertilizer , small - scale irrigation — but the financing is not .
The new African Green Revolution would initially subsidize peasant farmers ’ access to high - yield technologies and thereby at least double grain yields .
The funding would also help farm communities establish long - term micro-finance institutions to ensure continued access to improved agricultural inputs after the temporary subsidies are ended in a few years .
Second , the U.S. should end its misguided corn - to - ethanol subsidies .
Farmers hardly need them given world demand for food and feed grains .
There is certainly a case for re-doubling the scientific efforts to produce bio-fuels on lands which do not compete with food crops , for example from cellulosic ethanol , but this technology is still not ready for the market .
Third , the world should support longer - term research into higher agricultural production .
Shockingly , the Bush administration is proposing to cut sharply the U.S. funding for tropical agriculture research in the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research ( CGIAR ) , just when that research is most urgently needed .
This is an example of the Administration ’s anti-scientific approach at its worst .
Finally , the world should follow through on the promised Climate Adaptation Fund announced last December in the Bali Climate Change conference , to help poor countries face the growing risks to food production from increasingly adverse climate conditions .
Even as the world staunches the immediate crisis , there will be more wrenching dislocations as drought , heat stress , pest infestations and other climate - induced shocks occur increasingly often .
This story was originally printed with the title , " Surging Food Prices " .
Torture Questions Hover Over Chertoff John
Yoo and some other Bush administration lawyers who built the legal framework for torture are now out of the U.S. government , but one still holds a Cabinet - level rank – Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff .

In the summer of 2002 , Chertoff , then head of the Justice Department ’s Criminal Division , offered assurances to the CIA that its interrogators would not face prosecution under anti-torture laws if they followed guidelines on aggressive techniques approved by the Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , where Yoo worked .
Those guidelines stretched the rules on permissible treatment of detainees by narrowly defining torture as intense pain equivalent to organ failure or death .
Specific interrogation techniques were gleaned from a list of methods that the U.S. military feared might be used against American soldiers if they were captured by a ruthless enemy .
Three years ago , when Chertoff was facing confirmation hearings to be Homeland Security chief , the New York Times cited three senior - level government sources as describing Chertoff ’s Criminal Division as fielding questions from the CIA about whether its officers risked prosecution if they employed certain harsh techniques .
“ One technique the CIA officers could use under circumstances without fear of prosecution was strapping a subject down and making him experience a feeling of drowning , ” the Times reported .
In other words , Chertoff appears to have green - lighted the technique known as “ waterboarding , ” which has been regarded as torture since the days of the Spanish Inquisition .
Chertoff reportedly did object to some other procedures , such as death threats against family members and mind - altering drugs that would change a detainee ’s personality , the Times reported .
[ NYT , Jan. 29 , 2005 ]
During his Senate confirmation hearings in February 2005 , Chertoff denied providing the CIA with legal guidance on the use of specific interrogation methods , such as waterboarding .
Rather , he said he gave the agency broad guidance in response to questions about interrogation methods .
" You are dealing in an area where there is potential criminality , " Chertoff said in describing his advice to the CIA .
" You better be very careful to make sure that whatever you decide to do falls well within what is required by law . "
Nevertheless , the evidence continues to build that Chertoff ’s assurances gave CIA interrogators confidence they would avoid prosecution as long as they stayed within the permissive guidelines devised by deputy assistant attorney general John Yoo and his boss at the Office of Legal Counsel , Jay Bybee .
The Abu Zubaydah Case Chertoff ’s reported assurances to CIA agents appear to have led directly to the use of waterboarding against alleged al - Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah in August 2002 .
" The CIA was seeking to determine the legal limits of interrogation practices for use in cases like that of Abu Zubaydah , the Qaeda lieutenant who was captured in March 2002 , " according to the New York Times article .
The Abu Zubaydah case was the first time that waterboarding was used against a prisoner in the “ war on terror , ” according to Pentagon and Justice Department documents , news reports and several books written about the Bush administration ’s interrogation methods .
In The One Percent Doctrine , author Ron Suskind reported that President George W. Bush had become obsessed with Zubaydah and the information he might have about pending terrorist plots against the United States .
" Bush was fixated on how to get Zubaydah to tell us the truth , " Suskind wrote .
Bush questioned one CIA briefer , " Do some of these harsh methods really work ? "
The waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah was videotaped , but that record was destroyed in November 2005 after the Washington Post published a story that exposed the CIA 's use of so - called " black site " prisons overseas to interrogate terror suspects .
John Durham , an assistant attorney general in Connecticut , was appointed special counsel earlier this year to investigate the destruction of that videotape as well as destroyed film on other interrogations .
The CIA officials who pressed Chertoff to give assurances protecting CIA interrogators included former CIA General Counsel Scott Muller and his deputy , John Rizzo , according to the New York Times .
Muller and Rizzo , who is now the CIA ’s general counsel , are at the center of Durham ’s probe .
The Times also reported that Chertoff participated in the drafting of a second still - secret memo in August 2002 , which allegedly described specific interrogation methods that CIA interrogators could use against detainees .
Those interrogation techniques were derived from the Army and Air Force ’s Survival , Evasion , Rescue , and Escape ( SERE ) training program .
But those techniques were meant to prepare U.S. soldiers for abuse they might suffer if captured by a brutal regime , not as methods for U.S. interrogations .
New ACLU Document Release
This past week , the American Civil Liberties Union released more than 300 pages of documents showing that in 2003 military interrogators used methods they learned during SERE training against eight Afghanistan detainees held at the Gardez Detention Facility in southeastern Afghanistan .
Those methods included forcing a detainee to kneel outside in wet clothing , spraying the person with cold water , and punching and kicking a detainee over the course of three weeks .
One of the prisoners , an 18 - year - old Afghan militia fighter named Jamal Naseer , later died .
The documents released to the ACLU say his body was so severely beaten by his interrogators that it appeared to be a black and green color at the time of his death .
Amrit Singh , an ACLU attorney , said the SERE tactics that were approved by the Justice Department were never intended to be used by the U.S. government against its detainees .
The latest disclosures further erode claims by President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that prisoner abuses at Gardez – or the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib – were isolated acts by a few “ bad apples . ”
To the contrary , it appears that the policies approved by Bush and the assurances provided by Chertoff and others led to the atrocities at the CIA detention centers as well as the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay .
An action memorandum , dated Feb. 7 , 2002 , and signed by President Bush , stated that the Geneva Convention did not apply to members of al - Qaeda or the Taliban .
That , in turn , led Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez , the top commander in Iraq to institute a “ dozen interrogation methods beyond ” the Army ’s standard practice under the convention , according to a 2004 report on the prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prepared by a panel headed by James Schlesinger .
Sanchez said he based his decision on “ the President 's Memorandum , ” which he said had justified " additional , tougher measures " against detainees , the Schlesigner report said .
Other prisoner abuses resulted from Rumsfeld ’s verbal and written authorization in December 2002 allowing interrogators to use “ stress positions , isolation for up to 30 days , removal of clothing and the use of detainees ' phobias ( such as the use of dogs ) , ” according to a separate report issued by Army Maj.
Gen. George R. Fay .
“ From December 2002 , interrogators in Afghanistan were removing clothing , isolating people for long periods of time , using stress positions , exploiting fear of dogs and implementing sleep and light deprivation , ” the Fay report said .
Mora ’s Complaint Rumsfeld ’s approval of certain interrogation methods outlined in a December 2002 action memorandum was criticized by Alberto Mora , the former general counsel of the Navy .
“ The interrogation techniques approved by the Secretary [ of Defense ] should not have been authorized because some ( but not all ) of them , whether applied singly or in combination , could produce effects reaching the level of torture , a degree of mistreatment not otherwise proscribed by the memo because it did not articulate any bright - line standard for prohibited detainee treatment , a necessary element in any such document , ” Mora wrote in a 14 - page letter to the Navy ’s inspector general .
Additionally , a Dec. 20 , 2005 , Army Inspector General Report relating to the capture and interrogation of Mohammad al - Qahtani included a sworn statement by Lt. Gen. Randall M. Schmidt .
It said Secretary Rumsfeld was “ personally involved ” in the interrogation of al - Qahtani and spoke “ weekly ” with Maj .
Gen. Geoffrey Miller , the commander at Guantanamo , about the status of the interrogations between late 2002 and early 2003 .
Gitanjali S. Gutierrez , an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights who represents al - Qahtani , said in a sworn declaration that his client , imprisoned at Guantanamo , was subjected to months of torture based on verbal and written authorizations from Rumsfeld .
“ At Guantánamo , Mr. al - Qahtani was subjected to a regime of aggressive interrogation techniques , known as the ‘ First Special Interrogation Plan , ’ that were authorized by U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , ” Gutierrez said .
“ Those techniques were implemented under the supervision and guidance of Secretary Rumsfeld and the commander of Guantánamo , Major General Geoffrey Miller .
These methods included , but were not limited to , 48 days of severe sleep deprivation and 20 - hour interrogations , forced nudity , sexual humiliation , religious humiliation , physical force , prolonged stress positions and prolonged sensory over - stimulation , and threats with military dogs . ”
Gutierrez ’s claims about the type of interrogation al - Qahtani endured have since been borne out with the release of hundreds of pages of internal Pentagon documents describing interrogation methods at Guantanamo and at least two independent reports about prisoner abuse .
According to the Schlesinger report , orders signed by Bush and Rumsfeld in 2002 and 2003 authorizing brutal interrogations “ became policy ” at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib .
In February , the Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) confirmed that it launched a formal investigation to determine , among other issues , whether agency attorneys , including Chertoff , provided the White House and the CIA with poor legal advice when it said CIA interrogators could use harsh interrogation methods against detainees .

PARIS  The English - language offshoot of Al Jazeera , the Arabic television news network , is pushing for a “ breakthrough ” that would make the channel available to American TV viewers and help it move beyond a turbulent start - up phase , according to its new managing director , Tony Burman .
The hiring of Mr. Burman , a former editor in chief of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , the Canadian public broadcaster , was announced last week .
Al Jazeera English ’s first year and a half has been marked by intense scrutiny of its coverage and by the recent defection of several high - profile Western journalists who had been recruited to lend credibility to the channel .
Al Jazeera English , which is part of the Al Jazeera Network , based in Qatar , also announced distribution agreements last week in markets as far - flung as Portugal , Ukraine and Vietnam , increasing its potential audience to 110 million homes .
Conspicuously absent , however , was the United States , where Al Jazeera is still largely unavailable on television .
Viewers can watch it on the Web through a deal with YouTube , the online video service .

“ It Is Impossible To Distinguish A Creationist From A Parody Of A Creationist ”
. : In my last post I linked to what I thought was a clever parody of creationist thinking , Argument by technobabble ?
I ’m still certain the author is a crafty prankster , especially after reading this interesting analysis of the author ’s name .
. : But like all great stories , there ’s more .
Taking a cue from Gandhi , hblavatsky writes :
1. First they ignore you : Leading ID researchers such as Behe , Dembski and Ujvarosy have been prevented from publishing their work in many peer - reviewed journals .
It ’s not that our research is n’t good enough , it ’s just too radical for the mainstream biological establishment .
Ask yourself , why is it that most mainstream biologists refuse to debate the Evolution controversy with us ?
I suspect that it is part of a deliberate and organized conspiracy to marginalize our exciting and important discoveries .
2 . Then they fight you :
The evolutionists have started an unprovoked war against us .
They will stop at nothing at all to restrict our academic freedom until every American kid is taught the lie of evolution .
At this stage their goal is to frighten anybody who dares to oppose Darwinism into an oppressed silence .
The recent Dover trial shows that evolutionists are prepared to use every trick in the book to keep their foothold , but like the oppressors that Ghandi fought , every act of suppression only hastens the revolution .
America has seen what neo -Darwinists are capable of , and will not be so easily beat the 2nd time .
3 . Then they laugh at you :
That awful film â€ œA Flock of Dodosâ€ is only the tip of the iceberg .
When unhinged evolutionists know that they have lost the argument they can only resort to mockery and cruel ad - hominem remarks .
If you search Technorati search for external comments about Overwhelming Evidence , you will notice that the overwhelming proportion are written by neo -Darwinism apologists who have nothing better to do than to mock us .
For example , this article by â€œ90 % Trueâ€ is probably less than 1 % true .
He unfairly attacks OE Blogger Quizzlestick for daring to reveal the scientific applications of ID philosophy .
Internet nut - case â€ œShelly The Republicanâ€ is no better .
Her mockery takes the form of copying a number of our articles without permission .
As you can see , she has taken one of my articles and added what she believes are humorous images in order to use my words against us .
I am considering legal action against her organization on the grounds of blatant copyright abuse .
If your articles have been stolen by this site I urge you to contact me as soon as possible .
If we work together we can silence these jokers .
. : I ’m honored , I really am .
At this point I see two options : I can risk taking these people and their writings seriously , or I can treat them as the clever jokes they are .
If I opt for the former , and incontrovertible evidence surfaces that proves they are in fact parodies , I ’ll be the dope who did n’t get the joke — and nobody likes being that guy .
However , if I smile and go along with the joke , and it turns out these people really are serious . . . well then that does n’t necessarily reflect bad on me , now does it ?
. : As it happens , I know one of the moderators of Overwhelming Evidence personally .
He ’s on my university ’s quizbowl team , and I know as well as one can know that he really is an intelligent design creationist .
But it brings me no end of joy to see such a terrible waste of internet resources overrun with uncontrollable hijinks from posters like hblavatsky , HaEris , and TroutMac , the latter of which wrote this hilariously bad bit of reasoning :
I like to think of it this wayâ€ ¦think of DNA as a set of blueprints , like for a building of some sort .
On the one hand , you ’ve got blueprints for a simple “ organism ” â€¦ let ’s make it a storage shed .
One room , a pair of doors , a roof , etc. Pretty simply .
Maybe one page is all it takes to describe how that shed is built .
Now , compare that to blueprints for a 4 bedroom house .
Now you ’ve got multiple rooms , a bunch more doors , plumbing ( that ’s a whole new system thereâ€¦ the shed did n’t need plumbing ) and electrical ( also a whole new system ) , windows , insulation , etc .
This might be a 20 page set of blueprints .
The question is , how are you going to get all the new information that describes how the 4 - bedroom house is built from JUST the information for the storage shed ?
Never happen .
. : You ’d almost have to be a real creationist to be able to write such confused gobbledygook .
And the best part is : if it were legitimate creationist thinking , there ’s no way a reasonable moderator would keep it while discarding a perceived parody , because there ’s no way they could tell the two apart !
. : Now , I realized I ’ve made a ( somewhat ) serious charge against the people at Overwhelming Evidence .
I think , what with the available ( and hilarious ) evidence , it ’s reasonable for me to conclude that OE has been overwhelmed with parodists .
BUT , like a good skeptic , I ’ve an open mind and will still consider the possibility that these people are completely , utterly , and cluelessly honest .

Rogue Government
May 24 , 2008
The federal government is continuing the incremental agenda to build a Ministry of Love styled detention camp system for the American people .
According to a report from the Los Angeles Times , the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency or ICE is building three new detention camps in the United States .
The detention facilities will be minimum - security residential facilities that the federal government says will be used to house illegal aliens .
Considering that the majority of the American people are against illegal immigration and just want immigrants to come into the country legally , most people will believe that this is a reasonable step to solve the illegal immigration problem .
Unfortunately , this is really nothing more than a phony solution to solve a problem that has been created by government policies that have been implemented to encourage the illegal alien problem .
The federal government is using the illegal immigration problem as an excuse to build the detention camp apparatus that is really meant for the American people .
This is pretty obvious considering Rex 84 , the Army ’s Civilian Inmate Labor Program , the preservation of detention camps for Japanese Americans used during World War II and additional detention facilities built by KBR .
Building a series of detention facilities is not going to resolve the illegal immigration problem with an administration that has supported policies to ensure as many illegal aliens enter the country as possible .
As the economy unravels and as more and more people begin to protest against this criminal government , the establishment will need these detention facilities to lock up large numbers of Americans .
Recently in Waterloo Iowa , the federal government through ICE and FEMA built a temporary detention facility on the National Cattle Congress fairgrounds to round up a group of illegal aliens working in the area .
Rounding up a few hundred illegal aliens does absolutely nothing to reverse the long standing policies that created the illegal immigration problem in the first place .
In fact , all they are doing to the illegal aliens they round up is to process them through their temporary FEMA camp .
This is clearly not an effective way to stop illegal immigration .
Under the guise of solving the illegal immigration issue they are simply having their people go through the motions in order to practice the deployment of a FEMA camp and the processing of live test subjects through the FEMA camp .
According to a report from Radar Magazine , top secret continuity of government operations includes a database called Main Core which contains a list of 8 million Americans .
During a national emergency , people in this database could be arrested and detained by government authorities .
In 2007 , George W. Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive 51 which gives the president authority over all three branches of government during a catastrophic emergency .
The Bush administration has also refused to reveal details on specific details of continuity of government operations to the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee .
Perhaps the Main Core database and the plans to round up American citizens listed in this database during a national emergency is one of the reasons why they are keeping these details secret .
FEMA has also announced that they are expanding a program to transport a large number of American citizens using trains during an emergency .
This is the same method that the Nazis used to transport large numbers of Jews and political dissidents to their death camps .
At the very least , the federal government is setting up some sort of Orwellian Ministry of Love system with these FEMA camps .
In George Orwell ’s book 1984 , thought criminals were taken away to the Ministry of Love where they were re-educated to love Big Brother .
These FEMA camps would serve as suitable places for the federal government to take away political dissidents and protesters .
If Radar Magazine ’s report on the Main Core database is accurate , this makes the possibility that these FEMA camps will be used for such a purpose quite real .
Top this off with the fact that S 1959 the Homegrown Terrorism and Violent Radicalization
Act of 2007 gives the federal government a blank check to establish various think tanks and commissions to study and target people who have certain belief systems under the guise of fighting terrorism and it becomes even scarier .
The U.S. House of Representatives has already passed their version of the bill by a vote of 404 - 6 .
The U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee has come out with a report suggesting that new legislation should be passed to deal with homegrown terrorism and the adoption of so called radical ideology .
What better way to deal with people who have certain belief systems than to put them in FEMA camps that will be used for the purposes of re-education ?
It is no secret that the Bush administration has maintained a policy that endorses torture .
The 81 page torture memo that was authored by former Deputy Attorney General John
Yoo is proof that the administration sought to justify torture using the phony terror war as cover .
There ’s little doubt that they are attempting to socially engineer the general public to accept torture as an acceptable practice .
If they are successful in doing this , they will undoubtedly utilize these practices in any sort of Ministry of Love styled re-education camp system .
At the very worst , the federal government is setting up these FEMA camps as a way to exterminate large numbers of people .
The elites of the world are obsessed with population reduction and these FEMA camps could easily be used to kill a large number of people .
These actions by the federal government should be of the utmost concern to the American people .
The executive branch is being incredibly secret about continuity of government operations , there is legislation pending that will give the government a blank check to label particular belief systems as homegrown terrorism , the administration has written memos justifying the use of torture , they are maintaining a database of people who they ’d round up during a national emergency and they are increasing the number of government run detention centers .
As the economy continues to unravel and as more and more people become unhappy with the criminals and tyrants that have taken over the government , there is a very good chance that the ever growing martial law apparatus could be used on the people .
This apparatus that they are setting up could be as bad if not worse than the Ministry of Love as depicted in George Orwell ’s book 1984 .

Open Source Software
my PhysicsLab is provided as open source software under the Apache 2.0 License .
Source code is available at https://github.com/myphysicslab/myphysicslab.
Online documentation is available .
There are around 50 different simulations in the source code , each of which has an example file which is mainly for development and testing .
These can also be used to show simulations offline ( when not connected to the internet ) .
The example files are available online in two forms :
advanced - compiled which loads faster .
Downloadable version for offline usage .

How Does It Work ?
Most of the simulation web pages show how the math is derived .
See for example the Single Spring simulation .
A physics simulation starts with a mathematical model whose variables define the state of the system at a given time .
Each variable represents the position or velocity of some part of the system .
The heart of a physics simulation is the set of differential equations that describe how the variables evolve over time .
The forces and geometry determine the equations .
The next step is getting the computer to solve the equations , a process that goes by the name numerical analysis .
The Runge Kutta method is a popular choice .
For simulations that involve collisions there are additional steps : we need to detect the collision and then back up in time to the moment before the collision to modify the velocities .
Finally , there are lots of programming details about how to represent objects on the computer display , how to handle user input , how to synchronize with real time , and so on .
The rigid body physics engine is the most sophisticated simulation shown here .
It is capable of replicating all of the other more specialized simulations .
The physics engine handles collisions and also calculates contact forces which allow objects to push against each other .

Units Of Measurement
The myPhysicsLab simulations do not have units of measurements specified such as meters , kilograms , seconds .
The units are dimensionless , they can be interpreted however you want , but they must be consistent within the simulation .
For example if we regard a unit of distance as one meter and a unit of time as one second , then a unit of velocity must be one meter / second .

About the Author
Hi , my name is Erik Neumann , I live in Seattle , WA , USA , and I am a self - employed software engineer .
I started developing this website in 2001 , both as a personal project to learn scientific computing , and with a vision of developing an online science museum .
I grew up in Chicago near the Museum of Science and Industry which I loved to visit and learn about science and math .
I got a BA in Mathematics at Oberlin College , Ohio , 1978 , and an MBA from Univerity of Chicago , 1984 .
My first software jobs were using the language APL which I enjoyed for its math - like conciseness and power .
I was fortunate to get involved in the Macintosh software industry early on in 1985 , joining MacroMind , which became Macromedia .
I led the software development at MacroMind as VP of Engineering for 5 years .
Our most significant product was VideoWorks , which was renamed Director , and lives on today as Adobe Director .
In the 1980's , the interactive multimedia concepts that are so common today were new and being developed .
VideoWorks was mainly an animation tool , but also incorporated programmable interactivity .
Our main competitors at that time were HyperCard , SuperCard , and Authorware .
Director was used in many different ways ; I am most proud that it became the preferred way to prototype software user interfaces for a time during the 90's .
Director was also used to develop the introductory " guided tour " tutorial that came with the Macintosh in the early years .
And of course , Director was used for all sorts of art , design , and marketing projects .
I went on to work at Apple Computer on new multimedia and user interface concepts involving digital agents , animated user interfaces , speech recognition and distributed information access .
In 1991 , there was a sudden flurry of activity when Apple and IBM were trying to set up a strategic partnership .
I became involved in the super - secret negotiations , and made the suggestion that what the world needed was a standard for multimedia that multimedia content creators could rely on to publish to ( ultimately this is what HTML became ) .
Based on these suggestions , Kaleida Labs was founded .
Our work there developed a product called ScriptX , which turned out to be very similar to Sun 's Java which was being developed at the same time .
ScriptX had goals of supporting all forms of multimedia : text , images , audio , video , animation ; being cross-platform ( Mac and Windows ) , interpreted , object oriented , with a garbage collector to manage memory .
I then moved to Seattle and turned my attention back to mathematics and science .
I relearned calculus by doing all the problems in my old college text book and took further math classes at the University of Washington .
I started developing this website as a way to practice what I was learning .
I am now happy to use excellent tools such as HTML and JavaScript , and leave their development to others .
I continue to work on physics simulations , with several new ones in development .

CNN founder rebukes US military spending , says global warming could spark cannibalism RAW STORY
Published : Thursday April 3 , 2008

This CNN founder Ted Turner , who bills himself as the largest private landowner in the country , has a message on global warming .
" We 'll be eight degrees hotter in 30 or 40 years and basically none of the crops will grow , " Turner said , speaking in a little - noticed interview on PBS ' Charlie Rose Thursday .
" Most of the people will have died and the rest of us will be cannibals ...
Civilization will have broken down .
The few people left will be living in a failed state  like Somalia or Sudan  and living conditions will be intolerable . "
The comments were picked up by Thursday 's Atlanta Journal Constitution .
" We 're too many people ; that 's why we have global warming , " he added .
" Too many people are using too much stuff . "
He said that individuals should pledge not to have more than one or two children .
He also criticized his onetime network , saying it has veered too far away from serious news -- specifically singling out Lou Dobbs ' show .
Concurrently , he said the military needs to be cut " way back . "
" Right now , the U.S. is spending $ 500 billion a year on the military , which is more than all 190 countries in the world put together , " he remarked .
" The two countries that the military industrial complex and some of our politicians would like to demonize and make enemies are Russia and China , " Turner said .
" China just wants to sell us shoes .
They 're not building landing craft to attack the United States , and Russia wants to be our friends , too . "
He said that despite the United States ' huge military budget , " we ca n't win in Iraq . "
" We 're being beaten by insurgents who do n't even have any tanks , they do n't have a headquarters , they do n't have a Pentagon , we do n't even know if they have any generals , " Turner told Rose .
Turner called the Iraqi insurgents " patriots " who " do n't like us because we invaded their country and occupied it .
Nobody likes to be invaded . "
It must be the water at Harvard University .
Illegal online trading of digital music files is running rampant in universities across the nation , but not at Harvard , according to the Recording Industry Association of America .
The RIAA , the legal lobbying group for the music industry , has sent out hundreds if not thousands of letters to universities asking them to " remove or disable access " to infringing materials the RIAA has detected on IP addresses linked to schools ranging from MIT , Stanford , University of Chicago to UC Berkeley and dozens more .
THREAT LEVEL reportedWednesday that there is a sudden surge in these so - called take - down notices , which often are the precursors to legal action by the RIAA seeking the student 's identity behind the IP address who is oftentimes then sued .
Harvard , however , seems immune from the RIAA 's file - sharing campaign that commenced last year against universities .
Perhaps it 's something in the water system at the Cambridge , MA. - based university that is hindering Harvard students from doing what their fellow students area doing at other universities .
" Harvard has n't gotten prelitigation letters or subpoenas asking for identification of an IP address , " said Wendy Selzter , a Berkman Center for Internet & Society fellow .
( A prelitigtion letter is one in which the RIAA sends to the school , and asks the school to forward to its students asking them to settle for thousands of dollars or face court action . )
Whether it ’s the water , the RIAA says Harvard students are exercising file - sharing restraint .
" While we have detected incidences of theft on the Harvard network , the levels are not sufficient enough to warrant legal action .
Of course , this could always change , depending on what we find , " RIAA spokeswoman Cara Duckworth tells THREAT LEVEL .
Duckworth said no school was " immune , " not even Harvard .
" We try to manage our program in the most efficient and effective way possible with the resources that we have , " Duckworth said .
" When we detect certain levels of piracy on school networks we reserve the right to bring legal action . "
Seltzer had her own theory about the RIAA 's tactics .
" It might be that somebody does n’t want to go against the Harvard legal team or endowment or law faculty or brand , " she said .
Perhaps the RIAA does n't wish to make waves with the next - generation of the rich and powerful .
Also , Charles Nesson , of the Berkman Center at Harvard , has told the RIAA in an open letter " to take a hike . "
Nesson , as part of his evidence class , also requires students to draft motions quashing a subpoena from the RIAA demanding the identity behind a university IP address .

DHS Wants to Spy on Americans , Dems Charge Rep. Harman , Sen .
Thompson wrote of their concerns in a letter obtained by ABC .
May 15 , 2008  --
The Department of Homeland Security wants to set up a new program to illegally spy on Americans , two senior Democratic lawmakers charged Thursday in a letter urging colleagues to deny funds for the program .
In a letter to three colleagues obtained by ABC News , House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson , Miss. , and Rep. Jane Harman , Calif. , voiced objections to a new office DHS wants to create that would share the detailed surveillance capabilities of military intelligence satellites and other monitoring technology with state and local law enforcement .
The size of the National Applications Office , as DHS has named it , and its proposed budget , remain classified .
The department has said the office would not traffic in eavesdropped conversations .
It would primarily be used to share data from military assets for disaster response , monitoring climate change and other purposes , according to DHS .
Noting that the Pentagon is already cleared and capable of sharing satellite imagery on a legal and limited basis to aid authorities protecting major events or responding to natural disasters , Thompson and Harman said the purpose of expanding the program and placing it in a classified office could only be to surveil U.S. residents illegally .
" We are left to conclude that the only reason to stand up a new office would be to gather domestic intelligence outside the rigorous protections of the law -- and , ultimately , to share this intelligence with local law enforcement outside of constitutional parameters , " Thompson and Harman wrote .
The two urged their colleagues to bar funding for the program , which they said would likely violate long - standing laws prohibiting military involvement in peacetime law enforcement .
Current law bars money for the program until Congress ' auditors review and approve a legal argument from DHS justifying the office , which is expected later this year .
The letter contained some of the harshest language yet from the lawmakers , who have raised serious questions about the proposed office since the administration announced its plans for NAO late last year .
DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff has called their concerns baseless and has pushed to institute the program .
" I think we 've fully addressed anybody 's concerns , " Chertoff reportedly said in a recent chat with bloggers .
" I think the way is now clear to stand it up and go warm on it . "
But if the House appropriators who control DHS ' pursestrings listen to Thompson and Harman , that may not be the case .
" Having been burned before on the Terrorist Surveillance Program and knowing this administration 's disdain for obeying the laws Congress passes , we need to be extraordinarily careful , " Thompson and Harman warned in their letter today .
" We are confident that [ congressional auditors ] will soon conclude -- like the DHS Inspector General -- that the NAO is a lawful and effective tool for protecting the country , " said department spokeswoman Laura Keehner .
She said the lawmakers fundamentally misunderstood the office , were " wrong on the law " and charged that their efforts " are misguided , and plainly political . "

Yi reportingA middle school health teacher is under investigation , accused of teaching too much about sex .
Parents say the teacher is saying crude and explicit things that do n't belong in the classroom .
Dewayne Smith says , " These are our children , and we 're not going to breach the firewall of innocence . "
" What bothered me is that , not only did we get into discussions of masturbatory activity , but we got into explicit descriptions of homosexual acts , " Smith said .
Parents say the teacher also showed students fliers with explicit cartoon images .
Seventh - grader Marissa Poloei had a friend in the class .
She told us , " He thought it was gross and stuff , and she showed a lot of pictures of stuff . "
A spokesperson for the Jordan School District would not comment on the allegations but said there is an investigation .
The teacher has been put on administrative leave , but parents do n't think that 's enough .
Johnson says , " We want her fired .
We want her never to teach ever again . "
Some of the parents plan to meet with administrators at the school tomorrow .
They 've invited Rep. Carl Wimmer to attend .
Again , the district said it cannot comment on personnel issues .
We were not able to contact the teacher for her side of the story .

As she was due to visit North Korea at the end of 1993 , she was asked and readily agreed to carry critical nuclear data on her person and hand it over on arrival in Pyongyang ….. The gist of what she told me was that before leaving Islamabad she shopped for an overcoat with the deepest possible pockets into which she transferred CDs containing the scientific data about uranium which the North Korean wanted .
The Great Nuclear Conspiracy : Bhutto Carried Nuke Secrets On CDs To North Korea .
ATS Premium article by member MikeSingh
May 12th , 2008
Pakistan ’s Nuclear Facilities
Pakistan ’s Strategic Imperative
Pakistan ’s Quest For Missile Delivery Systems
Evidence for the missile - for - uranium enrichment technology trade probably emerged sometime in 1999 .
But when U.S. officials raised the subject with the Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , he denied any knowledge of it .
Was Washington Privy to The Pak - N Korea Nuclear Deal ?
“ The reactor is expected to be substantially smaller and less capable than reported . ”
“ a man who has demonstrated great courage under very difficult political circumstances and has been a great ally for the United States . ”
The nuclear - for - missile barter trade between Islamabad and Pyongyang probably began in 1997 and continued at least until Jul 2002 .
During this period , Pakistan ’s cooperation with North Korea involved the exchange of nuclear personnel , the sharing of technical knowledge , design information on gas centrifuges , machinery and possibly nuclear material .
“ We did n’t talk about the past and I do n’t want to get into who might have done what , when and at what point in history . ”
The conspiracy : The Smoking Gun
U.S. official statements leave little doubt that cooperation occurred , but there
are significant details missing on the scope of cooperation and the role of Pakistan’s
government .
Further , both North Korea and Pakistan have denied that nuclear
technology was provided to North Korea .
Benazir Bhutto , the then Prime Minister , had consistently denied any role of the Pakistani government in Korea ’s nuclear ambitions .
But now , it has come to light that a CD containing vital nuclear data was carried by her personally to be handed over to her Korean counterpart as part of a secret deal !
Benazir Bhutto once played an active role in furthering Pakistan ’s clandestine nuclear programme by personally taking CDs to and from North Korea on an official trip as Prime Minister , reveals a book by her Oxford college mate and journalist Shyam Bhatia who subsequently kept in regular touch with her .
It was in the 90’s that North Korea offered to provide long range missiles to Pakistan to offset the imbalance with India ’s integrated guided missile development program then led by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam .
By 1993 , Pakistan was under the spotlight as never before [ on bartering enrichment technology for missiles ] , with Russia , India and western secret services monitoring every nuance of Pakistan ’s military research .
As she was due to visit North Korea at the end of 1993 , she was asked and readily agreed to carry critical nuclear data on her person and hand it over on arrival in Pyongyang ….. The gist of what she told me was that before leaving Islamabad she shopped for an overcoat with the deepest possible pockets into which she transferred CDs containing the scientific data about uranium which the North Korean wanted .
Pakistani contacts later explained that Benazir returned with more than just CDs .
The delighted North Koreans who had already sold missile technology to Egypt , Iraq , Libya , Syria and Yemen insisted she carry back the disassembled parts of an entire missile so that Pakistani scientists could study it part by part .
Epilogue
Pakistan Gets A New Nuke Missile To Use On India !
The Associated Press .
April 2008 .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan : Pakistan said that a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead anywhere in India is ready for wartime use after troops launched it on Monday during a field exercise .
Scientists and engineers had prepared the Hatf VI missile , also known as Shaheen II , for the exercise with a test - firing on Saturday .
Monday ’s launch “ validated the operational readiness of a strategic missile group equipped with the Shaheen II missile , ” the Pakistani military said in a statement .
North Korea Could Make Nuclear Warhead For Missile Delivery
The North Korean nuclear
tipped medium - range Nodong
missile , seen here dressed in
Pakistani Ghauri
missile colors .
North Korea is capable of arming its medium - range Nodong missile with a nuclear warhead , two US experts said .
The report by the Washington - based Institute for Science and International Security ( ISIS ) also estimates that the communist state has separated enough plutonium to build about five to 12 nuclear weapons .
It is also suspected to have obtained warhead designs from Pakistan 's rogue nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan .
Should war break out , " North Korea would be expected to use its nuclear weapons against military targets and population centres in South Korea or Japan . "
Benazir Bhutto , the then Prime Minister of Pakistan , had consistently denied any role of the Pakistani government in Korea ’s nuclear ambitions .
But now , it has come to light that a CD containing vital nuclear data was carried by her personally to be handed over to her Korean counterpart as part of a secret deal !
Kashmir has been a bone of contention between India and Pakistan since the last 60 years and four wars have been fought by Pakistan in its unsuccessful bid to wrest it from India by force .
Conventionally , they could never hope to match the Indian war machine .
The biggest force leveler would be a viable nuclear deterrent against conventional force asymmetry .
With a nuclear deterrent , an incursion into Kashmir would prevent an all out assault by India ’s huge military juggernaut against Pakistan which lacked strategic depth .
Thus commenced a covert nuclear program and by the early 1990s Pakistan had acquired the capability to build nuclear weapons using highly enriched uranium cores .
But it lacked the delivery systems .
American made F - 16s were not a viable option and missiles armed with nuclear warheads were a system of choice as they are not as vulnerable to air defense systems as are aircraft , and are also more cost effective .
But Pakistan did not possess the wherewithal to build a delivery system consisting of long range missiles which it was desperate to acquire , whatever the cost .
Since the Chinese were reluctant to provide Pakistan with the ‘ M ’ series of longer range missiles due to American pressure , Pakistan turned to North Korea to view their Nodong prototype .
In 1995 , the missile deal was consummated and in April 1998 , Pakistan test fired the Nodong which was re-christened asAnd there it rested .
Nawaz Sharif ’s word was taken as confirmation that there was no such trade going on .
Or did it ?
Why did the U.S follow a policy of appeasement where Pakistan was concerned ?
The answer is simple : Pakistan is an ally in the so called war against terror .
With its contiguous borders with Afghanistan , Al Qaeda and the Taliban could use this ‘ no man ’s land ’ as launch pads against NATO Forces under the U.S , and thus it was imperative that nothing short of a policy of appeasement could assure the advancement of American strategy in Afghanistan and to a lesser extent Iraq , by keeping the command and control set up of the militants in disarray .
For example ,
In late July last year , the Institute for Science and International Security issued a report revealing that Pakistan was building a heavy - water reactor capable of producing enough plutonium for 40 to 50 nuclear weapons a year .
The Surprising response from Frederick Jones , a spokesman for the National Security Council , was astonishingly mild : Double standards and double speak is nothing new and are the hallmarks of the present dispensation in Washington .
No one batted an eye lid when on September 6th last , Pakistan ’s military dictatorship announced a peace treaty with militants in North Waziristan , al - Qaeda ’s center of gravity .
Vice President Cheney ’s response was unabashed praise of President Pervez Musharraf asConcerns about Pakistan ’s nuclear links with North Korea go back to 1999 when proliferation analysts began to speculate about North Korea ’s likely gains from the Nodong ballistic missile sales to Pakistan .
Senior U.S. officials who were briefed on Pakistan ’s nuclear cooperation with North Korea raised the issue at the highest levels of the Pakistani government .
In Jun 2001 , U.S. deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage drew attention to the role of retired Pakistani nuclear scientists in North Korea ’s nuclear program .
However , his public warnings were n’t paid heed to .
Then came the bomb shell in the form of a U.S. government source leak to the New York Times in Oct 2002 that Pakistan was the likely source of North Korea ’s gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program .
This was confirmed tacitly by the then Secretary of State , Collin Powell , when replying to a question whether such cooperation had taken place in the past said , U.S. intelligence officials claim that Pakistan was a key supplier of uranium enrichment technology to North Korea , and suggested that Pakistan had exchanged centrifuge enrichment technology for North Korean help in developing long range missiles , by transfer of vital technology and assembling missiles from semi knocked down kits surreptitiously transported from Korea , ironically in American made C - 130 Hercules transport aircraft !
Can one put the genie back in the bottle ?
By tacitly allowing the interchange to take place to keep Pakistan amused in its so called war against terror , the U.S has helped make the world more insecure than it has ever been .
So much for American policy of protecting its vital interests .
It has done just the opposite .

Cracked.com 's Headitor , ( that 's " Head Editor " shortened to just one word , Sports Fans , and you 're welcome ) , Jack O'Brien called all of the bloggers for a very important meeting .
Even Cracked and Week In Douchebaggery Superstar Lex Friedman was in attendance .
I hate being woken up in the middle of a Tuesday afternoon , so I was already eager for the meeting to end .
" What 's this all about , Jim , " I asked .
" Please stop calling me ' Jim , ' " Jack responded .
Lately I 'd been trying to establish a Batman - Commissioner Gordon relationship between me and Jack .
So far , he has n't been behind it .
Incidentally , that 's also the reason why I keep breaking in through his window whenever I want to speak with him .
Also , why I keep throwing smoke bombs at his family .
Lex spoke up .
" Guys , thanks for coming out today , I really appreciate it . "
" Do n't mention it , Lex & the City , " I answered .
" Do n't call him that , " Jack said .
" Anyway , the reason I called this meeting is because I want us to start shifting the focus of our articles and blog posts into a new direction , " Lex went on .
The bloggers all got nervous .
Me especially .
Unless the new focus is " Things Found in Hannah Montana 's Trash , " I 'm totally up shit 's creek .
" Why , " Swaim asked .
Lex started passing around some documents to everyone .
" On these sheets , you 'll find a list of the top words and phrases people have typed into various search engines that lead them to this site .
For example , about 150,000 people found us by typing the word ' Cracked ' into Google , which makes sense . "
I did n't know why exactly that made sense , but I know better than to question Lex Friedman .
" What I need you bloggers to do is to go through the other top words and phrases and start writing about that . "
" I 'm not sure ...
You want us to pander " Gladstone said .
" I think what Lexas Chainsaw Massacre is trying to say , " I began , " is that we need more content that directly involves things found in Hannah Montana 's garbage . "
" That 's not even close to what I 'm trying to say .
Even a little bit .
Okay , look :
For example , according these records , 5,091 people found Cracked by typing ' inspirational songs ' into a search engine .
So , Bucholz , maybe you could do a post on -" Bucholz interrupted him as soon as his name was mentioned .
" I 'm not doing shit .
I 'm gonna write about what I want , whenever I want to .
Hope you fuckers like the Olympics . "
He then got on his motorcycle and road off .
For a while , nothing happened .
Then , after nothing stopped happening , things started to happen .
Specifically , Ross spoke .
" Is anyone else , like , totally terrified of Bucholz ? "
I seriously almost crapped all over the place , Bucholz is scary as hell .
" Look , " Lex said , " Like it or not , these sheets reflect the kind of content that people expect from this site .
You guys have the sheets , you know what people are searching for , so you know what to write about .
Just give the people what they want . "
Gladstone raised his hand .
" Who 's Tupac ? " I lowered my head .
Gladstone is so god damned white I almost weep sometimes .
I swear to Hov , one of these days I 'm gonna give that guy a serious Hip Hop education .
But not today .
Today , I am providing you , the fans , exactly what you want , ( for once ) .
I 'm going to combine what you 've searched for with the trademark witty joke - making you 've come to expect from Cracked.com .
Today , I give you Five Things You Apparently Want to Read About 5 .
Horse Cocks Evidently , 473 of you found Cracked after googling " Horse Cocks , " and an incredible 1,359 found us by googling just " Horse Cock . "
Well , we 're sorry to the 473 who wanted to see / read about multiple horse cocks , ( gosh , for so many reasons ) , but majority rules , so we 're only going to focus on jokes with just one horse cock .
In an effort to please you , the discerning horse cock enthusiast , please enjoy these hilarious observations about a singular horse cock : " So , you 've got a horse cock , eh ?
Where are you gonna use that bad boy , a Whorse House ? ... Hm .
You know , that joke really is n't funny unless you read it .
And even then , it 's still kind of retarded . "
" So I was at a farm today doing a comparative study of animal genitalia for a friend 's birthday present and , let me tell you something : A horse penis is shockingly large .
Hey , more like schlong - ingly large , am I right ?
What ?
I 'm not right ?
Oh , I see .
It is ' shockingly . '
' Schlongingly ' is n't a word .
My mistake .
Take note , kids , because proper spelling is no laughing matter . "
That was Jokes About Horse Cocks , ladies and gentlemen , and You asked for it .
4 . Suicide " How to suicide " was one of our top phrases bringing in 1,963 readers , but " Suicide , " " Suicide how to " and " Committing suicide " also drew some huge numbers .
Long story short , you folks start out looking for suicide and you end up at Cracked , so we might as well give you some suicide jokes , right ?
Before you kill yourself ?
Because you came looking for a site about suicide and you ended up on a comedy site ?
Because you can't do anything right ?
Right ?
Here goes : " A friend of mine committed suicide , and gosh , I miss him every day .
Every single day . "
( What a knee - slapper ! ) " Knowing someone who committed suicide is like having a constant headache that wo n't go away .
You end up taking so many pills just to numb the pain . "
( Whoa , watch out for this guy , he 's on a roll ! )
" I just want my friend back . "
( A hat trick of comedy ! )
That was Jokes About Suicide , ladies and germs , and You made me revisit horrible memories .
3 . Tupac " Tupac , " " Tupac alive , " " Is Tupac alive , " " Tupac is alive , " " Tupac still alive , " " is Tupac still alive , " and " 2 pac alive " all brought in astonishingly huge amounts of readers .
Granted , we do have one article about Tupac in our back catalogue , but that 's one article out of our fifty year legacy of comedy .

I used to be very proud of my legs .
I have slight knees and ankles .
But the muscles around the bones were very strong .
And in my early 20s , as a full - time martial artist , I could kick very hard .
My nose bled like a faucet , but I will say I could hold my own good and I was never so happy as at the end of a long day of training .
Then things went sour , as they can .
My friend who owned my boxing gym was mortally hurt outside of it in a fight with criminals , and a few months later I smashed my leg in a bad bike accident .
I quit it all and my body has since been ravaged by the high - tech lifestyle .
I 'm now incapable of jumping high or running fast .
If my body was a gadget , I 'd have thrown it out a long time ago .
I think of all these things when I use the Wii Fit and grow a bit sad .
But what 's positive is that for the first time in years , I 'm excited to exercise .
Wii fit is making me happier and healthier .
( However retarded it is to exercise in front of a TV . )

The Basics
Wii
Fit the game has special hardware : an electronic sensing balance board the size of a car floor mat .
It does n't just take stock of the pounds you 've packed on .
The board can tell where my feet are in a two dimensional grid using four sensors , and measure pressure within fractions of pounds , 60 times a second .
Nintendo's parlayed the board 's capabilities into a watchful eye , taking stock of your balance and skill in several exercises .
The 50 + drills take about 1 - 6 minutes each , and are spread across yoga , strength , aerobics and balance .
At first , I entered my height and the board measured my weight .
It used both to calculate my body / mass index .
It 's here that the board told me I was overweight , and the debate is out whether or not that is from the extra mass in my legs or the ring of lard around my waist .
( BMI does not account for body fat %. )
Next , the game challenged me with some basic agility tests , and combined those results with my BMI to get my Wii Fit Age .
I scored a Wii fitness level appropriate for a 48 - year - old .
( My real age is 30 . )
Humiliated , I set a goal to lower my BMI ( and weight ) by a few notches within the next few weeks and improve my general fitness .
Me Before : Eat whatever I want , exercise a lot , get buff .
Me Now :
Too out of shape to do any sports , hate going to the gym , think yoga is boring .
Me Now : I guess I can play 30 minutes of Wii Fit for a work break .

Living With Wii Fit
I used the exercises in the yoga section to warm up .
There 's a decent variety of poses here , from simple breathing exercises to ballet - like poses that 'll challenge even the most balanced and flexible .
Being neither at this point , I enjoyed the static subtle workouts my feet , leg , hips , core back and abdominal muscles received .
All the while , the trainer will encourage you with compliments about your ability to remain static in a stance , or chide you for wobbling .
Previous to this , my experience with yoga included a class from some hippie with the last name Love .
I was bored out of my mind , but Wii fit made it fun .
The short duration of each test , along with the earning of a few " Wii Fit credits " for every few minutes of exercise .
Me Before : 100 explosive push - ups , no sweat .
Me Now : 10 explosive push - ups , no sweat
Me With Wii Fit : 10 slow - paced push - ups , with planks in between each repetition .
Lots of sweat .
Advertisement
I earned credits for other types of exercises , too .
The strength training has a focus on the core and legs , which I agree with as the most important in general power .
There are squats and lunges for the legs , but no calf raises .
There are planks and jack knifes for my abs , but no crunches or leg raises .
There are slow push - ups interspersed with planks for shoulder , chest and tricep strength .
Note :
There is no opposite exercise for the biceps .
I nitpick about drills I 'd like to see the game recommend because over the months you 'll want to cross train or your body will fall into a rut .
The good news is that you wo n't get bored too fast : to unlock all the basic exercises takes a good number of hours , and I 'd gather impossible to do within a week unless you 're very fit already .
But the available exercises are good basics and were challenging at the controlled slow pace that the game has you perform them at .
I did some drills with dumbells to make things more challenging at times , and would probably work a medicine ball and some outdoor activities into the mix for variety .
Me Before : Run five miles for a warmup before training .
Like a gazelle .
Me Now : Hate running .
Get tired being pulled along by a 10 - pound dog .
Have n't thrown a real punch with any heat on it in years .
Me With Wii Fit : Running in place around my living room is pathetic .
At least I 'm sweating .
If my friends from the boxing gym could see my now they 'd laugh and cry .
At least I 'm in my own home , blinds down .

Aerobic workouts were definitely capable of making me sweat .
I enjoyed jogging through a virtual park ; the step class was not challenging ; the hula hoop games are the most fun .
But the most intense drill happened to be the advanced six - minute boxing drill .
( The foot and hand combinations get complicated , requiring me to think while trying to react quickly , and the end - of - round bonus punching free - for - all added a nice bit of exhaustion to the workout . )
Me Before : Stand on one leg for as long as I 'd like .
Me Now :
No matter how much I use it or walk on it , the left leg is shaky from it being broken and pinned together a degree pigeon - toed .
Me With Wii Fit : Doing one - legged drills on my left is making my balance a lot better , very quickly .
Advertisement
Balance games are parlor games that encourage you to develop dynamic control in shifting your body weight .
One game had me smashing soccer balls with my head while dodging cleats ( hated it ) but the best were the ski jumps , slalom and snowboarding emulators .
( I could play those all day . )
While Wii Fit supports profiles for you and your friends and family , there is no versus mode .
To challenge each other in ski jumping , for example , you either had to log Wii Fit credits on each other 's accounts or back out to the main menu and reload your profile .
That 's a waste , because some of the best workouts I 've had with Wii Fit were my matches with buddies .
Advertisement
After a Week
I used Wii Fit to track my fitness and focused on longer workouts of +40 minutes , with days off in between .
My Wii fit age , largely by improvements in balance , improved to 31 .
While I do n't think I burned much fat off ( Ice Cream Wins Every Time ) a week really is n't long enough to show real results in this regard .
That said , I 'm not sure you 're going to stay sane doing 30 minutes of cardio in your living room , but people do such a thing on gym StairMaster machines all the time , so what the hell do I know .
I also feel stronger from doing the sit-ups , squats and push - ups .
Not necessarily strong , but taut .
90 Minutes of Wii Fit at 30 x Speed
( An excuse to make a video using Joe Esposito 's excellent track , You 're the Best , from the Karate Kid . )

Me Before : Eat two hamburgers , run five miles right after , gain no weight .
Me Now : Eat at a hamburger while doing a blog post in five minutes , gain weight .
Me with Wii Fit : Eat at a hamburger , do a week of Wii Fit , do n't gain weight .

Long - term Motivation : Habit Forming by Shame
I 'd never been a fan of the gym commute 's inefficiency .
Making an hour 's worth of travel , parking and changing just to do an hour of solitary weightlifting seems like a waste of time .
Using the Wii Fit for a few minutes at home is a lot easier , and because of that and the way it would graph my efforts , I found the barrier to exercising much lower and the motivation to do even a little bit of activity much greater .
In other words , Wii Fit brings video game addiction to my exercise regimen , and my body is the bloated scoreboard .
Every day , I 'd check my body age and weight , and every day , I 'd become more and more aware of my fitness .
Did I gain a few pounds ?
Wii
Fit made me admit if it was from night snacking on Haagen Daz or overeating ( Answer : Both . )
Did I miss a day of training ?
Wii Fit reminded me .
And every day , the Fit never neglected to reinforce that I was currently " overweight " and weaker than I should be , while encouraging me with cheers of " good job " during exercises .
It was very effective , like having a personal trainer .
Except , not really .
Advertisement
Me Before : Could n't take a day off from exercising without feeling guilty .
Me Now : Eats lots of ice cream when stressed at work .
Ca n't take a day off from work without feeling guilty .
Do n't generally give a shit about exercise .
Me With Wii Fit : I feel guilty skipping exercise or eating crap both , but feel good when the Wii Fit says I 'm strong or am doing a good job .
See , Wii Fit asks you to set goals of gaining weight ( presumably muscle ) or losing weight ( presumably fat ) but unlike a trainer , never ever goes as far as to customize your workouts to achieve this goal .
I 'd tend towards working out very hard on one day ( 1+ hour ) and then taking a day off in between to build strength and power .
The game offers no such advice .
Another gripe : along with the lack of recommended training regimens , there 's no way to have the game automatically step you through a circuit of exercises .
Consequently , screwing with menus makes it so that a 45 - minute workout includes 30 minutes of fiddling to choosing exercises , etc .
That 's a waste of time .
A trainer would also differentiate between me being overweight or simply muscular .

What It Is n't
I suppose the first step in appreciating it is to treat it like a healthy video game , not a replacement for the gym .
Not a personal trainer .
Not a set of free weights .
Not a bicycle .
You wo n't make it to six - minute mile shape .
Or 12 rounds of boxing shape .
You wo n't be able to even run swiftly or jump high or swim far or do pull - ups , let alone build skills in an actual sport any more than Wii Baseball teaches you how to hit home runs .
And why should n't you get in shape while learning a skill and coordination , too ?
No one is ever going to get past basic fitness by only playing Wii Fit alone .
If you need a little help getting into shape for the first time or back to your former glory , Wii Fit is the coolest , most interactive and kind way to ease your bloated body back into activity .
And for serious athletes , it 's a fun supplemental tool for measuring weight over time , and for improving balance on your days off .
It 's real exercise , but mild compared to what you 'd get with free weights or running or swimming .
Advertisement
Let 's put it this way :
While I exercised a total of seven hours in a week with Wii Fit , I probably burned about a combined 1000 calories .
Even though my muscles feel significantly tighter , even in just seven days , I easily wiped that weigh - loss potential away with the single pint of ice cream I ate watching Lost .
So what 's it good for ?
In fitness , no machine can ever replace the drive to be healthy .
Not Bowflex , not Thighmaster , and not Wii Fit .
The real difference here is that Wii Fit builds fitness consciousness , reminding us of our body 's state of being , chiding us for bad habits while encouraging the good .
And this is while building up the basic fitness necessary to start doing high intensity workouts or sports .
It makes exercise feel like a video game , and we all know we can have fun playing those for hours .
So far we 've had grandmothers , dead people , disabled single mothers , and today , we can add another category to the list of those targeted by the RIAA : the homeless .
Earlier this week , the RIAA decided to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit against Chaz Berry after learning he was living in a homeless shelter — but not until after a magistrate judge denied an earlier motion for summary judgment and recommended sanctions against the RIAA 's attorneys .
Berry was sued by the RIAA in February 2007 for copyright infringement after an IP address logged by MediaSentry on a P2P network was traced back to his AOL account .
When the time came for Berry to be served with a copy of the complaint , the RIAA discovered that he had vacated his apartment .
A pretrial conference scheduled for April 19 , 2007 , was postponed for 60 days at the labels ' request , due to the RIAA 's professed inability to serve Berry with a summons at his last - known address .
The RIAA said in its April 17 filing that it was " conducting a thorough address investigation " so it could serve Berry with a copy of the summons .
But that was n't quite right : it turns out that the RIAA 's process server slapped a copy of the summons " in a conspicuous place " at Berry 's last known address on April 9 — a full eight days before the RIAA said it could n't locate him .
The process server 's attempts were detailed in an April 25 , 2007 , affidavit completed by the process server , who also said that a copy was sent via first - class mail to the same address .
In June 2007 , the RIAA moved for a default judgment against Berry .
In his Report and Recommendation issued in February of this year , Magistrate Judge Kevin N. Fox criticized the RIAA , calling its representation that it had made every effort to locate Berry " disingenuous . "
He found that the RIAA 's statements were " not made in good faith " and recommended the imposition of sanctions against the RIAA 's attorneys .
At some point after the release of Magistrate Fox 's report , the RIAA discovered that Berry was living in a homeless shelter .
At that point , the labels apparently decided not to pursue the case any further and have filed no objection to last week 's denial of their motion for summary judgment .
In addition , the RIAA has voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice .
The case has been dismissed without prejudice , with presiding Judge Harold Baer , Jr. deciding not to subject the lawyers to sanctions .
" Their excuse here is the well - worn ' clerical error , ' i.e. , the office clerk ' mis - calendered this date , ' and they ' sincerely apologize ' for their failure , " wrote Baer .
" Once again , while Plaintiffs ' lawyers ... must keep careful records of deadlines and all court days , the error is not sufficiently akin to a contempt of court . "
We contacted the RIAA to get its perspective on the case and , in particular , why it is dismissing Warner v. Berry without prejudice , which would allow the labels to sue the homeless man again should his circumstances change .
" As you know , there may be lots of specific reasons that can cause a dismissal of a case without prejudice , " RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth told Ars .
" We recognize and evaluate the particular circumstances of each case , including this one , always endeavoring to be fair and reasonable while protecting our rights . "
Duckworth also assured
Ars that the labels have no intention of suing Berry in the future .

Problem reports from polling places in PA , including voting machine malfunctions and long lines , began coming in early this morning .
That could be an ominous sign , given that on most Election Days , the real extent of problems , at least with voting systems , is n't fully revealed until later , and often in the days after the election .
See our report yesterday detailing concerns about e-voting equipment ( though not from officials , who were n't concerned at all ) and whether there would be enough machines to go around ( presuming they work at all ) across Pennsylvania .
Election Prob Hotlines ...

Map of counties , showing which type of machines each uses , available here .
( Hat - tip BRAD BLOG commenter " GWN " . )
NOTE : Updated throughout the day and night of the primary , and the following morning .
Newest items posted on top .
4/23 , 2:40 am ET : " Smooth Sailing " say the media ... even if their very own reporting revealed otherwise ...
This will likely be the last of our " Problem Report Wire " dispatches added to this item .
We 'll pick up the rest of the PA mess , and there is a lot of it , in subsequent blog items .
The long list of reports that you can peruse below , from the past 24 hours , mostly culled directly from the corporate media itself , belie the claims made all day yesterday by many public officials and even the media themselves , that all went well at the polls in the Keystone State .
Countless voters were unable to cast a vote yesterday in PA .
The overwhelming majority of those who succeeded in doing so , will never be able to determine whether or not their vote was counted accurately , or even at all , given that some 85 % of those votes were cast on machines in which it is literally impossible for anyone , ever , to verify that a single vote was recorded accurately as per the voter 's intent .
We explained all of that here Monday night , prior to the election , in our article " The Pennsylvania Primary : Democracy of the Gods " .
As we mentioned then , if any election official in PA ( or anywhere else ) , or any voting machine company employee , or even any citizen , has proof otherwise , The BRAD BLOG would be happy to see it , and share it with everyone .
But that proof will never come , because it does not exist , to the eternal shame of those who would allow such voting systems to be used in American democracy .
The headline of the first story in our final posted collection below , may say it all .
The headline indicates " Mostly smooth sailing at polls , " yet we suspect the voters referenced , who will never know if their vote was counted at all , and those who can never know if their vote was counted accurately ( that would be all of them who voted on an e-voting machine ! ) may feel otherwise .
From Vindy.com ...
Another machine , at the Greene Township Building on Dowling Schoolhouse Road , started freezing up at one point during the day , he said , so the polling place stopped using it .
" He said that machine has 23 votes on it .
" He said that if necessary , the company that manufactures the machines , Election Systems and Software out of Omaha , Neb. , can retrieve those votes .
NOTE FROM JOHN GIDEON OF VOTERSUNITEORG :
Since when is it NOT necessary to count every vote ?
This tells me that it may not be necessary , in the county 's mind , to count the provisional ballots .
From the Times Chronicle ...
A Montgomery County judge Tuesday evening turned down a request by the county Democratic Committee to extend voting hours by an additional hour at one Cheltenham poll for voters who could not use an electronic voting machine to cast their ballots until some 2 1/2 hours after the poll opened .
Election officials in Cheltenham 's 4 - 1 ward reported problems with both electronic voting machines assigned to that polling place shortly after the polls opened at 7 a.m .
There were approximately 200 people in line at the time .
...
A replacement machine , which had to be programmed , was not delivered until after 11 a.m .
...
Poll workers offered emergency ballots to those initial would - be voters who could not wait for a functioning voting machine or could not return to vote .
However , those at the polls said the offer of emergency ballots came too late for many who were angry and stormed out , claiming they had to get to work or go out of town .
Only some 60 to 70 emergency ballots were filled out .
From the Times - Leader ...
WILKES - BARRE
A woman wanting to vote was turned away after no proof of her registration could be found .
The judge of elections at Ward 16 on Hanover Street , Walter Griffith , said Annmarie Lee , of Wilkes - Barre , told Griffith she registered to vote , but did not specify where she had registered .
Griffith said he called a county elections inspector who told him there was no evidence of her registration and not to give her a provisional ballot to fill out .
Griffith said that is a violation of the law .
It is .
Read the full story for the reasoning of the election officials , but as time allows , we will try to look into this story a bit deeper for more details .

AS RECORDED BY THE MEDIA DURING TUESDAY'S
DISASTROUS PENNSYLVANIA PRIMARY ...
4/23 , 1:01 am ET : More broken machines , missing registrations , voters turned away without being offered provisionals .
Missed this one from earlier in the afternoon .
From Philly Inquirer ...
After Richard Brown , of the 5700 block of North 12th Street in Philadelphia showed up at his polling place at 6:55 a.m. , it took nearly two hours for the machines to be either repaired or replaced , he said .
In an affidavit cited in a failed - attempt to keep city polls opened later , Brown said he waited more than an hour for election officials to produce paper provisional ballots .
Voters at a polling place in the 49th Ward near the Fern Rock station had to wait two hours because of machine malfunctions , said Kathryn Bookvar , an attorney with the Advancement Project , based in Washington , who was in Philadelphia to monitor the election .
Machine problems also were reported in West Oak Lane ; Upper Darby , Delaware County , and Elkins Park , Montgomery County .
In Elkins Park , the problem was a machine accidentally powered down by a poll worker , said county spokesman John Corcoran .
In addition to the machine issues , " numerous " registration snafus were reported to the Committee of Seventy , said its election coordinator John David .
The bulk of those complaints have come from voters who switched parties and whose names did not appear on the rolls of the new party .
The city has been inundated with calls , said David , adding : " It 's swamping the voter - registration office . "
In some instances , voters whose names were missing were not being offered provisional ballots , he said .
Some instances ???
Every such voter should be offered a provisional ballot by federal law .
The DoJ claimed they were in PA today monitoring the election .
So will any lawsuits be brought ?
How about for the voting machines which violate federal law ?
( We 'll not hold our breath on either score . )
11:35 pm ET : Machine , registration probs result in ' Countless eligible voters refused right to vote . '
The description here about the voter registration problems are particularly disturbing , if familiar from other primaries so far this year , particularly in states where voter rolls have been privatized to the same voting machine companies who have screwed those up to .
From Committee of 70's 10:30 pm press release [ WORD ] ...
Jonah Goldman , director of the National Campaign for Fair Elections of the Lawyers Committees Voting Rights Project said ... " problems with voting machines and inaccurate voter registration rolls caused countless eligible voters to be needlessly refused the right to vote .
One of the most troubling issues today was a barrage of reports from voters who have been registered as Democrats for years , but were listed as unaffiliated and so had to vote provisionally .
...
It is unclear at this time how widespread this problem was .
A couple of the incidents which came into their 1 - 866 - OUR - VOTE hotline , as reported in the late update :
In Delaware County , one voter reported that the voting machines at her precinct were set for Republicans only .
She told the poll worker that she was a Democrat and the worker replied , Not today .
The voter was not able to cast a vote , but The League of Women Voters provided her with the phone number of the Delaware County Board of Elections to report and resolve the issue .
One caller reported a polling location with only three voting machines and no printers working .
Voters were leaving without being offered emergency ballots .
9:58 pm ET : Brad on PBC
Show tonight , on voting machine probs today .
Here 's the audio ( 5 minutes ) from a quick update I did tonight on the Peter B. Collins Show ( where we appear regularly each week on Friday from 5 p - 6 p PT ) ...
9:24 pm ET : Fox " News " confirms e-voting problems .
While MSNBC was said to have reported earlier that PA 's SoS claimed there were no reports of problems today ( see the 6:34 pm ET update below ) , it was Fox " News " of all outlets that bothered to confirm and briefly report the problems .
Just after the polls closed tonight , as the Exit Polls were " too close to call , " and too important to share with us mere mortals , the cable news nets were beside themselves with the prospect of having to actually wait for votes to be " counted . "
In truth , very few of them can actually be counted because , as we explained yesterday , most of PA uses e-voting machines on which it 's strictly impossible to determine if even a single vote was recorded as any voter actually intended .
It was Fox then , which confirmed some of the problems we 've been reporting all day here .
" Some of those electronic voting machines did not work , " says the Fox reporter in the clip below , describing the process of " cartridges " being brought in for counting .
She mentions that there were some paper ballots brought in as well from where machines broke down ( though as we noted in earlier reports below , provisional ballots were only handed out if both machines in voting precincts broke down ) .
" Those machines were n't ready , were n't going , and they did have to resort to the paper , " before adding with a big roll of the eyes , " the old way . "
Apologies for the quality of the quick and dirty video ...
6:34 pm ET : MSNBC says PA SoS tells them no reports of voting probs .
This comes from an emailer , via NYU media professor , election integrity advocate , and author Mark Crispin Miller ...
Just 15 minutes ago MSNBC made a major point of saying that there have been almost no reports of voting problems , according to the SoS office .
Everything fine , so far .
Maybe Bradblog should contact MSNBC to direct them to the right sources for information .
We guess everything must be fine then ?
No need to read the list of problems below , as reported all day long ...

PA Dept. of State , Election Bureau : ( 717 ) 787-5280 , RA-BCEL@state.pa.us
From MSNBC website as of 12:50 pm ET ...
According to Leslie Amoros , a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania State Department , there have been no major voter irregularities in the state .
" It 's just been minor , normal kinds of stuff , " she said .
" Nothing major , nothing widespread . "
Who said anything about " voter " irregularities ?
The voters are doing fine , it 's the PA State Dept . which is doing a shitty job of running the state 's elections .
5:37 pm ET : Machine malfunctions account for 30 % of voter hotline calls .
A Philly - based non-profit watchdog group , Committee of Seventy , reports the following in a midday press release [ WORD ] from among 500 problem calls received , so far today , on their 1 - 866 - OUR - VOTE hotline ...
One volunteer called in to report that one of the voting machines does not seem to be recording votes properly : the count is off by three people .
In one precinct , voting equipment was not working and had not been working for over two hours .
This problem had been reported throughout Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania and has the potential to disenfranchise thousands of voters by the time the polls close .
The most commonly reported problem so far today , accounting for approximately 30 % of call volume on the hotline , has been equipment malfunction at the polls .
There have also been reports of voter intimidation , rule violations at polling places and registration issues .
Some sample reports include :
5:23 pm ET : Given all the trainwreck stories posted below , perhaps a non-trainwreck story would be a welcome , momentary relief .
From Philadelphia Daily News ...
On Viola Walker 's 103rd birthday , a dream of an election VIOLA WALKER says she has n't missed voting in a presidential election since Calvin Coolidge ran in 1924 .
It is one of the privileges of the " better life " that she and her late husband came to Philadelphia for 81 years ago .
Back when she was growing up in Rocky Mount , N.C. , even the U.S. Constitution could n't guarantee black citizens the right to vote .
When the Constitution finally granted voting rights to women in 1920 , she knew that did n't include her .
That 's why Election Days mean so much to her .
But Viola
Walker never dreamed she 'd live to see an Election Day like today .
4:12 pm ET : Wrong machine delivered , machine down , machine inspector blocked .
Culled from Election Journal 's running coverage ...
Confusion – Wrong Machine Delivered
Poll workers at Ward 53 Division 12 learned this morning that they had been delivered the machine intended for Ward 55 Division 14 ; down - ticket candidates inaccurate .
... Machine Failure 29th Ward , 4th Division .
One of the two machines at the polling place has malfunctioned .
Election officials scrambling to repair before turnout picks up .
Polling place at 2340 Fulton Way ... Court Appointed Machine Inspector Denied Entrance to Poll
In the the 3rd Ward State Representative Ron Waters refused to allow a court appointed machine inspector to enter the polling place .
Although Rep Waters is an influential Philly pol , he in fact holds no official election position .
Waters insisted that only one machine inspector was allowed into the polling place .
After election officials informed Rep Waters that his legal interpretation was incorrect , he stated “ well , that ’s not the way we do things ” UPDATE : Representative Ward relented , and the inspector was permitted to enter the polling location .
3:54 pm ET : Voter - service phone lines jammed across state .
From NY Times ...
“ Let ’s just say it ’s very busy , ” said Joseph Passarella , the director of voter services for Montgomery County , sounding a little harried .
“ Our phones have been ringing since 6:15 this morning and have been ringing nonstop .
We ’ve never had a primary election this busy . ”
Voting lines were long and voter - service phone lines were jammed across the state , from Philadelphia in the southeastern part of the state to Beaver County in the west .
“ We ’re just overwhelmed , ” said Geri Shuits , a polling clerk in Beaver County .
“ I ’ve gotten so many phone calls , I just ca n’t keep up . ”
3:45 pm ET : Machines down , get jammed , in Bucks County .
From Philly Burbs ...
Voters waited in long lines Tuesday morning at the Village of Pennbrook in Falls while poll workers spent an hour and a half working to get two downed machines up and running .
On one of the malfunctioning machines , a voter worried that her vote was not tallied , according to Falls Republican Committeeman Kennan Haley .
She was asked to cast a provisional ballot , he said .
...
In another instance , a voter casting a write - in vote failed to close the write - in door and caused the other machine to jam up , he said .
3:09 pm ET : More machine breakdowns in Philly , voters only allowed provisions if both machines malfunction .
From Philly 's CBS 3 [ emphasis ours ] ...
Voters reported problems with a polling place near 12th and Grange Streets in the Olney section of Philadelphia in the early morning hours .
Both machines were reportedly down as a long line of voters waited to cast their ballot .
Some voters said they were told the power went down and a technician was needed to get the machines to function .
...
Many voters reportedly left the location in order to get to work on time
...
If both machines in a polling location break down , officials said voters will get provisional ballots .
NOTE FROM VOTERSUNITE.ORG'S JOHN GIDEON : I find it amazing that only two machines are in each Philadelphia precinct and voters can only get a paper ballot , no matter how long the lines get , if both machines are broken .
Then , the paper ballots are provisional ballots and wo n't be counted until after the initial count is made this evening and tomorrow .
3:01 pm ET : Obama camp , media report voting probs , Philly official says " all is well . "
From RAW STORY 's election prob coverage ...
" We had a few problems early on .
We always do , " Fred Voight , a deputy commissioner in Philadelphia told MSNBC .
Video of Voight 's interview is available here .
He called reports of machines breaking down " flat out untrue " and said " everything is working throughout the city as we speak . "
...
The Post Gazette also reported some minor problems but said they were n't causing major delays : Because of the expected large turnout , election judges ' difficulty getting machines started at a polling place in North Braddock and another in the city 's Banksville section prompted some concern .
At these two sites , election judges , clerks and inspectors , all nominally paid volunteers , initially were unable to print out verification that the voting machines had been set at zero .

More than 30 people in Banksville and several more in North Braddock used emergency paper ballots to cast their votes .
Post - Gazette readers also reported problems at one or two polling stations this morning , including Graham Field and Beacon Hill in Wilkinsburg .
12:28 am ET : Machines down in African American area of Philly , voters leave without voting , registration probs .
Via Email from computer security , e-voting expert , Dr. Rebecca Mercuri ...
Channel 6 ( ABC News , Philadelphia ) was reporting at lunchtime that voting machines were down in the Fern Rock section of the city ( which happens to be a heavily African - American area ) and at least 50 people apparently left without voting .
I do n't know why they were n't given emergency ballots to use ( maybe they did n't have any there ) .
Also , there have been numerous reports of people who were listed in the poll book as one party when they claim they had registered as the other party ( the news report did n't specify which party predominated in the shift ) .
Those people are supposed to be allowed to vote by provisional ballot at the polls , but it is n't clear whether this is being offered by the poll workers .
Turnout has been high .
( See report below for more registration probs reported . )
11:00 am ET : Registration roll probs in Philly , provisionals only handed out if both machines malfunction .
From Philly Inquirer / Daily News PA Primary Blog ...
[ Watchdog group ] Committee of Seventy ... says turnout is high , and the two issues that appear to be most prevalent are : Voters whose names are not in the poll book ; and voters who are registered as members of one party in the poll book , but who are , in fact , registered as a member of another party .
We 've seen problems with registration rolls all season long , as many states have turned to privatizing them with some of the same voting machine companies that have failed so miserably to even get the voting machine part right .
Most polling places in Philly are equipped with two machines .
According to Inquirer / Daily News ' blog , even if one breaks down , causing long lines , paper ballots are not given out .
In the event of machine failure , they say , " provisional ballots " are only to be handed out if ...
Both voting machines in a division break down .
If at least one machine is operable , the official policy of the Philadelphia Board of Elections is that voters must use that machine rather than be given a provisional ballot .
10:50 am ET : Both machines break down , 100's leave without voting , Obama 's name not on provisional ballot !
From Philly Inquirer / Daily News PA Primary Blog ...
" I just came from voting .
Finally got my vote in at 49 ward , 07 division .... after waiting for ( the only ) 2 voting machines to be repaired .
" I was able to cast my vote for Obama after waiting 1 and 1/2 hours .
During that time at least 100 voters left without voting ..... possibly not to return .
" I immediately called every News channel I could get through to .
Persons who answered at the stations informed me that my ward was not the only one with broken machines and ' Paper ballots ( as an alternative ) without Obama 's name on it .
These provisional ballots did have Hiliary 's [ sic ] name on them . "
We continue to hear reports of broken machines .
This tale was reported to the Daily News by a very patient voter :
10:45 am ET : Electrical probs lead to ES&S iVotronic machine malfunctions , use of paper ballots in Green Tree.
From CBS affiliate KDKA 2 ...
Poll workers think a short power outage may have caused an early issue for about two - dozen voters in Green Tree .
According to Debbie Moskala , some voters had to use paper ballots to cast their vote because of a glitch with one of the machines at the Marian Manor senior living facility .
" When we first started voting this morning , one machine would n't work , " Moskala told KDKA , " …. so we did paper ballots .
We had about 20 people go through with paper ballots and vote that way . "
...
Moskala says they 've used the voting machines several times in the past and have n't had any previous problems .
She believes the electricity to the facility may have triggered the outage .
" We did have a problem with the electricity for a minute .
It must have gone off and on – and maybe that triggered what the problem ended up being . "
10:44 am ET : Machine breakdowns in Delaware County and South Philly .
From Philly Inquirer / Daily News PA Primary Blog ...
Readers and Inquirer reporters attempting to cast ballots this morning found long lines across the region created by broken machines .
One of two machines was down at a busy Delaware County polling site .
About 50 people already had voted by 9:15 a.m. at the Temple Israel on Spruce and Bywood Avenue in Upper Darby , which is heavily populated by immigrant and first time voters .
Many of those freshly - minted voters had difficulties using the one machine that still functioned .
" Hell of a day for one of the machines to be down , " said one poll worker .
In South Philadelphia , both voting machines were broken at 4th and Ritner
...
One reader wrote : I got to my polling place before 7 a.m. ; 2nd ward , 27th division : as the polls were opening , one of two machines for my division was malfunctioning : electrical problem .
...
In the city 's Spring Garden section , home to State Sen. Vincent Fumo , both machines were down at St. Andrews Lithuananian Church at 19th and Wallace .
Voters grumbled when they learned their provisional ballots would not be counted tonight .
9:45 am ET : Ballot design probs in Palmer Township ( Northhampton County ) .
Delegates not listed under candidates .
From Lehigh Valley Live ...
Palmer Township resident Ritann Tosto wants to warn voters to read the fine print beneath the delegate candidates ' names .
Tosto , 59 , said she assumed the delegates listed beneath Sen.
Barack Obama 's name were his supporters , and the delegates beneath Sen. Hillary Clinton 's name were hers .
That 's not the case , she reports after voting at St. Andrew 's Lutheran Church .
" Fortunately , I put my rather thick reading glasses on , " Tosto said .
" In the lightest italic , smallest print under the delegates ....
It states who they are committed to .
And it is the tiniest print in the whole space , and they 're mixed . "
She admits she has trouble with her eyes , but believes the setup is " incredibly misleading . "
" Had I not read the sample ballot , I would n't have known .
I would 've voted for all the wrong people , " Tosto said .
When she returned home she called the Northampton County election office to inquire about the reason for the setup , but got no answer .
...
She said no one else who was voting while she was there seemed confused , so they either understood or made the same assumption she did at first , and voted for the wrong delegates .
( Graphic of the ballot in question here . )
9:43 am ET : Fewer machines in Northhampton County this year .
From Lehigh Valley Live ...
Retired Rabbi Jonathan Gerard , 60 , of Easton , was concerned --- as were many voters --- that there was just one electronic voting machine [ made by Sequoia ] in the polling place , where for years there had been two mechanical machines .
Poll workers said it was because Northampton County went from 600 uncertified machines to 300 machines from a different vendor .
6:15 am PT : Machines " on fritz " as Philly polls opened , voters given provisionals .
From Philly Inquirer / Daily News PA Primary Blog ...
Both machines were on the fritz as polls opened at St. Andrew ’s Lithuanian Church , 19th & Wallace Streets , in the city ’s Spring Garden neighborhood .
The polls , five blocks from outgoing state senator Vince Fumo home , are in the 16th division , 15th ward .
Early voters were asked to fill out provisional ballots .
More than 20 people did so and left grumbling when they learned their ballots would n’t be counted tonight .
By 7:30 a.m. election workers got the two machines up and running on batteries .
9:14 am ET : Voting machines malfunctioned , votes lost in Bethlehem .
From Morning Call ...
In Bethlehem ... When judge of elections Craig Hynes swung open the doors , 15 people rushed in , including some that had been their since 6:40 a.m.... Hynes said .
" This is going to be a long day . "
Moments later he realized how long it could be when one of his three voting machines malfunctioned .
After four people had voted , he realized that it had only registered one voter .
He had to reset machine .
" We lost three voters and there 's no getting them back , " explained Hynes , " and at this point we do n't even know who they were . "

I received this email last night from a reader who is also the finance director for a Democratic congressional campaign .
While the letter below is anonymous , I know the name of the author and the candidate they work for – this is for real .
John ,
I got home tonight from my job as finance director for a top - tier Democratic Congressional challenger and read your post regarding the negative impact of Hillary ’s staying in the race upon our Congressional candidates ’ fundraising .
I can say definitively that what you wrote is absolutely true .
My candidate speaks every day to donors who tell him directly that they ’re more focused on the Presidential right now , or that they ’re tapped out because they ’ve given so much to the Presidential .
Or simply , as you say , because they ’re just pissed off about the Presidential .
And that ’s not even counting those who simply do n’t return our calls , or blow the candidate off when we do get them on the phone .
We ’ll never know how many of those people would have been max - out donors to us , but are simply too involved in ( or turned off by ) the Presidential race to give a damn about someone who ’s running for a House seat .
We had a good 1st Quarter anyway , but I do n’t think we can continue to reach our fundraising targets unless this thing gets settled , and quickly .
For her to wait until June is a nightmare that may well guarantee that not only my guy , but dozens and dozens of other challengers will come up badly short of their goals for the 2nd Quarter .
And my candidate is in the very top level of targeted races .
I can only imagine what the lower tiers of challengers are facing ( well , no , actually I ’ve heard from some of them , including the finance chair for a candidate in the Midwest to whom I spoke today ) .
We need her to drop out now , not only for the sake of our real Presidential nominee winning in November , but so that the rest of us can finally have a fighting chance with donors .
Thanks for all you do .
Regards ,
AMERICAblog Reader
The media drumbeat is hard to ignore
On MSNBC last night , Keith Olbermann asked Tim Russert whether the race for the Democratic nomination is over .
Russert ’s response became one of the more talked - about quotes of the evening .
For those of you who ca n’t clips online , Russert responded , “ We now know who the Democratic nominee is going to be , and no one ’s going to dispute it , Keith .
You know , sometimes in campaigns , the candidate is the last to recognize the best timing .
It ’s very much like being on life support — once they start removing the systems , you really have no choice . ”
He added , “ If , in fact , these reports of Senator Clinton giving her campaign more money are true , then the Clintons have a big decision to make in the morning :
Do they go into further debt ? …
Their ability to raise money after the events of tonight – it ’s going to be very difficult .
As opposed to what happened after Pennsylvania , when money roared in , because people saw a realistic chance .
That no longer exists .
They know it , Obama knows it , and the voters … now know it , as well … .
She has some real soul - searching to do .
And those closest to her will give her a hard - headed analysis , and if they lay it all out , they ’ll say , ‘ What is the rationale ?
What do we say to the undeclared superdelegates tomorrow ?
Why do we tell them you ’re staying in the race ? ’
Tonight , there ’s no good answer for that . ”
Now , the point is n’t that Russert is a reliable authority on Democratic politics , or that he somehow has his finger on the pulse of the nation .
He does n’t .
The point is that Russert is largely responsible for articulating the conventional wisdom , embraced by the DC establishment .
And once the establishment decides that a candidate is finished , and starts treating that candidate accordingly , it practically becomes self - fulfilling .
In Clinton ’s case , facing dispiriting metrics , it ’s critical that the broader campaign narrative suggest that she still has a shot at the nomination .
And right now , on every channel , everyone is hearing the opposite .
The morning shows apparently did n’t help Clinton ’s case .
ABC ’s “ Good Morning America ” : “ End of the Road ” NBC ’s “ Today ” : “ Is it Over ? ” CBS ’ “ Early Show ” : “ Obama ’s Big Night ” NBC : Russert repeated his Obama - is - the - nominee line , but hung it on “ objective Democrats ” rather than his own judgment .
Of insiders , said “ the obstacles are overwhelming , and they know it . ”
Russert suggested Obama would help Clinton retire her campaign debt ( and pay off Mark Penn ’s bills ) as part of an exit deal .
Andrea Mitchell : “ She is ready to give up . ” Cited Ed Rendell as the kind of supporter who might ease her out .
Stephanopoulos added , “ More superdelegates will come out today for Barack Obama — they will come three , four , five at a time , and this nomination will be locked up . ”
It looks like the general election begins today .
The apologists for homeopathy are upset again : this time with Professor Edzard Ernst and Simon Singh ’s new book .
Why ?
Because once more homeopathy is exposed for what it is : a placebo .
Dr Damien Downing , the Medical Director for the Alliance for Natural Health ( ANH ) , seems particularly put out .
So much so that he has released a rather silly critique .
( This link seems to be down .
Try here )
After some empty carping he suggests that Ernst is not a very good scientist and then goes on to wrap himself in the flag of good science , “ The scientific method ‘ consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation , and the formulation and testing of hypotheses ’ ( Wikipedia ) – not of unsubstantiated dogmatic statements .
Science has no room for dogma . ”
This is one point I can agree with ; compared to the statements of some other protagonists it ’s pretty reasonable : science should have no room for dogma .
However , Downing is not averse to peddling some homeopathic propaganda .
This is clearly seen in the way he handles evidence .
He refers to , what I would expect , is his best scientific evidence base for homeopathy : the homeopathy evidence section of “ The National Library for Health “ .
He points out that it currently , in his view , “ contains 32 systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of [ homeopathy ’s ] use in a wide range of disorders “ .
He opines , “ Of the 32 , 7 report a statistically significant clinical effect from homeopathy , 6 show a non‐significant trend in its favour , and 3 show no effect ; 16 concluded that there was “ insufficient data ” to draw a conclusion either way . ”
Now I ’ve very closely examined this database in the past and could not disagree more strongly with this ‘ analysis ’ .
It completely misses the main point : if you are concerned with either treating patients , or recovering from illness , what you really need to know is how many of these reports show that homeopathy works as well as the recommended conventional treatment : the answer is none .
[ three more items of ‘ evidence ’ have been added since I looked at the database , none of these have , as yet , been through the complete review process so it would be premature to cite these – hence my review is still relevant . ]
Next , the idea of a “ statistically significant clinical effect ” needs some thought .
Note that it does not claim that there is a clinically significant effect .
That is , an effect that would be worth having .
This is good , because none of the reports show any .
A statistically significant effect just means that the statistical tests used on the data indicate that if the study was repeated it is likely that the difference in outcomes between groups given homeopathic sugar pills and ordinary sugar pills would be seen again .
In other words , the difference between these two groups is not likely to be just the result of chance .
However , not likely here usually means nineteen times out of twenty .
Not too reassuring when you see the number of outcomes measured in some of these studies , or the number of researchers in the world looking at this issue .
Neither do tests of statistical significance account for a range of other impediments including experimenter bias , publication bias , lack of blinding , high drop - out rates from control groups etc .
One of the silliest things in Downing ’s statement is the citing of studies that he contends show “ a non‐significant trend ” in favour of homeopathy .
If the trend is not statistically significant , then it ’s very likely to be nothing more than random noise in the experiment .
This is non-evidence , not evidence .
So we have no evidence to support the use of homeopathy ; the authors of these ‘ positive ’ studies actually ask for more research .
All we have is a small number that claim to reach statistical significance for the particular ‘ homeopathic ’ intervention showing an effect in excess of a placebo .
The next sleight of hand is the contention that , “ 16 concluded that there was “ insufficient data ” to draw a conclusion either way . ”
The “ insufficient data ” part seems to be presented as a quotation .
This phrase does not appear in sixteen of the reports .
Also , the observation that researchers have looked for an effect and not found one tells its own story .
Whilst , in an absolute sense absence of evidence is not evidence of absence ; this is too simplistic .
We need to remember to account for prior probability .
If something genuinely does n’t exist then , by definition , we are never going to find evidence of its existence : there is an absence of evidence of unicorns because they are a myth .
Similarly , absence of evidence for the deeply physically implausible practise of homeopathy is telling us something .
However , if we are looking for something that is likely to be real , the quality of the search for evidence is also important : absence of evidence in high - quality research is clearly informative in a way that a similar result in low - quality research is not .
Seen in this light one of the observations contained in this database , that Downing has mysteriously overlooked , is vital :
“… Studies of high methodological quality were more likely to be negative than the lower quality studies … ” [ Cucherat et al ]
In other words , the better the quality of the search for a homeopathic effect the less likely one is to be found !
This moves us onto the oddly vexatious topic of the famous review by Shang et al .
For Downing , “ … the authors identified 110 relevant studies and then excluded all but 8 of them from the final analysis – and declined to name them !
This would seem to be blatant research misconduct . ”
Reality is somewhat different .
The research progressively excluded studies on the basis of transparent quality criteria .
They were particularly interested in bias and found that is correlated strongly with sample size .
That only eight of over one hundred trials of homeopathy made the cut tells us something important about the quality of research conducted into homeopathy .
That the eight best studies , taken together , showed that homeopathy is no more than a placebo is an entirely proper conclusion – consistent with the findings of Cucherat et al .
Any plea to include more of the original 110 is a plea for the inclusion of bias : not good science .
[ this subject is excellently explored on Paul Wilson ’s blog ]
Again , the better the quality of the search the more negative the findings about homeopathy .
This is , of course , what would be expected if there were no benefits from homeopathic remedies ( aside from the placebo effect ) : seemingly positive results are just noise in the signal and can be removed by proper filtering .
The assertion that the authors refused to name the final eight studies is a persistent piece of homeomythology .
I have commented on this before at some length .
The truth is that Shang and his co-authors unwisely omitted the names of the eight studies from the original paper ; some people pointed this out and they named them in the 17th December 2005 issue of The Lancet .
They have also made the details of the included and excluded papers available on a website .
This all happened in 2005 !
It would seem to me that to raise the banner of good science requires that one , at the very least , keeps up to date with developments !
On the subject of Shang et al , Downing confuses proper scientific conduct with mis-conduct .
This egregious folly can only be the result of a shocking lack of competence or letting personal dogma cloud his judgement .
I prefer to think it is the latter .
In any event , given this woeful performance , it would seem rather embarrassing to vilify Ernst as a bad scientist .
Unfortunately Downing is not alone in perpetuating the myth of the secret eight ; worse still others completely fail to understand Shang et al .
It ’s worth noting that Downing ’s much vaunted “ National Library for Health ” database contains one review that , taken at face value , is very problematic for a homeopathy advocate .
A meta-analysis of homeopathy for postoperative ileus by Barnes et al was not able to reach a definitive judgement .
However their data indicated that studies working with potencies below 12C ( there could be some active agent left ) provided a statistically significant reduction in time to first flatus ( vs. placebo ) whereas those using potencies above 12C ( odds are that just the solvent is left ) did not .
Now , because homeopathic ‘ remedies ’ are usually diluted to potencies beyond 12 C it both flatly contradicts both usual homeopathic practise and the ‘ less is more ’ notion of the ‘ law ’ of infinitesimals .
Finally , the most positive review contained in this database , covering trails of a homeopathic ‘ medicine ’ for vertigo ( that many homeopaths would n’t recognise as proper homeopathy anyway ! ) made this plea :
“… The positive effects of Vertigoheel in vertigo are based on good levels of evidence , but larger trials are required … ” [ Karkos et al ]
If this is the best evidence that apologists for homeopathy have to offer one wonders why they bother .
The real answer is that this debate is not about the evidence at all ; it is about some believers in an out - moded quasi-religious system of medicine clutching at fig - leaves to cover their embarrassment .
Science certainly has no room for dogma .
Propaganda is n’t that helpful either , but that is all Downing and other apologists are peddling .
RUGER ® SR9 ® PRODUCT SAFETY WARNING AND RECALL NOTICE
We have determined that some Ruger® SR9 ® pistols manufactured between October 2007 and April 2008 could , under certain conditions , fire if dropped with their manual safeties in the " off " or " fire " position .
The pistols will not fire if the manual safety is in the " on " or " safe " position .
How to determine if your pistol needs the retrofit :
It is easy to determine if your pistol has been retrofitted by simply looking at it .
Although both the old and new trigger group have a two - stage trigger , the original design had an inner " shoe " that was not visible and , therefore , appeared to be a single trigger ( See Figure 1 ) .
The new trigger design incorporates a visible inner trigger of a blade design ( See Figure 2 ) .
Click here to view PDF of the retrofit changes .
Figure 1 Figure 2
Original trigger group – Pistol needs retrofit
New trigger group – Pistol does not need retrofit
If you own an SR9 ®
Pistol bearing a serial number below 30000 ( that is , 330-29999 or less ) that has not been retrofitted , please contact us immediately to arrange return of the pistol .
Step 1 - Contact us via email at SR9recall@ruger.com or phone at 1-800-784-3701 and provide your name , address , the serial number of your pistol , your telephone number and the best time to call .
Step 2 - We will verify that your pistol is subject to the recall and will send you a packing container , detailed instructions and shipping label so you can send your pistol to us FREE of charge .
Step 3 - We will install the new trigger group in your SR9 ® and return it to you FREE of charge .
Do not load or fire your pistol until it has been factory retrofitted with these new parts !
If you must fire your pistol , be sure to keep the manual safety in the " on " or " safe " position except when you are actually firing .
Thank you ,
Sturm , Ruger & Co. , Inc .
We recognize that this is an inconvenience so , as a thank you , we will include an extra magazine at no charge to you when we return the pistol .
For Connecticut residents ( only ) , we will send you a ShopRuger.com gift certificate in lieu of the magazine .
Credit card advertisers have a difficult task – after all they are selling debt !
Think about it .
Credit cards are a means of accessing money , by pre-arrangement , which is n’t yours and which you have to pay back .
Having said that , any commercial advertising credit card needs to be both positive and have desirable associations .
How credit card providers go about achieving these goals has been the cause of some very creative and clever entertainment as you ’ll have seen .
MasterCard ’s Master Commercials
The most famous credit card commercials , of course , are the MasterCard Priceless commercials – and all of the parody ads made in the same style .
So , if its true that imitation is a form of flattery then MasterCard really have pulled off a marketing coup .
You know you ’ve struck a cord with popular culture when you get a mention in The Simpsons .
Credit Cards Made Attractive Using Celebrities
Not to be undone , American Express credit cards have used the endorsement of famous celebrities shopping in their “ My Life .
My card ” campaigns .
As an aside , check out this funny British comedy skit ( ‘ Not the Nine O’Clock News ’ ) making fun of the American Express cardholder back in the 80’s .

The Big Credit Limit Angle
This Korean credit card provider designed the commercial to illustrate how the card ’s big credit limit makes you bigger than all the rest of the crowd .
Rewards Sell
This commercial incentivises the rewards of the credit card itself to lure potential customers to apply .
Credit Card Theft Protection
CitiBank employed the creative use of acting and voiceovers to successfully get across the real threat of identity theft , and how you are protected from it .
Banking Customer Service
Again , CitiBank uses humour to address people ’s bad customer service experiences with those ‘ other ’ credit card providers .
Of courses , Citi are perfect .
Extras
Again , CitiBank choose the humourous slant to get you to buy into their product .
Dramatic , Old Western - Style Visa Commercial
It seems they needed plastic cards back in the days of the wild wild west , presumably because of the safety benefits they offered : they could n’t be cloned or used to buy anything .

from the BBC :
Campaign group Pants to Poverty said the “ pantathlon ” showed “ the unfinished business of third world debt ”
… “ Ten years ago this same weekend , 70,000 people gave birth to a new phase in the fight against poverty .
“ This event shows our committed ‘ panters ’ are prepared to drop their clothes to drive governments to drop the debt . ”
Craig Haynes , 22 , of Leamington Spa , Warwickshire , was one of those taking part .
He said : “ We ’re here , not to expose ourselves , but to expose injustice . ”
An Illinois man says he doubles his gas mileage by driving at or below the speed limit and sticking to the right lane on the highway .
His creeping along might tick you off , but he 's getting great gas mileage .
Wayne Gerdes ' standard engine 2005 Honda Accord has an average EPA mileage rating of 25 miles per gallon .
Gerdes almost doubles that .
His average is 48 miles per gallon .
Gerdes is the guru of what he calls " hypermiling . "
" I used to be the ' A ' type personality , left hand lane , passing everybody , going down I - 94 at 80 miles an hour , then 9/11 happened , " Gerdes said .
No longer willing to pour as much money into Mideast oil , Gerdes started his own website called CleanMPG.com .
On it , he and several thousand other Americans have developed a set of driving and car maintenance techniques to squeeze all the miles they can out of every gallon .
Gerdes begins each trip by coasting down his driveway , then down the street for a block or two .
He says he knows he infuriates some other drivers , like the tailgaters he calls " proctologists " or the speed demons he calls " mad rabbits , " but he continues like that , gliding silently when he can , turning the engine on only when he has to -- even in traffic .
" When you go to a red light and you 're going to sit for two minutes , shut your engine off , " Gerdes said .
Hypermilers also recommend filling your tires to maximum pressure and using lightweight synthetic oil .
" Average driver in this is paying $ 3.89 a gallon to travel 25 miles .
I 'm paying $ 2 , maybe $ 2.10 to travel the same 25 miles , " Gerdes said .
Gerdes , who does not visit the gas pumps as often as the rest of us , admits that shutting the engine off while moving might be illegal in some jurisdictions , but he says it should n't be .
He points to the fact that the Prius and other full hybrid vehicles do the same thing automatically .
ネット検索は第3世代に進化するか
グーグル先生を超える良回答連発、Powersetを使ってみた
インターネットの検索でエポックメーキングな出来事は2度しか起こっていない。1994年にジェリー・ヤン氏らが立ち上げたヤフーがインターネットに検索をもたらしたときと、1998年にラリー・ペイジ氏らがグーグルを立ち上げ、Webページの重要度を示す「PageRank」という概念を導入したときだ。検索連動広告の発明もビジネス的には大きなステップだったが、使い勝手の向上というユーザー視点での転回点は2つだけだ。いま、ベンチャー企業の米Powersetが注目を集め、3つ目のイノベーションを起こすかどうかが注目されている。
自然言語検索のベータ版サービスを開始した米Powerset（http://www.powerset.com/）
ネット検索の歴史：数から順位への転換
Powersetが解決しようとしている問題を明確にするために、インターネットの検索エンジンの歴史を少しだけ振り返ってみよう。
グーグルが登場する以前、各検索サイトは、自分たちがいかに多くのWebページをクロールし、検索に対してどれだけたくさんの結果を返せるかを吹聴していた。例えば2000年6月のINTERNET
Watchの記事を読むと、当時インターネット全体で10億ページがあり、グーグルはこのうち5億ページをインデックスしているとある。そのほか、当時まだ人気のあった検索エンジン、AltaVistaが12億ページの中から有用な6億ページをインデックスしているだとか、Inktomiが5億ページをインデックス済みで、次のバージョンアップで10億ページをカバーする計画を発表しているとある。
もはや誰も、そんな数字は口にしない。
現在、単純なクローリングで情報を引き出せないWeb上の情報、通称「ディープウェブ」と呼ばれる領域へ手を伸ばす試みが始まっている。グーグルのWebクローラーは、すでにJavaScriptエンジンを搭載したインテリジェントなものに進化しており、簡単なメニュー程度であれば機械的に展開して情報を収集できる。しかし、人間向けに作られた複雑なUIのために、クロールしきれていない情報は、まだ多いとされている。
ディープウェブの議論を置いておけば、もはや検索エンジンのカバー範囲が問題になることは、ほとんどない。インターネットに何十億ページあろうが、そのうちグーグルが何億ページをカバーしていようが、誰も気にしないだろう。グーグルが証明したのは、検索において重要なのは、どれだけたくさんの情報が出てくるかではなく、どれだけ検索キーワードと関連性が高い、重要な情報が上位に出てくるかだということだ。言い換えれば、検索結果に含まれるページの数ではなく、重要なのはページの順位ということだ。ほとんどのユーザーは検索結果の上位の5つぐらいしかクリックしないと言われている。
Powersetはページ検索ではなく情報検索
インターネット検索に3度目の転機が訪れるかも知れないと鳴り物入りで登場したのがPowersetだ（参考記事：Powerset、「質問の答え」を見つけてくれる検索エンジンをβ公開）。自然言語検索の技術を使い、通常の人間の言葉による質問に対して、それに適した回答を探し出してくれる。
5月12日に一般公開されたPowersetのベータ版を使って、早速いろいろな検索を試してみた。
グーグルとの違いをひと言で言えば、グーグルが検索キーワードに最も関連のある「ページ」を提示してくれるのに対して、Powersetは「情報そのもの」を提示してくれるということだ。
具体的にいくつか例で見てみよう。以下の例で注意してほしいのは、Powersetが現在検索対象としているのはWikipediaの英語版と、アルファ版公開中のオンラインデータベース「Freebase」だけであるのに対して、グーグルはインターネット全体が検索対象である点だ。もう1つ、以下の例ではフルセンテンスで検索したが、Powersetは1単語や単語の羅列も受け付ける。
■アルカトラズ島から逃げた囚人の数は？
「 アルカトラズ島から逃げた囚人の数は ？
（How many prisoners have escaped from the Alcatraz Island？） 」 という検索に対する結果は、グーグルとPowersetで以下の通りとなった。
グーグル で 「 アルカトラズ島から逃げた囚人の数は？（How many prisoners have escaped from the Alcatraz Island？） 」 と検索した結果。微妙に答えらしきセンテンスが見えているが、本文に飛ばないと正解は分からない
同じ検索文 でPowersetで検索した結果。ずばり答えが含まれる部分が表示されている。この例では「36」は正答ではないが、少なくとも数字を聞かれていることを認識してハイライト表示していることは分かる
グーグル はWikipediaのアルカトラズ島の項をトップに持ってきている。答えは当該ページを読めば分かる。脱獄不能と言われたアルカトラズの監獄で本当に脱獄に成功した囚人がいなかったことが分かる。従来の検索エンジンのパラダイムでは、これ以上の答えは望めない。
しかし 、Powersetの出してきた答えは、これとは異なる。ずばり、関連する段落がトップに表示され、検索結果をクリックしなくても答えが分かるのだ。「how many」とフレーズを認識したPowersetは「36」という数字をハイライトしている。
ただし、ここでは正答は36人ではない。計14回あった脱獄計画に36人の囚人が関わり、誰1人として脱獄に成功していないというのが正答だ。結局人間が読まなければならないという意味では、まだ機械は人間の言葉である自然言語を理解するというレベルにはほど遠いが、それにしてもグーグルとの違いは一目瞭然だ。グーグルではアルカトラズ島の解説ページに飛んで、目でざっと読むか「escape、break、sneak」などいくつかの単語で検索して該当個所を探す必要がある。
■イルカってどうやって呼吸してるの？
グーグル検索でトップにヒットしたページ
も う1例やってみよう。「イルカってどうやって呼吸してるの？（How do dolphins breathe？） 」という検索だ 。
グーグルの検索結果トップに来たのはイルカ好きのイギリス人が作った個人サイトの右のようなページだ。イルカたちが、頭のてっぺんにある潮吹き穴で呼吸するということが写真入りで端的に解説されていて、おそらくこれ以上の回答を望む人は少数派だろう。また、グーグルの検索結果では「頭のてっぺんにある潮吹き穴で呼吸する」というセンテンスがずばり検索結果のトップに表示されていて検索結果をクリックするまでもなく答えが分かる。この例ではグーグルとPowersetで差がつかなかった。
グーグルを使って 「 イルカってどうやって呼吸してるの？
（How do dolphins breathe？） 」 と検索した例。ずばり端的な回答が検索結果トップの下に表示されている
Powersetでもイルカの呼吸法について端的に説明する箇所を正しく提示できている
■ IBM のPC部門を買ったのはどこ？
次の例ではグーグルとPowersetの微妙な差が分かる。「IBMのPC部門を買ったのはどこ？（Who bought the IBM's PC division？） 」 という検索文だ 。
グーグルでは、中国で発行される英字新聞チャイナ・デイリーの速報記事にヒットし、答えがレノボ・グループであることが検索結果をクリックするまでもなく分かる。
一方 、Powersetの結果も似たようなもので、Wikipediaのレノボの項目中で該当するセンテンスがずばり検索結果のトップに表示されている。しかし、よく見ると「purchase」（購入）という語がハイライトされている。これは「purchase」（購入）が「buy」（買う）という口語的単語の同義語として扱われているということだ。従来の単なる語彙レベルの一致ではなく、Powersetでは同類語にヒットした結果も積極的に表示するという違いが見て取れる。
グーグル で 「 IBM のPC部門を買ったのはどこ？（Who bought the IBM's PC division？） 」 と検索した例。チャイナ・デイリーの記事にヒットし、ちゃんと必要な答えが表示されている
Powersetでは「 purchase」（購入）という語がハイライトされており、「buy」（買う）という口語的単語の同義語として扱われていることが分かる
■ MacBook AirってUSBポートあったけ？
次の例でもずばりと答えを表示したのはグーグルではなくPowersetのほうだった。
「 MacBook Airっ てUSBポートあったけ？
（Does the MacBook Air has any USB ports？） 」 という検索文に対 し てPowersetが出してきた答えは「それに加えて、MacBook Airは1つだけしかUSB
ポートを持たない……
（In addition , the MacBook Air offers only a single USB port ...）」 というセンテンスだ。
一方グーグルのほうはガジェット系ブログサイト
のEngadgetがヒットした。ヒットしたエントリはAirQueueというUSB拡張デバイスに関するもので、探していた答えは含まれていなかった。Engadgetはページランクが高いのかもしれないが、求めている答えはなかった。これは、よりグーグル向けの検索方法と考えられる「MacBook Air USB 」 としたときでも同様だった。
グーグルを使った検索では、良質な情報を含む「ページ」がたくさん出てくるが、Webブラウザで行きつ戻りつしながら求めている「情報」を目で探すというステップで手間取るケースもある。
これはアルカトラズの監獄の例と同じことだが、重量や寸法といったデータを検索するような例でも、Powersetの威力がよりハッキリと分かる。
ただし、こうした検索例はPowersetが事実上Wikipediaだけを対象としていることによる結果でもあり、あまり公平な比較とはいえないかもしれない。また理由は定かではないが、以下の例ではグーグルのほうが、より簡単に正答（もしくは満足できる情報）を得られたと報告しておきたい。「アボカドって冷凍庫に入れなきゃいけないの？（Do
I need to keep avocado in a freezer？） 」 「 アメリカで最大の発行部数を持つ新聞は？
（What 's the American newspaper with the largest circulation？） 」 「 ハリーポッターの最初のっていつ出たんだっけ？
（When did the first Harry Potter come out？） 」 。
「 MacBook Airっ てUSBポートあったけ？
（Does the MacBook Air has any USB ports？） 」 という検索文に対 し てPowersetは、検索結果トップで「それに加えて、MacBook Airは1つだけしかUSBポートを持たない……」というセンテンスを提示している
Powerset で 「 MacBook Airって重さどのぐらい？（How much does the MacBook Air weigh？ ） 」 と検索した例。ずばりの回答がトップに出ているほか、単位のついた数字がハイライトされているのが分かる。単に「 how much 」を見ているだけの可能性もあるが、見やすい結果には違いない。よく見るとメートル法の「cm」が無視されているが、これは度量衡の国際標準への移行におけるアメリカの後進性を示しているのだろう
グーグル で「 MacBook Airって重さどのぐらい？（How much does the MacBook Air weigh？ ） 」 と検索した結果。旧モデル のMacBookの重量がトップに出ている。2つ目の候補にはアップルのFAQサイトに含まれる該当箇所が表示されているが、画面に出ているのは回答ではなく質問文のほうだけだ
「 症状 」 で「 吐き気 」 「 頭痛 」 「 熱 」などをハイライ ト
Powsersetは 「 purchase 」と「 buy」のような同義語だけではなく、関連する語彙も認識するようだ。それを示すのは、次のような検索例だ。
記者は先週、サンフランシスコであったJava関連のイベントに出ていたのだが、そこでノロウイルスの感染被害が発生した。イベント会期のど真ん中、70人あまりが腹痛や嘔吐を訴えた。参加者が1万人を超える大イベントなので記者が感染する確率は低かったが、ホテルに戻ってテレビニュースで知って事態の大きさに驚いた。
気になったのはノロウイルスの潜伏期間や、それがどの程度ひどい症状を患者にもたらすかなどだ。
このくらいであれば、インターネット上のどこかに非常に良く書けた解説が軽く数十は見つかると検索する前から分かっている。そして、かなり読みやすいページがグーグルの検索結果の上位3つに含まれることも分かっている。しかし、それでも検索してから目的の情報（答え）にたどり着くまでに、Webページの構造を把握し、本文や箇条書きから正しいセンテンスを人間が目で見て探し出すというステップは残っている。
Powersetは、このステップを取り除こうとしている。
PowersetでWikipediaの項目を開くと、以下の画面のような独自インターフェイスが現れる。右側にページ全体の段落構造が表示され、検索にヒットした段落や単語、センテンスが全体のどこにあるかがハイライト表示で示されている。このインターフェイスはFlashではなくJavaScriptで書かれているようだが、非常にスムーズにスクロールする。また本文側をスクロールしても右の段落表示の画面は追随してくるため、自分が全体のどの当たりを読んでいるかが分かりやすくなっている。
このダイアログボックスには検索ウィンドウがあり、ここで「症状（symptoms）」と入力すると、本文側が「兆候と症状（Signs and symptoms）」という段落に自動的にスクロールする。そして、もっとも答えに近いセンテンスが薄くハイライトされた上で、「吐き気（nausea）」「下痢（diarrhea） 」「痛み（pain） 」 「頭痛（headache）」などが強くハイライト表示される。まさに求めていた答えだ。これはPowersetが「症状」という語が、さまざまな具体的症状を包含する上位概念であると理解していることを示している。さらに記者はノロウイルスによる死亡例があるのかどうかが気になって「die」（死ぬ）という語彙で該当項目を検索してみたのだが、「kill」（殺す）という語彙にヒットした。死ぬと殺すは同義語ではないし、単純な意味での反意語でもないが、同じグループに属しているのだろう。
Powersetは一般向けベータテスト公開前から大きな注目を集め、マイクロソフトによる買収も噂されている。それはPowersetが単に自然言語による検索が可能というだけでなく（それはどんな検索エンジンでもある程度できる）、概念や文章の構造を理解した上で適切な回答を探すという新しいアプローチが期待されているからだ。
Powerset は 「 セマンティック・アプリケーション」
Powersetの技術は 「 セマンティックWeb」と呼ばれる次世代Web技術を先取りした、「セマンティック・アプリケーション」（またはセマンティック・サーチ）の1種だという見方がある。
セマンティッ クWebは、インターネット（HTMLやXML）で、より意味論的な情報を扱えるようにするための技術や仕様の総称で、WWW（World Wide Web。Webは昔そう呼ばれていた）の生みの親であるティム・バーナーズ＝リー氏が提唱したものだ。2000年頃には「次世代インターネット」としてバズワード的に騒がれた。
セマンティッ クWebはアカデミックな世界では盛んに研究されてきたが、まだほとんど普及していない。現在までに概念の階層構造を扱う“オントロジー辞書”や、そのマークアップのための標準的技術仕様、それに対応した処理エンジンなどが作成されているが、インターネットの世界（HTML）を作っているのは研究者たちではなく、エンドユーザーだ。エンドユーザーやWebデザイナーたちが日常的に小難しい新技術を使うと期待するのは無理がある。
トップダウン的に仕様を決め、あらゆるWebページにメタ情報（機械に分かる意味）を付けるのではなく、ボトムアップ的にインターネットをセマンティックにしていこうというのが、最近の流れだ。
その1つが「microformats」と総称されるHTMLのマークアップスタイルだ。例えば「2008/05/13」という単なる文字列が、人間だけでなく機械（Webクローラーなど）にも日付であることが分かるように、タグの属性を使って日付であることを明示する。まだmicroformatsを採用したWebサービスは多くないが、徐々に増えている。こうしたマークアップスタイルが普及すれば、検索エンジンは「2008年1月から5月までのIT関連イベント」といった検索クエリに対して、より有効な結果を提示できるだろう。
セマンティック・アプリケーションは、ボトムアップ的にインターネットをセマンティック化する動きと見ることができる。すべての人がセマンティック関連技術を利活用するようになるのは、おそらくWeb 2.0 やWeb 3.0では無理で 、Web
5.0ぐらいになるのではないか。そうではなく、特定領域に絞って適用すれば、それだけでも大きな成果が得られるのだから、今すぐにセマンティック技術を使おう――、それがセマンティック・アプリケーションの発想で、一群のベンチャー企業を生み出している。Powersetも、そうした企業群の1つだ。2010年までにセマンティック技術関連市場は524億ドル規模に拡大するという予測もある（参考記事：基盤が整い普及期に入るセマンティックWeb）。
Powersetが、グーグルの対抗馬となるべくインターネット全体をクロールして検索サービスを提供することになるのかどうかは分からない。むしろ、あらかじめ対象とするWebサイトの構造が分かっているときにPowersetのような検索エンジンの威力は発揮されるだろう。Powersetの検索結果画面を見れば分かるように、Wikipediaは1つのタブとなっている。Wikipiaは扱いやすい事例の1つというだけで、今後はタブを増やしていく形で、Powersetはニュースサイトや情報サービスを統合していくのではないだろうか。
例え ばAmazon.comのようなeコマースサイトを対象にして「最近売れているプログラミング言語の本は何？」というような検索インターフェイスを提供できれば、売る側にも買う側にもメリットがあるだろう。旅行代理店なら「どこか南の島で来月まだ予約できるところは？」というような検索は魅力的だ。
ビル・ジョイ氏の業績を手っ取り早く調べる
Powersetには、もう1つ「 Factz」という興味深いサマリー機能がある。検索語が人名や場所、会社名などの固有名詞であった場合、その基本的属性や概説が1画面に収まる形でリストアップされるというものだ。
例えば 「 ビル・ジョイ 」 （Bill Joy）のような人名を検索すると 、Wikipediaの記述の冒頭と並ぶ形で誕生日や出身地、家族の名前、職業、宗教などがリストアップされる。右の欄に表示される属性情報はデータベースのFreebaseから生成している。俳優の「トム・クルーズ」（Tom Cruise）とすると、表示される属性情報には「出演した映画」として映画の名前がリストアップされる。
「 ビル・ジョイ 」 （Bill Joy）のように人名で検索すると、サマリーや基本的な属性情報が表示される
気が利いているの はWikipediaの記述にある重要な動詞と、それに対応する名詞を認識して、それを整理した動的なインターフェイスで提供している点だ。
ビル・ジョイ氏は起業家やソフトウェア開発者として知られるが「founded（創業した）」という動詞に対して「Sun Microsystems , firm , HighBAR Ventures and Sun.」という名詞群が対応して表示されるほか、「developed（開発した）」には「BSD、shell……」などが対応して表示される。
驚くのは、この情報の元となったセンテンスが「 Bill Joy ( a primary developer of BSD ) 」となっていることだ。ビル・ジョイ氏がBSDを開発したことを意味する箇所は名詞句となっていて、developという動詞そのものは含まれていない。ここにも単純な語彙レベルのマッチングではなく、背後で意味論的な解析が行われている形跡が見て取れる。
ビル・ジョイという人物が何をしたかということが「動詞＋名詞」の組み合わせで一覧表示される。サン・マイクロシステムズやVCのHighBARベンチャーズなどを創立した（founded）ことや、BSDを開発した（developed）ことが分かる。developという語では動詞ではなく名詞句にヒットしていることに注目
このFactzの表示にはAjaxが使われており、適度に情報が折りたたまれて表示されている。各動詞をクリックすると、実際に該当する文章がハイライトして表示されるほか、「More」ボタンをクリックすることで表示する動詞の数を増やせる。ノイズも多いが、例えば「 Bill
Joy envosioned language .（ビル・ジョイは言語を構想した）」という、まるで哲学者の箴言か聖典からの引用のような、端的で、いやに鋭い項目もある（該当箇所を読んでみるとビル・ジョイ氏はMesaとC言語の良いところを組み合わせて新言語、Javaを構想したとあり、そのサマリーになっているようだ）。
Powersetはグーグルにとって脅威となるか
モバイルからSaaS、SNSまで、広範な領域で新規サービス・ソフトウェアの開発を進めるグーグルだが、検索も忘れたわけではない。現在、同社の実験サービスサイト「
Google Experimental LABS 」では新しい検索エンジンを公開している。
新検索エンジンでは、例え ば「 1980-2000 」「 japan」と時期や場所を指定した検索や「30〜40 inch」と長さを範囲指定した検索が可能だ。時系列に沿ってヒットしたページの量をグラフで表示する機能などもある。Powersetと異なり、情報検索というよりもページ検索を指向しているという違いが感じられるが、それでもセマンティックサーチ的な進化の方向性は見られる。
Powersetはグーグルにとって脅威となるだろうか？
すでに書いたように 、Powersetがうまく結果を持ってこられるのはWikipediaやFreebaseといった特定の、しかも構造が比較的きれいなWebサイトだけを対象としているからという可能性がある。Powersetが検索対象を増やしたときに、意味のある結果を返せるかどうかは、まだ分からない。そもそもPowersetが全インターネットを対象としない可能性もあり、比較は意味がないかもしれない。
グーグルの良さはクロール頻度や順位付けノウハウ
も う1つ、現在のPowersetがほぼ静的で変更のないデータしか相手にしていないことも忘れてはならない。グーグル検索の良さは、クローリング頻度と、その順位付けにある。
ノロウイルスに続いて再び個人的体験で恐縮だが、以下のような検索ニーズに対してPowersetがどこまで応えられるかはまったく不明だ。
記者は出張中のサンフランシスコで飛び降り自殺を目撃した。正確には目撃する寸前だった。ビルの4階あたりから飛び降りようとする30絡みの男をしばらく人だかりの中で見ていたのが、おそらく1時間経っても飛び降りないだろうと、10分ほどでその場を立ち去った。その晩、別の記者から私が立ち去った5分後に男が飛び降りたと聞かされた。ただ、死なずに済んだのかどうかが分からない。
気になった記者はグーグルで 「 san francisco suicide 」 で検索した。地元新聞も見たが、関係する情報がなかなか見つからない。しばらくすると、Yahoo!のQ＆Aサイトで、私とまったく同じ質問をしている人が見つかった。そこには現場にいたとする目撃者からの回答があり、読むに耐えない恐ろしい記述と、死亡したという事実が書かれていた。
こうした情報がグーグルの検索ですんなりと出てくるのは、ある種のWebサイトでのクロール頻度が高いからだろう。また、地元新聞のベタ記事にもならないできごとの伝聞情報が、ちゃんと検索で上位に表示されるのは、ページの鮮度を勘案して順位を決定しているからとだろう。「san francisco suicide 」の検索に対して、サンフランシスコの自殺予防センターや、過去にゴールデンゲートブリッジから飛び降りた自殺者のリストと、「さっき起こった出来事」を同程度に優先するべき理由はある。グーグルが支持されるのは、そうした順位付けにおける各種アルゴリズムやパラメータのさじ加減が絶妙に感じられるからだろう。とすれば、Powersetのベータ版サービスは、まだこうした領域でグーグルを脅かすだけの力があるかどうか、何も証明していないということになる。
さらに、インターネット全体という巨大なデータを対象に高頻度なクローリングとインデクシングを継続するためには膨大な計算機資源とテクニックが必要だということもある。GFSやMapReduceの名で知られるグローバルな分散ファイルシステムや並列処理技術など、グーグルのインフラ面での優位については簡単に揺らぎそうもない。
Powersetとグーグルでは、もともと目指しているものが異なるのかもしれない。ただ、およそあらゆるインターネット上の検索に対して有効と考えられていた汎用的なグーグル検索に対して、有力なライバルが現れたことだけは間違いないだろう。

Global use of the pesticide DDT has been sharply curtailed since the 1970s , so it ’s natural to expect that over time , less of it would find its way into living creatures .
And that has generally been the case : although many organisms still have detectable levels of DDT in fatty tissues , those levels have generally declined .
Not so among Adélie penguins in the Western Antarctic Peninsula , however , according to a study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology .
DDT levels in these birds have remained about the same in the past 30 years , and the researchers say it ’s likely that Antarctic glaciers , which would have accumulated DDT through atmospheric deposition before its use was restricted , are delivering the pesticide into the food chain through meltwater .
Image DDT levels in Adélie penguins in Antarctica have stayed the same .

Powder your work surface with a good amount of corn starch .
Pinch off a lemon - sized ball of marshmallow fondant and roll it out to about 1/4 - 1/8 " ( 3 - 6 mm ) thick .
A very strong endorsement for Obama from the Philadelphia Daily News .
The editorial writers do not mince words here at all :
Contrary to Sen. Hillary Clinton ’s campaign slogan , we believe Barack Obama is more likely to be “ ready on Day One ” to lead us in a new direction .
Because of his experience .
Sure , Clinton has more “ experience ” of a sort .
For one thing , she has 14 more years on earth .
How much of this experience is directly applicable to the job of president is , at best , debatable .
We are frankly troubled by her assumption that her husband ’s administration and accomplishments were her own .
And if her equation holds , that the first spouse is an equal partner in the administration , then the reappearance of Bill Clinton in the White House is a prospect we have a hard time reconciling with the work that needs to be done .
THERE IS a way to match Clinton ’s and Obama ’s performances on a relatively equal playing field : their campaigns .
A candidate ’s campaign may be the best indicator of how she or he will govern .
If so , an Obama administration would be well - managed , inclusive and astonishingly broad - based .
It would make good use of technology and communicate a message of unity and , yes , hope .
It would not be content with eking out slim victories by playing to the narrow interests of the swing voters of the moment while leaving the rest of the country as deeply divided as ever .
Instead , an Obama administration would seek to expand the number of Americans who believe that they have a personal stake in our collective future – and that they have the power to change things .
It would motivate them to hold their representatives accountable for making it happen .
That is , after all , the only way to get us out of Iraq , to address global warming , to make us energy - independent .
It ’s the only way to resist the forces arrayed against providing universal health care , rebuilding our infrastructure and returning our schools to world - class status .
It ’s the only way to give our children the means to compete with children in other parts of the world who are healthier , better - educated and have more opportunities than many of our own .
An Obama administration would be freer of the the corrupting influence of big - money donors and corporate interests .
Obama has raised $ 240 million overall , with half coming in contributions of less than $ 200 .
People who contribute to political campaigns can feel they “ own ” a candidate and so Obama would owe allegiance to the wide swath of America that has financed his campaign .
Based on his experience in running a quarter - billion - dollar enterprise with thousands upon thousands of volunteers , we could expect an Obama administration to be well - managed and cost - effective , with the president choosing forward - thinking advisers committed to his program , demanding that they work as a team and pay attention to details .
He would be steady and calm , given neither to irrational exuberance or outbursts of anger .
He would make mistakes , that ’s for sure , but he could be expected to recognize them , adjust , and move forward .
He would adjust his views to reality rather than trying to adjust reality to his views .
Obama ’s unprecedented appeal to younger voters is significant not only because it expands the electorate , which is vital .
It ’s also a validation of his promise as a president to be free of the baby - boomer / Vietnam / segregation - era hangups .
Younger people are more egalitarian , more accepting of diversity , and more comfortable with rapid change .
They also are less confined by old resentments or regrets .
AND AN OBAMA administration would lower the tone of the rhetoric that separates us .

My friend got kicked out of french once .
Faustmaster300 :
He goes , 'Madam !
I have a joke for you !'
Faustmaster300 :' What is it Zach ? '
Faustmaster300 :' Why was n't Jesus born in Paris ? '
Faustmaster300 : 'THEY COULDN'T FIND THREE WISE MEN !'
Faustamster300 : and after about 10 min of sitting the hallway , he pops his head back in the door and goes , ' Oh , and they could n't find a virgin either . '
In general , we do n't like to think of mullets as being very religious ( and we 're probably right in our assumption ) .
BUT , once in a while a beauty like this will come along and remind us that mullets can -- and do -- defy stereotypes and classification .
The Catholic Latino makes up a large group of humans and for one of them to have a mullet is a big day in the communullty .
Not only does this species fit the criteria for this particular classification , but he ALSO adds an insane amount of flamboyancy & charisma and overall sex appeal - all which makes this mull a precious find .
* Girls : Hector can be a hard - ass sometimes , but he 's got integrity AND a great heart .
YES , he is single .
Interests include : Early Madonna , soccer games in random parks ( usually located near freeways or major highways ) , cars built in the 1980's with those long , thin , medal ' whisps ' that stick out of the tire area ( I think they might be called FEELERS ??? ) and churros .
If you share any of these hobbies and are attracted to Hector , e-mull a pic / description , and I 'll pass it along .
He 's a busy man though , so do n't expect a quick response any time soon .
I cannot reprint the text of that letter because I wrote it to him directly from his website , and did not save a copy .
Keep in mind , Shays is a Republican .
Republicans , as a party , extol the virtues of personal freedom and responsibility , unless it 's about what you put in your body or do to your body , or who you sleep with .
Then they get all up in your shit .
Consequently I did not expect his support on this issue , but I figured it could n't hurt to write .
Recently I read a newspaper article about H.R.5843 , The Act to Remove Federal Penalties for the Personal Marijuana Use by Responsible Adults ( read full text of the bill here ) .
Basically it says you can have 100 grams or less pot for " personal use , " and if you get caught smoking in public , it 's a hundred dollar fine .
Now I do n't know how much 100 grams is , but it sounds like a lot .
Certainly more than you need to get your rocks off .
The bill is sponsored by Barney Frank and Ron Paul , both of whom I like a lot , and it finally seeks to address our nation 's drug hypocrisy , which I hate .
The hypocrisy is this : 40 % of Americans have smoked or will smoke marijuana during their lifetimes .
It 's less dangerous than alcohol or cigarettes , and yet we allow our political leaders pretend that it 's some dangerous scourge that 's going to infect our youth and turn them into brownie - munching zombies .
To which I say : bullshit .
And besides , even if it does , brownies are delicious .
Dear Michael :
Thank you for contacting my office expressing support for H.R. 5843 , the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act .
I appreciate you taking the time to contact my office .
I would be inclined to oppose H.R. 5843 should it come to the House floor for my consideration .
This legislation would eliminate federal penalties for the possession of up to 100 grams of marijuana and the not - for - profit transfer of one ounce ( 28.3 grams ) of marijuana .
Additionally , this legislation would provide for a civil penalty of $ 100 for the public use of marijuana .
While the medical use of marijuana may have its benefits , the fact is , recreational use of marijuana is not benign .
Smoked marijuana damages the brain , heart , lungs and immune system .
It impairs learning and interferes with memory , perception and judgment .
Smoked marijuana contains cancer - causing compounds and has been implicated in a high percentage of automobile crashes and workplace accidents .
By legalizing the medical use of marijuana we would be opening the door to easier production and accessibility for others .
Please do not hesitate to contact my office again .
If you would be interested in receiving my e-newsletter to update you about my work on your behalf in Washington , or for other information , please visit my website at www.house.gov/shays to sign up or to contact me .
Sincerely ,
Christopher Shays
Member of Congress

I cannot guarantee the integrity of the text of this letter if it was not sent to you directly from my Congressional Email Account : rep.shays@mail.house.gov .
If you have any questions about the validity of this message , please email me or call my Washington , DC office at : 202/225-5541 .
I found this response annoying because nowhere in my letter to him did I mention medical marijuana , as I think that 's a side issue , and I did n't want to use it as an excuse to talk about recreational marijuana smoking .
Also , I think his argument that marijuana has been " implicated in a high percentage of automobile crashes and workplace accidents " is specious .
What percentage ?
What are you basing this on ?
Where are you getting your information ?
I appreciated that he told me " not to hesitate to contact " his office again .
So I did .
I wrote back another letter :
Dear Congressman Shays ,
Thank you for responding to my email in support of HR 5843 .
While I agree with you that marijuana poses some health risks , I maintain that the risks are minimal , especially when compared with alcohol and cigarettes .
According to the National Vital Statistic Report , in 2005 there were 21,634 alcohol - related deaths in the United States excluding accidents and homicide .
The CHC reports that cigarettes cause 438,000 deaths each year .
I can find no credible source reporting any marijuana - related deaths .
This clearly does not mean marijuana is not directly or indirectly responsible for some deaths , but clearly whatever that number is , it pales in comparison to the deaths caused by cigarettes and alcohol .
Furthermore , according to the White House 's Office of National Drug Council and Policy , nearly 40 % of Americans have tried or will try marijuana during their lifetimes .
Are these people all criminals ?
The same office reports that " 12.7 % of state prisoners and 12.4 % of Federal prisoners were serving time for marijuana - related offenses . "
That 's over a hundred thousand people incarcerated for marijuana - related crimes .
My question is : does marijuana 's cost to our national health justify the cost to society of locking up over a hundred thousand people each year ?
The average cost of incarceration is , conservatively , $ 20,000 per inmate .
Is our marijuana policy saving us more than the two billion dollars a year it is costing just to keep people locked up ?
Not to mention the cost of police , lawyers , judges , etc ?
Marijuana , when used responsibly , is as safe or safer than cigarettes and alcohol .
I urge you to reconsider your position on HR 5843 .
Adults should have the right to make a personal choice regarding recreational marijuana use .
Thank you ,
Michael Black
Nowhere did I offer to make my newsletter available to him , the way he did me .
Perhaps I should have .
But , what if he accepted my offer ?
Then I 'd have to start publishing a newsletter .
Anyway , sorry this is n't funnier , but there was something very satisfying about writing to my congressman , and I thought I would share the experience with you .
God bless all of you , and God bless America .
Baby Bottle To Avoid
You 're learning to recycle plastics ( great ! ) , but now you have probably heard reports of nervous consumers cleaning out their cupboards and closets of containers that experts are warning may not be safe to use .
The good news is those recycling codes can help you protect your family , and The Daily Green will tell you how .
Though it 's true regulators and the plastics industry are pointing out that the science on the real - world harms is not yet proven , many are saying the stakes are too high , and the alternatives too easy , to ignore .
Read on to see which types of water and baby bottles you do n't want to give your kids .
Exclusive Google has murdered the AdSense account run by one of the web 's most influential anti-Scientology sites .
Yesterday , the search giant cut off all ads served to Enturbulation , a fledgling site dedicated to promoting activism against the Church of Scientology and all its related organizations .
This could have something do with the nature of the ads Google was serving .
Many of the Google - driven ads funding the anti-Scientology site were paid for by the Church of Scientology .
" While going through our records recently , we found that your AdSense account has posed a significant risk to our AdWords advertisers , " read Google 's letter to Enturbulation , a kind of home base for the now famous Anonymous movement .
" Since keeping your account in our publisher network may financially damage our advertisers in the future , we 've decided to disable your account . "
Of course , it 's not Enturbulation 's fault that Google was serving the site pro-Scientology ads .
AdSense automatically chooses ads based on a site 's content .
And like any AdSense advertiser , the Church of Scientology has the power to ban its ads from individual domains .
Google did not respond to our requests for comment .
But it should be noted that the company 's new AdSense policies say that partner sites may not include " advocacy against any individual , group , or organization . "
That said , Google 's terms and conditions also prohibit " any action or practice that reflects poorly on Google or otherwise disparages or devalues Google ’s reputation or goodwill . "
And this is n't always enforced .
The Register , for instance , is an AdSense user , and it does n't always champion Google 's every move .
It should also be noted that the Church of Scientology would n't actually pay for ads posted to Enturbulation unless someone clicked on them .
The question is whether the site 's users would be interested in doing so .
We leave that question to you .
Meanwhile , Enturbulation may lose between $ 400 and $ 500 a month in ad revenue .
Google 's crackdown on Enturbulation 's AdSense account follows similar actions by its YouTube subsidiary .
Last month , the world 's most popular video site vaporized an account run by Mark Bunker , a well - known TV journalist / anti-Scientology activist .
YouTube said it destroyed Bunker 's video channel because he 'd already had an account suspended for violations of site policy .
But it seems this rule does not apply to the Church of Scientology . ®

I 'm a senior principal researcher ( and one of three founding members ) at Microsoft Research New England in Cambridge , Massachusetts and an adjunct professor in the MIT Department of Mathematics .
Previously I was head of the cryptography group at Microsoft Research Redmond , and before that , I was in the theory group .
If you 're interested in the future of mathematical publishing , you should read the article that Douglas Arnold and I wrote about the Elsevier boycott for the Notices of the American Mathematical Society .
Research
My principal research projects are currently on sphere packing , energy minimization , and fast matrix multiplication .
More broadly , my mathematical interests include discrete geometry , coding theory , cryptography , combinatorics , computational number theory , and theoretical computer science .
One conceptual issue that fascinates me is the role of symmetry in mathematics and physics , particularly for exceptional structures such as E 8 ( or more familiar but still remarkable relatives , such as the regular icosahedron ) .
Why do the same beautiful structures occur in so many different contexts ?
There is clearly far more going on here than we currently understand .
I 've always been interested in understanding simple physical systems , ranging from the dimer model to hard spheres and soft - matter systems .
Many of the deepest issues deal with order vs. disorder , for example in phase transitions or the study of defects in ground states .
Which conditions lead to order and symmetry ?
My preference is for a mixture of concrete and abstract mathematics .
I love concrete problems , especially those arising in science and technology , and I 'm particularly happy when abstract mathematics turns out to be useful .
For example , I am interested in the use of harmonic analysis in sphere packing or representation theory in computational algebra .

A Clackamas County Sheriff 's
Office major crimes detective will be allowed to keep his weapons despite being accused today of fourth - degree assault domestic violence in an incident involving his wife , with whom he has a five - month - old baby .
Steven P. Hyson , 41 , appeared in Clark County District Court moments after Judge Vernon Schreiber issued a warrant for his arrest .
Hyson arrived about 1:42 p.m. , 15 minutes after the judge had noted Hyson had signed paperwork saying he would appear at 1 p.m .
When Hyson appeared accompanied by Vancouver attorney Thomas C. Phelan , Schreiber quashed the warrant and one that would have held Hyson without bail .
Hyson , a Vancouver resident , was arrested early Sunday but was later released on bail .
According to reports from Clark County sheriff 's deputies who went to the couple 's east Vancouver home , Hyson 's 36 - year - old wife said they had been arguing about his time spent at work while she is home with the baby and a 7 - year - old .
She told Hyson late Saturday that she wanted to go dancing with her sister but would be home at 1:30 a.m. so he could get to work by 2 a.m.
Sunday , the reports said .
She told deputies that Hyson called her cell phone at 1:45 a.m. , but she told him she wanted to stay out , the reports said .
Hyson called his office , saying he was unable to come in to work .
When his wife got home about 2 a.m. , the two argued .
Hyson said she began slapping and punching him while he was holding the baby , spilling a cup of coffee and striking him in the face with an apple .
She told deputies that he punched her in the left eye with an orange from the fruit bowl , and a deputy noticed a slight redness under her eye , the reports said .
She admitted verbally abusing him and slapping him once .
She went outside and called her sister , telling her she would not call 9 - 1 - 1 because of Hyson 's job , the reports said .
Police indicated she thought her sister might have called 9 - 1 - 1 .
Hyson told deputies that in the past , his wife had threatened to call police and claim he assaulted her and that he would lose his job and go to jail , the reports showed .
He said he has a tape of such a threat , the reports said .
Tests showed Hyson 's blood alcohol level at zero ; his wife 's was 0.121 .
In court today , Phelan , the attorney , asked that in contrast to usual procedure , Hyson be allowed to retain his weapon because of his job and for his personal protection , and the judge agreed .
He owns a 9 - mm , semi-automatic Glock pistol and a 12 - gauge Remington shotgun , police reports showed .
Schreiber set arraignment for March 5 .
If convicted , Hyson faces a maximum penalty of a year in jail , $ 5,000 fine and the loss of his right to possess a firearm .
He was ordered not to contact his wife of six months , but the two can communicate through a third party about their child , property and any potential divorce , the judge said .
Hyson has been placed on paid administrative leave from the sheriff 's office , where he has worked since August 1996 .
He has a " commendable work ethic and record , " Detective Jim Strovink said in a prepared statement .
After a short stint with the Portland Police Bureau , Hyson joined the Clackamas County Sheriff 's Office in August 1996 and was promoted to detective in 2001 .
He was demoted during a 2002 budget crunch but quickly reinstated .
He is the president of the Clackamas County Peace Officers ' Association , a non-profit labor organization representing the workers of the Clackamas County Sheriff 's Office and several other agencies .
His term runs through 2010 .
In 2002 , Hyson solved the " Sunnyside Rapist " case on his own time on his last day as a detective .
He also was assigned to the Ward Weaver case involving two murdered Oregon City girls .

California ’s once - ambitious , always - controversial plan to require automakers to sell electric cars faces a vote this week that , advocates say , would effectively gut the program .
Thursday , the state Air Resources Board meets in Sacramento to consider a plan to cut the number of pure electric vehicles that carmakers would be required to sell over the next few years from 25,000 to 2,500 .
When the state enacted this zero-emission vehicle mandate in 1990 , it called for 10 percent of new - vehicle sales from big automakers to be all - electric by 2003 , or about 100,000 cars or more a year .
That requirement was eventually delayed by several years and reduced to the current level .
At the board ’s request , the ARB staff revisited the mandate and produced a 52 - page proposal that concluded battery - electric and hydrogen fuel - cell vehicles remain too costly and still face too many hurdles for mass sales in the state .
Instead , requiring automakers to sell a mix of cleaner - burning gasoline cars , hybrids and plug - in hybrids would be more realistic .
The changes “ keep our commitment to zero emissions alive while appropriately reflecting the pace of the technology , ” said Analisa Bevins , chief of the air board ’s sustainable transportation technology branch .
But advocates are n’t so sure .
“ The low numbers do turn the clock back on progress and certainly send the wrong signals to the public and the technology producers , ” said Bonnie Holmes - Gen , policy director for the American Lung Association of California .
If the board approves the changes , said Ze ’ev Drori – chief executive of Tesla Motors , the San Carlos company that put its $ 100,000 electric roadster into production this month – it would “ make a mockery of CARB itself . ”
Even Mary Nichols , chair of the 11 - member board , is n’t sure .
“ We ’re all looking for ways that we can strengthen the staff report to make it a little bit more aggressive in terms of numbers of vehicles , ” she said .
Asked directly if she would vote to approve the amendments , she said , “ I ’m going to be supporting some changes . ”
The original mandates were written when there was much less awareness of greenhouse - gas emissions and California had n’t enacted its groundbreaking global - warming legislation , AB 32 , which requires dramatic cuts in the state ’s total production of greenhouse gases .
Nichols wants a “ rethinking of the whole ZEV mandate program in light of our AB 32 needs . ”
That echoed a comment by Holmes - Gen , whose group funded a study that suggested that weakening the ZEV mandate would be bad for the health of Californians .
“ It ’s disappointing that the proposal is not linked to the aggressive statewide targets for greenhouse gas reduction by 2050 , ” she said .
Tesla ’s Drori said the changes to the ZEV mandates would “ needlessly weaken ” the program .
He takes particular umbrage at the fact that reducing the number of required electric cars would cut the number of credits his company could earn – and sell – for making them .
Those funds would help defray Tesla ’s development costs , he said .
California once seemed poised to change what people drive when the Air Resources Board issued the ZEV mandates in 1990 .
But automakers launched a legal battle against them , delaying their implementation .
Ultimately , a few thousand electric vehicles from General Motors , Honda , Toyota and others were sold or leased in the state .
And , as the ’90s ended , first Honda , then Toyota , and later other automakers introduced hybrids , higher - mileage cars carrying both gasoline engines and electric motors .
In 2003 , ARB shifted direction , saying the electric - car technology was n’t progressing and instead agreeing to let automakers make cleaner gasoline cars and hybrids while they worked toward pure electrics .
That decision , along with GM ’s move to stop leasing its EV1 and to crush many of the vehicles that it took back , led to “ Who Killed the Electric Car ? , ” a documentary by Chris Paine .
One star of that movie , Chelsea Sexton , is now executive director of Plug - In America , which advocates for production of plug - in hybrid and electric vehicles .
The air board staff listens too much to automakers , she said , who tell it that batteries are and will remain too expensive .
“ Certainly there ’s a history here of automakers low - balling CARB .
No industry wants to be regulated , so they want to make this look as difficult as possible , ” Sexton said .
If the changes are approved , Sexton said , CARB will render itself irrelevant in future discussions about alternate - fuel technologies .
“ This is a fairly toothless piece of policy , ” she said .

Pregnant 16 - year - old Juno MacGuff is about to enter an abortion clinic when she meets a protester waving a banner declaring , ungramatically : No Babies Like Murdering .
" Your baby probably has a beating heart , " says the demonstrator .
" It can feel pain .
And it has fingernails . "
When Juno later decides to keep her baby and flees the clinic , the protester shouts : " God appreciates your miracle . "
And so does Hollywood , which last month embraced the film Juno as a surprise Oscar contender .
Scroll down for more ...
With its smart script , the bittersweet comedy , which follows a teenager 's decision to go through with an unplanned pregnancy , has already made a star of its leading actress , newcomer Ellen Page , who has picked up one of the film 's four Academy Award nominations .
Hailed by critics as this year 's Little Miss Sunshine , another successful , low - budget , independent film with no A - list Hollywood names , Juno will be released in Britain on Friday .
Yet the film has also united America 's Left and Right in condemnation of its writer , a 29 - year - old from Illinois called Diablo Cody .
Her script 's insouciant endorsement of teenage pregnancy , with no repercussions , shame or consequences , has angered pro-choice activists who claim it sends out a message that is naive , unrealistic and irresponsible .
Meanwhile , feminists and the religious Right have formed an unlikely alliance to condemn
Cody not only for her past as a stripper and phone - sex operator , but for glorifying her role in the sex industry in an autobiographical book .
The issue of abortion is regularly the subject of controversy in America .

But teen pregnancy is a hot topic following the publication of figures showing that the birth rate among teenage mothers , after falling for 14 years , has now risen by three per cent .
Public opinion has also been divided over Britney Spears ' 16 - year - old sister Jamie Lynn , who recently stunned fans of her show on Disney TV by revealing she was pregnant and keeping her baby because she wanted to " do what 's right " .
The film Juno does nothing to contradict this sentiment .
Having had unprotected sex with her boyfriend , Juno ignores the advice of her parents and friends and decides to give up the baby for adoption to a yuppie couple .
Yet her studies are unaffected , her parents accept her choice and she remains as cute as ever .
" A teenager who saw this movie would feel like a moral failure for choosing abortion , " says feminist commentator Katha Pollitt .
" The mother in me winced at Juno , that wisp of a child - woman , going through pregnancy and childbirth . "
It 's a view shared by other campaigners .
" Single motherhood , for the average teenage girl , is just about the least glamorous thing you can possibly imagine , " says Joyce Arthur of the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada .
" Juno tells young women the best option is to have the baby , and it glorifies that choice . "
Nor does middle - class Juno reflect the majority of teenage mothers , who come from poor families .
" Some have the babies as part of their path to what they see as adulthood , but they often put their education on hold , and it makes life a lot tougher , " says Demie Kurz , sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania .
" Do we want to put burdens on these teenage girls by encouraging them to think having a baby is cool ? "
Unsurprisingly , those on the religious
Right were quick to praise Juno 's implicit pro-life sensibility - until they discovered how far Diablo Cody 's life has strayed from the teachings of the Church .
A former prom queen Catholic schoolgirl who had supportive , middle - class parents , Cody , whose real name is Brook Busey , turned herself into a tattooed Goth with a wilful disregard for authority .
In 2003 , while working by day at an advertising agency in Minneapolis , Minnesota , she was a stripper by night , experiences she chronicles in
Candy Girl : A Year In The Life Of An Unlikely Stripper , a book published last year .
In a recent TV interview she said she began stripping so she would have something to say on her internet blog .
" I stripped for one night , and it was supposed to be a fun thing to do .
But I wrote about it , and people responded right away .
" I was the world 's worst stripper , but I danced for two hours that night , and came home with 100 bucks .
" I thought , ' This is awesome .
I could do this and buy a car . ' "
In Candy Girl , Cody describes offering " bed dances " for £ 30 , how she then became a " sex worker " and how she finally passed herself off as under - age girls on a phone - sex line .
" If you are hoping to find some sort of redemption in this sprawling epic , " she writes , " I 'm afraid you wo n't find any here . "
Her unashamed , recalcitrant stance has not won her many fans .
" Most women become sex workers through making poor choices , being pregnant teenagers or being abused , " says Lalla Shackelford of New Friends , New Life , a group that helps rehabilitate prostitutes .
" They get into it for glamour or money but quickly realise it 's degrading and turn to substance abuse to keep going . "
Perhaps it is not surprising that there is one more skeleton in Cody 's cupboard - the accusation that she stole another woman 's husband .
The victim was 31 - yearold Renatta Hunt , a teacher from Minneapolis .
She was married to Jonny Hunt , a graphic artist who had an affair with Cody when she was known as Brook .
" Jonny and I were married in 1998 and our daughter Nadija was born the next year , " said Renatta .
" He met Brook on the internet .
He lied and told her we were just two parents sharing a house , but without romance .
Then he went to Los Angeles to meet her on Mother 's Day . "
Cody moved from Chicago to Minneapolis to be with Jonny , who left Renatta in 2002 .
Soon after , Cody began stripping - something Jonny considered " cool " - and the couple seemed happy to discuss it with four - year - old Nadija .
Renatta said : " One day Nadija and I were out and she pointed to a sex club and said , ' That 's where Brook works . '
I could n't believe it . "
Cody and Jonny got married on the Star Trek ship at the Las Vegas Hilton in 2004 , surrounded by aliens .
According to Renatta , Cody also borrowed elements of their lives for her Oscar - nominated script .
" Jonny was adopted , " said Renatta .
" I wanted him to meet his birth mother , and he resisted .
After meeting Brook , he finally contacted his birth mother .
I 'm full of life , a lot like Vanessa , the woman adopting Juno 's baby .
And Vanessa 's husband , Mark , is supposed to be Jonny - he dreams of being a rock star and is kept on a tight leash by his wife .
In the film , Juno gives birth on May 4 , Nadija 's birthday . "
However , Renatta said Cody and Jonny are no longer together .
" The week before Juno had its premiere , Jonny called me to say they 'd split up , " Renatta said .
" I wish Brook well , but she 's shattered my life . "
Since Juno , Cody has sold three more screenplays and was recently chosen by Steven Spielberg to write and produce his TV series The United States Of Tara , about a housewife with multiple personalities .
As for the inspiration behind her hit film , Cody says she based Vanessa and Mark on her own parents and Juno 's boyfriend on her best friend at school .
And Cody adds that she found it easy to write about 16 - yearold Juno .
" I never got past being a teenager , and never had to assume responsibility , " she says .
" And I still have n't . "
While she says she supports a woman 's right to have an abortion , she admits Juno reflects her own antipathy towards it .
" I would have freaked out if I was about to have an abortion , " she says .
" So she bolts out of fear .
It 's a personal choice not moral .
At the end , everything turns out all right . "
This encapsulates Cody 's personal philosophy - though Oscars voters may think otherwise .
The Department for Children , Schools and Families said boys aged between three and five had fallen behind their female classmates partly because nursery staff tried to curb their desire for boisterous play involving weapons .
Boys were more likely to become interested in education and would perform better if encouraged to pursue their chosen play .
The advice has proved controversial with teachers ' unions , which said that toy guns " symbolise aggression " and teachers were right to stop them being used .
They also criticised the government for stereotyping boys .
The guidance , Confident , Capable and Creative : Supporting Boys ' Achievements , said national data for 2004 - 06 showed that in nursery education , boys performed worse than girls across all areas of learning .
It is a pattern which the government says continues up until GCSE stage .
Better results can be achieved if nursery staff curb their " instincts " to stop boys from playing with toy guns and instead make better use of their interests .
" Sometimes practitioners find the chosen play of boys more difficult to understand and value than that of girls , " the guidance states .
" They may choose activities in which adults involve themselves least , or play that involves more action and a greater use of the available space , especially outdoors .
Images and ideas gleaned from the media are common starting points in boys ' play and may involve characters with special powers or weapons .
Adults can find this type of play particularly challenging and have a natural instinct to stop it . "
It said this was unnecessary as long as staff helped boys understand and respect the rights of other children .
" Creating situations so that boys ' interests in these forms of play can be fostered through healthy and safe risk - taking will enhance every aspect of their learning , " it said .
Beverley Hughes , the children 's minister , said the guidance took " a common - sense approach to the fact that many children , and perhaps particularly many boys , like boisterous , physical activity " .
But Chris Keates , general secretary of the NASUWT teachers ' union , warned that nurseries following the guidance risked incurring the anger of parents .
" I do not think schools should be encouraging boys to play with toy weapons , " he said .
" Many parents take the decision that their children wo n't have toy weapons .
In addition to that , I think this is a clear example of gender stereotyping . "
Steve Sinnott , NUT general secretary , said : " The real problem with weapons is that they symbolise aggression .
We do need to ensure , whether the playing is rumbustious or not , that there is a respect for your peers , however young they are . "

At an ISSCC session this afternoon , Sun's Marc Tremblay took to the podium to describe a processor that 's as aggressive and musclebound as the pro wrestler who shares its name .
Rock , as Sun 's high - end SPARC processor project is called , sports 16 cores ( 32 threads ) and runs a 2.3GHz in a power envelope that hits 250W ( hence the " cookin ' " part of the title ) .
Sun took a lot of architectural risks with this chip , some of which are probably at fault for the part 's rumored delay , but to go into detail on everything that Tremblay packed into his short talk would expand this post unduly .
So I 'll just zero in on two aspects of Rock 's design : out - of - order retirement and chip - level layout .
These unique architectural and organizational features distinguish Rock from the rest of the high - end server fold , and make it one of the most theoretically interesting designs to come down the pike in a very long time .
Retirement , Rock - style
Probably the most interesting aspect of Rock , at least from a CPU geek 's perspective , is that the processor features out - of - order retirement .
You read that right : instead of reordering the instruction stream , executing it , and then putting it back in program order before retirement , Sun 's processor actually retires some instructions out of program order .
Sun 's rationale for rethinking the traditional out - of - order pipeline in such a radical manner is that the amount of logic required to track and retire instructions in order balloons to an untenable size if you 're trying to use OOO to hide ever increasing memory load latencies .
So instead of expanding the instruction window to mammoth proportions , Sun adopted a unique approach that involves forking the instruction stream and executing it twice .
Let me explain .
A Rock core 's pipeline .
Source : Sun
In Sun 's new model , instructions enter the front end of the machine , where they 're decoded before being dispatched and reordered like normal .
But if the instruction stream stalls for a long time while waiting on main memory to load data , Rock first saves the thread 's state in a " checkpoint " and then launches a " scout thread " that runs ahead of the ( now stalled and saved ) main thread .
This scout thread ( ST ) is a hardware entity that 's totally invisible to the operating system , hypervisor , or whatever else has control of the processor , and in the course of execution it predicts and resolves branches , prefetches code and data , and saves its speculative state in a shadow register file .
Most importantly , the scout thread can actually retire some of the instructions that it speculatively executes .
If an instruction has no dependencies and can be retired out - of - order without causing the program state to be incorrect , the scout thread will go ahead and retire it .
Instructions that can't be retired are pushed into a 128 - entry " deferred queue , " a low - power SRAM structure that saves execution and dependency information .
When the main thread finally gets the load data that it has been waiting on and becomes unstuck , it moves along behind the scout thread and executes the instructions that have been put in the deferred queue .
If the scout thread stalls due to a long load latency , then the main thread can actually catch up to it and pass it , at which point it becomes the " scout thread " and the former " scout thread " — now stalled and saved as a checkpoint — becomes the " main thread . "
The Rock can save up to eight checkpoints per thread , which means that the scout and main threads can fork , join , and leapfrog each other in this fashion up to eight times .
Remixing the execution units / storage / latency relationship
Tremblay claims that the advantage of this " main thread plus scout thread " approach is that it replaces the traditional instruction window with this much smaller deferred queue , a queue that 's implemented in a much more power - efficient SRAM structure .
Of course , what Tremblay did n't say is that the tradeoff for this is that you actually have to implement a shadow register file for each speculative thread that the processor is capable of executing .
Because Rock can save eight checkpoints worth of state per thread , that 's at least eight copies of the integer register file per thread ( it 's not clear to me if Rock does this for floating - point instructions or not , but probably not ) for a total of 32 threads x 8 files = 256 copies of the integer register file per chip .
Ultimately , that 's a whole lot of register file space required to make this work , and what it means is that Sun has taken a novel approach to reimagining the relationship between execution units , on - chip storage , and memory latency that may or may not pay off .
What I mean by that statement is this : instead of just loading up on simple cache space ( e.g. , Intel 's Tukwilla ) , they 've moved more storage out into the chip in the form of these register file copies , and they 're using that storage to hide memory latency with these prefetching and speculative execution tricks .
( As an aside , it 's worth noting that this degree of dynamic , run -time speculation , and the amount of overhead that it entails , is the exact philosophical opposite of Intel 's VLIW approach with Itanium .
Itanium relies for its performance on static , compile - time reordering of the instruction stream in combination with loads of cache and execution hardware . )
Rock 's layout
The micrograph below shows
Rock 's overall layout : the 16 cores are grouped in four clusters of four cores each , where the clusters are connected by a central crossbar switch .
Die micrograph of Rock .
Source : Sun .
The 65nm Rock has an overall die size of 396 mm2 , and it dissipates 250W of power at 2.3 GHz .
The individual , four - issue cores are only 14mm2 and dissipate 10W each .
All four cores in a cluster share among them a number of components that are typically the domain of one core only .
Specifically , all four cores in a cluster share a single I - cache , two FPUs , and two data caches .
A Rock core cluster .
Source : Sun .
Tremblay claims that the FPU sharing alone saves about 8 percent on die area and about 30 W of power .
In the end , I can't say that I 'm really sold on Sun 's very aggressive use of speculative execution , but I will say that Rock is one of the most interesting and novel processors that I 've seen in 10 years of covering this space .
In its own way , it 's every bit as exotic as IBM's Cell processor , but because all of that exoticism is hidden from the programmer it wo n't be nearly as difficult for developers to deal with .
Sun 's official line is that Rock will be out later this year , but rumored delays put the chip out sometime in 2009 .
Gulak put off college for a year ( now 19 , he enrolls at MIT this fall ) and began building the Uno at a motorcycle shop outside Toronto .
He modified the frame from a Yamaha R1 , which is wider than most motorcycles , so it can house the side - by - side wheels .
But he quickly realized that he was out of his depth in the electronics department :
He would ride the Uno for a few seconds , and the circuitry would catch fire .
So he contacted Trevor Blackwell , a robotics engineer who specializes in self - balancing software .
With Blackwell 's help , Gulak equipped the Uno with a gyroscope and a control system that both keeps the rider balanced over the tires and manages the suspension .

The cartograms below show the world through the eyes of editors - in - chief , in 2007 .
Countries swell as they receive more media attention ; others shrink as we forget them .
( We also have a nice , embeddable Flash version with hi-res maps )
These maps allow you to grasp several media trends at a glance .
First , traditional newspapers are highly selective in their coverage of world news .
Looking at the three British dailies , editors favour countries that are bigger and more populous , but also closer to home and better developed .
They also give more room to the countries of origin of British immigrants , especially if they are white ( look at the size of Australia and New - Zealand ) .
Hardly surprising , but still disheartening , especially when you consider that the only brand that does not advocate objectivity , The Economist , covers the world more equally .
Second , we see that web - only outlets do not offer such a different view of the world .
That makes sense , considering the narrowing of the news agenda on the web that was described in the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s latest report .
Their lack of resources forces them to contract their scope .
Smaller issues are better covered by the blogosphere , which seems unbeatable at providing niche news .
The world according to newspapers is a project that came up while writing a dissertation for school .
I first published some maps on L’Observatoire des Médias , a French blog .
Seeing the response , Gilles Bruno and I decided to go further and keep track of newspaper coverage .
We want the maps above to be updated daily ( or weekly ) in order to pressure editors into covering more diverse issues .
We will build a scraper that will automatically retrieve the data for the 164 countries on several newspapers and a Java or Flash interface that will morph the maps .
If you have any skill in cartograms , or data scraping , or if you have funds to buy these skills , you are more than welcome in the team !
Colors indicate the same thing .
However , a country can appear in red if it ’s in the top 10 % but still shrink , as the top 3 countries concentrate most of all media attention .
This article was written by Nicolas Kayser - Bril , one of the Online Journalism Blog ’s Virtual Interns .
FBI director Robert Mueller 's testimony to the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives on Wednesday gave a tiny glimpse of the future of law enforcement online , and it raised some tough questions about the evolving line between public and private in a networked world .
In a blog post on the hearing , CNet 's Declan McCullagh reproduced the most relevant portion of the testimony — an exchange between Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) and Director Mueller on the subject of the FBI 's role in detecting and stopping illegal activity on the Internet .
Issa began the discussion with the analogy of an FBI raid on a bookie , where the Bureau obtains a warrant to get proof of illegal activity .
He then moved to the subject of online crimes and the ongoing barrage of cyberattacks on civilian , government , and military targets , asking Mueller what types of legal powers he would need to be able to obtain proof of those attacks in order to bring a prosecution .
Mueller responded with the follow revealing nugget .
I think legislation has to be developed that balances on one hand , the privacy rights of the individual who are receiving the information , but on the other hand , given the technology , the necessity of having some omnibus search capability utilizing filters that would identify the illegal activity as it comes through and give us the ability to preempt that illegal activity where it comes through a choke point as opposed to the point where it is diffuse on the Internet [ ed .
— emphasis added ] .
FBI Director Robert Mueller
Let me focus in on the boldfaced comment above and unpack it a bit , in order to expand on the point that I think Mueller is trying to make .
If you read my recent article on US law enforcement 's next - generation system for scouring the Internet for child porn , then you know how state and federal officials carry out the detection and evidence - gathering phases of criminal prosecution online .
Right now , the different state and federal entities in different locations use different systems to monitor chat rooms , Web sites , P2P networks , and other parts of the Internet for illegal activity .
In other words , law enforcement on the Internet is still " local " — not geographically local , but local to a particular type of crime or criminal community .
The spread - out , localized nature of law enforcement efforts is what Mueller most likely has in mind when he refers to illegal activity being " diffuse on the Internet . "
In different corners of the ' net using different protocols and media , people are committing crimes .
Do n't just centralize enforcement ; centralize the crimes
One of the FBI 's more recent efforts at centrally coordinating the fight against these " diffuse " activities is the Fusion Center , which I described in a recent article as " low - profile , highly secure sites where federal and state officials with top - secret clearance meet in order to collect , analyze , and redistribute information on ' all hazards , all threats . ' "
But while Fusion Centers centralize law enforcement efforts , they do not centralize the criminal activity .
There are places , however , where such activity is centralized : the backbone hubs located in hosting facilities across the country .
All of the Internet 's activity , legal and illegal , flows through these " choke points , " and the feds , of course , are already tapping those points and siphoning off data .
What Mueller wants is the legal authority to comb through the backbone data that is already being siphoned off by the NSA in order to look for illegal activity .
I 'll refrain from opining on the desirability or constitutionality of what Mueller wants to do , because regular
Ars readers who follow our national security reporting know our take on this stuff well enough anyway .
Instead , I want to point out that this centralization of legal and illegal activity at network hubs will be a persistent part of all of our lives as we live more and more of them online .
Thus the government 's desire to tap those hubs and filter them for criminal and hostile activity will never go away .
The current debate over who gets to do what and how with network hubs is akin to the foundational debates over property and taxes with which we started America , so it 's important that we have it in the light of day and that we all participate .

BLINDNESS -WHAT IT MEANS IN THE MIND OF A BLIND CHILD
by Ramona Walhof
Editor 's Note :
The following article is an edited and expanded version of a speech given at the Parents Seminar at the 1995 NFB convention .
Perhaps you have heard the story about Johnny , who came running in from play to ask , " Mommy , Mommy , where did I come from ? "
Mommy thought four years old was a little young to be asking about the birds and the bees , but she supposed she was up to it .
She explained about growing for nine months in the uterus inside her tummy and then being born .
Johnny was impatient to go back outside , but on the way he called over his shoulder , " I came from a uterus , but Michael came from California . "
We cannot read our children 's minds .
If we could , there would be many surprises .
This is true of blindness , just as it is regarding other things .
But there are some general things we do know .
A child who is born blind does not know what it is like to see .
Until he or she is old enough to begin to understand how other people do things , blindness seems normal .
Therefore , a small child will not feel bad about blindness until someone teaches him or her ( directly or indirectly ) to feel bad .
When my sighted children were little , they treated me in some ways that were different .
If they showed me something , they put my hand on it .
I did not teach them to do this ; it was obvious .
They knew what worked , but that did n't mean they understood blindness - they did n't , not at that age , anyway .
A blind child is the same .
They learn what works , and they do it .
But that does n't mean they understand what blindness is and is n't .
Blindness is something we explain little by little as a child progresses toward school .
Because nobody knows when a blind child really understands what blindness is , it should be discussed in a positive manner .
Anything associated with blindness should also be approached positively .
Learning to use a white cane or being able to read Braille can be an opportunity and a privilege , not a last resort .
Braille is a special way to read with your fingers .
These positive approaches convey the attitude , " It 's okay to be blind . "
We must not lament the fact that a child cannot see .
It is n't helpful to make comments such as : " I wish you could see the birds out the window , " Or " I wish you could see the pictures in this book . "
But we can say , " Do you hear the birds singing ?
They sound nice .
They have pretty colored feathers which look nice , too . " or " This is a funny picture .
It shows an elephant in a dress !
Is n't that silly ?
Do you remember the elephant you rode on at the zoo ?
Can you imagine it in a dress ! "
In other words we must share what we see with a blind child as a pleasant and normal part of communicating , not as a constant sad reminder of something a child is lacking .
It is impossible to guard blind children from all excessive admiring , crying , and gushing about blindness , but parents can begin by setting an example .
This means getting your own grief and frustration about blindness out of your system as early as possible .
You have a good peer support group right here to help you through that .
I recommend you do n't spend a lot of time talking about how much your child can see .
Neighbors , other family members , friends , and even strangers will want to do that .
They are curious and being friendly when they say to your child :
How much can you see ?
Can you count my fingers ?
Can you see that color ?
Can you see across the street ?
Sometimes the child tries to cooperate , and sometimes he does n't .
Either way too much talk about what he can see will be boring and confusing to him .
Why does it matter so much ?
Is the amount a child can see really the most interesting and important part of him ?
Of course the doctor must do eye tests , and as a parent you want to have some idea of what your child can use vision to do , but this is enough .
Blind people can tell you about the different reactions they had as children to all this discussion about seeing .
I learned to lie about it .
I tried to make people happy so they would leave me alone and I could go on to other things .
Pretending sometimes got me special privileges and prestige at the school for the blind ; and I knew I made my family members happy if I said I could see things .
Nobody meant to teach me to lie , but they did .
And what about using the word , " blind ? "
Does it make you uncomfortable ?
It might be hard for you , but it could be a relief for your child to be able to name the difference he senses , but no one will talk about .
I can remember feeling that something was wrong with me before anyone used the word blind .
When I was in kindergarten in public school , the teacher guided my hand to teach me to print .
I could n't see the large letters she put on the paper .
I learned to print , but the whole thing was embarrassing and confusing to me .
Some explanation about what was happening might have been helpful , although I know that the adults involved were as unsure about what to do as I was .
An even bigger concern for me in kindergarten , though , was the bathroom .
From the kindergarten room you had to go across a big hallway , down a flight of stairs , around a few corners , and there was the bathroom right next to the door that led to the playground .
My class always went to the bathroom just before recess , and I found it very hard to wait .
It was all right to go earlier , and I know that other children did , but I was sure I could not see well enough to find my way .
I did not dare admit this to anyone .
One day when the teacher asked me why my dress was wet , I told her I did n't know .
I did not associate this problem with blindness , but I now do .
I am not aware that the teacher or my mother ever figured it out .
Your child needs reassurance that blindness is okay even before he or she really understands what blindness is .
This is true because of what others say about it , and because a blind youngster may have fears ( as I did ) that are associated with their lack of vision .
If you have created an atmosphere where it 's okay to talk about blindness , your child will have the language , and the " permission " he needs to express some of the things he or she is thinking or experiencing about it .
When a blind child is little he or she may not have much interest in what you see .
You may drive along the road and describe beautiful scenery , and your child may totally ignore you .
Because children express no interest , that does n't mean you should quit talking about what you see .
But do it in small doses .
You know that you get information from all directions through your eyes , both close up and far away .
Your child does n't know what you see .
Gradually , he or she will learn - if you keep talking .
It is important that a blind child learn how to interact with people who are getting information visually .
In one sense your child may borrow your eyes to read a story , learn about colors , identify a noise , and so forth .
Sight is convenient and blind people rely on sighted people for certain things .
This is not bad , but good and proper .
Blind children need to learn how eyesight works and how to interact with sighted people .
It 's a part of learning about blindness .
But , too much reliance upon someone else 's sight deprives the child of skill and confidence .
Thus , a blind child must learn how to balance trusting their blind techniques and understanding the uses of vision .
It is part of growing up for a blind child .
It is not a disaster if we do n't understand it all immediately .
Several parents have mentioned to me lately that their blind children seem to have trouble understanding humor .
I would not hesitate to describe some humor to your children , but I would n't worry if they miss some jokes .
It 's good to describe some cartoons so that your child comes to understand that humor is often based on weird impressions shown in pictures .
My mother used to read the comic papers to me , and I am sure this was helpful , but I was often slow to understand jokes .
Blind children must learn to get information from sighted people for many different purposes .
This is part of a life - long process .
We keep learning about eyesight , just as we keep learning about many things .
When I was 40 or so I was driving down the street with my two sighted teen - agers , and I wanted to get some information about street signs .
I said , " I want you to read to me every sign you see . "
That was a mistake .
They thought this was a wonderful opportunity .
They could n't talk fast enough to read all the signs out loud .
They were deliberately taking advantage of the situation to read things they knew I did n't want to know ( not an unusual attitude for a teen - ager ) , but I learned something new from this experience .
I knew that in a business district there are signs on practically every building , but I really had no concept of how many signs you could read while driving down one street .
I tell you this just to show how a blind person continues to learn about seeing .
The process needs to start young .
Your awareness of this process will help you help your child build a better grasp of how vision is used .
When my son was three years old he taught me something I found instructive .
He was a sighted child .
I already knew how blind children learn about color for I was a blind child and grew up with other blind children .
We learned by listening to what people said about color .
As we grew older , we learned to do things with color based on what others were doing and saying .
What I did n't know is that this is the very same way sighted children learn about color , too .
My son had a pair of comfortable , striped , knit pants , and he had a nice comfortable T - shirt that was absolutely the wrong color to wear with those pants !
In typical three - year - old style , he wanted to wear them together .
He liked them , so they must look good together .
I had to teach him that other people said they did n't look good together .
We had similar experiences when matching other things he liked , too .
This is the same lesson you teach a blind child .
A sighted child sees the colors and a blind child does n't .
But both must learn what the culture agrees is okay in using colors .
Think about it .
You have heard statistics about how much learning is visual .
These are often used to indicate that blind children do n't learn as much or as fast as other children .
This is not necessarily so , unless we do n't use the alternative techniques that are available to the blind .
If a blind infant drops a set of keys on the floor , and you lean down to pick them up , that can be a fun game .
If you lower the baby down and put his or her hand on the keys , it might be even more fun .
If you encourage the little one to move his hand back and forth on the floor to find the keys , that 's another kind of game , and that 's learning .
As the baby becomes a toddler , a little talk about where things go when they get thrown and dropped increases learning gradually .
Sometimes the child will cooperate and enjoy the games , and sometimes not .
But you keep playing them and making them more challenging and complex as he learns .
My friend , Ali was three years old when she first came to my house .
She is blind and has mild cerebral palsy , so is slow to walk .
However , she covers a lot of ground in her crawling .
Within minutes after arriving at my house Ali was sitting in front of the refrigerator in the middle of a crowd of people in the kitchen and was in danger of being stepped on .
Her father rescued her and explained that Ali often heads for the fridge in new houses .
She must find that big metal box with a motor humming and air blowing out very interesting .
Later I learned from Ali's mother that she also likes to get things out of the fridge ( if she can reach them ) when the door is open .
I have no idea when Ali made the connection between the fan in the fridge and the food , but I know she did , and that 's learning .
It may not be exactly the same pattern that another child would follow , but that does n't matter .
Ali learned about the fridge , and that 's what is important .
We reduce blindness to the level of a nuisance by using our own imaginations to figure out what techniques are best suited to specific experiences .
Just because you never saw someone who is blind doing a thing does n't mean it can't be done .
It can be helpful , as you raise a blind child , to observe how sighted children learn .
Here is an example .
When I was visiting my daughter 's Sunday school class of three - year - olds , one little boy , Thomas , arrived early .
My daughter gave him colors to keep him busy until she and the other children were ready for class .
After coloring for a while , Thomas reached for the scotch tape which was nearby .
It was clear to me that he did not know how to get the end loose from the dispenser , so I showed him how to do it .
If Thomas had been blind , he might not have noticed the tape an arm 's reach away - I would have had to tell him it was there , or prompt him to explore until he found it .
Also , I would have used different techniques to show him what to do with it .
But using tape should be as normal and typical for the blind three - year - old as it is for the sighted three - year - old .
If we watch a sighted child doing something like this , it prods us to offer the same opportunity to our blind child .
It is a simple matter to say , " Oh , look at this .
What do you suppose we can do with it ?
Here , let me show you . "
So what if the child makes a big mess with the tape ?
That 's the way kids learn .
Paying attention to children in general can help us be on our toes in offering new learning experiences to blind children .
It is really just as simple as that - not anything to worry about , just a guide which can be useful .
Like other children , blind children need to learn about appropriate and inappropriate behavior .
This gets a little complicated sometimes because blind children should do some things differently .
For example , it is okay for a blind baby to feel your face , and they often do .
But this becomes socially unacceptable at a very young age .
Before school age a blind child needs to learn that it is not a good idea to put their hands all over other people .
It is better for a young boy to be slapped and learn a lesson about getting along with his peers than be branded " to be avoided " by his classmates .
Unfortunately , most young girls would not slap the " blind boy . "
This means parents have an extra responsibility in teaching social skills to their blind youngsters .
They need information even when they do n't ask for it and do n't take it .
We must keep reminding them when we see inappropriate behavior .
When my children were small , I grew very tired of having to fuss at them for doing the same thing over and over .
I tried to be creative in finding ways not to nag .
This spring my youngest graduated from college , a real milestone for both of us .
He is selling books this summer as he has done throughout college .
He said to me " Do n't let me stay with the company beyond the summer . "
Amazed , I asked what he wanted me to do about it if he did .
" Nag me " he answered .
I told him I did n't like to nag , and I thought he did n't like it either .
What do you suppose he said ?
" Sometimes it works . "
Well , I found that most interesting and pass it on for what it is worth .
Many blind children feel no need to hold their heads erect .
Not only does this look funny , it also causes underdevelopment of the muscles in the neck and back .
Constant reminders and creative motivators must be tried .
There is no simple solution , but it 's worth working on .
When they get to be 16 or 20 they will be very glad if they 've developed the practice of holding their heads up and looking at other people .
One evening I was talking with a blind eight - year - old who was jumping up and down and flopping his body around .
Thinking I could subtly change this behavior , I suggested we sit down .
We did and continued our conversation , and he continued to jump around .
By and by I mentioned that most eight - year - olds do n't jump around all the time .
" Oh , " he said , " I do that all the time . "
" Yes , " I said , " that 's why I brought it up .
It makes you look funny . "
I still did not get much response , but repetition of the same message in different ways will get through .
Sometimes we just have to figure out how to make the message matter , and there may be some value in using a blend of shock techniques and repetition .
It reminds me of a story I once heard about an old man named Pat .
The priest wanted Pat to support the building of a new church , but Pat was resisting .
Pat said , " I give my dime every Sunday , and that 's all you 're going to get out of me . "
Just then a big piece of plaster fell and hit Pat on the head .
This changed his mind .
After Pat offered a large sum , Father said , " Pat , let us pray . "
They knelt in front of the altar , and Father prayed , " Heavenly Father , hit him again . "
I cannot provide a big piece of plaster when you need it , but there are times when you can be too gentle .
No technique is right for every situation , and frequently a change of emphasis from day - to - day is desirable .
Today most blind children have far less contact with one another than when most of us were young and went to schools for the blind or resource classrooms .
Being one blind person among hundreds of sighted children in public schools and in the neighborhood can be lonely .
There is a void in learning about blindness .
In fact children learn , to their detriment , to take advantage of other people 's attitudes about blindness .
Public attitudes about blindness may be the most difficult part of raising a blind child , both for you and your child .
Some of you may know better examples than I do , but let me share just one .
Nine - year - old Melissa lived in a house about 200 yards from the road where the school bus picked her up .
There was a dry creek bed with a bridge across it between her door and where she caught the school bus .
Melissa was still learning when to use her cane and when not to .
She resisted taking it when she should .
Her mother explained to her what could happen if she did n't use her cane , but Melissa continued to resist taking it when she should .
Sure enough , one morning Melissa went racing out the door to catch the bus - without her cane - and fell in the creek bed .
Melissa was not seriously hurt , but the neighbors were angry .
They felt mom should not let Melissa out of her sight .
They did n't think Melissa could be safe even with the cane .
Even though mom had the right attitude , it was difficult to stand her ground when all the neighbors were mad at her .
I reassured mom that she was right on target .
Sometimes it is hard not to fall into traps formed by public attitudes .
Without realizing what they are doing , blind children often learn to depend on sighted people more than they need to or should .
Elementary school is not too soon for a blind child to begin traveling independently , keeping track of print papers , looking for things that are lost or dropped , keeping track of clothes that match , etc .
As a child matures , he or she needs to develop more self - reliance in all these areas .
This spring Kathryn was a model in a fashion show .
She had less time than I wished to practice her route across the stage , down the steps , around a couple of corners , and down the aisle through the audience .
Still she did just fine and looked good .
As she came down the steps someone could not resist the need to tell her where she should go .
A lipreader at a nearby table reports that Kathryn said in a whisper without looking around , " I can do it myself . "
Kathryn handled the situation , but it must have been demoralizing and embarrassing .
Still , how many times in a day or a week do children like Kathryn have to face somebody who does not really believe in them ?
What does it do to their confidence ?
Their self - esteem ?
We cannot quickly change these attitudes but what we have to offer is valuable .
We can reassure blind children that somebody does understand .
We can offer the opportunity to talk about blindness and to learn the skills that help to reduce it to the level of a nuisance .
We can share with these children the successes , frustrations , grief , and excitement of growing up as a blind person .
Blindness is a characteristic these children do not share with most of their peers .
To talk about it when they can is important , and we must find a way to give them this opportunity .
A child needs to be encouraged to understand how he or she is affected by blindness .
I have been asked many questions by blind youngsters which demonstrate they want to talk about it .
They ask me :
When should I use my cane , and when should I walk with someone else ?
How do I decide when I really need Braille ?
If a lot of other people seem to know what is going on and I do n't , what can I do about it ?
In a group I do n't always like to ask for help or information , but if I am quiet , often I get left out or forgotten , and I do n't like that either .
I know I can be noticed by calling attention to blindness , but sometimes that is n't much fun .
What will my life be like when I grow up ?
All the adults I know can see .
How will I learn to put make - up on ?
What will happen if I do n't drive a car ?
Whether you hear these questions in so many words or not , you need to realize that blind children are thinking about these things .
Both you and your children need to talk about matters like these and work out answers .
One of the resources available to you through the National Federation of the Blind ( NFB ) comes in the form of people who have answers to these questions .
The other day I visited a one - week camp for blind children who attend public school in Idaho .
I was introduced to a group of about ten teen - agers .
Most had returned to the camp for at least the second year .
After telling them who I was , I asked why they liked the camp and came back .
No answers .
I told them I thought I knew .
It gives them an opportunity to share experiences with others who are blind .
Immediately , the room was abuzz with chatter and questions .
My few minutes grew into a whole class period .
These youngsters wanted to talk about jobs ; careers ; discrimination - what it is and what to do about it ; attitudes of parents , teachers , and peers about blindness ; and all the topics we have touched on this morning .
At that camp there were counselors who would discuss blindness in the evenings , but they were not themselves blind .
It seems to make a difference .
I do n't have all the answers to their questions , but that did not seem to matter .
They were eager to share with me and to have my thoughts to ponder .
The NFB Training Centers in Louisiana , Colorado , and Minnesota sponsor summer programs for blind children .
Their staff members - most of whom are blind like me - will tell you the same thing .
Children are eager to learn about blindness from those they know have had real experiences .
They are glad for the opportunity to experiment with the skills and attitudes about blindness that they are learning .
Kathryn is ten years old , and I have known her for five or six years .
When I see her , Kathryn always wants to take hold of my cane .
At first she wanted to talk about it and compare its size to her own .
Now she just wants to grasp it for a moment and go on with whatever she is doing and saying .
I think this is her way of saying , " I 'm glad you and I have canes in common . "
The National Federation of the Blind provides the rhythm and the melody for us all to march forward together to change public attitudes about blindness .
We have a young , energetic leader who depends on all of us to make the music and move ahead .
Our children are learning to play the instruments that broadcast our message to the world .
One or a few persons cannot make the band move forward or sound good .
The fullness of sound and the impressiveness of configurations on the field come from planning and rehearsals .
Each individual must play a part and coordinate with the others .
Because of our togetherness , we are all more successful than any could be alone .
We meet at this convention to renew our spirits and improve our skills and our understanding .
As adults , both blind and sighted , we need what we came here to partake of .
And we bring our children , for they need it , too .
They need what they will find this week , and they depend on us throughout the year to improve their skills and grow in their understanding .
When our children become the section leaders , one day our band will be welcomed by society as a leading part of the parade , not merely with sympathy because the blind are doing better than expected , but with honor because the high quality of our performance can no longer be denied .
This is what we hope and plan for our children , and this is what they dream .
We must do what we can to facilitate their dreams .
We are , and we will continue to do so .
This is our goal today for ourselves , and this is our pledge to the next generation !

You know , every time I see a pink ribbon campaign I get pissed off .
Oh sure , some would say ; “ if you knew someone that survived or even died from breast cancer , you ’d think differently . ”
Well , I have , I do , and I still feel the same thank you very much .
Recently , I was ‘ discussing ’ yet again , the disparity in research , care , and funding for men ’s health issues .
And of course , the subject of breast cancer being the # 2 killer of all female creatures on the planet , whereas # 1 being the patriarchy itself … Tired of the bullshit ‘ facts ’ thrown around , I decided to waste some of my time researching the actual FACTS from two major sources , that of the CDC ( Center for Disease Control ) and the NCI ( National Cancer Institute ) .
Oh sure , I already knew that there was a significant disparity , but I wanted ALL THE FACTS .
The how many ’s and how muches , so to speak .
As with any “ official statistical gathering ” , there is always missing years .
Why ?
I have n’t a clue .
We are in 2008 , yet there is very little concrete numbers more current than 2006 / 07 .
Anyhow , without further ado , here is what I have found .
By the way , I took the time to find this information , if you want to argue it , feel free , but look it up yourself .
I aint your research bitch .
ACTUAL AND REAL NUMBERS on the disparity in research , education and treatment of two prevalent gender specific cancers ; Prostate Cancer and ( Female ) Breast Cancer specifically .
Information from the 2006 NCI ( National Cancer Institute ) Fact Book : Male – 1.4 BillionFemale – 2.78 Billion - Almost twice the amount .
Male Prostate Cancer – 293.2 MillionFemale ( only ) Breast Cancer – 584.7 Million - Again , almost twice the amount .
Male – 766,860 Female – 678,060 - Over 100,000 more cases in males versus females estimatedFYI : that from 2000 to 2004 : Incident rate was 2.3M/1.7M
Male / female – a difference of 600 K more men .
Male – 289,550 Female – 270,100 - Over 10,000 more male deaths estimatedFYI : that from 2000 to 2004 : Mortality rate was 1.2M/807 K
Male / female – a difference of about 400 K more men .**
In most of their data sheets , 2006 was the latest numbers .
And for those that do not like to read , here is a cute little graph from the CDC showing the top 10 cancers - incident rate in 2004 for male / female ( all races ) :
And here is the top 10 cancer mortality rate in 2004 for male / female ( all races ) :
Please note the CDC ’s reason for 2004 being the latest information :
“ Previous versions of United States Cancer Statistics have been updated with 1999 – 2004 cancer cases as reported to CDC as of January 2007 , and as reported to NCI as of November 2006 , and made available through the SEER Program public use file . ”
Notice that although not the # 1 killer , prostate still KILLS MORE MEN OVER ALL RACES than breast cancer kills women ... yet where is the research ?
Where is the $ $ ?
Where are the walkathons , the cans in the 7 - 11 , the ribbons , and the stamps ?!
Where ?
Shit , even testicular cancer gets more media attention ... and that is only because recently , a few public figures ( Lance Armstrong for example ) have MADE IT A MEDIA ISSUE .
And that is n’t even in the top 10 cancers with just over 7 thousand new cases and 380 deaths in 2007 .
Cute little tid-bits of info :
In 2006 alone , our government “ granted ” ( gave ) foreign countries : 28.16 Million dollars for cancer research .
No stipulations or explanations as to where it actually went .
Nice to know we have that sort of cash to just give away for …well … who knows ?
In 2005 , an additional $ 2.9 million was received by the NCI from the US Postal Service ’s sale of the Breast Cancer Stamp .
This is not calculated in the total dollar amount of breast cancer monies above .
In 2006 , an additional $ 6.9 million was received by the NCI from the US Postal Service ’s sale of the Breast Cancer Stamp .
This is not calculated in the total dollar amount of breast cancer monies above .
So let us summarize :
Although the prostate is the # 1 cancer site , we as a country spend almost double the amount of money on research , care , education and program moneys ( USPS Stamps ) on breast cancer ( specifically women ’s breast cancer – yes girls and boys , men can and do get it too ) .
Although prostate cancer is the # 2 overall cancer killer of humans ( sorry girls you are not the primary victims this time ) , breast cancer gets more media attention , funding , donations , educational programs , and of course donations .
Although prostate cancer does n't differentiate between common men and political leaders , there have been recent politicians that have had a battle with prostate cancer ...
Yet , they continue to perpetuate this financial discrimination , I call it ' gray discrimination ' , upon all men . why ?
Tell me again why we need a Federally Funded Women ’s Health Commission as well as an International Women ’s Health Commission ( read – our tax dollars ) whereas none exists for men ?
FOR the people , OF the people , and BY the people .. eh ?

will not fight Saturday night in San Jose , Calif. , nor will he collect the $ 50,000 purse he was set to receive for his bout against South Korea 's Jae Suk Lim California State Athletic Commission executive officer Armando Garcia made that determination Wednesday .
Why ?
It depends on whom you ask .
" He did not turn in his medical information in time for the fight , " said Garcia , confirming an MMAWeekly report that Diaz was removed from the Showtime - televised card .
" They were just turned in today .
" Late Wednesday evening , however , EliteXC President Gary Shaw , who promotes Diaz , disputed Garcia 's account .
" He never mentioned anything about late medicals , " said Shaw .
" And if there were late medicals it was n't because of Nick Diaz and it was n't because of EliteXC .
" The issue , as described to him by Garcia , said Shaw , was Diaz 's prescription for medical marijuana , which is legal in California based on the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 .
" He 's got a medical marijuana card , " confirmed Diaz 's manager Cesar Gracie , who mentioned Attention Deficit Disorder as the cause for the prescription .
"
Nick is a naturalist by heart , " said Gracie .
" He thinks Ritalin is an amphetamine .
He thinks that 's really bad for you .
People with ADD are kind of hyper , so he has trouble sleeping .
He got the medical marijuana card and he takes his pot to go to sleep and be more focused .
It 's completely legal in California .
Voters voted it in .
The commission is actually supposed to obey that , so this will probably open up a legal case .
If it was something small , OK , f---- it , whatever .
But if they 're not even going to allow him to test clean , that does n't make sense .
That 's overstepping their boundaries .
" Completing paperwork on March 10 in the Los Angeles offices of Dr. Richard Gluckman -- in an effort to renew his license to fight in California , Diaz underwent a battery of tests including MRI , EKG , ophthalmological , neurological , bloodwork for HIV , Hepatitis B and C , and a comprehensive physical -- the 24 - year - old from Stockton , Calif. , noted his use of medical marijuana .
Not the first mixed martial artist to list marijuana as prescribed medication on CSAC forms , Diaz included the information , said Gracie , in case a positive test arose out of the CSAC 's strict anti-doping regulations , which began almost one year ago .
( Earlier this month , the California commission fined and suspended Toby Grear , who cited the use of Marinol based on a medical marijuana prescription . )
Two and a half weeks later , Garcia said he first learned of Diaz 's medical marijuana usage .
As with any mention of prescribed medication taken by fighters applying for a license , Garcia said an investigation was required to determine the reason for the prescription .
"
If you 're a fighter and you know you 're going to fight in a state that has a commission and they test for drugs -- they have a doping program -- you have to tell them way ahead of time , not three days before the weigh - in or the fight , " Garcia said .
" You have to give the commission the opportunity to evaluate your ailment and the reason you were prescribed a certain drug .
And if you do n't do that , you 're risking not fighting .
" Shaw , who said the responsibility for filing medicals to Sacramento rested with Dr. Gluckman 's office , called Diaz 's acknowledgment of marijuana usage " entrapment . "
" He does what you ask him , and you punish him ? " said a puzzled Shaw .
" It 's like if you have a Ferrari and a police officer gives you a speeding ticket before you turn the key .
" It was n't about lateness because I say you definitely can't pull him off if your own doctor sent it in .
We have guys getting licensed today , so you know it 's an outright lie .
" Garcia declined to comment on Shaw 's recollection of their conversation .
Scheduled to appear on a televised bout on the undercard of Frank Shamrock 's tilt with Cung Le , Diaz 's ouster from the HP Pavilion - housed event forced EliteXC to put together a bout between Lim and Drew Fickett , who was left without an opponent when Jake Shields dropped out Tuesday because of a back injury .
( The winner between Fickett and Lim will fight Shields for the vacant EliteXC 170 - pound title . )
Diaz should return to action on June 14 in Hawaii , said EliteXC Vice President Jared Shaw .
The brash 160 - pounder is no stranger to mixing marijuana and MMA .
In March of last year the Nevada State Athletic Commission suspended , fined and stripped Diaz of his win over Takanori Gomi after testing positive for THC levels more than three times the accepted limit .
A Monroe Marine ’s sister said her family is “ living in a nightmare ” as news spreads around the world linking the man to a video of what appears to be a U.S. Marine throwing a puppy off a desert cliff .
Death threats and graphic descriptions of physical violence continue to be directed at the Marine and his extended family as their personal information is being spread on the Internet .
That information on Tuesday continued to be posted on various blogs , social networking sites and online forums .
“ They are getting angry about this puppy and the loss of this puppy , if this is real , ” the sister said in an interview with KIRO ( 710 - AM ) radio talk - show host Dori Monson .
“ On the same hand , they are also threatening human beings ’ lives .
They are putting this puppy ’s life above human beings . ”
Local law enforcement and national animal rights groups are calling for people to express their emotions in a civil way .
The U.S. Marine Corps is investigating , attempting to determine whether the event shown in the video — dramatic though it is — is authentic .
“ Obviously , the video is extremely disturbing , ” said Inga Gibson , Washington state director for the Humane Society of the United States .
“ We will not condone any threats or violent behavior .
We are solely seeking an investigation . ”
Thousands of people have contacted the national group about the video , which started getting attention on Monday , Gibson said .
Marine Corps investigators have yet to identify who appears in the video or where or how it was created .
They have n’t yet concluded whether the video is authentic or a hoax .
In either case , Marine Corps officials do not like what they have seen , condemning the video in a statement released Monday .
The Marine from Monroe is stationed at Marine Corps Base Hawaii , and that is where the investigation is being conducted .
The Herald is not identifying the Monroe man because of many questions surrounding the video .
“ I understand people ’s outrage , ” Maj . Chris Perrine , a spokesman at the Kaneohe Bay Marine Corps base in Hawaii , told The Honolulu Advertiser on Tuesday .
The Monroe Marine is at the base .
“ I think every Marine is outraged by the video , and what I would do is encourage people to support our Constitutional process and treat people as innocent till proven guilty and let the process run its course . ”
The blurry 17 - second video makes it difficult to tell whether the puppy is a toy or real .
It dangles motionless as someone dressed as a Marine holds it by the scruff of the neck .
The man throws it into a gully and shrugs at the camera .
The video has gone viral , spreading through e-mails and multiple Web postings .
It is making international headlines , appearing in news stories in Australia and Germany and on CNN , Fox News , MSNBC and Wired magazine ’s Web site .
The video already has been viewed more than 145,000 times on YouTube.com , where copies of the video are posted as quickly as they are taken down .
The site also features dozens more video blogs offering individuals ’ opinions to the video .
Many sites keep posting the Monroe family ’s personal information , which exposes them to harassment and verbal abuse .
A deputy from the Snohomish County Sheriff ’s Office visited the Monroe family on Monday , said Rebecca Hover , a sheriff ’s spokeswoman .
The family has disconnected their phones following threatening calls .
“ With the phones out , they should n’t have any more problems with harassing calls , so now we want to make sure they are safe in their home , ” Hover said .
An investigation into any threats would be started if the family chooses to report them , Hover said .
“ What it says for them is when they are so passionate about a single dog ’s life , yet they are willing to — they say they are — willing to kill the entire family over something like this , ” the sister of the Marine from Monroe told KIRO .
Her brother has served his country in Afghanistan and Iraq and “ none of them take that into account , ” she said .
“ They just want to jump on him and immediately call him a mental maniac . ”
The sister did not return a phone call from The Herald seeking comment .
In cyberspace , some posters were calling for restraint , saying that threatening the man ’s family is wrong and pointless .
“ Some of the comments made toward the innocent family members of this Marine by certain Web site owners , bloggers and their responders — and their actions — have bordered on the criminal in my opinion , and many have very frankly crossed well over that line .
I saw one vile post advocating a sexual assault on this Marine ’s mother , ” wrote one poster , IrishRose , on the conservative commentator Michelle Malkin ’s Web site .
“ I am not defending what he did , ” wrote toothygrim on Digg , “ because it is inexcusable . … but do we have any proof that the guy in the video is actually the guy whose name and address people are posting ?
I personally have no idea , but it would be really sad if someone else is getting all the hate mail and threatening phone calls and it was n’t even them in the video .
I did n’t see a name tag on the guy , but I do n’t have the ability to enhance video etc . ”
Ivan Orton , a King County prosecutor who has written books on cybercrime , also wrote Washington state ’s statutes on computer trespass and malicious mischief .
They are considered some of the stiffest cyberstalking laws in the United States .
The anonymity of the Internet makes people a lot ruder than they are in the real world , Orton said .
While Washington created a cyberspace stalking law in 2004 , the law is vague about what makes a cyberspace threat worthy of criminal investigation .
“ The problem is that we are dealing with the ever - changing Internet and technology with laws that may have been outdated , ” Orton said .
“ We will never win that battle . ”
This incident also serves as a warning to people about the need to be careful about how they put personal information out on the Internet , said Mike Andrew , vice president of training and forensic analyst for the CyberSecurity Institute .
The Monroe firm trains law enforcement and military agencies and corporations on cyberspace security .
“ People do n’t realize that there is a lot of information about themselves that they do n’t know of , ” Andrew said .

We All Own Stolen Goods — and How Defending Property Rights Can Help the World ’s Most Oppressed People
You very likely own stolen goods .
The gas in your car , the circuits in your cell phone , the diamond in your ring , the chemicals in your lipstick or shaving cream — even the plastic in your computer may be the product of theft .
Americans buy huge quantities of goods every day that are literally stolen from some of the world ’s poorest people .
These thefts are permitted — indeed encouraged — by an archaic rule of international trade that violates the most fundamental rule of capitalism : to protect property rights .
Tracing these stolen goods back to where the thefts occur lands us in some of the most wretched places on earth .
What these countries have in common is an abundance of natural resources and plentiful political violence and corruption .
All suffer from what Joseph Stiglitz and Jeffrey Sachs call “ the resource curse . ”
Here dictators and insurgents sell off the country ’s resources to foreigners , terrifying the people into submission while keeping the wealth for themselves .
The lavishly tyrannical Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea has become richer than Queen Elizabeth II by selling off the country ’s oil and gas while killing or menacing anyone who might try to stop him .
Obiang is the kind of dictator who has not shied from having himself proclaimed “ the country ’s God ” on state - controlled radio , or from having his guards slice the ears of political prisoners and smear their bodies with grease to attract stinging ants .
Obiang sells two - thirds of Equatorial Guinea ’s oil to American corporations like ExxonMobil and Hess , and has recently spent 55 million of these petro-dollars to add a sixth private jet to his fleet .
His playboy son and heir ( who earns $ 5,000 a year as a government minister ) prefers Lamborghinis , and recently spent $ 35 million on a house in Malibu .
Meanwhile raw sewage runs through the streets of the country ’s capital , three quarters of the country ’s people suffer from malnutrition , and most citizens are forced to exist each day on what you can buy in America with one dollar .
Obiang does not need to worry about the health or education of the population : he gets the money he needs to maintain his despotic rule by allowing foreign corporations to set up offshore platforms to extract the country ’s oil .
Resource - cursed countries like Equatorial Guinea are prone not only to authoritarian rulers but also to civil strife , since the prospect of obtaining fabulous wealth by wrenching resources from a poor country often sets off a violent struggle for the prize .
In 2004 a cabal of businessmen ( including Margaret Thatcher ’s son Mark ) financed mercenaries who attempted to overthrow Obiang and replace him with a puppet president who would funnel the country ’s oil revenues to the plot ’s financiers .
( The coup failed and Obiang had the captured leaders tortured . )
Nor is Equatorial Guinea the only country whose resources have cursed it with authoritarianism and civil war :
In the late 1980′s and early 1990′s Pol Pot supported the Khmer Rouge army by capturing and then plundering a strip of Cambodian territory rich in rubies and timber .
In Sierra Leone in the 1990′s insurgents recruited child soldiers to scare much of the population away from the country ’s rich diamond deposits with a brutal campaign of shootings and machete amputations .
The rebels enslaved many of the remaining locals to work in the pits , selling these “ Blood Diamonds ” to international merchants like De Beers who then set them in wedding rings that Americans now wear as symbols of enduring love .
The highly repressive Burmese military junta remains in power today partly by selling $ 2.8 billion of natural gas to Thailand each year and using these revenues to buy advanced weapons from India to quell domestic dissent .
The regime is being protected from UN sanctions by China partly in exchange for access to large offshore gas deposits .
In the Democratic Republic of Congo right now more than a thousand people die every day in the chaos caused by militiamen fighting over the minerals used to make our cell phones and laptops , who rape village women with bayonets and clubs as a tactic of war .
Authoritarianism and civil war both impoverish the people of resource - cursed countries .
Sierra Leone this year ranks 177th out of 177 countries on the Human Development Index .
Social scientists say that resource exports are correlated with higher rates of child malnutrition , lower healthcare and education budgets , higher illiteracy rates , higher poverty rates , and lower life expectancy .
The natural resources that the strongmen and civil warriors sell off are made into products sold in America .
The money we spend on these products goes back to pay for their Kalashnikovs , helicopter gunships , and fleets of private jets .
Paul Collier estimates that 290 million of the world ’s “ bottom billion ” people are caught in what he calls “ the resource trap . ”
Millions of these poor people must watch helplessly as their countries ’ resources are sent overseas while our money flows in to the men with guns .
This is literally theft .
The authoritarians and insurgents have no right to sell these countries ’ resources .
As the ancient Roman legal maxim says , Nemo dat quod non habet : no one can give what they do not have .
The authoritarians and insurgents do not own these countries ’ resources .
The natural resources of a country belong , after all , to its people .
George W. Bush and Tony Blair recently and repeatedly invoked this principle of national ownership in the case of Iraq : “ The oil belongs to the Iraqi people , ” Bush said , “ It ’s their asset . ”
Nor is this principle parochial to any particular ideology : Hugo Chavez and Ayatollah Khamenei have proclaimed the principle as well .
All of these leaders are drawing on one of the deepest ideas in modern international law .
This is the principle of national ownership declared in Article 1 of the primary human rights treaties , ratified by the United States and the vast majority of the countries of the world : “ All peoples may , for their own ends , freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources . ”
The principle of national ownership is deeply embedded in international law , but it is also violated daily under cover of a rule from the days of European colonial empires .
By this archaic rule the internationally recognized power to sell off the territory ’s resources is vested in anyone violent enough to cow a country ’s people into submission .
By this rule any tyrant or civil warrior can gain the right to sell off a country ’s resources simply through force of arms .
According to this archaic rule for selling resources , might makes right .
It is this archaic “ might makes right ” rule that generates systematic incentives toward the curses of tyranny , violence , and poverty .
Authoritarians who gain the resource right use the money from resource sales to buy weapons and spies to keep the population living in fear .
Coup plotters look for ways to grab the resource right from the current regime and then become authoritarians in their turn .
Rebels who can seize control of resource - rich territory gain the funds they need to start or escalate a civil war .
And the people , whose resources are being sold off , become not the beneficiaries of this wealth but the victim of those who use their own wealth to repress them .
“ Might makes right ” is the rule that sets off a violent contest to extract poor countries ’ resources while crushing popular resistance , and it is the rule sends the products of crime into our gas stations and shopping malls .
How bad is the problem of stolen resources ?
The U.S. government uses the seven - point Freedom House scales to rate each nation on how much control citizens have over the those who hold power in their country .
The very worst countries — the “ sevens ” — are places like Burma , Equatorial Guinea , Libya , North Korea , Somalia , Sudan and Zimbabwe .
Taking these very worst countries as the places where the people could not possibly be authorizing the dictators and civil warriors to sell off their country ’s resources , we can measure the amounts of stolen resources that enter America each year .
By these official U.S. criteria over 600 million barrels of oil — more than one barrel in eight — have been taken illegitimately from their countries of origin .
Stolen oil may be in your car ’s gas tank right now .
Stolen oil might have been used to make the computer mouse in your hand .
What can be done ?
One option is a public pressure campaign to divest from companies that invest in resource - cursed countries , as is endorsed by Nicholas Kristof in the case of Sudan ( “ Is your pension fund helping finance the Janjaweed militias that throw babies into bonfires in Darfur ? ” ) .
Another possibility , in countries where this is politically conceivable , would be to institutionalize Vernon Smith ’s proposal for a “ People ’s Fund ” : a mutual fund built up by auctioning the country ’s natural resources , from which any citizen could at any time withdraw their per-capita share of the revenues .
The most promising strategy , however , is to enforce property rights directly : to take legal action in U.S. jurisdictions against the middlemen who trade Americans ’ dollars to the worst regimes in exchange for stolen resources .
This means taking corporations like ExxonMobil and Hess to court for receiving stolen goods .
The international and American laws needed are already in force : these legal cases could be brought tomorrow .
International capitalism has already created strong laws and institutions for enforcing these property rights .
Americans may or may not blame these corporations for trading their dollars for stolen resources .
These corporations are merely doing what they are designed to do , taking the “ might makes right ” rule as part of accepted business practices .
Yet neither these corporations nor market - friendly governments can resist the reality that a significant portion of international commerce today is trade in stolen goods .
More than any other country , the United States has worked to create a modern international order that protects human rights , especially the human rights that are property rights .
This is why legal cases requiring the United States to follow its own principles are waiting to be made .
However , upholding market principles is not as simple as bringing some court cases .
Stopping American corporations from transporting stolen oil from a country like Sudan will not end the resource curse there .
We know this because the U.S. government has barred American energy companies from trading with the regime in Khartoum since 1997 , in part because of this regime ’s grim record on human rights .
Yet the genocidal Sudanese regime continues to sell the country ’s oil to China , using the money to buy more Chinese arms to menace the populations in Darfur and the south .
This is disastrous for the Sudanese , and it is also a problem for Americans .
Stolen Sudanese oil today percolates through the Chinese economy , becoming part of the Chinese imports that Americans buy every day .
Americans right now ca n’t help dirtying their hands with stolen Sudanese oil when they shop at Target and Best Buy .
Discouraging China from buying cursed Sudanese oil is possible , and again turns on enforcing property rights — this time through trade policy .
The key insight is that when China exports products made using the looted Sudanese oil it is not engaging in trade .
It is literally passing stolen goods .
Say that China buys $ 3 billion worth of oil from the regime in Khartoum .
The correct response on a property rights approach is for the United States government immediately to announce a Clean Hands Trust for the People of Sudan .
This trust is a bank account that the U.S. government will fill until it contains $ 3 billion .
The money to fill the trust will be raised from tariffs on Chinese imports as they enter the United States .
The money in this Clean Hands Trust is to be held for the people of Sudan until a minimally decent , unified government is in place .
At that point the $ 3 billion will be turned over to the true owners of the stolen oil : the Sudanese people .
The Clean Hands Trust will protect the American people from becoming tainted with the oil that China gets illegally from the regime in Khartoum .
The tariffs extract from Chinese imports the value of the oil taken from Sudan , and the trust holds this money in reserve until it can be given back to the Sudanese people .
With the tariffs in place American consumers can buy Chinese goods with clean hands .
The Chinese , for their part , will have much less of an incentive to buy more oil from Sudan — knowing that if they buy $ 2 billion more oil then the United States will impose tariffs worth $ 2 billion more on their goods .
The Sudanese people will know that there is a great deal of money waiting to be turned over to them if they can replace the regime that is looting their resources with a minimally decent , unified government .
The trust gives the Sudanese people an extra incentive to unite in installing a government that is in some way responsive to the people ’s wishes , while drying up the revenues that support and arm the current regime in Khartoum .
The trust - and - tariff mechanism protects property rights by retaining the value of the stolen property for the owners of that property : the citizens of Sudan .
The tariffs here are different from other tariffs : they are “ anti - theft tariffs ” designed to enforce property rights .
The trust - and - tariff mechanism is no more a restraint on free trade than a court order to return stolen property , and no more a restraint on free trade than a prison term for a thief .
China , having violated market rules by passing stolen goods , has no standing to complain when these violations are rectified .
The World Trade Organization , for example , could not allow China to impose trade restrictions in retaliation for these anti-theft tariffs .
The Chinese could no more protest these anti-theft tariffs in the WTO than they could protest sanctions were they to occupy Sudan militarily and attempt to sell off its oil .
The WTO should find these tariffs as acceptable as the 1990 UN sanctions that kept Iraq from selling stolen oil from Kuwait .
This trust - and - tariff mechanism will generate strong incentives for a variety of American economic interests to support the property - based approach .
The instant that China contracts for the Sudanese oil , American manufacturers will lobby the U.S. government to set up a Clean Hands Trust .
Many American companies ( in apparel , electronics , machinery ) will want these tariffs to protect them against Chinese competition in their sector .
The American banking industry will also be enthusiastic about the Clean Hands Trust , as American banks will hold the tariff proceeds in trust until these are returned to the Sudanese .
Both the manufacturing and banking sectors will also welcome the opportunity publicly to support measures aimed at helping the victims of a genocidal regime .
This trade policy will also be popular across the American political spectrum .
Supporters of the free market will support it for correcting a major flaw in the global economy by enforcing property rights .
Protectionists will support it for protecting good American jobs against Chinese competition .
Security advocates will support it for strengthening failed states where terrorism can incubate .
Environmentalists will support it for at least temporarily raising oil costs and so lowering carbon emissions .
And humanitarians will support it for improving the prospects of millions of the most oppressed people on earth .
Americans today can’t help funding death and terror when they buy gasoline and magazines , jewelry and laptops , cosmetics and cell phones .
The materials used to make these goods are not just stolen : they have been stolen from the world ’s poorest people using weapons paid for with money gained from previous sales of stolen goods .
Peoples have rights , and there are things no person or group may do to them ( without violating their rights ) .
Trafficking in a country ’s valuable natural resources without the people ’s consent certainly crosses that line .
The priority in reforming global trade must be to lock in the rights that define the market order .
The first step in improving the prospects of poor people is to enforce the rights they already have .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Microsoft was fined a record 899 million euros ( $ 1.35 billion ) by the European Commission on Wednesday for using high prices to discourage software competition in the latest sanction in their long - running battle .
The executive arm of the European Union said the U.S. software group defied a 2004 order from Brussels to provide the information on reasonable terms .
Microsoft has now been fined a total of 1.68 billion euros by the EU for abusing its 95 percent dominance of PC operating systems through Windows .
Its latest fine far exceeded the original and was the biggest ever imposed on a company .
“ Microsoft was the first company in 50 years of EU competition policy that the Commission has had to fine for failure to comply with an antitrust decision , ” Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a statement .
For years after the decision Microsoft said it was making every effort to comply with the Commission ’s orders .
“ Talk is cheap , flouting the rules is expensive , ” Kroes said .
“ We do n’t want talk and promises .
We want compliance . ”
Microsoft said in a statement the fines concerned “ past issues ” and it was now looking to the future .
The Commission said in a landmark 2004 ruling , upheld by an EU court last year , that Microsoft had withheld needed interoperability information for “ work group server ” software .
RIVALS SHRIVELLED
Rival makers of work group servers , which operate printers and sign - ons for small office groups , saw their markets shrivel because Microsoft stopped providing information they needed to hook up to Windows office machines .
Even after the 2004 decision and a 497 - million euro fine Microsoft dragged its feet , giving incomplete documentation and charging high royalties , the Commission said .
“ I hope that today ’s decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft ’s record of non-compliance with the Commission ’s March 2004 decision , ” Kroes said .
The latest decision picks up from where a 280.5 million euro fine for non-compliance left off , covering the period from June 21 , 2006 until October 21 , 2007 .
After losing a major court decision in September 2007 , Microsoft capitulated .
Last week it promised to publish critical information so rival programs worked better with Windows .
That came as the company was facing this week ’s fine and perhaps even more important , two new formal Commission investigations opened in January .
“ As we demonstrated last week with our new interoperability principles and specific actions to increase the openness of our products , we are focusing on steps that will improve things for the future , ” Microsoft said on Wednesday .

The new Commission investigations relate to the issues of the 2004 case but with different products .
The Commission said in 2004 that Microsoft tied its Windows Media Player to Windows .
Opera , maker of a Web browser , said Microsoft has done the same with Internet Explorer .
The new interoperability question concerns Microsoft Office and the difficulty for documents from rival systems to interoperate with Word and other Office products .
Kroes took a wait - and - see attitude about Microsoft ’s announcement of last week , noting it had promised change on four other occasions without results .
“ A press release , such as that issued by Microsoft last week on interoperability principles , does not necessarily equal a change in a business practice , ” she said .

Mozilla , the maker of the open source Firefox browser , is redoubling its efforts to check user created add - ons for viruses and Trojans after it discovered that a language pack on its official add - on page had been infected for months with rogue code , the organization reported Wednesday .
Starting in mid-Feburary , Vietnamese users of Mozilla 's open source Firefox browser were at risk of infection from malicious Trojan Horse code seemingly accidentally embedded in a language pack available on its Add - ons site .
The virus 's signature was unknown at the time , and thus passed Mozilla 's testing of add - ons .
The glitch is n't the first time that seemingly trusted software included rogue code , but such occurences are surprisingly rare given the amount of open - source and shareware programs that net users install based on blind trust .
That 's not even mentioning the huge selection of pirated software available on file sharing networks that could easily be infected with malware .
In response to the later discovery of the latent Trojan code by anti-virus software , Mozilla pulled the language pack and announced it would begin scanning all add - ons whenever they update their virus signatures , not just when add - ons are originally posted , according to a entry on the Mozilla security blog .
Mozilla had no exact statistics on the number of users who had installed the infected Vietnamese language add - on since it was uploaded on February 18 , but said that 16,667 people had downloaded the add - on since November 2007 .
On Tuesday , a user named Hai -Nam Nguyen reported that anti-virus programs detected the Xorer Trojan inside the add-on .
Firefox admins quickly confirmed the presence of the Trojan 's code and removed the file the same day .
Mozilla ran an anti-virus check on the most recent version in February when it was added to the official Firefox add - ons site , but the Trojan 's virus signature was not known until April .
The add - on's author is not suspected of intentionally booby - trapping the file , but instead had his own system infected .
That Trojan inserted a banner - ad displaying script into any html file on his system , which included the help files for the language pack .
That meant that anyone installing the language pack would have malicious ad displaying code inside their browser – which could be used for other exploits .
The Vietnamese language pack has been pulled until a clean replacement is uploaded .
Existing users should uninstall the add - on in the meantime .

He was a military leader turned dictator who had such a complex about his receding hairline that he perfected the Roman comb -over and liked laurel crowns that disguised his bald patch .
In flattering posthumous portraits Julius Caesar was often portrayed as a dashing , healthy - haired , divine being .
But now a realistic marble bust believed to be the oldest representation taken during his lifetime has been discovered at the bottom of the river Rhône in France .
The life - sized bust , which has thrilled French archaeologists , shows a man in his fifties with the receding hair said to have given him a complex after taunts from his battlefield enemies .
He also has wrinkles and lines that reflect the war - hardened life of the man who conquered Gaul and whose quest for power was largely responsible for turning the Roman republic into a dictatorship that would later become an empire .
The bust was discovered by French archaeologist divers scouring the bottom of the Rhône in the southern town of Arles , which Caesar founded in 46BC , distributing land among his veteran legionnaires .
It is believed the bust was sculpted between 49 and 46BC , when Caesar was in his 50s , a few years before he was assassinated by nobles in the senate house .
The French excavation team said this was the only bust of Caesar made during his lifetime , apart from a Turin death mask taken just before or after his death .
Even in Rome , portraits and statues of Caesar were essentially posthumous .
The French culture minister , Christine Albanel , triumphantly claimed the bust " the most ancient representation of Caesar known today " .
" The important thing is that this is a bust taken from the living man , " said Michel L'Hour , head of the French government 's team for subaquatic archaeological research .
" It 's done in the republican tradition of realism from real life - he looks aged , lined and balding .
It 's extremely rare and most likely unique . "
The riddle that remains is why the bust ended up at the bottom of the river in the town dubbed " Little Rome in Gaul " .
" Perhaps this bust was thrown into the river after Caesar was assassinated because that was a difficult time to be considered a follower of his , " L'Hour said .
" Or was it dumped because Caesar was becoming a tyrant who wanted to kill the republic and become emperor ?
It could have belonged to an important person , or it could have been placed on a public building . "
The find was made in October 2007 but was kept quiet until now so the site would not be disturbed .
Other items found in the treasure - trove included a 1.8 m marble statue of Neptune dating from the third century .
Two smaller bronzes were also found , one a satyr with its hands tied behind its back .
The guys behind the Gumpert Apollo supercar hope to prove that " green " and " performance " are n't mutually exclusive when they line up at the 24 Hours of Nurburgring endurance race in a hybrid producing 800 horsepower .
It will compete alongside gasoline - powered cars from the likes of Porsche , Audi and BMW on one of the most famous tracks in motor racing , and it opens another front in the campaign to make auto racing more environmentally responsible .
The Indy Racing League runs 100 percent ethanol and Formula 1 teams must use kinetic energy recovery systems beginning next year , and German boutique automaker Gumpert wants to see more gas - electric drivetrains on the grid .
" Motorsports cannot ignore the necessity to save energy , " says former F1 driver Heinz - Harald Frentzen , who with Dirk Müller will drive the Apollo .
" I see a chance that our sport will go back to the forefront of technical development , making cars outside the race track more energy efficient . "
These guys know what they 're doing .
Roland Gumpert was the head of Audi Sport when the automaker scored two World Rally Championship driver 's and constructor 's championships .
Frentzen raced scored three wins during his F1 career and is ranked 59th among the " 100 Greatest Racing Drivers Ever " in this month 's issue of F1 Racing magazine .
Müller has raced in F3 and the American Le Mans series .
Gumpert has n't released photographs of the hybrid racer , but it probably will look a lot like the car pictured .
Gumpert worked with Lithium Technology Corp. to develop the hybrid drivetrain , which mates a 3.3 - liter V8 twin - turbo engine to a 100 - kilowatt electric motor to produce the equivalent of 800 horsepower .
The motor uses a 9 - kilowatt hour lithium ion battery comprised of 90 high - power 27 amphere hour cells connected in series .
It weighs about 420 pounds and provides a full - electric range of 31 miles .
The battery will be fully charged before the race and the car will use regenerative braking to keep it charged .
Company CEO
Klaus Brandt says motorsports is the perfect place to test its technology .
" LTC believes that racing plays a significant role in pioneering the use of new technologies , such as lithium ion batteries , and offers the opportunity for us to demonstrate the performance of our batteries under extreme conditions , " he says .
This is n't the first time a hybrid has gone endurance racing .
The Toyota Supra HV - R handily won Japan 's Tokachi 24 - hour endurance race last year .
But the 24 Hours of Nurburgring is more famous , having started in 1970 as a low - cost alternative to the 1000 KM of Nurburgring , and will expose the technology to a wider audience .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - The United States is already in a recession and it will be longer as well as deeper than many people expect , U.S. investor Warren Buffett said in an interview published in German magazine Der Spiegel on Saturday .
He said the United States was “ already in recession ” and added : “ Perhaps not in the sense that economists would define it ” with two consecutive quarters of negative growth .
“ But the people are already feeling the effects , ” said Buffett , the world ’s richest man .
“ It will be deeper and last longer than many think . ”
But he said that wo n’t stop him from investing in selected companies and said he remained interested in well - managed German family - owned companies .
“ If the world were falling apart I ’d still invest in companies , ” he said .
Buffett also renewed his criticism of derivatives trading .
“ It ’s not right that hundreds of thousands of jobs are being eliminated , that entire industrial sectors in the real economy are being wiped out by financial bets even though the sectors are actually in good health . ”
Buffett complained about the lack of effective controls .
“ That ’s the problem , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t steer it , you ca n’t regulate it anymore .
You ca n’t get the genie back in the bottle . ”

Crossing the crocodile - infested
Tugela River
Enlarge Image
A South African village is demanding that a bridge be built across a crocodile - infested river to stop children swimming it to get to school .
Students as young as seven have been making the crossing for two months since the community 's boat was stolen .
" There are about 70 households on that side of the river but there are no buses and no - one owns a car , " a Kwazulu - Natal local councillor said .
To cross safely would require a 20 km ( 12 miles ) detour to get to the school .
I worry all the time .
There are dangerous animals in there , especially crocodiles ,
Headmistress Hlengiwe Mthembu
On school days , 150 children from Sahlumbe village in the heart of rural Zululand swim across the river in their underwear using rubber tyres and buckets to keep afloat and to keep their school uniforms and books dry .
The older ones help the small ones who cling to the tyres .
" I worry all the time .
There are dangerous animals in there , especially crocodiles , " says Thuthukani Primary School headmistress Hlengiwe Mthembu .
The children , some of whom also attend Mabizela High School , often arrive tired and unable to concentrate , she says .
" They sit in class and shiver because of the cold and they can't study well because they are worrying about how they are going to get home .
" It is very hard for them .
After heavy rains the river gets very full .
It can take up to 10 minutes to cross . "
Drowning Local councillor Sibusiso Nbatha says most of the families moved to the area three years ago after being evicted from the land they were on .
Once at school the journey home is on pupils ' minds ( Pic : Gcina Ndwalane / The Mercury )
He says many parents have no choice but to let their children make the dangerous crossing .
" Not all the children can swim so some ride on the tires or their parents carry them across .
The river is too deep for the adults to walk across and not all of them can swim , " Mr Nbatha says .
It is not only children who have to face the fast - flowing Tugela River .
The only hospital in the area is also situated on the far bank .
In 2003 a pregnant woman battling to reach the opposite bank drowned .
It 's very frustrating .
You can see the school from the opposite bank but you just can't reach it
Local councillor Sibusiso Nbatha
In 2005 , two children from the same family were also taken by the river and drowned .
Mr Nbatha says even the stolen boat was not safe and he wants a bridge built in the area .
" It was old and full of holes .
There was only one boat and it was used by the whole community . "
He says he has pleaded with the department of transport for five years .
" They just keep us waiting , " he says .
" It 's very frustrating .
You can see the school from the opposite bank but you just can't reach it . "

What are these ?
Arjun N. Murti remembers the pain of the oil shocks of the 1970s .
But he is bracing for something far worse now :
He foresees a “ super spike ”  a price surge that will soon drive crude oil to $ 200 a barrel .
Mr. Murti , who has a bit of a green streak , is not bothered much by the prospect of even higher oil prices , figuring it might finally prompt America to become more energy efficient .
An analyst at Goldman Sachs , Mr. Murti has become the talk of the oil market by issuing one sensational forecast after another .
A few years ago , rivals scoffed when he predicted oil would breach $ 100 a barrel .
Few are laughing now .
Oil shattered yet another record on Tuesday , touching $ 129.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Gas at $ 4 a gallon is arriving just in time for those long summer drives .
Mr. Murti , 39 , argues that the world ’s seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil means prices will keep rising from here and stay above $ 100 into 2011 .
Others disagree , arguing that prices could abruptly tumble if speculators in the market rush for the exits .
But the grim calculus of Mr. Murti ’s prediction , issued in March and reconfirmed two weeks ago , is enough to give anyone pause : in an America of $ 200 oil , gasoline could cost more than $ 6 a gallon .
At a time of soaring food prices , America 's grocery bill is about to balloon .
Congress is staggering toward completion of a nearly $ 300 billion farm bill that upholds subsidies for big farmers and food corporations – undermining vital efforts to make our food supply more healthful and sustainable , both environmentally and economically .
It 's time to overhaul the government 's approach to food and farming .
If the current measure passes ( as it 's slated to this Friday ) Americans will shell out billions of dollars for farm subsidies that wreak havoc on our land and diets .
These payments irresponsibly promote the consumption of cheap fatty foods , the depletion of soil and air through overuse of pesticides , and destructive farming practices .
Like farm bills past , this one also advances the removal of small farms , eroding the spirit and finances of rural communities across the US .
There is funding for conservation and nutrition programs , even allotments for innovative community food security projects that expand markets for small farmers while making food accessible to poor inner-city residents .
But the subsidies for agribusiness – sometimes exceeding $ 15 billion a year – deepen the very problems these programs seek to remedy .
The core issue lies in the Commodity Title , which subsidizes large growers ' production of corn , wheat , and other raw ingredients used in everything from food sweeteners to livestock feed to auto fuel .
Supporting farmers to produce basic foodstuffs is a laudable policy , but today 's subsidy system instead props up unsustainable growing practices and undermines the nation 's health and its farming and food future .
Consider that 75 percent of subsidies go to a handful of commodities ( mostly wheat , corn , and oilseeds ) used as food additives , making highly processed junk food cheap – while fruits and vegetables and whole foods currently get no aid .
Nearly 70 percent of farm subsidies go to the top 10 percent of the country 's biggest growers – while America loses one farm every half an hour .
This form of corporate welfare encourages the ongoing consolidation of farming and food production into fewer hands .
It removes small and mid-sized farmers who can no longer compete in the unlevel playing field .
Meanwhile , by skewing payments toward large - scale farming , these subsidies promote ecologically damaging intensive pesticide use and severe depletion of precious topsoils .
Organic foods , often exorbitantly expensive , get no financial support .
As a result , the US dumps nearly half a million tons of toxic pesticides on the land , polluting the air , often sickening nearby residents , and tainting rivers and streams .
Instead of upholding these mega - farm subsidies , let 's invest the public 's money in sustainable growing practices , organic foods , and small and mid-sized farms that form the bedrock – both economically and socially – of communities throughout America 's heartland .
Hardly a romantic nod to the past , such an overhaul is a practical investment in the future .
As global warming heats up , we can't afford a system that guzzles 100 billion gallons of oil each year in pesticides and the long - distance transit of packaged foods .
As obesity hits 30 percent of the population – harming lives and costing the public more than $ 100 billion in related health costs – we cannot afford to finance cheap junk food and excessive meat consumption .
And we cannot afford to continue paying large - scale commodity growers to plunder our fast - eroding soils while making it near impossible for smaller diversified growers to compete and survive .
Programs that revive local foods and small farms – via farmers ' markets , community - supported agriculture , and school purchasing programs – are gaining ground across the country .
Consumers are clamoring for organic foods , and for more farmer 's markets where growers can increase profits while keeping food prices the same or lower than in supermarkets .
The public 's money ought to finance sustainability in its truest sense – supporting farms and food programs that sustain local economies , our health , and the future of farmlands , instead of agribusiness and food corporations that plumb the land and these communities for short - term profit .
As Congress lurches toward destructive old policies , now is the time to cast our vote for a new path .

Counterterrorism officials in FBI headquarters slowed an investigation into a possible conspirator in the 2005 London bombings by forcing a field agent to return documents acquired from a U.S. university .
Why ?
Because the agent received the documents through a lawful subpoena , while headquarters wanted him to demand the records under the USA Patriot Act , using a power the FBI did not have , but desperately wanted .
At this July 27 , 2005 hearing , FBI Director Robert Mueller pushed the Senate Judiciary Committee to give FBI agents expanded spying powers . .

When a North Carolina State University lawyer correctly rejected the second records demand , the FBI obtained another subpoena .
Two weeks later , the delay was cited by FBI director Robert Mueller in congressional testimony as proof that the USA Patriot Act needed to be expanded .
The strange episode is recounted in newly declassified documents obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act .
The documents shed new light on how senior FBI officials ' determination to gain independence from judicial oversight slowed its own investigation , and led the bureau 's director to offer inaccurate testimony to Congress .
The revelations are likely to play a key role in Capitol Hill hearings Tuesday and Wednesday on the FBI 's use of so - called national security letters , or NSLs
At issue is the FBI 's probe of a former chemistry graduate student at North Carolina State University who was then suspected aiding the deadly attack .
The student has since been cleared of any involvement .
The agent investigating the student in the Charlotte , North Carolina field office obtained a grand jury subpoena demanding some university records on the student .
But he was then advised by superiors in Washington DC to return the papers and draft an NSL demanding the documents instead .
Under the USA Patriot Act , FBI counterterrorism investigators can self - issue such letters to get phone records , portions of credit reports and bank records , simply by certifying that the records are relevant to an investigation .
Unlike subpoenas , NSLs do not require probable cause , and at the time obliged the recipient to not discuss the demand with anyone , ever .
In contrast , gag orders attached to grand jury subpoenas have expiration dates .
FBI agents have relied heavily on the power , issuing more than 100,000 NSLs in 2004 and 2005 combined .
The first audit of the FBI 's use of the power found the agents became sloppy in their use of the power and one HQ office went rogue and issued hundreds of fake emergency requests for phone records .
The problem in the bombing case : the NSL demanded the university 's health records on the student .
Even under the USA Patriot Act , which greatly expanded the NSL 's reach , university records and health records are exempt , making the order from headquarters a sure - fire path to delay .
The FBI even has sample letters for each of the 11 kinds of records NSL can be used to obtain .
To comply with the demand from Washington , the Charlotte agent had to modify a sample letter intended for internet records .
The university , which had readily turned over the records in response to a subpoena , rejected the illegal NSL .
Two weeks later , Mueller , testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee , portrayed the university as intransigent and said the incident showed the FBI needed the power to force the turnover of all sorts of records without having to involve the court system .
" Now in my mind , we should not , in that circumstance have to show somebody that this was an emergency , " Mueller testified on July 27 , 2005 .
" We should 've been able to have a document , an administrative subpoena that we took to the university and got those records immediately . "
Some of the declassified documents suggest that Mueller was himself misled by underlings , and was n't told that the records had already been turned over in response to a subpoena .
Additionally , no one reported the overreaching subpoena to the Intelligence Oversight Board until 2007 , when the Inspector General started asking questions .
Oversight rules require officials to report any possible violations within 14 days .
This week , the House and Senate Judiciary committees are holding new hearings on NSLs .
Over the past two years , the Justice Department 's Inspector General has issued two damning reports on the agency 's sloppiness in using the letters .
Additionally , several courts have struck down some aspects of the NSLs as unconstitutional , and reports have surfaced that intelligence and military units are using them for domestic investigations .
Congressman Jerrold Nadler ( D - New York ) has introduced legislation to rein in the use of national security letters , and provide penalties for abuses .
UPDATE : FBI General Counsel Valerie Caproni responded to questions about the incident from Rep. Nadler in a hearing Tuesday , essentially saying it was n't a big deal since the FBI was entitled to the records , anyhow :
" I am not quite sure why the direction was give to issue an NSL in that case , " Caproni said .
" As I look at what I believe they were seeking from the university , an NSL was not the way to go .
It 's unclear why HQ chose the wrong tool . "

As the sun rose over the Mojave Desert , researcher Kristina Drake approached with caution as a creature with weary eyes , a scuffed carapace and skin as rough as rhino hide peered at her from the edge of a dirt road just east of here .
Wearing rubber gloves , Drake picked up the old female California desert tortoise and , in one fluid motion , moved her to safer ground beneath a nearby creosote bush .
“ It ’s one of ours , ” she said .
“ No. 4118 . ”
The tortoise , nicknamed “ Road Warrior , ” was among the 760 captured and airlifted by helicopter a month ago out of the southern portion of the Army ’s nearby National Training Center at Ft. Irwin , which is slated for expanded combat exercises .
Her well - being in new terrain is essential to the $ 8.7 - million relocation effort , which has been hit hard by a problem unforeseen by federal biologists : rampant coyote attacks .
“ Coyotes did n’t seem to be a problem when we started , ” said U.S. Geological Survey biologist Kristin Berry , a lead scientist in the project .
“ The question in the back of all of our minds now is this :
How could we have determined that this was going to happen ? ”
Advertisement
The California tortoise , whose population has fallen to an estimated 45,000 on the public lands in the western Mojave , is protected under state and federal endangered species acts .
In 2001 , Congress authorized Ft. Irwin to expand into prime tortoise habitat .
As mitigation , the Army agreed to move the tortoises from the expansion area onto unoccupied public lands , an effort that began in late March .
So far , at least 14 translocated adult tortoises and 14 resident tortoises in the area have been killed and eaten by coyotes , according to biologists monitoring survival rates of the reptiles , most of which were fitted with radio transmitters .
In a related problem , 15 of 70 baby tortoises collected at the training center as part of the relocation have died of various causes , Army officials said .
The problem , they say , may be linked to severe drought , which killed off plants and triggered a crash in rodent populations .
As a result , coyotes , which normally thrive on kangaroo rats and rabbits , are turning to the lumbering Gopherus agassizii for sustenance .

In an effort to prevent further losses , the Army has requested that the predators , described by one military spokesman as a “ rogue clan of coyotes , ” be eradicated by animal control sharpshooters .
The gunners , however , have been delayed for weeks by bureaucratic red tape , military officials said .
In the meantime , many translocated tortoises have shown a tendency to wander , sometimes for miles , often in a northward direction back toward the Army base .
Gashes and tooth marks on the shell of a translocated tortoise found April 15 indicated that it had been ripped out of the front of its carapace .
The Center for Biological Diversity , a Tucson - based environmental group , said it plans to file suit later this month against the Army , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management for allegedly violating the federal Endangered Species
Act in their management of desert tortoises .
Desert tortoises spend most of their lives underground .
Recent studies indicate that the creatures , which can live for a century , are extremely sensitive and have complex social lives .
Advertisement
Of particular concern , lawyers for the center say , was the Army ’s decision a month ago to move tortoises to areas where they would be vulnerable to potentially lethal threats .
The Army had been warned that numerous environmental studies expressed concern about vehicle traffic , drought - stricken foraging grounds , and resident tortoises suffering from infectious respiratory disease and predation by ravens , dogs and coyotes .
“ The deed is done , and now we are watching the aftermath , ” said Ilene Anderson , a biologist and spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity .
“ It ’s a disaster .
We ’ve lost so many tortoises -- the California state reptile and a species that has taken a nose dive over the past 20 years -- so early on in the project . ”
Michael Connor , a longtime advocate of the tortoise and California science director of the Western Watersheds Project , a nonprofit conservation group , was critical of the Army ’s plan to wipe out suspect coyotes .
“ These are n’t rogue coyotes .
They ’re just coyotes trying to make a living in the desert , ” Connor said .
“ Now they want to shoot them .
Fine .
But what happens if there are unforeseen implications from wiping out the region ’s top predator , like an explosion of rabbits and rats ? ”
Advertisement
Beyond that , he added , “ the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had identified canine attacks as possible threats even before the project got underway .
So I ’m surprised the scientists are surprised that tortoises are becoming targets . ”
In any case , William Boarman , an adjunct professor of biology at San Diego State who ’s helping direct the translocation project , said that after the Army decided to expand operations at Ft. Irwin , “ we were stuck with bad options : move the tortoises or leave them in place , which would have been much worse . ”
“ Translocation was always risky , ” he added .
“ We ’re trying to make it work the best we can , and conduct research that can help us make future translocations more effective . ”
In years to come , the Army plans to relocate an additional 1,200 tortoises from the western edge of the base to prevent them from being squashed by military equipment .

Field researchers said most of the predation has occurred in areas between the rugged Calico Mountains and desolate Coyote Dry Lake .
On a recent weekday morning , USGS field researcher Kevin Lucas strode across loose rock and cholla cactus in a sandy wash just north of the lake near where a hefty radio - collared male tortoise , variously known as “ No. 4164 " and “ Thor , ” relaxed in a patch of shade .
That tortoise was among the lucky ones .
“ There was another translocated tortoise I ’d really gotten to like , even admire , ” Lucas said .
“ He was a tremendous mountain climber with a can - do personality .

“ The last time I saw him , he was on a steep slope in howling winds and something did n’t look right , ” he recalled .
“ Through binoculars , I saw that his head and legs were missing .
A deep sadness came over me . ”

How to clean your computer keyboard
In this guide we will show you how to clean your keyboard thoroughly as well as how to give it a quick once over .
We will guide you through with the aid of photos and diagrams .
The first part is for keyboards that just need a quick clean and is also suitable for laptops , notebooks and netbooks .
The second part is for membrane keyboards ( most desktop keyboards ) and includes removing the keys for a thorough cleaning .
advertisement
To keep your keyboard in top condition the moderate cleaning could be done weekly and the more thorough cleaning could be done every 2 months .
What you will need :
Lint - free cloth .
Dry cloth or duster .
Suitable cleaning fluid ( isopropyl alcohol ) .
Cotton buds .
Can of compressed air or vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment .
Flat tip screwdriver ( optional for thorough clean ) .
Before you begin
Desktop computers
Laptops , notebooks and netbooks .
Moderate cleaning ( quick and easy )
If you have a can of compressed air then use it to carefully blow any debris from around and under the keys .
If you do not have any compressed air , then you can hover the brush attachment of a vacuum cleaner just above the keyboard to remove the dust .
Take one of the cotton buds and put a couple of drops of the cleaning fluid on one end of it ( never put fluid directly onto the keyboard ) .
If you do not have cleaning fluid then you can use some distilled water .
Use the cotton bud to clean the sides of the keys as seen in fig 1.1 below .
After cleaning the sides of the keys take your lint - free cloth and dampen it with your cleaning fluid .
Give the surface of the keyboard a good wipe over using the cloth to trace the contours of the keys ( see fig 1.2 below ) .
When you have finished give the keyboard a wipe over with the dry cloth / duster .
You should now have a nice clean keyboard , to clean it more thoroughly follow the guide below .
Thorough cleaning
To remove the keys , ease the tip of the screwdriver under the bottom edge and gently apply leverage until the key pops off .
You can see an example of this in fig 1.4 .
Once you have removed the first key , the neighbouring keys will be easier to access .
When you have removed all of the keys ( except any keys you wish to avoid ) use the compressed air or vacuum cleaner to remove any dust and debris from inside the keyboard .
Now is the time to give the keys a proper clean .
For best results clean each one individually with the cloth and cleaning fluid , when they are clean wipe them over with the dry cloth .
If they have very stubborn marks then soak them in a bowl of luke - warm water with a mild soap / detergent for several minutes .
Take your lint - free cloth and dampen it with your cleaning fluid .
Give the surface of the keyboard a good wipe over ensuring to clean as much as possible any keys that you have n't removed .
Once the keyboard surface is done we can replace the keys .
To put the keys back on , position the key in place and press gently but firmly until it clicks home .
Check their position according to your notes or photo .
If you have just removed the letter keys use fig 1.3 below as a guide .
After replacing all the keys give the keyboard a quick wipe over with your dry cloth and you have a nice clean keyboard .
Always ensure the keyboard is completely dry before it is plugged back in , or in the case of a wireless keyboard before the batteries are reinserted .
advertisement
If you have a wireless keyboard then remove the battery cover and take out the batteries .
If your keyboard has a cord , shutdown your PC , remove the mains plug and then unplug the keyboard .
Turn the keyboard upside down and run your fingers over the keys to release any trapped debris from inbetween the keys .
Shutdown the system and remove the power cord and any other devices which you may have connected .
If accessible , remove the battery cover and take the battery out .
To release any dust or debris from inbetween the keys , turn the device upside down and run your fingers across the keyboard .
Suitable for standard keyboards as well as laptops , notebooks and netbooks .
Standard keyboards only , not suitable for laptops , notebooks or netbooks .
This procedure takes time and requires patience as it involves removing the keys from the keyboard .
Although all of the keys can be removed , the larger keys ( space bar , enter key , shift keys , backspace , caps lock , etc ) can be difficult to put back so you may want to avoid removing them .
If you do want to remove all of the keys then make a note of their position , or better still , take a quick photo of the keyboard to use as a reference .
Alternatively , just remove the letter keysfrom the keyboard which is where the most of the dust / debris will be , and refer tobelow as a guide to put them back .
The Pentagon military analyst program unveiled in last week 's exposé by David Barstow in the New York Times was not just unethical but illegal .
It violates , for starters , specific restrictions that Congress has been placing in its annual appropriation bills every year since 1951 .
According to those restrictions , " No part of any appropriation contained in this or any other Act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States not heretofore authorized by the Congress . "
As explained in a March 21 , 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service , " publicity or propaganda " is defined by the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) to mean either ( 1 ) self - aggrandizement by public officials , ( 2 ) purely partisan activity , or ( 3 ) " covert propaganda . "
By covert propaganda , GAO means information which originates from the government but is unattributed and made to appear as though it came from a third party .
These concerns about " covert propaganda " were also the basis for the GAO 's strong standard for determining when government - funded video news releases are illegal :
The failure of an agency to identify itself as the source of a prepackaged news story misleads the viewing public by encouraging the viewing audience to believe that the broadcasting news organization developed the information .
The prepackaged news stories are purposefully designed to be indistinguishable from news segments broadcast to the public .
When the television viewing public does not know that the stories they watched on television news programs about the government were in fact prepared by the government , the stories are , in this sense , no longer purely factual -- the essential fact of attribution is missing .
In a related analysis , the GAO explained that " The publicity or propaganda restriction helps to mark the boundary between an agency making information available to the public and agencies creating news reports unbeknownst to the receiving audience . "
In case anyone disagrees with the GAO on this point , here 's what the White House 's own Office of Legal Council had to say , in a memorandum written in 2005 following the controversy over the Armstrong Williams scandal ( when it was discovered that the Bush administration had actually paid him to publicly endorse its No Child Left Behind Law ) :
Over the years , GAO has interpreted " publicity or propaganda " restrictions to preclude use of appropriated funds for , among other things , so - called " covert propaganda . " ...
Consistent with that view , OLC determined in 1988 that a statutory prohibition on using appropriated funds for " publicity or propaganda " precluded undisclosed agency funding of advocacy by third - party groups .
We stated that " covert attempts to mold opinion through the undisclosed use of third parties " would run afoul of restrictions on using appropriated funds for " propaganda . " ( emphasis added )
The key passage here is the phrase , " covert attempts to mold opinion through the undisclosed use of third parties . "
As the Times report documented in detail , the Pentagon 's military analyst program did exactly that .
It was covert .
As Barstow 's piece states , the 75 retired military officers who were recruited by Donald Rumsfeld and given talking points to deliver on Fox , CNN , ABC , NBC , CBS and MSNBC were given extraordinary access to White House and Pentagon officials .
However , " The access came with a condition .
Participants were instructed not to quote their briefers directly or otherwise describe their contacts with the Pentagon . "
It was an attempt to mold opinion .
According to the Pentagon 's own internal documents ( which can be downloaded and viewed from the New York Times website ) , the military analysts were considered " message force multipliers " or " surrogates " who would deliver administration " themes and messages " to millions of Americans " in the form of their own opinions . "
According to one participating military analyst , it was " psyops on steroids . "
It was done " through the undisclosed use of third parties . "
In their television appearances , the military analysts did not disclose their ties to the White House , let alone that they were its surrogates .
The military analysts were used as puppets for the Pentagon .
In the words of Robert S. Bevelacqua , a retired Green Beret and for Fox News military analyst , " It was them saying , ' We need to stick our hands up your back and move your mouth for you . "
Additional evidence of the illegality of the Pentagon pundits operation can be found in the February 1 , 1988 memorandum mentioned above by the White House Office of Legal Council .
That memorandum , titled " Legal Constraints on Lobbying Efforts in Support of Contra Aid and Ratification of the INF Treaty , " was written for the Reagan administration by the well - known conservative lawyer Charles Cooper ( then head of the OLC ) , explaining the limits of what the White House was allowed to do in its campaign to win support for the Contra War in Nicaragua .
Cooper ( clearly not some liberal naysayer with an anti-war ax to grind ) , wrote that the Reagan Administration " can make available to private groups , upon request , printed materials that explain and justify the Administration 's position on Contra aid .
These materials must be items that were created in the normal course of business and not specifically produced for use by these private groups . "
Cooper continues :
It would be unwise , however , for the Administration to solicit the media to print articles by or interviews with anyone not serving in the government .
And , of course , the Administration cannot assist in the preparation of any articles or statements by private sector supporters , other than through the provision of informational materials as described in the preceding paragraph .
In the case of the current Pentagon pundit scandal , however , the Pentagon clearly was assisting in the preparation both of articles and statements by private sector supporters .
It did not simply provide " informational materials " that had been " created in the normal course of business . "
Rather , it sat down with the retired military analysts , worked closely with them on drafting talking points , and in some cases scripted language for them to write in written commentaries , and deployed them as message amplifiers and surrogates without disclosure .
The target is you
A tantalizing window into Donald Rumsfeld 's motives for creating the military analysts program can be find in a transcript that the Times obtained of one of his meetings with them .
In it , he complains that he has been warned that his " information operations " are " illegal or immoral " :
This is the first war that 's ever been run in the 21sth Century in a time of 24 - hour news and bloggers and internets and emails and digital cameras and Sony cams and God knows all this stuff .
...
We 're not very skillful at it in terms of the media part of the new realities we 're living in .
Every time we try to do something someone says it 's illegal or immoral , there 's nothing the press would rather do than write about the press , we all know that .
They fall in love with it .
So every time someone tries to do some information operations for some public diplomacy or something , they say oh my goodness , it 's multiple audiences and if you 're talking to them , they 're hearing you here as well and therefore that 's propagandizing or something .
This comment shows that Rumsfeld knows about the law against information operations that propagandize U.S. audiences .
Although it is illegal to target propaganda at the America people , the law does not forbid propaganda -- even covert propaganda -- aimed at foreign audiences .
Rumsfeld has been warned , however , that in today 's world with " bloggers and internets and emails , " even information operations overseas reach " multiple audiences " including U.S. citizens who are " hearing you here as well and therefore that 's propagandizing . "
The irony , of course , is that Rumsfeld made these comments in a meeting with military analysts whom he had recruited specifically for information operations targeting U.S. audiences .
If Rumsfeld knew that there were legal concerns even about operations targeted at foreign audiences , he certainly knew that it was illegal to target the American public .
Yet he went ahead and did it anyway , and in another part of the transcript , he explained why .
In fighting the war on terror , Rumsfeld said , the " center of gravity 's here in Washington and in the United States . "
The term " center of gravity " in this context refers to a concept in military theory .
According to the U.S. Department of Defense , it means " those characteristics , capabilities , or locations from which a military force derives its freedom of action , physical strength , or will to fight . "
What Rumsfeld is saying , therefore , is that the most important battle in his war is not the struggle to control Iraq or defeat foreign terrorists .
The most important battle , he 's saying , is the fight to control the hearts and minds of the American people .
And that 's why he 's willing to break the law to do it .
What is to be done ?
Of course , the mere fact that a practice is illegal does not mean that anyone is going to be punished for breaking the law .
For that to happen , someone with the power to act needs to enforce the law , which is why Congress needs to hold hearings and create enforcement mechanisms that will ensure compliance in the future .
Currently , no such mechanisms exist .
As the Congressional Research Service noted in its 2005 report , " No federal entity is required to monitor agency compliance with the publicity and propaganda statutes .
At present , the federal government has what has been termed ' fire alarm oversight ' of agency expenditures on communications .
Scrutiny typically occurs when a Member of Congress is alerted by the media or some other source that an agency ’s spending on communications may be cause for concern .
A Member then sends a written request to the Government Accountability Office asking for a legal opinion on the activities in question . "
Congress should certainly seek such a legal opinion from the GAO and the White House Office of Legal Council regarding the Pentagon 's military analyst program , but this time it should n't stop at simply seeking an opinion .
When the GAO has rendered such legal opinions previously , the government agencies caught violating the law have announced that they would comply in the future .
No one was punished , however , and in practice they knew that they could continue doing what they want .
That is what happened after the Reagan administration was caught using third - party surrogates to promote the Contra war in Nicaragua in the 1980s ( which is how Charles Cooper ended up writing the memo I quoted above ) .
It 's what happened after the Armstrong Williams scandal broke in 2004 .
And without something more than mere publication of a GAO opinion , it 's probably all that will happen as a result of this latest Pentagon pundits scandal .
It does n't have to be this way .
If the U.S. Congress had the will to take action , it could create real mechanisms for enforcing the law and ensuring compliance .
This is important for reasons that go beyond the issue of whether anyone supports or opposes the current war in Iraq .
So long as government agencies are allowed to continue getting away with covert domestic propaganda , the public is left unable to know whether the opinions of " independent " analysts are truly independent .
During the Vietnam War , official Pentagon statements became so mistrusted that the term " credibility gap " was coined to describe the distance between official statements and public perceptions .
The government 's use of " surrogates " posing as independent experts extends the credibility gap not just to public officials but also to seemingly independent , private citizens and the news media .
Until accountability exists to prevent abuses like Pentagon analyst program from continuing with impunity , the public will have to assume that anyone who appears on camera espousing views sympathetic to the White House ( or , for that matter , to other government agencies ) has been secretly trained , recruited and given financial incentives to do so .

I ’m not naive — I understand that there are severe hardships in store the longer the price of a barrel of oil soars ever higher .
But here ’s the thing .
Every time I pass by my local gas station and see the numbers a couple cents higher than the day before , I smile .
For some that might seem odd — and for those that depend on cheap oil , my sentiments are with you .
Unfortunately for all of us , those unaffected and those in dire straits , this had to happen .
As someone who champions sustainability day in and out , writes about political hangups to change America ’s dependency on oil , and laments our lack of investment in renewable energies , this is a blessing in disguise .
My only hope is that this continues — and is less of a “ rubberband effect ” we all experienced in the wake of Hurricane Katrina three years ago .
Why ?
Because if we are to shift to an economy that is truly self - sufficient and sustainable , we have to be hit hard collectively in the wallets .
It ’s the only way .
As environmentalists , we can release movies , write articles , hold rallies , and buy all the green products in the world — but to to truly bear witness to real change , it has to come from those not directly involved .
In other words , everyone must be faced with a burden .
For some , climate change might be their burden and buying a hybrid vehicle or biking to work might be the solution .
For others , higher gas prices which affect the bottom line might be their burden .
In the end , what matters most is that it is a common hardship .
Whatever the personal impact , the demanded outcome will be in unison .
Back in December 2005 — when the price of a barrel of oil was a staggering $ 70 —
Wired magazine wrote an article titled “ Why $ 5 Gas Is Good For America “ .
Here ’s a highlight :
“ So what ’s a price - shocked , carbon - afflicted highway jockey to do ?
Keep driving .
In fact , drive more .
The longer gas stays expensive , the higher the chance we ’ll see alternatives .
Put that pedal to the metal .
And smile when you see a big black $ 3 or $ 4 out in front at the gas pump .
Those innovators need all the encouragement they can get .
Shale oil , uranium , sunlight – there ’s enough energy out there for a dozen planets .
Where we ’ll all park is another matter . ”
And Ladies and Gentlemen , that should be the moral of the story .
Sure , we went through this BS back in the 70s — but I ’m not sure if the world was ready technologically or even mentally to embrace alternatives .
Although , I will concede that watching Jack Nicholson drive around in a hydrogen - powered car makes me wonder indefinite “ what ifs ” had we embraced the future 30 years ago .
Alas .
So , to those gritting their teeth over what ’s happening at the pump , hang on .
Remember , we ’re all in this together .
From the guy with the Suburban in his driveway , to the woman who rides a bike to work but faces higher food prices .
The greatest thing to look forward to in times of strife is the eventual change .
And it will come .
The days of $ 1 / $ 2 gas are well behind us .
The time now is to innovate and recognize the flaws in a society so dependent on cheap gasoline .
And here ’s one more sobering thought :
No matter how bad you think it is now , it could ( and may one day soon ) be much worse .
In fact , in a recent survey of a 155 countries , the US was ranked as the 45th cheapest — even with the average around $ 3.45 / gallon .
Think you ’re hurting ?
It ’s $ 8 a gallon across much of Europe , $ 12.03 in Aruba and $ 18.42 in Sierra Leone .
This alone should give you reason to smile as you drive by the gas station .
I know I will be .
Five years after “ mission accomplished , ” sharp rise in Iraqi and US casualties
By Bill Van Auken
2 May 2008
May 1 marked the fifth anniversary of the infamous “ mission accomplished ” speech delivered by President George W. Bush aboard a US aircraft carrier .
Five years after what Bush proclaimed to be the end of “ major combat operations ” in Iraq , US casualties have reached a seven - month high , while the Iraqi death toll continues to mount .
In April , 52 US troops were killed in Iraq , the highest number since last September .
The bulk of the casualties came in Baghdad , mostly in the crowded Shia slum neighborhoods of Sadr City .
The sharp rise in US dead and wounded , and the far greater death and destruction being inflicted on Iraqi civilians , is the result of a month - old offensive launched by US and Iraqi puppet forces against the Mahdi Army , the militia loyal to nationalist Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
Citing “ security officials , ” Agence France - Presse said that 1,073 Iraqis were killed last month .
This is undoubtedly a gross underestimation of the real death toll .
One hospital alone in Sadr City reported taking in 400 bodies .
The two major hospitals in the area , which is home to more than 2 million people , said that they had received nearly 2,500 wounded .
The medical facilities are overwhelmed with the number of casualties .
They report that they lack sufficient numbers of severe trauma specialists to treat the wounded and are running low on basic supplies , including clean water .
“ The situation is very critical and unstable , ” Abbas Owaid , director - general of Fatima al - Zahra hospital told the United Nations news agency IRIN .
“ There is still a pressing need for bandages , pain killers , syringes and other first aid materials .
Blood is available as there are people who donate , but we still need more as there are injuries . ”
Owaid said that ambulances were coming under attack and that patients and staff alike were prevented from reaching his hospital because US - backed Iraqi forces had taken up positions nearby .
A senior military official at the Pentagon used a press briefing Wednesday to assert that the sharp climb in casualties did not indicate an unraveling of the US “ surge , ” the escalation of the American intervention that sent another 30,000 troops into the occupied country last year .
“ While it is sad to see an increase in casualties , again , I do n’t think it is necessarily indicative of a major change in the operating environment , at least from the US perspective , ” said Lt. Gen .
Carter Ham , director for operations of the military ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff .
He added , “ When the level of fighting increases , then , sadly , the level of casualties does tend to rise . ”
He stressed that the US military had never made a decline in casualties “ The measure of how things are progressing in Iraq . ”
On the contrary , both the Pentagon and the White House were until recently lauding the relative decline in the carnage against the Iraqi people and the reduced number of US soldiers killed in action as proof of the “ surge ’s ” success .
Now , the US military is providing daily body counts in which it invariably describes all those killed as “ criminals ” and “ terrorists . ”
Hospitals receiving the victims , however , report that the bulk of them are civilians , including large numbers of women and children .
The military has been ordered to achieve a political objective deemed crucial for rescuing Washington ’s faltering attempt to impose colonial domination over the oil - rich country .
It is to take on and defeat the Mahdi Army and thereby weaken the Sadrists , who have voiced opposition to both the US occupation and the bid to open up Iraq ’s oil reserves to exploitation by US - based energy conglomerates .
The aim is to complete this task before October provincial elections , which Sadr ’s followers would otherwise be expected to win in the key southern provinces that contain the bulk of Iraq ’s oil assets .
To carry out this task , Washington is prepared to spill as much Iraqi blood as it takes , and to accept a sizeable increase in American casualties as well .
One result has been a steady increase in the number of flag - draped coffins returning to towns and cities across America .
The news of these individual tragedies is confined to the local media , with the real cost of this criminal war largely concealed from the American people .
Among those who last month lost their lives in the five - year - old war to conquer Iraq were the following :
* Army Specialist David P. McCormick , 26 , who died as a result of wounds suffered in a rocket attack April 28 .
The soldier ’s longtime friend and minister , Mike Zimmerman , described him as “ a pretty quiet person , ” who was “ looking forward to getting out ” and wanted to go to college for business administration .
* Air Force Technical Sergeant Anthony Capra , 31 , who died April 9 from wounds inflicted by a roadside bomb .
Capra , who is survived by a wife and five children , was serving his fourth tour of duty in Iraq .
* Sergeant Jesse Ault , a national guardsman from Virginia , who died April 9 from wounds resulting from an improvised explosive device ( IED ) .
He had left the guard , but when his wife , also a guard member , was recalled for a second tour in Iraq , he re-enlisted in order to take her place and allow her to stay with their children .
“ I ’ve got to do what ’s best for my family , ” he told his father .
* Army Sergeant Shaun Paul Tousha , 30 , who was killed by an IED on April 9 .
He was the 100th military fatality from the Houston , Texas area .
His sister Becky , reflecting on the mounting death toll , told the Houston Chronicle , “ I think they ought to bring our boys home and call it quits . ”
* Jacob Fairbanks , 22 , of St. Paul , Minnesota , who died in Iraq on April 9 .
He had been sent back for a 15 - month tour shortly after he and his wife , Dwan , had a new baby .
Dwan told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he had been plagued by a feeling of dread .
“ What if I do n’t come back this time ? ” he told her .
The Pentagon listed the cause of death as a self - inflicted gunshot wound .
* Staff Sergeant Jeremiah McNeal , 23 , of the Virginia National Guard , who died April 6 from wounds caused by an IED .
“ He joined the National Guard soon after [ high school ] graduation to support his mother and three younger siblings , ” the Virginian Pilot reported .
“ He was not just another number , ” his wife Nikita told the media .
* Private Fist Class Shane Penley , 19 , who was killed April 6 by a sniper ’s bullet just short of a year after graduating from Bloom Trail High School in Illinois .
According to the local newspaper , the Southtown Star , he “ joined the Army because he was frustrated trying to find a good job ” after waiting on tables in a local restaurant .
His three sisters , the paper reported , had tried to talk him out of enlisting .
* Major Stuart Wolfer , 36 , who was killed in an April 6 rocket attack on the fortified Green Zone , where the US Embassy and Iraqi government buildings are located .
He is survived by a wife and three children .
When Representative Robert Wexler ( Democrat of Florida ) invited his constituents to submit questions for last month ’s congressional testimony by the US Iraq war commander , General David Petraeus , Len Wolfer , the soldier ’s father , requested that he ask Petraeus , “ “ For what ?
For what had he lost his son ? ”
The names of the victims of American Hellfire missiles , bombs and machine gun fire in the crowded streets of Sadr City are for the most part unknown outside of Iraq , and are far more numerous .
Thanks to a wrenching Associated Press photograph , the identity of one has been publicized .
He is Ali Hussein , aged two .
A photographer captured the image of his lifeless , chalk - covered body being lifted from the rubble of his home , which had been destroyed in a US rocket attack .
Mouth agape and limbs hanging limp , the little boy wore a T - shirt , blood - stained shorts and a child ’s sandals .
As these crimes continued to unfold , the White House took the occasion of the fifth anniversary of Bush ’s “ mission accomplished ” speech to invent a new defense of the American president ’s grotesquely unfounded assessment of the situation in Iraq .
In what was obviously a scripted remark aimed at preempting inevitable media references to the anniversary , White House Press Secretary Dana Perino told a news conference : “ President Bush is well aware that the banner should have been much more specific and said ‘ mission accomplished ’ for these sailors who are on this ship on their mission .
And we have certainly paid a price for not being more specific on that banner . ”
This is , of course , all nonsense .
The banner , together with Bush ’s tailhook landing on the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln and his strutting before the cameras in a pilot ’s flight suit , were all carefully choreographed to sell the success of the Iraq war and American militarism to the public .
The banner itself was produced by a private contractor with White House assistance .
The remarks made by Bush on that occasion were fully in keeping with the two - word slogan .
“ In the battle of Iraq , the United States and our allies have prevailed , ” he told his captive audience of sailors .
“ And now our coalition is engaged in securing and reconstructing that country . ”
Moreover , barely one month later , he used the same words emblazoned on the banner in a speech to US troops in Qatar .
“ America sent you on a mission to remove a grave threat and to liberate an oppressed people , ” he said , “ and that mission has been accomplished . ”
At that point , the Bush administration and most of the American ruling elite believed they would be able to quickly solidify their grip over Iraq , install a puppet regime and use the country ’s oil wealth to pay for the war and strengthen US capitalism .
At the time , the World Socialist Web Site foresaw that there would be no such easy road for US imperialism ’s colonial - style venture in Iraq .
“ In reality , of course , the killing is far from over , ” the WSWS stated on May 2 , 2003 .
“ Pentagon officials acknowledge that there is no prospect of reducing the current number of US troops in Iraq — close to 140,000 — for years to come .
There is , in short , no ‘ exit strategy , ’ but rather a plan for permanent colonial occupation .
“ Some of the greatest US war crimes lie ahead as Washington attempts to suppress popular opposition to its imposition of a puppet regime to rule the Iraqi people in the interests of the US oil companies , banks and corporations . ”
This warning has been tragically confirmed .
Close to 97 percent of US casualties have been suffered since Bush delivered his speech , while the bloodbath suffered by the Iraqi people over the same period has dwarfed the considerable carnage inflicted during the “ shock and awe ” stage of the US invasion .
According to the best demographic estimates , at least a million Iraqi lives have been lost as a result of the US intervention .
Engineering might be regarded as the process of production of working technology in the absence of complete knowledge - the strategies for managing the unknown , and applying what we do know with rigor and to good effect .
Bridge building and large - scale construction came to a fair and effective maturity long before the scientific , mathematical and computation tools that enabled rigorous models and full understanding of the underlying principles , for example .
So too with medicine : it is an engineering discipline aiming for the best possible results with the information we have right now .
More information is better - bridge building was greatly improved through the development of those mathematical and computational tools - but we do n't need to know everything to make significant progress .
We just need to know enough ; I think that the history of medicine to date amply demonstrates that maxim .
You can find the argument that we know enough now , today , to make significant progress in repairing the damage of aging at the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence section of the Methuselah Foundation website , and the details backing up that argument in the book Ending Aging .
The short of it : aging is the consequences of an accumulation of a small number of different types of cellular and molecular damage throughout the body .
Scientists know what those forms of damage are , and have good ideas as to how to proceed with repair or removal .
In some cases , that repair has already been demonstrated in the laboratory .
The biggest problem I see today for the future of longevity science is that the bulk of the aging and longevity research and development community is not focused on goals in medicine and engineering near - term therapies of rejuvenation .
There is no urgency and directed purpose analogous to that in the cancer research and development commmunity .
The community is instead mostly focused on observation and complete understanding of biochemical changes with aging .
This state of affairs is much as if we lived beside a great chasm , but instead of engineering bridges for the benefit of all , we held off any such work until the full modern science and understanding of architecture was developed .
Waiting too long has costs .
In longevity science , waiting is measured in millions of lives lost with each passing month .
Here 's a good example of the sort of productive research that takes place in the mainstream of aging science :
The major cell signaling pathways , and their specific mechanisms of transduction , have been a subject of investigation for many years .
As our understanding of these pathways advances , we find that they are evolutionarily well - conserved not only individually , but also at the level of their crosstalk and signal integration .
Productive interactions within the key signal transduction networks determine success in embryonic organogenesis , and postnatal tissue repair throughout adulthood .
However , aside from clues revealed through examining age - related degenerative diseases , much remains uncertain about imbalances within these pathways during normal aging .
Further , little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which alterations in the major cell signal transduction networks cause age - related pathologies .
The aim of this review is to describe the complex interplay between the Notch , TGFbeta , WNT , RTK - Ras and Hh signaling pathways , with a specific focus on the changes introduced within these networks by the aging process , and those typical of age - associated human pathologies .
Is this important and useful ?
Yes , of course , very much so .
Is this knowledge necessary for us to proceed to reverse and repair aging ?
No .
We already know what the damage of aging is , at the cellular and molecular level .
Knowing more about the way in which that damage twists our metabolism and controlling biochemistry will help , in the same way that modern techniques of architecture improve bridge building , but the absence of that knowledge does not hold back significant advances in the engineering of healthy longevity .
The only present barriers hindering rapid and aggressive progress towards rejuvenation of the aged are those of will and funding .
That is why we can all help to make a difference to the future of aging science - you do n't have to be a scientist to help make will and funding a reality .
Your parents always told you candy would give you cavities .
But what if you could satisfy your sweet tooth with something that 's actually good for your teeth ?
Now you can , thanks to UCLA microbiologist Wenyuan Shi , who 's just invented a sugar - free lollipop that contains a licorice root extract ( Glycyrrhiza uralensis ) which naturally targets and kills the bacteria that cause tooth decay .
" This was particularly charming because in both Chinese and in Western cultures , people have been chewing it maybe for the taste , but it also has a lot of good health reasons .
It stimulates saliva flows , has anti-bacterial properties and keeps bacteria from adhering to your teeth , " Professor Shi told The Future of Things .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
And these lollipops do n't just help your teeth stay super - white : Professor
Shi claims the licorice extract can also help prevent strep throat and stomach ulcers , which means they 're really not just for kids .
For optimal cavity - fighting power , Professor Shi recommends eating two lollipops a day for a ten - day period , and two to four a year from then on ( though if you love the flavor , have as many as you like â€ “ no harm done ) .
We 've got a hunch that parents and other cavity - prone people will be raiding the stores for these super - powered sweets â€ “ and that dentists the world over will soon be cursing the name of Professor Shi .
I wo n’t make any comment on this finding from the latest Washington Post / ABC News poll because the thing speaks for itself — and it should be speaking to superdelegates :
Lost in the Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign ’s aggressive attacks on Barack Obama in recent days is a deep and enduring problem that threatens to undercut any inroads Clinton has made in her struggle to overtake him in the Democratic presidential race :
She has lost trust among voters , a majority of whom now view her as dishonest .
Her advisers ’ efforts to deal with the problem — by having her acknowledge her mistakes and crack self - deprecating jokes — do not seem to have succeeded .
Privately , the aides admit that the recent controversy over her claim to have ducked sniper fire on a trip to Bosnia probably made things worse .
Clinton is viewed as “ honest and trustworthy ” by just 39 percent of Americans , according to a new Washington Post - ABC News poll , compared with 52 percent in May 2006 .
Nearly six in 10 said in the new poll that she is not honest and trustworthy .
And now , compared with Obama , Clinton has a deep trust deficit among Democrats , trailing him by 23 points as the more honest , an area on which she once led both Obama and John Edwards .
But it has n’t happened this time : all through the period of the alleged bubble , inventories have remained at more or less normal levels .
This tells us that the rise in oil prices is n’t the result of runaway speculation ; it ’s the result of fundamental factors , mainly the growing difficulty of finding oil and the rapid growth of emerging economies like China .
The rise in oil prices these past few years had to happen to keep demand growth from exceeding supply growth .
Saying that high - priced oil is n’t a bubble does n’t mean that oil prices will never decline .
I would n’t be shocked if a pullback in demand , driven by delayed effects of high prices , sends the price of crude back below $ 100 for a while .
But it does mean that speculators are n’t at the heart of the story .
Why , then , do we keep hearing assertions that they are ?
Part of the answer may be the undoubted fact that many people are now investing in oil futures  which feeds suspicion that speculators are running the show , even though there ’s no good evidence that prices have gotten out of line .
But there ’s also a political component .
Traditionally , denunciations of speculators come from the left of the political spectrum .
In the case of oil prices , however , the most vociferous proponents of the view that it ’s all the speculators ’ fault have been conservatives  people whom you would n’t normally expect to see warning about the nefarious activities of investment banks and hedge funds .
The explanation of this seeming paradox is that wishful thinking has trumped pro-market ideology .
After all , a realistic view of what ’s happened over the past few years suggests that we ’re heading into an era of increasingly scarce , costly oil .
The consequences of that scarcity probably wo n’t be apocalyptic :
France consumes only half as much oil per capita as America , yet the last time I looked , Paris was n’t a howling wasteland .
But the odds are that we ’re looking at a future in which energy conservation becomes increasingly important , in which many people may even  gasp  take public transit to work .
Many people have expressed outrage at NSPD - 51 -- a presidential directive that gives Bush dictatorial powers in the event of a national emergency .
For example , well - known conservative writer Jerome Corsi writes :
President Bush , without so much as issuing a press statement , on May 9 signed a directive that granted near dictatorial powers to the office of the president in the event of a national emergency declared by the president .
The " National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive , " with the dual designation of NSPD - 51 , as a National Security Presidential Directive , and HSPD - 20 , as a Homeland Security Presidential Directive , establishes under the office of president a new National Continuity Coordinator .
That job , as the document describes , is to make plans for " National Essential Functions " of all federal , state , local , territorial , and tribal governments , as well as private sector organizations to continue functioning under the president 's directives in the event of a national emergency .
The directive loosely defines " catastrophic emergency " as " any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government functions . "
When the president determines a catastrophic emergency has occurred , the president can take over all government functions and direct all private sector activities to ensure we will emerge from the emergency with an " enduring constitutional government . "
Translated into layman 's terms , when the president determines a national emergency has occurred , the president can declare to the office of the presidency powers usually assumed by dictators to direct any and all government and business activities until the emergency is declared over .
Ironically , the directive sees no contradiction in the assumption of dictatorial powers by the president with the goal of maintaining constitutional continuity through an emergency .
The directive specifies that the assistant to the president for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism will be designated as the National Continuity Coordinator .
Further established is a Continuity Policy Coordination Committee , chaired by a senior director from the Homeland Security Council staff , designated by the National Continuity Coordinator , to be " the main day - to - day forum for such policy coordination . "
***
A Congressional Research Service study notes that under the National Emergency Act , the president " may seize property , organize and control the means of production , seize commodities , assign military forces abroad , institute martial law , seize and control all transportation and communication , regulate the operation of private enterprise , restrict travel , and , in a variety of ways , control the lives of United States citizens . "
***
NSPD - 51 / HSPD - 20 appears to supersede the National Emergency Act by creating the new position of National Continuity Coordinator [ within the White House ] without any specific act of Congress authorizing the position .
( CNN ) --
The military is investigating a " shocking and deplorable " YouTube video that seems to show a Marine throwing a puppy off a rocky cliff .
YouTube.com removed the video for violating the Web site 's terms of use .
The black - and - white puppy makes a yelping sound as it flies through the air .
" That 's mean , that was mean , " one companion says off - camera , addressing the alleged puppy thrower by his last name .
The fate of the animal is not known .
The Marine is identified on the video and in other Internet postings as a lance corporal stationed at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe .
It 's not clear where the video was shot , although the man who appears to throw the puppy and another Marine are in full combat gear with helmets .
YouTube.com had taken down the video by 12:30 p.m. ET Tuesday " due to terms of use violation , " according to a banner on the Web site .
" This is a shocking and deplorable video that is contrary to the high standards that we set for every Marine , " Marine Corps spokesman Maj .
Chris Perrine said at a news conference Monday night .

" We will investigate this and take appropriate actions , " Perrine said .
Watch other Marines and civilians react to the video »
He said the Marine is being kept safe in view of the anger over the alleged incident .
Perrine added that the majority of Marines conduct themselves honorably .
" There are many examples of Marines who adopt pets and bring them back from Iraq and demonstrate their compassion on a daily basis , " he said .
If the video is deemed legitimate , the lance corporal could face a charge of conduct unbecoming a Marine , Perrine said .
There could be administrative action , nonjudicial punishment or a court - martial , he added .
" It 's all governed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice , and anything from reduction in pay to reduction in rank to confinement to discharge from the Marine Corps " is possible , Perrine said .
If others are involved , they too will be disciplined , he said .
" Certainly , there 's a lot of outrage , and a lot of people are upset about it .
I think every Marine is upset about this video , " he said .
" We hope that it turns out not to be what it looks like . "

Siegelman petitions court to throw out conviction The Associated Press
Published : Thursday May 22 , 2008
|
Print This Email This By BOB JOHNSON MONTGOMERY , Ala . - Former Alabama Gov.
Don Siegelman asked a federal appeals court Thursday to overturn his conviction in a government corruption case .
In an 84 - page motion , Siegelman 's attorneys asked the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to order the former Democratic governor acquitted of all charges or grant him a new trial .
Siegelman and former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy were convicted in June 2006 of bribery and other charges .
Scrushy is scheduled to file his appeal brief with the 11th Circuit by June 2 .
Siegelman was accused of appointing Scrushy to a hospital regulatory board in exchange for Scrushy arranging $ 500,000 in donations to Siegelman 's campaign for a lottery .
During the trial , former Siegelman aide Nick Bailey testified that Siegelman and Scrushy met privately in the governor 's office in the summer of 1999 and afterward the governor told him Scrushy wanted to be appointed to the Certificate of Need Review Board .
Bailey said in exchange , Siegelman wanted a contribution to the lottery campaign .
In the brief , attorneys argue that Bailey did not attend the meeting between Scrushy and Siegelman and that prosecutors never proved there was an explicit agreement between the two men connecting the board appointment to the contributions .
The brief also argues that U.S. District Judge William Fuller did not tell jurors such an agreement must be proven in a federal bribery case .
" Bailey confirmed that he did not have firsthand knowledge of anything that Governor Siegelman and Scrushy said to each other , " the brief said .
" The existence of an explicit agreement cannot be inferred from the fact that Governor Siegelman and Scrushy met . "
Siegelman spent nine months in federal prison before the 11th Circuit ordered him released on an appeal bond in March .
Siegelman told the Associated Press Thursday he has been working with his attorneys on the appeal since he walked out of the federal prison in Oakdale , La .
" When I was in prison I never lost faith .
Now that my freedom rests with the Court of Appeals my faith in the system is stronger than ever , " the former governor said .
" I 've done nothing else over the last 21 days , but focus solely on reading briefs and going back and forth talking with my lawyers .
It was a huge help for me to be out of prison , " Siegelman said .
Scrushy , who was sentenced to almost seven years in prison , continues to be held at a federal prison in Beaumont , Texas .
Chief prosecutor Louis Franklin said the government would file a response in 60 days .
" The only comment I can make is that we will leave it to 11th Circuit to decide these issues , " Franklin said .
Siegelman 's lead attorney , Vince Kilborn of Mobile , said he believes Siegelman was convicted for participating in legal political activities .
" We 've presented what we believe are compelling and persuasive reasons why the governor 's conviction should be set aside , " Kilborn said .
Kilborn said the brief includes arguments about " what proof is needed in a political setting to criminalize what is normal and acceptable conduct where a contributor gives to an issue like a lottery . "
In the brief , Siegelman 's attorneys ask the 11th Circuit judges to hear oral arguments .
The appellate justices had earlier indicated they expect to hold oral arguments once all briefs have been submitted from attorneys for Siegelman and Scrushy and from prosecutors .
Not the end of history after all
By Paul Reynolds
World affairs correspondent BBC News website
John McCain delivers 26 March speech on foreign policy History did not end after all , apparently .
Instead , it has resumed , in a rather nasty fashion .
Or so it is said .
You remember the claim , from American neo-conservative thinker Francis Fukuyama as the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War ended : " What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War , or the passing of a particular period of post - war history , but the end of history as such ...
That is , the end point of mankind 's ideological evolution and the universalisation of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government . "
Even at the time , the " end of history " seemed little more than an enticing phrase .
The return Now along comes another of the old neo-cons , Robert Kagan , who admits in a new book that history did not quite work out like that .
In " The Return of History and the End of Dreams " he says : " History has returned and the peoples of the liberal world need to choose to shape it or let others shape it for them . "
Kagan dismisses his colleague 's satisfied pronouncement : " The world was not witnessing a transformation , however , merely a pause in the endless competition of nations and peoples .
Nationalism , far from being weakened by globalisation has now returned with a vengeance . "
In particular he identifies autocracy as the new menace and singles out Russia and China .
" The autocracies of Russia and China have figured out how to permit open economic activity while suppressing political activity .
They have seen that people making money will keep their noses out of politics , especially if they know their noses will be cut off . "
He portrays the modern world as one of " global competition " .
" It may not come to war , " he remarks alarmingly , " but the global competition between liberal and autocratic governments will likely intensify in coming years . "
McCain Robert Kagan is an adviser to Senator John McCain and his idea that the United States should continue to take a strong , and possibly a confrontational , role in world affairs accords with McCain 's own views .
Kagan 's brother Frederick was instrumental in persuading President Bush to reinforce US forces in Iraq with last year 's " surge " , against the advice of the Iraq Study Group of " wise men " at the time .
The surge was and is a policy supported by John McCain and one of the reasons for his political success .
However , John McCain is not a neo - conservative nor , he says , a unilateralist .
Instead , in a speech on foreign policy on 26 March , he called himself a " realistic idealist " , the definition of which remains to be seen .
But he did single out Russia and China , much as Robert Kagan is doing .
He called Russia " revanchist " , which posed " dangers " , and China " a central challenge for the next American president " .
The signs are that a McCain presidency would see the world , if not with the ideology which informs the Bush administration 's policies , then with a robustness that might turn out not to be so different .
McCain 's speech was full of the language of engagement - but only with America 's friends , not its opponents .
" We cannot build an enduring peace based on freedom by ourselves , and we do not want to , " Mr McCain said .
" We have to strengthen our global alliances as the core of a new global compact . "
Why do they see a threat in China ?
Corelli Barnett According to Elisabeth Bumiller of the New York Times , there is a struggle going on for influence over McCain between the " pragmatists , some of whom have come to view the Iraq war or its execution as a mistake ... ( and ) a competing camp , the neo- conservatives , whose thinking dominated President George W Bush 's first term ... "
The critics Critics are concerned .
British historian Corelli Barnett said : " I correspond with some of the neo-cons , though not Robert Kagan , and what they see has no resemblance to the real world .
They see international relations in terms of ideology instead of solving problems .
" Why do they see a threat in China ?
China has an enormous stake in the health of the American economy .
" Equally , with Russia , Putin worries me less than George Bush , who has invaded Iraq .
Putin is simply a good , old - fashioned , cynical , nationalist politician who advances Russia 's interests like Metternich and Bismarck did for Germany .
" Putin does n't have a vast mission of ideology like the Soviet Union or the neo-conservatives .
As for McCain , he seems a pretty plain man and I hope he does not have a terrible reverence for intellectuals like Kagan . "
History has not ended and nor has the debate about it .

What are these ?
WASHINGTON - Programs teaching US schoolchildren to abstain from sex have not cut teen pregnancies or sexually transmitted diseases or delayed the age at which sex begins , health groups told Congress yesterday .
The Bush administration , however , voiced continuing support for such programs during a hearing before a House panel , even as many Democrats called for cutting off federal money for so - called abstinence - only instruction .
" Vast sums of federal monies continue to be directed toward these programs .
And , in fact , there is evidence to suggest that some of these programs are even harmful and have negative consequences by not providing adequate information for those teens who do become sexually active , " Dr. Margaret Blythe of the American Academy of Pediatrics told the committee .
These programs , backed by many social conservatives who oppose the teaching of contraception methods to teenagers in schools , have received about $ 1.3 billion in federal funds since the late 1990s .
Currently , 17 of the 50 US states refuse to accept federal funds for such programs .
Specialists from the American Public Health Association and US Institute of Medicine testified that scientific studies have not found that abstinence - only teaching works to cut pregnancies , sexually transmitted diseases , or the age when sexual activity begins .
The American Psychological Association and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also issued statements to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform criticizing the abstinence - only programs .
Republicans said even if some abstinence - only programs do not work , others do , and it would be wrong to end the funding .

@ajm3 : It did after all say it uses a 8 GB SDHC .
Im guessing it downloads the necessary information for a 10 mile radius or maybe a mile radius and refreshes it after every minute .
I say everyminute because 60 mph=1 mile a minute or maybe it has the traffic monitor too and lets you know which is the best route .
Why cant we get something this good instead of getting crappy old devices and late technology ???

Rove said cooperating in CIA leak inquiry Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Monday March 27 , 2006 Print This | Email This Karl Rove , Deputy White House Chief of Staff and special adviser to President George W. Bush , has recently been providing information to special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald in the ongoing CIA leak investigation , sources close to the investigation say .
According to several Pentagon sources close to Rove and others familiar with the inquiry , Bush 's senior adviser tipped off Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald to information that led to the recent " discovery " of 250 pages of missing email from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney .
Rove has been in the crosshairs of Fitzgerald 's investigation into the outing of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson for what some believe to be retaliation against her husband , former U.S. Ambassador to Gabon , Joseph Wilson .
Wilson had been an ardent critic of pre-war Iraq intelligence .
While these sources did not provide any details regarding what type of arrangements
Rove 's attorney Robert Luskin may have made with the special prosecutor 's office , if any , they were able to provide some information regarding what Rove imparted to Fitzgerald 's team .
The individuals declined to go on the record out of concern for their jobs .
According to one source close to the case , Rove is providing information on deleted emails , erased hard drives and other types of obstruction by staff and other officials in the Vice President 's office .
Pentagon sources close to Rove confirmed this account .
None would name the staffers and / or officials whom Rove is providing information about .
They did , however , explain that the White House computer system has " real time backup " servers and that while emails were deleted from computers , they were still retrievable from the backup system .
By providing the dates and recipient information of the deleted emails , sources say , Rove was able to chart a path for Fitzgerald directly into the office of the Vice President .
In a comment to RAW STORY late Sunday evening , Robert Luskin denied any deal between Rove and Fitzgerald 's office .
" Mr. Rove has cooperated fully with Mr. Fitzgerald 's investigation , " Rove 's attorney said .
" We have not and will not comment on the nature or substance of any communications with the office of the special counsel . "
" That said , there is no basis whatsoever to the matters you allege that Mr. Rove has related , " Luskin added .
One senior White House official is already under indictment in the leak case .
Cheney 's former chief of staff I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby was indicted on five counts of obstruction and false statements to investigators in October of last year .
Rove eluded indictment late last fall after his lawyer said he recalled a conversation with Time reporter Viveca Novak that he alleged would vindicate his client .
Sources say that while the defense was able to parlay Luskin 's revelation into postponing Rove 's indictment , ultimately a deal would likely have to be cut .
The sources did not say a deal had been reached , but did assert that Rove pointed Fitzgerald to Cheney 's office for the missing emails .
Asked about allegations that Rove is providing Fitzgerald 's office with key information and if his status had changed as a result , Luskin provided a vehement denial .
" Your story is false and utterly without foundation , " he said .
" There has never been any discussion of any deal of any kind involving Mr. Rove .
His cooperation has at all times been voluntary and unconditional . "
One of the sources close to the investigation said he was not surprised by Luskin 's response .
" That would be difficult for Rove to admit , " the source said .
" I think Rove is now considered a special cooperating witness . "
The White House was ordered to turn over all emails by then - White House Counsel and current Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in 2003 , after the Administration received word the Justice Department had launched an investigation into the CIA outing .
According to newspaper reports , Gonzales waited twelve hours to inform White House staff after he had received an order from the Justice Department to surrender materials relating to the case .
In a January letter to Libby 's defense team , Fitzgerald expressed concern that some emails might be missing .
" Some e-mails might be missing because the White House 's archiving system had failed , " he said .
Sources say that the missing emails , which surfaced only a month later were not really " missing . "
Rather , they had been deleted by White House staff .
Fitzgerald may have been aware of this at the time of his January letter when he cited the missing emails .
Fitzgerald 's spokesman , Randall Samborn , was unavailable for comment Monday .
A White House divided Sources say the rift between Rove and the Vice President 's office crystallized when Rove quietly attempted to gauge the temperature for replacing Cheney on the 2004 Presidential ballot last year .
" Rove was the source of ' feelers ' put out before the last presidential election in which he was suggesting that Cheney could be replaced on the ticket with someone who had better poll ratings , " said one of the former experts approached who wished to remain anonymous .
" White House polls were showing that Cheney was a drag on the reelection ticket and that the Iraq war issue might be responsible for about a three percent drop , with Cheney the principal object of voter hostility in this percentage of anti-war sentiment among the general public , " the source added .
Cheney , the source said , got wind of " Rove 's political soundings " and the already tense relationship between the Bush and Cheney camps became almost impossible .
Whether or not Rove 's recent cooperation will spare him an indictment and a Fitzgerald probe remains unclear .
But according to last week 's New York Times , associates say Rove is " increasingly certain " he will not be indicted in the case .
