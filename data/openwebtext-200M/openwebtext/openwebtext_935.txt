Developer and publisher Bethesda Softworks is taking its fantasy universe The Elder Scrolls beyond games , signing a two - book deal with Random House imprint Del Rey Books .
" We 're not talking about the next game , but it does n't mean we 're not doing anything with the franchise , " said PR and marketing VP Pete Hines , during a Gamasutra - attended event in London .
The studio has enlisted fantasy author Gregory Keyes , author of several Star Wars - set books as well as his own series The Age of Unreason and The Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone -- the latter of which Hines said " a bunch of us " at Bethesda enjoyed .
While Keyes will be writing the novels themselves , he will collaborate with Bethesda design director Bruce Nesmith and senior game designer Kurt Kuhlman to accurately portray The Elder Scrolls ' lore .
Nesmith and Kuhlman both worked on Bethesda 's 1996 title The Elder Scrolls : Daggerfall , before leaving the studio and eventually returning for The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion .
Kuhlmann was responsible for much of Oblivion 's main quest writing .
" Those who know The Elder Scrolls know we love our lore , " said Hines .
" We certainly love our books -- you can spend hours and hours reading books [ in the games ] . "
The first of the two books , The Infernal City , will take place in the world of Tamriel following the events of Oblivion .
Said the Bethesda exec of Keyes and his work so far , " He 's already given us the first half of the manuscript , and it 's fantastic . "
( CNN ) -- A Belgian city has decided to go " veggie " for a day in an effort to highlight the environmental and health costs of eating meat .
Stock breeding is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions .
The city authorities in Ghent , some 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) west of Brussels , have declared Thursdays " Veggie Day , " ( Veggiedag ) and are asking residents to get involved and opt for vegetarian meals at least one day a week .
It says Ghent is the first city in Europe to try such a scheme .
According to the city 's campaign publicity , eating less meat can help to minimize the ecological footprint of your food because stock breeding has a detrimental impact on the environment .
It points to data from the United Nations which says livestock is responsible for generating around 18 percent of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions .
It is also hoped that Veggie Day will have a positive health impact in the fight against diet - related illnesses such as obesity , cancer and diabetes .
On Wednesday organizers provided residents with meat - free recipes and a list of vegetarian restaurants at a " launch party " in the center of the city .
Ghent claims to have more vegetarian eateries per inhabitant than Paris , London and Berlin .
Demonstrations were also on offer to people looking for green cooking tips .

Dressing up , video games , home video , cos-play and sing - along - lyrics .
What more could a game geek desire ?
That 's pretty much what 's gone into Rebecca Mayes latest review .
At the end of last year I challenged her to review video games with song alone for Game People .
Little did I know how creative the result would be .
Not only has she played more games than ever before in her life , but she has spent hours on each of her hand - crafted songs .
The latest song - review is for Resident Evil 5 .
Rebecca has , of course , turned things her own way though .
And rather than blood and gore we have her ' Do n't Shoot them ' song .
Maybe it 's just me , but this response to a video game is so much more interesting than a simple written review .
What 's more it makes me want to go out and grab a copy and get playing .
She 's said she 'll do an album 's worth of songs for us at Game People , so with seven down we reakon we have another three or four to go .
If you want to suggest a game for her to cover next , why not drop us a line in the comments .
Black carbon is responsible for 50 percent of the total temperature increases in the Arctic from 1890 to 2007 according to a study published in Nature Geoscience .
Since 1890 the temperature in the Arctic has risen 1.9 degrees Celsius , linking black carbon to nearly an entire degree rise in Celsius or almost two degrees Fahrenheit .
Black carbon , a particulate air pollutant , is formed by - way of the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels , biofuels , and biomass .
In places like Asia black carbon is usually produced by burning wood , coal , or cow dung for cooking or heating .
In America and Europe , the use of diesel contributes heavily to black carbon .
In total the destruction of forests and savannah by burning is the largest contributor of black carbon .
Black carbon is a double - whammy in terms of climate change : when in the atmosphere dark carbon particulates absorb sunlight and emit it as heat and after falling back to the earth black carbon can darken snow and ice , reducing their ability to reflect sunlight , thereby accelerating melting .
The study conducted by Drew Shindell of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space and Greg Faluvegi of Columbia University also found that the Arctic is most sensitive to black carbon produced within the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemispheres .
A previous study had shown that 25 to 35 percent of the world ’s black carbon emissions come from China and India alone : two nations whose latitude lies at least partly in the sensitive zone .
“ Climate conditions in the Arctic are rapidly deteriorating , ” said Rafe Pomerance , president of Clean Air – Cool Planet .
“ This study reinforces the opportunity to control short - lived forcers of global warming including black carbon , methane and tropospheric ozone in order to slow the rate of warming in the Arctic .
We cannot afford to allow the shrinkage of the Greenland ice sheet to accelerate . ”
Reducing black carbon would have immediate payoffs .
Since black carbon only remains in the atmosphere between several days and a few weeks , any reduction will have an instant impact on mitigating global warming .
Carbon dioxide emissions on the other hand remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years .
“ We need to broaden climate policy to include reductions in black carbon , given its critical role in Arctic warming and overall global warming , ” said Durwood Zaelke , president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development .
“ Black carbon is part of a package of fast - action strategies that can achieve mitigation in the near term and slow Arctic warming , including targeting short - lived , non-CO2 climate forcers such as HFCs , methane , and tropospheric ozone , as well as increasing carbon sequestration through forest protection and production of biochar . ”

RealNetworks has filed legal counterclaims against the DVD Copy Control Association and all the major movie studios , claiming that the studios conspired to eliminate competition in the market for fair use copies of DVDs .
The company says that the studios abused their power by refusing to grant licenses to Real unless the whole group was involved , and wants the court to force them to drop their lawsuit against Real .
Real has been dealing with the legal fallout from his RealDVD software since September of 2008 — before it was even released to the public .
The software claimed to be able to rip DVDs while still preserving the discs ' copy protection mechanisms .
At that time , Real seemed confident that RealDVD operated well within the DMCA because the software did n't break the CSS encryption — it merely copied it straight to a hard drive , keeping the encryption intact .
Additionally , RealDVD added a new layer of DRM to each file to lock the files to the user and PC that created them , which the company thought would keep it on the movie studios ' good side .
Unfortunately , Real thought wrong .
Almost immediately , the Motion Picture Associaton of America ( MPAA ) sued Real , claiming that the company had violated DMCA anticircumvention rules , referring to RealDVD as " StealDVD . "
Real sued right back hoping to get a judge to declare RealDVD as legal early on , but instead , a judge granted a temporary restraining order against the company , halting the sales of RealDVD .
That brings us to where we are today .
In its counterclaims against the DVD CCA and the movie studios , Real points out that the organization licensed the CSS specifications to Real as well as Video Descrablers , Authentication Modules for CSS Encryption Modules , and Authenticator Modules for DVD Drives .
However , because the movie studios ganged up to bully Real , the DVD CCA turned around to allege that Real had broken " hidden and secret contractual terms " in its licensing agreement .
The company says that the studios and the DVD CCA conspired to keep Real out of the market for fair use copies of DVDs , and that they had a private agreement not to grant licenses to Real .
" Without this illegal cartel , Real and others would be able to compete to provide consumers with products to enable them to gain more value from their DVDs , without having to pay again to make a fair - use copy of the DVDs they had already purchased , " Real VP of Corporate Communications Bill Hankes told Ars via e-mail .
Real says that the studios and DVD CCA are in violation of the Sherman Act , the Cartwright Act , and the California Unfair Competition Law , and asks for an injunction barring the studios and the DVD CCA from continuing their anticompetitive activity .
Additionally , Real asks that the DVD CCA 's and studios ' claims be dismissed , and for appropriate monetary damages to be determined at trial .

SEOUL , South Korea ( CNN ) -- North Korea has fired another short - range missile , the South Korean Yonhap News Agency reported on Wednesday .
North Korean leader Kim Jong - II is suspected to have suffered a stroke last August .
The agency cited a government official who said that the missile had been fired into the Sea of Japan , the latest in a series of tests that began two days ago .
North Korea 's actions have heightened tensions in the international community , though U.S. officials made it clear that other nations will not be intimidated by the " provocative and destabilizing " missile tests , particularly the nuclear test on Monday .
" If they want to continue to test and provoke the international community , they 're going to find that they will pay a price , because the international community is very clear -- this is not acceptable , it wo n't be tolerated , and they wo n't be intimidated , " U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told CNN's " American Morning . "
Watch Rice 's reaction »
The U.N. Security Council -- which includes North Korea 's closest ally , China -- on Monday unanimously condemned Pyongyang 's nuclear test as a " clear violation " of international law .
A day later , North Korea fired two short - range missiles from its east coast in what one South Korean official called a continuation of the North 's " saber - rattling , " Yonhap reported .
After passing the non-binding statement of criticism , the Security Council is now working on passing " a strong resolution with teeth , " Rice said .
" Those teeth could take various different forms -- there are economic levers , there are other levers that we might pursue , " she said .
North Korea first tested a nuclear weapon in October 2006 .
Pyongyang had threatened last month to carry out a new test after the Security Council condemned its test - firing of a long - range rocket and extended economic sanctions against the nation , which is in dire need of food and energy assistance .
North Korea agreed in 2008 to scrap its nuclear weapons program -- which it said had produced enough plutonium for about seven atomic bombs -- in exchange for economic aid .
But the deal foundered over verification and disclosure issues , and the North expelled international inspectors and announced plans to restart its main nuclear reactor .
Watch how Pyongyang has used nuclear tests to gain concessions »
Russia , France and Japan have signaled support for new sanctions against North Korea , already one of the most isolated nations in the world .
North Korea first tested a nuclear weapon in October 2006 .
Pyongyang had threatened last month to carry out a new test after the Security Council condemned its test - firing of a long - range rocket and extended economic sanctions against the nation , which is in dire need of food and energy assistance .
Monday 's blast , conducted just before 10 a.m. ( 9 p.m. Sunday ET ) showed up on seismographs with the punch of a magnitude 4.7 earthquake , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
Russia estimated the force of Monday 's blast at 10 to 20 kilotons , in the neighborhood of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs of World War II and far larger than the 2006 test .
Pyongyang 's state - run Korean Central News Agency said only that the latest test was safely conducted " on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control . "
The North Koreans followed up with a short - range missile launch as well , according to the White House .
Watch more analysis on the nuclear test »
Less than three weeks ago , the White House announced a new diplomatic effort to restart the stalled six - party nuclear talks .
The discussions involve China , Japan , North Korea , Russia , South Korea and the United States .
Several analysts said the test could be an effort to improve Pyongyang 's bargaining position , or a sign of a power struggle within North Korean leader Kim Jong - Il 's government .
Han Park , a scholar at the University of Georgia , said North Korea wants normal diplomatic relations and a non-aggression pact with the United States -- and is " angry enough and hungry enough to sell anything they can put their hands on . "
" They are a big - time weapons trader , " Park said .
" If we are going to try to do something about nonproliferation , we have to include diplomatic relations with North Korea . "
Analysts say North Korea is years from having a weapon it can put atop a long - range missile like those in the U.S. , Chinese or Russian arsenals .
Meanwhile , Kim is widely reported to have suffered a stroke in August and has been absent from many public functions in recent months .
In April , he named his son Kim Jong - un and brother - in - law , Jang Song Thaek , to the country 's powerful National Defense Commission , suggesting his son might be his heir .
Rebecca Johnson , executive director of the Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy , told CNN that Kim " needs to demonstrate domestically that he is in charge . "
" Doing the nuclear tests , firing a couple of missiles , is a way to do that -- perhaps the only way to do that -- because he can't feed the people , " she said .
North and South Korea technically remain at war , because no treaty formalized the truce that ended the Korean War in 1953 .
The conflict also involved China and the United States , and about 25,000 U.S. troops are still based in South Korea .
But Johnson said renewed conflict is unlikely ; rather , Pyongyang is " playing a political game . "
" It causes a lot of anxiety in South Korea and Japan , but they are sensible countries , " she said .
" They know that this can be dealt with politically and diplomatically .
This is not a situation where anyone should start saber - rattling and threatening to go to war . "

ith the recent release of the JavaFX Software Developer Kit 1.1 , Sun also released the long awaited JavaFX Mobile platform .
Through a Java - like scripting language ( JavaFX Script ) and a single API , JavaFX provides a development tool that supports a variety of platforms , from desktops to mobile devices .
This article provides a beginner 's guide to JavaFX Mobile development , but because all JavaFX development relies on the same SDK and tooling , it could just as easily be about JavaFX in general .
Rather than offering a separate JavaFX Mobile SDK , the JavaFX SDK 1.1 and its development tools provide mobile emulation for developing JavaFX Mobile applications .
Joshua Marinacci from Sun's Java
Swing team put it best in a recent blog posting : " There is no JavaFX Mobile .
There is only JavaFX . "
Java 's ubiquity on mobile devices has made the " write once , run anywhere " ( WORA ) premise difficult to abide by given the thousands of mobile device screens .
With JavaFX Mobile , the Java community has a tool to possibly combat this device UI fragmentation .
JavaFX's Syntax and Synergy with Java
JavaFX is a product framework comprised of JavaFX Script and JavaFX Mobile .
JavaFX Script ( JavaFX for short ) is a scripting language meant to provide rich user interfaces and as its name implies , JavaFX Mobile is JavaFX for mobile platforms .
JavaFX Script uses a declarative syntax that resembles JavaScript and Scalar Vector Graphics ( SVG ) .
For example , here is the JavaFX code ( minus imports ) for creating a little " hello world " type of window as shown in Figure 1 , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 .
Stage { title : " Cool Running " width : 250 height : 80 scene : Scene { content :
Text { font :
Font { size : 20 } x : 10 , y : 30 fill : Color .
GREEN content : " JavaFX is cool " } } }
As you can see , JavaFX has some resemblance to Java and / or JavaScript , but it is neither .
JavaFX 's declarative style is more apparent when contrasted with the imperative programming style of Java Swing .
The following Swing code creates the same " hello world " window as the previous JavaFX example ( again minus imports ) :
public class Main { public static void main ( String [ ] args ) { JFrame a Frame = new JFrame ( " Cool Running " ) ; a Frame.setSize(250 , 80 ) ; JPanel content = new JPanel ( ) ; content.setLayout(new BorderLayout ( 5 , 5 ) ) ; content.setBackground( Color .
WHITE ) ; JLabel a Label = new JLabel ( " Swing is cool " ) ; aLabel.setFont(new Font( null , Font. PLAIN , 20 ) ) ; aLabel.setForeground(Color.GREEN ) ; content.add( aLabel , BorderLayout.CENTER ) ; aFrame.setContentPane(content ) ; a Frame.setVisible ( true ) ; aFrame . setDefaultCloseOperation( JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE ) ; } }
Notice the imperative nature ( i.e. , statement by statement , control flow ) of Swing , which has been used for traditional Java UI development .
Figure 4 shows the result of the Java Swing code .
Figure 4 . Swing Versus JavaFX : This is the same " Hello World " window created from Swing code versus JavaFX code .
As previously stated , JavaFX is neither Java nor JavaScript , but JavaFX scripts can call Java classes or be called on by Java classes .
For example , in the following JavaFX script for determining the size of a window , the Stage object 's size has been rewritten to use the standard Java Math class :
var i = 250 ; var j = 300 ; Stage { title : " Cool Running " width : java.lang.Math.max( i , j ) height : 80 scene : Scene { ...
Sun has touted JavaFX 's ability to leverage existing Java code as one of its advantages over other RIA technologies such as Adobe Flex .
Also , while JavaFX Script provides a platform for building any application , its purpose as defined by Sun is for use in UI development and not for business or backend components .
Last November , hundreds of same - sex couples went to the altar in the days before the election in California , which had become the second state to legalize same - sex marriage .
( Massachusetts was the first , in 2004 . )
One couple who wed in 2008 , Chloe Harris and Frankie Frankeny , had already had a commitment ceremony , and they hold domestic partnerships for San Francisco and for California .
Image Wade French and Brent Lok , holding an invalid marriage license from 2004 and a valid one from 2008 , are awaiting the California Supreme Court 's decision on their marriage and more than 18,000 others .

“ Keeping up with anniversaries is difficult , ” Ms. Harris said .
But Ms. Harris , a freelance writer , and Ms. Frankeny , a photographer , said , their marriage last fall “ was a big moment . ”
“ We had said ‘ I do ’ before , but this time it carried a lot more weight particularly because our families were there , ” said Ms. Harris , who , like Ms. Frankeny , is from Texas .
“ What really changed was the relationship with our families .
It ’s when our relationship really gelled in their minds .
They may not understand how  or why  we ’re gay , but now they get why we wanted to get married . ”
Since the passage of Proposition 8 , several states have legalized same - sex marriage , including Iowa , Maine and Vermont .
Connecticut , where a court decision legalized same - sex marriage shortly before Election Day , began performing ceremonies shortly after California banned them .
At the moment , married same - sex couples in California have the same rights as straight , married couples under California law , though same - sex couples have no federal recognition .
Like several other states , California allows members of the same sex to enter into domestic partnerships , which afford many of the same rights as marriage .
But Kate Kendell , the executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights , says domestic partnerships are not equivalent to marriage .
“ It is more than symbolism to say that an entire category of recognition is off limits to one class of people , ” Ms. Kendell said .
“ And the category that is off limits is the one that is most culturally desirable . ”
And , it seems , an institution not taken lightly .
Gerardo Marin and Jay Thomas said they debated whether to codify their decade - long relationship last fall , but opted against getting married at the last moment , because “ we did n’t feel we should be rushed into it , ” said Mr. Marin , 35 .
Police took photos of the peel after the suspect ate most of the " evidence "
A US teenager who was thwarted in an attempt to rob an internet cafe armed with a hidden banana ate the " weapon " before he was arrested , police say .
John Szwalla entered the shop with a banana concealed under his T - shirt and demanded money , saying he had a gun .
The shop 's owner and customers overcame the hapless thief and called for help , but they said the teenager ate his " weapon " before the police arrived .
Officers joked they may charge the 17 - year - old with destroying evidence .
Bobby Ray Mabe , the owner of 109 Biz Center in Winston - Salem , North Carolina , said police officials took pictures of the banana skin instead .
" If he had had a gun he would 've shot me , " Mr Mabe told the Winston - Salem Journal newspaper .
" But he had a banana . "
Mr Szwalla has been charged with attempted armed robbery .

Pension trustees and insurance company portfolio managers look away now .
Your increased commitment to government bond holdings in recent times is about to blow up spectacularly .
At least , that is the view of Ron Paul , the US congressman who ran against John McCain in last year ’s Republican Party presidential nomination .
[ efoods ]
His is a minority view .
Yields on government bonds worldwide have been falling fast over the past few months and in the UK , the commencement of “ quantitative easing ” this month sent bond prices soaring .
But the credibility of both western governments and their currencies is waning , and has been ever since the gold standard was abandoned in 1971 , says Mr Paul .
And that means even “ safe ” investments are far from safe , he claims .
“ People will start to abandon the dollar as current and past economic policies create a steep rise in interest rates , ” Mr Paul says .
“ If you are in Treasuries , you will need to be watchful and nimble to time your escape . ”
Unfortunately , cashing out will not protect the value of investments , he insists , because “ fiat ” currencies will all decline over the coming years as measures to try to haul the world economy out of recession fail .
“ The current stimulus measures are making things a lot worse , ” says Mr Paul .
“ The US government just wo n’t allow the correction the economy needs . ”
He cites the mini-depression of 1921 , which lasted just a year largely because insolvent companies were allowed to fail .
“ No one remembers that one .
They ’ll remember this one , because it will last 15 years . ”
At some stage – Mr Paul estimates it will be between one and four years – the dollar will implode .
“ The dollar as a reserve standard is done , ” he says .
He sees little hope for other currencies where central banks have also created too much liquidity dating right back to the early 1970s .
“ Europe and the US will both have to fundamentally change their money systems , ” he adds .
And do n’t even mention shares to Mr Paul : “ The last place you want to be is in the stock market , ” he says .
“ It may not bottom out for 10 years – just look at Japan . ”

Wolfe reviews the new play Seven Jewish Children and takes on the critiques of those who accuse it of " anti-Semitism . "
ACCUSATIONS OF " anti-Semitism " have long been the knee - jerk response by Zionists to critics of Israel .
And woe unto the Jew who dares to criticize ; they are clearly a self - hating masochist .
This is playing out once again in the barrage of vituperative criticism hurled at Caryl Churchill 's Seven Jewish Children : A Play for Gaza , a " minor playlet " as one detractor called it , penned and staged in response to Israel 's most recent brutal massacre in Gaza .
" Operation Cast Lead , " Israel 's carefully calculated and long - planned 22 - day December 2008 / January 2009 attack on Gaza , resulted in the deaths of 1,300 Gazans , the majority unarmed civilians , and left communities in shambles .
A major playwright in the tradition of Bertolt Brecht and Samuel Beckett , Churchill has won several awards , including the Obie Sustained Achievement Award in 2001 .
She worked with the radical theater companies Joint Stock and Monstrous Regiment during the 1970s and ' 80s , during which time she produced some of her best - known plays ( Cloud Nine , Top Girls and Serious Money ) .
A production of Seven Jewish Children by the Rude Guerilla theater company in Los Angeles
In 2001 , a performance of her play Far Away , supported by the Royal Court , raised funds for two Palestinian theaters .
Churchill has long been an outspoken feminist , anti-imperialist and member of the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign .
Seven Jewish Children was by no means her first foray into political theater .
Written in seven short poetic sequences , each section of the play is set in a key period of the last 61 years of Israel 's occupation of Palestine , and each consists of adults debating what to " tell her " ( a Jewish child who is either asleep , elsewhere or maybe listening outside the door ) about what is going on .
Most of the litany of lines begins with " tell her " or " do n't tell her . "
The play / poem is seven pages long , and takes about 10 minutes to perform .
The text includes enough specifics to make the time and place clear , yet is general enough that the current plight of Palestinians conjures the plight of Jews in the past , and vice versa .
The voices express familiar and universal debates that parents and other adults have about what to tell children : protect them from the truth ; tell them a white lie ; give them some portion of the truth ; no , they need to know it all .
The subtext of course is what the adults think about the events , which erupts in the final and most controversial sequence .
Review : Theater Seven Jewish Children : A Play for Gaza , written by Caryl Churchill .
Read the play online .
The language is simple , yet laden with the double and triple negatives that hypocrisy and conflict generate : " Do n't tell her she can't play with the children . "
As Tony Kushner and Alisa Solomon point out in their gorgeous review in the April 13 issue of the Nation , it is
dense , beautiful , elusive and intentionally indeterminate .
This is not to say that the play is n't also direct and incendiary .
It is .
It 's disturbing , it 's provocative , but appropriately so , given the magnitude of the calamity it enfolds in its pages .
Kushner and Solomon explain the nature of criticism from Zionist and liberal quarters : " The power of art to open us up to the subjectivities of others is especially threatening to those who insist on a single narrative . "
Referring to the squelching of Palestinian voices in arts / media , they are " grimly determined to maintain the invisibility of others . "
Further , the brevity and apparent simplicity of the play are an " implicit rejection of the idea that the situation in the Middle East is too complicated ... to be explored at anything other than great length . "
The lightning rod for criticism comes toward the end , the culmination of the only lengthy prose outburst in the piece set , we presume , during the current onslaught :
Tell her I look at one of their children covered in blood and what do I feel ?
Tell her all I feel is happy it 's not her / Do n't tell her that / Tell her we love her / Do n't frighten her .
There the play ends .
CHURCHILL IS accused of giving new life to the medieval " blood libel , " the myth that Jews relish drinking the blood of non-Jewish children .
Theaters and actors performing the play have come under attack ; two retaliatory Zionist " playlets " have already been written and performed .
Seven Other Children by British playwright Richard Stirling purports to show , in the words of the playwright , " the tragedy of the Palestinian child as a victim of a distorted education about Israel . "
What Strong Fences Make , by New York playwright Israel Horovitz , is set at an Israel Defense Forces checkpoint outside Ramallah .
Countering Churchill 's request for collections for Gazan children , Horovitz has requested money at performances go to aid children wounded in attacks on Israel .
Seven Jewish Children is a tribute to the power of political theater to humanize , and to provoke discussion and debate .
In one particularly bizarre published dialogue in the Atlantic between Jeffrey Goldberg and Ari Roth , who produced the Seven Jewish Children at the " pro-peace " Zionist Theatre J , Goldberg states : " I do n't want to treat this as a serious piece of art worthy of argument . "
He goes on at length about the " complexity " of the Israel / Palestine situation , and how the " playlet " is " gross " in its oversimplification , " agitprop " and " polemic " at its worst .
Churchill is a " smug playwright with pronounced animus toward Israel writing this drive - by polemic that 's meant to demonize the Jewish state . "
He accuses Churchill of " seduction " of the reader with her " shrewd " writing .
Roth concludes that it is " unfortunately " well - written .
One can't help but feel that he 's suggesting that Churchill has lured the hapless masochistic Jew unwittingly to founder on the rocky shoals of anti-Semitism and perpetuation of the " blood libel " myth .
It is worth quoting Churchill at length as she defends the play , and herself :
Throughout the play , families try to protect their children .
Finally [ at the time the play was written , during the massacre in Gaza ] , one of the parents explodes , saying " No , stop preventing her from knowing what 's on the TV news . "
His outburst is meant , in a small way , to shock during a shocking situation .
Is it worse than a picture of Israelis dancing for joy as smoke rises over Gaza ?
Or the text of Rabbi Shloyo Aviner 's booklet distributed to soldiers saying cruelty is sometimes a good attribute ?
And as for the " blood libel " accusations , she responds :
I find it extraordinary that , because the play talks about the killing of children in Gaza , I am accused of reviving the medieval blood libel that Jews killed Christian children and consumed their blood .
The character is not " rejoicing in the murder of little children . "
He sees dead children on TV and feels numb and defiant in his relief that his own child is safe .
He believes that what has happened is justified as self - defense .
AS THE Jewish parent of an 8 - year - old , I imagine the " Seven Children " to be about the age of my own son-- old enough to understand , but young enough that there are things you do n't want them to have to understand .
The play strikes the perfect chord of tension every parent experiences , shifting with events around us and of course with the child 's age : how much do I tell them ?
How do I tell them ?
How do I protect them ?
How do I tell them enough to protect themselves ?
This , as well as the moment of anger that often comes when you see your child has been threatened .
Anger toward others , oneself and even the child .
This is what seems to me to be the context of the penultimate " explosion . "
The title of the play and its contents evoke a fairy tale .
But this is n't the modern kind with a happy ending ; rather the old Grimm Brothers ' grisly morality tale that usually end with children eaten or transformed into gruesome creatures because they did n't do their parents ' bidding .
And , more importantly , it is real .
Horrifyingly real .
Seven Jewish Children drives home that the Zionist colonial settler state can only be justified by the perpetration of the most venal form of racism , and demonstrates at the micro - level how this is achieved in the messages parents give their children : " Tell her they they 're animals living in rubble now ;
Tell her I would n't care if we wiped them out . "
The play is about how the founding of Israel seemed a fairy tale -- the Promised Land , the Land of Milk and Honey - - but was based on racist lies .
As Kushner writes , " The last line of the monologue is clearly a warning : you can't protect your children by being indifferent to the children of others . "
I would add , just as horrifying and damaging to a child as seeing other children killed , is witnessing their parents ' indifference .
There are still not enough tents to accommodate all the homeless and some people have spent the last two nights sleeping in their cars , struggling to stay warm in an upland area which is surrounded by snow - capped mountains .
Is There A Connection Between Religion And Standard Of Living ?
A recent Gallup poll reveals the world ’s most and least religious countries , along with some other surprises .
Which countries come to mind when you hear the word “ religious ” ?
Israel ?
India ?
Istanbul ?
Ok , ok , Istanbul is n’t a country , but it was the inspiration for that catchy tune .
Well , if you guessed any of the above , you did n’t hit even one of the countries that made the top 11 Most Religious Countries in the world in a recent Gallup Poll .
Coming in at the top spot was Egypt , followed by Bangladesh , and a host of African countries , along with Indonesia .
On the flip side , which are the least religious countries in the world ?
Estonia had the lowest percentage of people who said that religion plays an important part in their lives , followed by a few fair - skinned places : Sweden , Denmark , and Norway .
Rounding out the top five is a former Communist territory , the Czech Republic .
Even more interesting , according to the same poll :
A population ’s religiosity level is strongly related to its average standard of living …( the poll ) indicates that 8 of the 11 countries in which almost all residents ( at least 98 % ) say religion is important in their daily lives are poorer nations in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia .
And you guessed it , several of the least religious countries have the highest living standards , including Hong Kong , Japan , and the fair - haired triple whammy mentioned above .
What does this mean exactly ?
Is there a clear link between being devoted to a higher power and having no money in your pocket ?
Of course , one of the problems with this purported correlation is the United States , which has both a high standard of living AND high marks for being religious .
What do you think – is there a real correlation between religion and standard of living ?

Woman who fractured baby 's skull is freed by judge , saying SHE had suffered enough
Free : Claire Thompson , 32 , has been handed a suspended sentence for battering infant she was looking after
A woman who battered a nine - week - old baby in an horrific attack has avoided jail after a judge decided she had already suffered enough .
Claire Thompson , 32 , who had been entrusted with looking after the infant , was found guilty in March of fracturing its skull , breaking a rib and inflicting up to three leg fractures .
An expert at her trial said the skull fracture was probably caused by the baby 's head hitting a hard surface with force , the rib was probably broken by severe squeezing and the the leg bones were likely to have been fractured by forceful pulling or twisting , or by violent shaking .
But yesterday Judge David Goodin spared Thompson from prison , handing her a nine - month suspended prison sentence , ordering her to do 200 hours of community service and telling her to pay £ 500 costs .
Hearing that she had ' lost everything ' following the assault , he heaped praise on her character and told her she had already suffered more than any sentence he could impose on her .
Judge Goodin said : ' All evidence simply confirms you to be an industrious , decent and placid well - liked young woman who was slow to anger and disinclined to confrontation . '
He added : ' The only sensible explanation for these injuries must have been a sudden and momentary loss of control . '
Thompson , of Sudbury , Suffolk , was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm to a baby she was looking after - but was cleared of causing the injuries intentionally .
Despite denying both charges , Thompson admitted she was one of three people who could have injured the infant .
Lindsay Cox , defending Thompson , told Ipswich Crown Court yesterday : ' She was engaged and lost that .
The home that she had with a former partner was again lost to her . '
He added : ' She was working in the retail industry in a job that would bring her into contact with children .
Although she has not been told that she is fired , she has not gone back to work , and I cannot in all honesty think that she could keep that appointment . '
Redheads may be hotheads , but they get colder quicker .
They also bruise more easily .
And they feel more pain .
All this comes from a series of studies done in the last few years on people with genes for red hair .
Red hair is red due to excess production of the molecule pheomelanin .
While we brunettes produce more eumelanin ( dark brown pigment ) , redheads produce an excess of pheomelanin .
Too much of this yellow - red pigment is the result of mutations in the MC1R.3 gene .
Redheads have two copies of this variant allele , one from each parent .
So what does the “ redhead gene ” have to do with sensitivity ?
University of Louisville anesthesiologist Edwin Liem suspects that when both copies of the MC ! R.3 have mutations , which is the case for redheads , the melanocortin 4 receptor is faulty , inefficient , and / or unable to be transported to the surface of cells .
This receptor happens to modulate sensations of cold and pain .
Another explanation is that the mutation in the MC1R gene , the same one that produces too much pheomelanin , affects hormones that stimulate pain receptors in the brain .
In one study , Liem and his colleagues compared the pain tolerance of sixty naturally red-haired volunteers with sixty brunettes .
The redheads began to feel chilling pain at around 6C ( 43 F ) , unlike the volunteers with dark hair , who did not really begin to ache until the temperature approached freezing .
In another study , by Liem et al. , women with various hair color types were exposed to electric shock .
Turns out , the redheads needed about 20 percent more anesthetic to put down the pain ( confirming the common belief among anesthesiologists that redheads are tough to knock out ) .
While redheads have normal blood counts and coagulate blood the same as anyone else , a study found that they bruise more easily .
Yet another study found that redheads are more than twice as likely as women with other hair colors to fear and avoid the dentist .
These studies have been done on women only , and it ’s unknown whether red - haired men would have the same outcome .
However , there ’s evidence that pain pathways differ between the sexes .
Redheads are stereotyped as being hot - headed , tempestuous , dramatic , high - strung .
Is it possible that a genetic sensitivity to pain can affect temperament ?
It ’s fun to speculate .
For some , physical pain may translate into emotional pain .
Sensitivity may tip over into volatility .
Could a fiery , short temper even be a pain avoidance mechanism ?
Why not — after all , a good offense can be the best defense .
Microsoft ’s CEO Steve Ballmer had some interesting things to say yesterday about which companies Microsoft sees as its competitors in the client operating system space .
You ’d think Apple was their number one competitor – and you ’d be wrong .
Microsoft sees two other competitors as their primary adversaries .
During a speech for investors , Steve Ballmer showed the following slide to his audience :
As you can see , Microsoft sees piracy as its biggest competitor .
“ Number two market share goes to Windows pirated , or unlicensed , ” Balmer said , “ That ’s a competitor that ’s tough to beat , they ’ve got a good price and a heck of a product , but we ’re working on it . ”
This is n’t exactly new information , but it ’s interesting to see it spelled out so clearly .
Much more interesting is Microsoft ’s idea of Linux and Apple , According to Microsoft , Linux is a bigger threat to the company than Apple , placing Linux above Apple in the marketshare figure pie chart thing .
“ Linux , you could see on the slide , and Apple has certainly increased its share somewhat , ” Ballmer said .
He went on to explain how the company views Apple :
I think depending on how you look at it , Apple has probably increased its market share over the last year or so by a point or more .
And a point of market share on a number that ’s about 300 million is interesting .
It ’s an interesting amount of market share , while not necessarily being as dramatic as people would think , but we ’re very focused in on both Apple as a competitor , and Linux as a competitor .
As much as I find Ballmer a rather annoying figure , he does score a major point here .
About 300 million PCs were shipped worldwide in 2008 .
Round and about 9 - 10 million of those were Macs .
Apple ’s market share might be increasing , but it ’s still relatively irrelevant compared to the bigger picture .
As we said yesterday , Apple might be doing swell in the United States , but on a worldwide scale , Cupertino still falls a bit to the wayside .
In any case , it appears that Linux ( and piracy ) is a larger blip on Microsoft ’s radar than Apple , and it ’s not hard to see why .
With an economy that ’s not doing very well , people will opt for cheaper products .
Apple cannot offer those , but Linux and piracy can .
At the age of 16 months , she still weighs only 17lb and has been advised by a paediatric dietician to eat the three full meals a day as well as fatty snacks .
Editor 's note : Alicia H. Munnell is the Peter F. Drucker professor of management sciences at Boston College and director of the Center for Retirement Research .
She was a member of President Clinton 's Council of Economic Advisers from 1995 to 1997 and was assistant secretary of the Treasury from 1993 to 1995 .
Alicia Munnell says Social Security has proved much less fragile than the private retirement system .
( CNN ) --
The nation 's financial and economic crisis provided a stress test for the nation 's public and private retirement system .
The 2009 Social Security Trustees report released Tuesday provides a basis for assessing how each held up .
On the one hand , assets in 401 ( k ) accounts -- which are predominantly in stocks -- have declined in value by about a third , employers are suspending matching contributions , and millions of unemployed workers have seen their retirement savings efforts disrupted .
On the other hand , the Social Security Administration continues to send out monthly checks to 35 million retirees and their spouses , 9 million disabled workers and their families , and 6 million families whose breadwinner has died .
In other words , the government system has proved to be much less fragile than the private system of retirement savings .
Social Security did not escape totally unscathed , however .
As firms laid off workers , payrolls and payroll tax revenues declined below levels that had been assumed in the previous report .
This decline in revenues , together with some changes in assumptions about how long people will live , has accelerated the date when the trust fund is projected to be exhausted and has increased the deficit the system faces over the next 75 years .
The Social Security Trustees now predict that trust fund assets will be exhausted in 2037 , four years sooner than the estimate in last year 's report .
Assuming no new legislation , what happens in 2037 ?
This date is often described as the point at which Social Security is " bankrupt , " leaving the impression that there is no money at all .
But payroll tax revenues continue rolling in , and Social Security still has enough revenue to pay roughly three - quarters of promised benefits .
The financial crisis has simply accelerated the date at which this event occurs .
Looking at the silver lining , the acceleration may convince policymakers that action needs to be taken sooner rather than later to eliminate the financing gap .
And how much action is required ?
The Social Security Trustees report the deficit over the next 75 years as a percent of payrolls .
That deficit also increased as a result of the financial crisis , but remained in the familiar territory where it has been for the last 15 years .
Over the next 75 years , the Social Security Trustees project a program shortfall equal to 2 percent of covered earnings .
That is , if the payroll tax rate were raised immediately by roughly 2 percentage points -- 1 percentage point each for the employee and the employer -- the government would be able to pay the current package of benefits for everyone who reaches retirement age at least through 2083 .
A lasting fix for Social Security would require additional changes , as an aging population continues to present financial challenges beyond the 75 - year horizon .
Solutions that focus just on the next 75 years typically involve the build up of trust fund assets in the near term and the sale of those assets to pay benefits in the out years .
Since the trust funds have no further bonds to sell in the 76th year , the program is suddenly short of money .
So , realistically , eliminating the 75 - year shortfall should probably be viewed as the first step towards long - run solvency .
The bottom line , however , is that the 2009 Trustees Report did not reveal any important new information about the finances of the Social Security system .
The system has enough money to pay full benefits for decades , although for a few years less than previously reported because of the financial / economic crisis .
And the system faces a long run financial shortfall of about 2 percent of taxable payrolls , a figure that is higher than last year 's estimate because of the financial / economic crisis but well within the range of deficits estimated over the past 15 years .
The new information that we have about Social Security is how well it has withstood the onslaught of the financial / economic crisis .
Social Security checks have gone out on time .
Though the amounts are not large , the benefits are increased each year to reflect changes in the cost of living , and they continue for as long as the recipient lives .
So , despite the modest amounts , the benefits are extremely valuable and people can count on them regardless of what happens to financial markets or the real economy .
In contrast , the financial crisis has demonstrated the vulnerability of 401 ( k ) plans to economic and financial conditions .
401 ( k ) balances , which are modest at best , declined in value by about one - third .
And , as the financial crisis spread to the real economy , employers suspended their matches , and employees without jobs were forced to discontinue contributions .
In other words , in the wake of the shift away from traditional defined benefit pension plans , the only real supplement to Social Security for most private sector workers is fragile .
The fragility of the employer - sponsored system , as evidenced by the impact of the financial / economic crisis , makes the basic public pension system all the more important .
So when the time comes to decide between revenue increases and benefit cuts to close Social Security 's financial shortfall , policymakers may be surprised to find that Americans might be willing to pay up to maintain current benefit levels .
Of course , the amount that they have to pay up will be less the sooner the problem is addressed .
So if the 2009 Trustees Report serves as a call to action , then it has played a useful role .

More about Atelier Rorona came out of this week ’s issue of Famitsu .
The biggest surprise being Atelier Rorona has 3D graphics .
Gust , the developers of titles like Atelier Iris and Ar Tonelico , stuck with sprites and talking heads for facial expressions throughout the PS2 ’s lifecycle .
Atelier Rorona retains static character portraits , but has 3D models .
Ca n’t really get a good feel for them from the scan so we ’ll have to wait for clearer pictures .
Gust should be sending those out soon since Atelier Rorona is scheduled to come out in Japan on June 25 .
We ’ll start bothering NIS America to see if Atelier Rorona is on their plate for this year .

The sun has a new spot , and it could signal the long - awaited beginning of the next solar cycle .
Solar flares rise and fall on an 11 - year cycle , and last year marked what scientists thought was the solar minimum .
But through the beginning of 2009 , the sun stayed unusually quiet .
That changed yesterday , when a major sunspot appeared on the backside of the sun , where it was captured by NASA 's STEREO instrument .
" This is the biggest event we 've seen in a year or so , " said Michael Kaiser , research scientist with the heliophysics division at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center .
" Does this mean we 're finished with the minimum or not ?
It 's hard to say .
This could be it .
It 's got us all excited . "
People have been counting sunspots since Galileo first observed one in the early 17th century .
Through the 28 cycles that have been well - documented , stretching from 1745 to today , the average cycle length has been 11 years , but shorter and longer cycles have been observed .
( The polarity of solar storms also alternates , so technically , a full cycle is 22 years . )
For unknown reasons , the current solar minimum has lasted longer than normal .
" It 's been a long solar minimum , the longest and deepest one through the last hundred years , but not out of the extreme ordinary , " Kaiser said .
Sunspot activity causes magnetic storminess around Earth and is correlated with the total amount of energy we receive from the sun .
That connection caused some speculation in the media about the implications of the extended solar minimum on climate change , like yesterday 's FoxNews.com article , " Quiet Sun May Trigger Global Cooling . "
If the new solar flare is indeed a sign of the resumption of the normal cycle , it should put all that to rest .
Kaiser is sure this sunspot is part of the new cycle because it appeared at about 30 degrees of latitude .
This is typical early in the solar cycle when sunspots appear closer to the poles .
Toward the solar minimum they show up closer to the equator .
To date , a few minor sunspots have shown up in the higher latitudes , but none with the intensity or size of the new spots .
" We have seen a few events in the new cycle , but they 've all been pretty timid compared to this one , " Kaiser said .
" In angular size , this one was n't spectacularly big , but it was certainly pretty bright . "
STEREO picked up the event around the backside of the sun , but it wo n't come fully into view from Earth until May 8 .
Still , solar photographers are already pointing their telescopes at the sun , hoping to catch a glimpse of the new event .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) - ABC has officially picked up “ Flash Forward , ” a drama starring Joseph Fiennes .
The show , which already is being promoted on the network , received a 13 - episode order Friday night .
Based on Robert J. Sawyer ’s novel , the series chronicles the aftermath of a global event in which everyone in the world blacks out for 2 minutes , 17 seconds and has mysterious visions of six months into the future .
Originally developed at HBO , which retains a piece of any profits , “ Flash ” landed at ABC after heated bidding with Fox .
From the get - go , it has been considered compatible with the network ’s hit “ Lost ” and a potential successor to the mystery drama , which is heading into its sixth and final season .
Not surprisingly , ABC two weeks ago launched a teaser promo campaign for “ Flash ” during “ Lost . ”
The new series is expected to launch in the fall .
ABC has been the most aggressive among the broadcast networks this year in handing out early series pickups to its strongest pilots .
The order for “ Flash ” came hours after the network brass screened it to a strong reception .
It follows ABC ’s Thursday pickup of the new comedy “ Modern Family . ”
In addition to Fiennes , the “ Flash ” cast includes Sonya Walger , John Cho , Jack Davenport , Brian F. O’Byrne , Courtney B. Vance , Christine Woods , Zachary Knighton and Peyton List .
With ABC ’s pilot screenings slated to wrap Monday , other hot prospects at the network include the mystery drama “ Happy Town ” and prolific producer Jerry Bruckheimer ’s “ The Unknown , ” both enjoying rave reviews .
Also going strong are the Courteney Cox-starring comedy “ Cougar Town ” and the contemporary witch take “ Eastwick . ”
“ V , ” an update of the 1980s miniseries , is heading into its Monday screening with a strong buzz , with the dramas “ Empire State ” and “ Limelight ” also in contention .
On the comedy side , the Patricia Heaton vehicle “ The Middle , ” which was filmed months ago , is picking up heat after a solid screening .
Three other pilots have the strong presence of stars going for them : Alyssa Milano ( “ Romantically Challenged ” ) , Kelsey Grammer ( an untitled project ) and Cedric the Entertainer ( “ The Law ” ) .

The incident sparked a huge police response
Three police officers have been killed by a gunman in Pittsburgh - the second mass shooting in the US in 24 hours .
The officers were responding to an emergency call from the house of the gunman , named as Richard Poplawski , 23 .
Police said he was waiting , armed with rifles and a bulletproof vest .
He shot two officers as they entered the house , and a third who tried to help them .
He then traded gunfire with police for four hours before being injured and giving himself up .
His friends said he had recently lost his job , and was worried that US President Barack Obama was about to ban guns .
The shooting comes a day after a gunman killed 13 people in New York state .
' Lying in wait '
In a televised press conference , Pittsburgh police chief Nathan Harper said it was a " very sad day " for the city .
WEEK OF SHOOTINGS Sat 4 April : Gunman kills three policemen in Pittsburgh before being wounded and captured Fri 3 April : Gunman kills 13 people at an immigration centre in Binghamton , New York state , then apparently shoots himself Sun 29 March : Gunman kills seven elderly residents and a nurse at a nursing home in Carthage , North Carolina , then is shot and wounded himself Sun 29 March : Man kills five relatives and himself in Santa Clara , California " Our hearts and our prayers go out to the officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice , " he said .
Mr Poplawski was armed with two rifles , a pistol and a lot of ammunition , the authorities said .
Mr Harper said the emergency call had been made by the gunman 's mother , who had apparently stayed in the basement of the house during the whole incident .
He said the gunman had been " lying in wait " , and the first two officers who reached the house were shot in the head as they entered .
' Stockpiled food and guns ' Witnesses described how the officers who arrived after the shooting could not reach their stricken colleagues .
One neighbour , Don Sand , told the Associated Press : " They could n't get the scene secure enough to get to them .
They were just lying there bleeding .
" By the time they secured the scene enough to get to them it was way too late . "

Edward Perkovic , who said he was close to Mr Poplawski , told the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette how his friend had called him on his mobile phone during the incident , saying he had been shot in the leg and the chest .
Mr Perkovic said Mr Poplawski told him : " Eddie , I 'm going to die today .
Tell your family and friends I love them .
This is probably the end . "
Then there was a burst of gunfire and the call ended , Mr Perkovic said .
Another man who said he was a friend of Mr Poplawski , Aaron Vire , told the newspaper : " He said he 'll be ready if there 's ever an invasion of the United States and that he had stockpiled foods and guns for that eventuality . "
Mr Poplawski has been charged with three counts of homicide , aggravated assault and a weapons violation .

There are six unique segments of the American public that each engage with the issue of global warming in their own distinct way .
Just over half of American adults ( 51 percent ) are either Alarmed or Concerned about global warming , and these individuals are poised to vote on the issue with their pocket books and at the ballot box .
The Alarmed ( 18 percent of the U.S. adult population ) are the segment most engaged in the issue of global warming .
They are very convinced it is happening , human - caused , and a serious and urgent threat .
The Alarmed are already making changes in their own lives and support an aggressive national response ( see graphs below ) .
The Concerned ( 33 percent ) are also convinced that global warming is a serious problem and support a vigorous national response .
Members of this group have signaled their intention to at least engage in consumer action on global warming in the near term , but they are less personally involved in the issue and have taken fewer actions than the Alarmed .
The Cautious ( 19 percent ) also believe that global warming is a problem , although they are less certain that it is happening than the Alarmed or the Concerned .
They do not view it as a personal threat , and do not feel a sense of urgency to deal with it .
The Disengaged ( 12 percent ) do not know and have not thought much about the issue at all and say that they could easily change their minds about global warming .
The Doubtful ( 11 percent ) are evenly split among those who think global warming is happening , those who think it is n’t , and those who do not know .
Many within this group believe that if global warming is happening , it is caused by natural changes in the environment .
They believe that it wo n’t harm people for many decades , if at all , and they say that America is already doing enough to respond to the threat .
The Dismissive ( 7 percent ) , like the Alarmed , are actively engaged in the issue , but are on the opposite end of the spectrum .
Most members of this group believe that global warming is not happening , is not a threat to either people or non-human nature , and strongly believe that it does not warrant a national response .
Very large proportions of the Alarmed and the Concerned are currently or intend to begin rewarding or punishing companies that are either enacting or opposing steps to reduce global warming .
Overall , 58 percent of Americans — 134 million adults — intend to reward or punish companies through their product purchases in the near term .
The primary barrier to this consumer action , however , is knowledge — 68 percent of these consumers say they simply do n’t know which companies to reward or punish .
More than half ( 52 percent ) of the Alarmed and 17 percent of the Concerned have already or intend to contact elected officials in the next 12 months to urge them to take action on global warming .
This represents a large potential “ issue public ” waiting to be mobilized .
These groups express strong support for a wide range of climate and energy policies .
This is shown , for example , by their strong support for regulating CO2 as a pollutant .
The very large size of the Concerned segment — one out of three American adults — and their increasing willingness to express their concern about climate change through changes in their consumer and political behavior , suggests that the United States could be rapidly approaching an important tipping point in public engagement .
Interest in personal energy conservation is even more common across all six groups , which may be motivated by a desire to save money , in addition to any advantages to the environment .
This reflects results drawn from the same data in a previously released report , “ Climate Change in the American Mind , ” which found that , by over a 5 - to - 1 margin , Americans believe changing their lifestyle to reduce carbon emissions would actually improve or have no impact on ( versus decrease ) their quality of life .
Policies that help people reduce their energy use through energy efficiency improvements thus receive wide support , regardless of individual opinions about climate change .
“ Climate Change in the American Mind ” also found that despite the economic crisis , more than 90 percent of Americans said the United States should act to reduce global warming , even if it has economic costs ( Figure 5 ) .
Likewise , 67 percent of Americans said , “ The United States should reduce its greenhouse gas emissions regardless of what other countries do ” ( Figure 6 ) .
The data for “ Global Warming ’s Six Americas ” and “ Climate Change in the American Mind ” was drawn from a nationally representative survey of 2,129 American adults in the fall of 2008 .
The survey questionnaire included extensive , in - depth measures of public climate change beliefs , attitudes , risk perceptions , policy preferences , behaviors , barriers to action , motivations , and values .
The charts below visualize some of the report ’s major findings .
The size of the circles and width of the columns represent the proportion of the American public in each audience segment .
The small cross at the center of each circle represents the segment average response to the question .
The ” 6 Americas ” fall on a scale from extremely sure to unsure that global warming is happening , with the majority somewhat to very sure that it is occurring .
The Alarmed and Concerned generally believe that global warming is currently harming or will harm Americans within the next 10 years or so , while the Cautious and Disengaged believe it will take 25 to 50 years .
The Doubtful and Dismissive believe it is very far off or will not occur at all .
Most Americans support an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ; only the Doubtful and Dismissive are opposed .
Most Americans strongly or somewhat support regulating CO2 as a pollutant .
Almost all Americans strongly or somewhat support rebates for the purchase of solar panels and fuel - efficient cars , including the Dismissive .
Few Americans have contacted their elected officials about global warming , although many of the Alarmed and Concerned say they intend to within the next year .
The majority of the Alarmed and Concerned plan to make purchasing decisions based on whether companies are enacting or opposing steps to reduce global warming .
Members of all six groups have made some energy efficiency improvements to their homes , which may come from a desire to save money , rather than the environment .
Anthony Leiserowitz is Director of Yale Project on Climate Change , Edward Maibach is Director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University , and Andrew Light is a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress and Director of the Center for Global Ethics at GMU .

Republicans have to say something to fill the time allotted to the opposition .
Imagine being trapped in the Republican debris , amid a poverty of ideas , and you can understand why they ’ve spent the past week trying to conquer a tactical molehill .
Never mind the mountains on the horizon — economic recovery , health - care reform , and landmark legislation on energy and global warming .
The Republicans have nothing credible to say on the first two ; and on the climate bill , the party of business is reduced to a faux populist attack on business for daring to agree to a cap and trade system to reduce carbon emissions .
So that leaves Guantánamo .
Polling suggests that the public agrees — narrowly — with the Republican position that the prison should stay open .
And Republicans can’t resist demagoguing the controversy by raising the specter of Waleed Hortons rampaging across the land .
The way the Republicans paint the picture , if Willie ’s Muslim brothers are brought to the U.S. , they will overcome manacles and isolation to execute the first ever break - out from a super - max federal penitentiary .
Democrats in Congress opened the Republican route up the molehill by refusing to fund the closure of Guantánamo until they saw the details .
Panicked by the absurd warnings of TIMBY — Terrorists in My Backyard — Democrats for the first time in a long time seemed cowed by the scare tactics on the other side .
In the end , though , this sound and fury will signify nothing .
The president , who wo n’t yield on closing the prison , will announce his plan .
His congressional majority will go along with it even as the Republicans threaten retribution at the polls in 2010 .
Some detainees will be transferred abroad ; some will be brought to the U.S. , and even tried here , while being incarcerated behind tons of steel and stone .
As the imagined danger fades , so will the issue — and the Republicans will be left to search for another expedient .
We know where they ’re likely to look .
When the tide is running against them , Republicans instinctively cling to national security as a life raft .
But they ’re now losing that issue , too .
Despite the Beltway blather about Dick Cheney putting the president on the defensive , a new survey from Democracy Corps shows that , for the first time in a generation , Obama has brought Democrats to parity with Republicans on handling national security .
Cheney himself , whether leading the charge on Guantánamo or rising in praise of torture , may be the president ’s best ally .
This dull Darth Vader contaminates every message he carries .
And has anyone noticed that the Cheney brag that waterboarding saved lives requires a stunning suspension of disbelief ?
It was George W. Bush who called a halt to this form of torture — despite Cheney ’s fervent pleas — before Obama ever took office and explicitly banned the practice .
Cheney ’s argument asks us to conclude that the president he disserved and the president he now denounces , both of whom saw the intelligence , consciously chose to risk the safety of Americans because they were too squeamish about the near drowning of alleged terrorists .
To John McCain ’s credit , he ’s warned that Republicans wo n’t find their way back by becoming the party of torture .
His friend , the level - headed former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge , has flatly disagreed with Cheney ’s unsubstantiated assertion that Obama has made the country less secure .
So do the majority of Americans ; in the Democracy Corps survey , they say that this president is “ doing better , not worse , than his predecessor ” on national security .
That stands to reason .
After all , why would Americans take advice from those like Cheney , who left the world in tatters , respect for America shredded , and our alliances strained ?
The last recourse of the rear guard , the only answer they have left , is that at least the nation has not been attacked at home since 2001 .
This is a blatant shift in their argument that reflects their fall from power .
In office , they constantly warned that another attack was inevitable ; now , if it comes , the convenient implication is that Obama ’s policies will have caused it .
It ’s bad enough that they might root for his failure on the economy .
That anyone should contemplate the political capital that could flow from another terrorist act on American soil is unthinkable .
So I have to believe that this is one instance where Cheney ’s patriotism trumps political calculation .
Allow me here to return the sentiment :
Even though I know that Cheney ’s omnipresence is an unmitigated boon to the Democrats , I ’ve reached the point where , for the sake of the country , I wish Dick Cheney would just go away .
OTTAWA – Canada 's ballooning $ 50 - billion deficit is " affordable , " Prime Minister Stephen Harper said today as he fended off political demands to dump his finance minister .
Opposition MPs jumped on news of Ottawa 's bigger than expected deficit as proof of the government 's mismanagement of the economy and demanded that Finance Minister Jim Flaherty be replaced .
" Canadians just cannot trust this government with their money .
Will the Prime Minister fire this minister of finance ? "
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said during Question Period .
Harper said the recession has meant growing payments to the unemployed and stimulus spending to communities coupled with lower tax revenues , which have all combined to cost federal coffers .
" We are borrowing money at historically low interest rates to help unemployed people , to build infrastructure .
That is what we should be doing and what we will continue to do , " the Prime Minister said .
" They ( the Conservatives ) have been incompetent , " Liberal MP John McCallum told reporters earlier today .
" They overspent when times are good so we have a far bigger deficit than we need had they been more fiscally prudent . "
The ballooning deficit , which Flaherty now says could exceed $ 50 billion , could change the political dynamic in Ottawa , tempting opposition parties into toppling the minority government before the summer recess .
But that would depend on how news of the bigger than expected deficit is received by the Canadian public , something that will take days , even weeks to unfold .
McCallum declined to be drawn into election speculation but added : " In a minority government setting , one can never rule out an election . "
He said after his party 's morning caucus meeting that the Liberals are taking aim at the Conservatives on three key points — reforming employment insurance , speeding stimulus spending and their record as an " incompetent fiscal manager . "
" Whether that will lead to an election , you can speculate , I will not , " he said .
But he was clear that the rising tide of red ink will not deter the Liberals from pressing the government to improve employment insurance benefits , even though that would mean billions of dollars more federal spending , McCallum said .
" To the extent that the economy is weaker than people thought , there will be even more unemployed people falling through the cracks who will need this assistance , " McCallum said .
Flaherty 's forecast of a $ 50 - billion revenue shortfall is $ 16 billion higher than he predicted in the budget only four months ago .
And McCallum pointed out that Flaherty 's November economic update did not foresee any budget deficits .
" Sadly , I 'm afraid this serves to further undermine confidence in our finance minister at a time when Canada desperately needs competence and strength at the helm in this area , " McCallum remarked .
" It 's incredible that the same person who told us in November that Canada would have nothing but surpluses forever now acknowledges he's the $ 50 - billion man . "
The Liberals are expected to demand Flaherty step down during the afternoon question period in the Commons .
There has been no indication that Flaherty 's job is in jeopardy as far as Prime Minister Stephen Harper is concerned .
Yesterday , McCallum called the deficit " a shocking number , " noting it is the largest deficit in Canadian history .
NDP finance critic Thomas Mulcair also took dead aim yesterday at Flaherty 's credibility .
" He 's wearing the dunce cap of all Canadian finance ministers , " Mulcair said of Flaherty .
" He swore up and down ( last fall ) that we would never go back to deficits .
Then he said there was not going to be a recession .
" If we want to get out of this mess , the government 's got to start telling the truth and the whole truth . "

Harper is facing increasing heat as the country 's economic problems worsen , with Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff threatening to topple the Conservative minority and force an election if the Tories continue to refuse to bring in major improvements to employment insurance during the recession .
But Flaherty said " it 's necessary in the short term to run a large deficit — relatively large — to make sure that Canada gets through this ( recession ) well . "
Previously , the worst yearly budget deficit was $ 39 billion , recorded by the Mulroney Tories in 1992 - 93 .
Flaherty 's revelation was the latest in a string of economic blows .
Fresh proof of how badly the economy is crashing came hours before , when it was reported that 10.6 per cent more people were receiving employment insurance payments in March than the previous month .
In the Commons , McCallum said the government 's deteriorating fiscal position reminds him of the unexpected budget deficit run up by the former Ontario Progressive Conservative government of which Flaherty was a part .
" In 2003 , the finance minister was a senior member of the Mike Harris government and they ran on a balanced budget .
Whoops , it turned out to be a big deficit , " McCallum said , adding that last fall Flaherty predicted budget surpluses , but that 's given way to a huge deficit .
" Why is the minister so bad with numbers ? " McCallum asked .
Fielding the question , Harper said , " Virtually every national government in the world is running a deficit .
Ours , by comparison , remains much lower than our competitors . "
NDP Leader Jack Layton took aim at the Conservatives for creating " the largest deficit we have seen in the history of Canada . "
" What do they have to show for it ?
There have been 400,000 people thrown out of work .
There should at least be some results for the steps that they have taken , but there are not any , " Layton said .
Flaherty said later the rising deficit was partly attributable to increasing EI payments , which he said would be several billion higher than the $ 19 billion budgeted for in January .
Ottawa is also committed to supporting the struggling auto industry , he noted .
He declined to say if next year 's prediction of a $ 30 billion deficit would also need to be revised .
But he insisted that the Conservatives would as planned bring the government out of deficit in four years without raising taxes .
Also , there are " some encouraging signs " in the economy , he said , adding that some analysts expect economic conditions to improve later this year and into next year .

When I accepted the invitation of the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) to attend the 2009 Offshore Technology Conference ( OTC ) in Houston on their dime , I could n't resist the offer out of sheer curiosity .
But I had little notion of how illuminating it would be , on so many levels .
This is n't your ordinary , bland - slide - decks - with - boring - exhibits conference .
It 's the cutting edge of the oil and gas business , or perhaps more accurately , the cutting edge of all industry : offshore , particularly deepwater ( over 1000 feet of water ) drilling .
Giant machines , sprawling constructions of pipe and pumps and electronics and incredibly high - tolerance parts litter the sprawling exhibit hall .
The speakers are top executives in the oil and gas industry , and policy leaders on energy and climate change .
Some 60,000 people from all over the globe will attend this year 's conference .
In short : It 's immense .
I could describe the utterly amazing technology on display here .
I could share what I learned about the oil and gas industry 's deep commitment to safety and minimizing its environmental impact .
I could inundate you with data and names and affiliations .
But that 's not what the discussion at this conference is about — not from my perspective .
The top issues of the energy industry revolve around policy more than technology .
Should we drill ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) ?
Can we achieve energy independence ?
How can we grapple with climate change without destroying the economy , and the sources of energy on which we utterly depend ?
Can renewables supplant fossil fuels ?
As critical as these policy debates are , I see little in the way of progress .
An Ironic Debate
I saw a parade of oil industry representatives plead for a transparent and fact - based public dialogue about our energy options for the future .
We should step away from the all - or - nothing debate on fossil fuels vs. renewables , they said , stop demonizing any of our potential energy sources , and get serious about addressing our energy problem before it 's too late .
As the head of the API said , " The energy issue will intensify until cooler heads prevail , " and the debate desperately needs to be depoliticized .
But in the next breath , apparently unaware of the obvious contradiction in it , I saw those same executives complain bitterly about the policymakers who stand in the way of their progress .
I heard them discount the potential of wind and solar to meet our energy needs , while trumpeting the much smaller footprint of modern oil and gas production .
I heard overblown claims about how technology will continually increase reserves , and how offshore drilling in America could solve our problems if only they were allowed to do it .
One executive decried the " cheap shots " taken at the oil and gas industry by climate change activists , and then a few moments later mentioned how much he liked a print ad that offered a false choice between offshore drilling and high gasoline prices .
I asked a panel of oil company executives how a potential 2 - 3 million barrels per day ( mbpd ) of new oil production from the OCS by 2030 ( according API and EIA data ) would figure against the background of steadily declining North American supply .
The only response I received was that 2 mbpd is a lot , we'd be happy to have it , and if we do n't start drilling for it now , we 'll regret it .
I heard not one word suggesting that oil production may have in fact peaked , no mention of decline rates , nor any hint that there might be any limits on supply other than the political will to develop new sources .
The oil and gas industry does acknowledge that the burning of their products probably contributes to climate change .
They are resigned to the fact that carbon will soon come with a price , and they are intent on helping to define how that will be done under the rubic that " If you 're not at the table , you 're going to be on the menu . "
At the same time , they seem to have a greater appetite for a political approach to the climate change debate than an objective evaluation of the data .
The green side of the debate is , unfortunately , no better .
An attendee stood before a panel of major oil company executives and ask how the energy industry could engage more fruitfully with policymakers and the public on climate change , then admitted that she had boycotted a recent local presentation by T. Boone Pickens about his energy plan for the country simply because he was an oil baron .
She considered it an act of conscientious objection .
The contradiction of her position apparently escaped her as well , along with the fact that of all the oil barons in America 's history , Boone is arguably the most forward - thinking and realistic , and a major proponent of moving beyond oil .
Her story offered a classic demonstration of how too - principled positions on energy so quickly lead to stalemates .

As a longtime advocate for renewable energy and a former solar system designer , I have been to my share of " green " conferences .
I have often heard the utterly unrealistic claims of renewable energy advocates , and listened to them vilify the oil industry .
They seem to have as little appetite for the facts on fossil fuels as the fossil fuel industry has for objective evaluation of renewables .
So while I agree with the conference speakers who called for a balanced , non-demonizing policy debate , what I see is both sides — the green / climate change side and the fossil fuel side — retreating to their corners , throwing up walls of propaganda , and demonizing the other side .
The middle ground , where truth and progress reside , feels virtually empty .
I am left to ponder , once again , why that is .
And once again I come to the conclusion that you can't make policy without politics .
What we have here is simply political maneuvering with each side trying to gain an edge by overstating their positions , in hopes that when the dust settles , they 'll be left holding something .
It is most emphatically not a neutral and balanced dialogue .
In fact , there is no dialogue at all .
Cleantech people go to cleantech conferences , and oil and gas industry people go to oil and gas conferences , and rarely do the two crowds mix .
In the halls of Congress there is much shouting , but little listening .
At the end of the day , it is the art of political compromise , not data , which drives policymaking .
The oil and gas industry remains mired in denial about the peak and decline of its products .
Renewable advocates are still lost in a dream about quickly replacing fossil fuels with green energy and an infrastructure that runs on it .
Climate change concernists continue to pin their hopes on visions that cannot possibly be realized in the time frames they need .
No side trusts the other .
Ten Inconvenient Truths
Allow me then to stake out a bit of middle ground , based on what I believe to be the objective facts , in an effort to bring the parties together and perhaps make some actual progress on the policy front .
We have extracted nearly all of the world 's easy , cheap oil and gas , and now we 're getting down to the difficult , expensive stuff .
The largest untapped resources that remain are in extreme places like deepwater and the Arctic , and marginal formations like shale .
As a result , global oil production has for all intents and purposes peaked .
Natural gas production will also peak in 10 to 15 years .
Neither technology nor high prices will change that .
Therefore we must begin to replace those fuels with renewables , and use what remains much more efficiently , with the expectation that most of the world 's oil and gas will be gone by the end of this century .
Drilling for oil and gas drilling in the OCS and ANWR must and will be done ; our need for those fuels is simply too great to pass them up .
An additional 2 - 3 mbpd will put a dent in the roughly 12 mbpd we now import , but if we drill for it now , it wo n't come to market for 10 years or more .
By that time , it probably wo n't even compensate for the depletion of conventional oil in North America , nor will it do much to reduce prices .
But it will be crucially necessary , and producing it wo n't make an ugly mess of the environment .
Renewables are clearly the long - term answer , as is an all - electric infrastructure that runs on its clean power .
However , it will likely take over 30 years for renewables to ramp up from a less than 2 % share of primary energy today to 20 % or more .
They probably wo n't even be able to fill the gap created by the decline of fossil fuels .
Oil and gas currently provide about 58 % of the world 's primary energy , and they will remain our primary fuels for a long time to come .
It will take many decades to reconfigure out transportation systems to run on electricity .
It will take decades to fix our wasteful , leaky built environment so that it does n't need as much energy to begin with .
None of the solutions will come quickly or easily .
Neither renewables nor fossil fuels nor nuclear power alone can bring " energy independence . "
Indeed , if independence means isolating ourselves from the rest of the world 's energy commerce , it might not even be desirable .
We must pursue all sources of energy immediately and aggressively if we hope to meet our future needs , and pitting one against another is counterproductive .
Nuclear power will not grow significantly in the next several decades , as nearly all of the existing reactors will need to be decommissioned within the next 20 years , and a new generation of reactors must be built to replace them .
After we do that , a renaissance for next - generation nuclear energy may be a possibility but it will only happen after we have confronted the crises of peak oil and peak gas .
It may produce no net reduction in emissions at all .
It is quite possible that even our best efforts on all fronts will not achieve the carbon emission targets we have set .
Climate change must be confronted via a unified policy on emissions and energy supply , which is to say that in our zeal to control emissions , we take care not to squelch the production of the oil and gas that constitutes the majority of our energy supply , at least until we have something to replace it .
To do so could have unintended and paradoxical consequences , like impeding the manufacture of renewable energy devices , and contributing to tight supply situations that once again cause fossil fuel prices to skyrocket and further damage the economy .
Rather than emphasizing the uncertainty on climate change data , and fomenting fear about the cost of mitigation , all sides must come together in a depoliticized dialogue strictly based on neutral scientific analysis .
We should use accurate and unbiased models of the future growth and decline curves of all forms of energy for policymaking — models based on historical data , not faith .
If the data says we 're likely to recover another 1.2 trillion barrels of oil worldwide and no more , then we should not assume that future drilling and technological progress will somehow turn that into 3 trillion barrels of recoverable oil .
Carbon emissions will soon come with a price .
Drilling the remaining prospects for oil and gas will be expensive :
From the decision to invest until first oil is produced , it can take 10 years and $ 100 million dollars to drill the first well in a new deepwater resource , using rigs that cost $ 1 million a day to run , and the production platform can cost as much as $ 5 billion .
Deploying thousands of wind turbines and square miles of solar will be expensive , slow , and difficult .
Replacing millions of inefficient internal combustion engine vehicles with electric and plug - in hybrids will be expensive .
Rebuilding the nation 's rail system will be hugely expensive .
In short , the good ol ' days of cheap electricity and gasoline are likely gone forever , and all the solutions going forward will be expensive .
I share the industry 's concern about energy illiteracy , but it cuts both ways .
It 's true that as long as oil and gas provide the majority of our energy supply , we must continue to invest and drill for it , and the industry must work hard to educate the public and policymakers about that .
But to claim that limits on drilling are the only problem , or that renewables cannot provide the energy we need in time , exploits that illiteracy and deliberately confuses the debate .
The fact is that there are good people and good intentions on all sides of the issues , and none of them wants to destroy the environment or the economy .
As I see it , neither the fossil fuel industry nor renewable boosters are yet willing to come out of their corners and work with each other in an honest fashion to develop a truly viable path forward on energy .
Until both sides put aside their exaggerated claims and partisan bickering , the public will remain confused about the true options and continue to use politics , not neutral data , as their guide .
That cannot produce good policy , and it does all of us a grave disservice .
Such unhelpful contentiousness , denial , and cheating on the numbers is a luxury we can no longer afford .
Our energy and climate change problems are real , they 're urgent , and they 're getting more so every day .
It 's time to set the tactics of the last war aside , wring politics out of the dialogue , and start grappling in an honest and direct way with real solutions .
Nothing else will do .
Next week , I 'll dive back into energy data , and share some observations about the impressive technology and the potential of offshore drilling .
Until next time ,

Last week I read in the morning paper about a street here where 60 out of 66 homes were vacant or abandoned on a single block .
The reporter called it a " ghost street . "
Yesterday I found myself in the area .
Other than an errant sofa , the street was completely empty , almost peaceful .
I took a photo of every house on the north side of one block and then stitched them together .
If you were to compare the current international housing crisis to a black hole sucking the equity out of our homes , this one - way street near the northern border of Detroit might just be the singularity : the point where the density of the problem defies anyone 's ability to comprehend it .
These homes started emptying in 2006 .
Click on the image below to load a large file in your browser and then zoom and scroll right .
This is the entire north side of the block : every home , every lot .
You 'll notice the fourth and seventh homes appear occupied .
Pay attention to the state of all the other houses rather than the terrible stitching job :
This is just another virtually - abandoned block in Detroit .
Eventually the burned houses will collapse ; the boarded - up houses will burn .
Someday it will all be green .
But this is what it looks like today .
* UPDATE *
I went back and took pictures of the houses on the south side of the road , just to show the extent of vacancy on this single block .
Again , click on the image and try to ignore the stitching job :
Poor people have I.Q. ’s significantly lower than those of rich people , and the awkward conventional wisdom has been that this is in large part a function of genetics .
After all , a series of studies seemed to indicate that I.Q. is largely inherited .
Identical twins raised apart , for example , have I.Q. ’s that are remarkably similar .
They are even closer on average than those of fraternal twins who grow up together .
If intelligence were deeply encoded in our genes , that would lead to the depressing conclusion that neither schooling nor antipoverty programs can accomplish much .
Yet while this view of I.Q. as overwhelmingly inherited has been widely held , the evidence is growing that it is , at a practical level , profoundly wrong .
Richard Nisbett , a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan , has just demolished this view in a superb new book , “ Intelligence and How to Get It , ” which also offers terrific advice for addressing poverty and inequality in America .
Professor Nisbett provides suggestions for transforming your own urchins into geniuses  praise effort more than achievement , teach delayed gratification , limit reprimands and use praise to stimulate curiosity  but focuses on how to raise America ’s collective I.Q .
That ’s important , because while I.Q. does n’t measure pure intellect  we ’re not certain exactly what it does measure  differences do matter , and a higher I.Q. correlates to greater success in life .
Tornadoes are one of the planet 's most photogenic natural disasters , and with zealous storm chasers hunting them each spring and summer , they 're well - documented on YouTube .
But as this year 's U.S. twister season hits its peak , we decided to sift through all that funnel footage and round up some of the videos that best convey these storms ' — and storm chasers ' — intensity .
6 ) An EF5 tornado , rotating at more than 200 mph , is a rare sight even in Tornado Alley .
But storm chaser Reed Timmer and friends caught up with this one — and almost vice versa .
It was the most severe storm in the deadly Great Plains Tornado Outbreak of May 3 , 1999 , generating the strongest winds ever recorded on Earth .
Timmer says this is what hooked him on storm chasing , which he 's been doing for 10 years since .
He 's also gotten better at holding a camera steady since then .
5 ) This giant wedge tornado was filmed a few hundred miles north of Tornado Alley in Manitoba , but it'd be right at home in Kansas or Oklahoma .
It gives the storm chasers a scare until it settles into a groove and churns around in place , but what it lacks in mobility it more than makes up for with size and power .
4 ) Filmed in Ellis , Colorado , in May 2007 , this tornado was on a mission .
The clip opens with a frantic scene — the chasers become the chased as they flee down the highway in reverse — but you can clearly see how wildly it 's rotating at several points , especially between the 1:35 and 2:20 marks , when it rips apart a building and several trees .
3 ) This clip of a quarter - mile - wide EF4 tornado in Manchester , South Dakota , has been called " the most amazing tornado footage of all time , " albeit by the guy who shot it .
But it 's Timmer again , and since his bio says he 's already seen 230 tornadoes in his decade of storm chasing , he 'd probably know as well as anyone .
Timmer lists this EF4 among his most " notable tornado intercepts . "
It was apparently also notable for someone in the background named Alex .
2 ) National Geographic produced this montage , which is basically its own " best tornado videos " clip .
Not only does it compile a bounty of great twister footage from around the country , but it 's set against a nice , subtle techno beat .
Cows reacting to a tornado is as funny as you 'd imagine , and watching people helplessly film their houses being obliterated is as painful as you 'd imagine .
1 ) Veteran storm chaser Jim Reed and his assistant Katie Bay discover this funnel cloud in the air above them before it touches down .
They 're lucky at first when it snakes away from them to land , but its invisible tip quickly becomes a roaring tornado that heads right for them .
Mexico passes bill on small - scale drugs possession Fri May 1 , 2009 8:39 pm EDT MEXICO CITY , May 1 ( Reuters ) - Mexico's Congress has passed a bill decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs , from marijuana to methamphetamine , as President Felipe Calderon tries to focus on catching traffickers .
The bill , proposed by Calderon after an attempt by the previous government at a similar bill came under fire in the United States , would make it legal to carry up to 5 grams ( 0.18 ounces ) of marijuana , 500 milligrams ( 0.018 ounces ) of cocaine and tiny quantities heroin and methamphetamines .
The lower house of deputies passed the bill late on Thursday .
It already has been approved by the Senate and is expected to be signed into law by Calderon in the days ahead .
Mexico's Congress passed a similar proposal in 2006 but the bill was vetoed by Calderon 's predecessor , Vicente Fox , after Washington said it would increase drug abuse .
The United States recently pledged stronger backing for Calderon 's army - led war on drug cartels , whose turf wars have killed some 2,000 people so far this year in Mexico , as the drug violence is starting to seep over the border .
The new bill also allows Mexican states to convict small - time drug dealers , no longer making it a federal crime to peddle narcotics , a move that should speed up those cases .
U.S. President Barack Obama praised Calderon 's drug war efforts in a visit to Mexico last month and promised more agents and southbound border controls to curb the flow of guns and cash to the cartels .
( Reporting Miguel Angel Gutierrez ; Editing by Bill Trott )
... and nobody north of the Rio Grande seems to have noticed .
Last week , I wrote that the Mexican decrim bill had passed the Senate , but on the afternoon before we published that report , the bill also passed the Chamber of Deputies .
Now it awaits only the signature of President Calderon .
While a Dallas Morning
News blogger wrote that it is unclear whether Calderon will sign the bill , it seems likely to me that he will .
The bill , after all , was pushed by his ruling PAN party , and unlike 2006 , when a similar bill passed only to be vetoed by then President Fox in the face of US threats and bluster , there have been no threats and bluster from Washington this time .
And , of course , the situation in Mexico is much worse than in 2006 , thanks largely to Calderon 's war on the cartels .
The bill is not great :
The personal use quantities are tiny , and it allows for the states to prosecute low - level trafficking offenses ( currently , that is the province of the feds , with the result being that being low - level traffickers are never tried because the federal prosecutors and courts are overwhelmed with serious trafficking cases ) .
But it is decriminalization , and right on our border , not an ocean away , like Portugal .
I 'll be talking to people on both sides of the border this week about this bill and what it means and I 'll have a feature article on it Friday .
In the meantime , here 's the lone Reuters article on these momentous events :
GOP can't do squat without the help of these 2 ugly galoots
Dear Howard ,
Tuesday was a historic day : President Obama nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the United States Supreme Court .
I am thrilled the president has chosen such a qualified nominee and , at the same time , moved toward a Supreme Court that looks more like America .
Judge Sotomayor would be the first Latina , and only the third woman , to serve on the nation 's highest court .
Judge Sotomayor 's vast knowledge of the law , excellent temperament and lifetime of experiences make her a great choice .
She 's authored about 400 legal opinions , and she understands how laws affect people , businesses and government .
Judge Sotomayor has more federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in the past century and has garnered bipartisan support :
She was appointed to the District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H.W. Bush and the Second Circuit by President Bill Clinton .
Despite all of her qualifications , Republicans stand ready to obstruct .
On Tuesday , de facto party spokesman Rush Limbaugh went so far as to accuse President Obama , and Judge Sotomayor , of racism .
" Obama is the greatest living example of a reverse racist and now he 's appointed one ... Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court , " he said .
With statements like that from Limbaugh , we can expect to have a fight on our hands .
You can be assured , however , that the DSCC , the branch of the Democratic Party solely dedicated to electing more Democrats to the Senate , is working hard every day to elect senators who will give President Obama 's nominees a fair hearing .
It 's what America expects of us .
Sincerely ,
Robert Menendez
There 's really no clear definition as to what exactly is an activist judge according to Nelson , but apparently none of President George W. Bush 's nominees were .
Nelson was the only Democrat to vote for Janice Rogers Brown , one of Bush 's most conservative and controversial judicial picks , and was one of only a couple of Democrats who supported Samuel Alito and John Roberts for the Supreme Court and John Bolton for UN ambassador .
Nelson also backed both John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales for Attorney General .
Nelson explained in an op -ed for the Omaha World Herald that his only criteria for a " good judge " is one that is not an activist .
How did he know Alito was not an " activist judge ? "
Well , because Alito told him so , of course .
In my meeting with Judge Alito on Nov. 2 , he assured me that he was carrying no political agenda to the bench .
I asked him if he envisioned himself carrying a hammer and chisel and looking to forge new law .
He assured me that he would consider each case on its merits and would bring no agenda to the bench .
The open secret about the politicization of the judiciary in this country is that right - wing judges are just as " activist " -- if not more so -- than left - wingers .
The myth about the Supreme Court being a group of impartial umpires is especially strong , but categorically false .
Supreme Court Scholar Jeffrey Toobin recently called out Chief Justice Roberts for faithfully serving the interests and values of the GOP .
Jeffrey Rosen , the writer who began the whisper campaign against Sotomayor before she was nominated , called Alito a " conservative activist ... [ willing to ] overstep judicial boundaries to further right - wing ideology , " and threw Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia in that category as well .
Almost everybody cheers for the underdog -- maybe not those born to upper - class standing with great advantages , but those of us who were n't always want the little guy to be victorious .
We want hard work and extra effort to be rewarded .
Standing at the front of the East Room of the White House Tuesday morning were two Americans who clearly had started life as underdogs .
One is now our president , son of a Kenyan .
The other is the daughter of Puerto Rican parents who is about to sit on the highest court in the land .
Both were born without privilege .
Both were raised in households with little cash , but much love .
Both were raised by strong , devoted mothers who worked hard to support them .
Both were encouraged that through hard work and education they could go beyond the boundaries of their environment and their class .
Somehow the flame of ambition was lit and both became outstanding students who did n't need affirmative action programs to get to the top of their class .
Both are extraordinary role models for the next generation of Americans and both will be historic figures .
And the important thing is that both President Obama and Judge Sonia Sotomayor never forgot where they came from or the people who helped them move forward to such heights .
It was a day to make all Americans proud .
Now we begin a process that might not make Americans proud .
The Senate confirmation hearings for Sotomayor will begin in the coming weeks and already the long knives are out .
The historic role of the Senate to advise and consent to a president 's judicial nominations has become in the last few years a process of " attack and condemn . "
Unfortunately , the battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party that has raged for the last several weeks is now spilling over into the debate over Sotomayor 's ideology and judicial temperament .
The challenge has been laid down by conservative commentators that " if not now , when ! "
The terms " radical liberal " and " reverse racist " are being bantered about , with more to come .
Those who have not been able to lay a glove on President Obama , with his 60 percent - plus approval ratings , now think they can define him by smearing Sotomayor .
For a political party that lost an election just six months ago by 9 ?
million votes , the second largest vote margin of defeat ever for a Republican presidential candidate , you would think we would shut our mouths and figure out how to get more votes in the future .
But instead we have gotten into a raging debate over the purity of the party and who 's a better Republican .
Dick Cheney , Colin Powell , Tom Ridge , Karl Rove , Rush Limbaugh and even Meghan McCain have had their say along with the new party chairman , Michael Steele .
But a political party is not a religion .
We do n't get up every weekend and go to our church or synagogue or mosque or wherever else we might practice our beliefs and pay homage to the great tenets of the Republican Party , or the Democratic Party for that matter .
Of all the things that are important to me , I do n't get up every morning and say first and foremost I 've got to go out and be a good Republican today and spread the gospel and beat up on President Obama and the wretched Democrats .
Like most Americans , I wake up every day and think about my wife , my daughter , my friends , my neighbors , my job and go to work .
I worry about my favorite sports teams and whether they won or lost .
I do think of myself as an American and thank the almighty that I have that privilege .
And as an American , I do worry about the direction of my country and the decisions made by our elected leaders .
That is where political parties matter .
Political parties are vehicles to help elect people to office .
Elected officials are the name of the game .
And what people do when they are elected is what matters to most Americans .
Here is where the conduct of the Republican Senators will have a big impact on the future of this party in this crucial rebuilding period .
Sotomayor will have a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court .
Senators , both Democrats and Republicans , have a right and an obligation to question her and get to know her views .
But they must treat her with the respect she deserves and has earned .
Let me state that I am sure Sotomayor and I do n't agree on very much .
And I am sure some of her liberal rulings will drive me nuts .
But President Obama won , is a liberal and gets to put liberals on the court .
That 's the way it works .
Ideology aside , is she qualified ?
There can be no debate over her qualifications .
Her lifetime achievements in the academic world , in the legal world and the judicial world are unchallengeable .
If that was the only measure , she would be confirmed unanimously .
That is n't going to happen !
We are into full - bore political battle within the Republican Party , with conservatives and pragmatists arguing over what are the best tactics to stop the direction that this young president and his congressional allies are taking us .
But I just offer a word of caution .
The confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor is not the battle to be waged and it wo n't be won .
No one should be brutalized like Judge Robert Bork was in the 1980s .
And no one should be rubber - stamped either .
Sotomayor is not deserving to be on the Supreme Court because she is Puerto Rican or a woman .
She has been appointed by the president because she is extremely well - qualified .
Judge those qualifications fairly and without malice .
To do less will antagonize Hispanic and female voters , two voter groups Republicans must do better with to have any chance of electoral success .
In 1981 when Sandra Day O'Connor was nominated by President Reagan to be the first woman on the court , she was confirmed unanimously .
When Antonin Scalia was nominated , also by President Reagan , he was confirmed 98 - 0 .
He was the first American of Italian descent appointed to the court .
Sotomayor , if confirmed , will be the 111th judge to sit on the court .
One - hundred - six white men , two African - American men and two white women have gone before her .
The appointment of a Hispanic - American is long overdue .
Appointing another woman is critical also .
But she 's there because of her own accomplishments , not her gender or her heritage .
Republicans are in a position where we are the underdogs .
Unfortunately , no one is cheering for us to win .
These nationally televised hearings may be an opportunity for Republican senators to take a step in the right direction .
Do n't treat her like a lady .
Treat her like an extremely qualified American who the president chose to elevate to the nation 's highest court .
It 's easy enough to dismiss par - for - the - course , totally predictable racism from sordid , partisan characters like Limbaugh Tancredo and Gingrich .
I 'm sure President Obama warned Sonia Sotomayor exactly the kind of vicious buzzsaw she'd be walking into if she accepted his nomination .
Yesterday , I got a fundraising beg from Senator Bob Menendez , chair of the NRSC .
Pretty boilerplate and the emphasis is his .
Menendez is correct , Limbaugh will rile up a whole pack of craven reactionaries in the Senate , from Richard Burr ( R- NC ) , Jim Bunning ( R- KY ) , Jim DeMint ( R- SC ) , Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , Johnny Isakson ( R - GA ) , Robert Bennett ( R- UT ) , Sam Brownback ( R- KS ) to David Diapers Vitter ( R- LA ) , Chuck Grassley ( R- IA ) , Blanche Lincoln ( D - AR ) and Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) .
Blanche Lincoln Ben Nelson ?
Sure .
There are a handful of Democratic senators ( and candidates ) who have to face the voters in 2010 and whose every move is predicated not on principle but on electoral calculus .
There 's no Democrat worse in that regard than WalMart 's representative in the U.S. Senate Blanche Lincoln .
Lincoln and Nelson sound about as supportive of the president 's nomination as do half the Republicans !
" Concerning Judge Sotomayor ’s nomination , I look forward to examining her entire record and commitment to upholding the law and Constitution of the United States in the coming weeks . "
That could be John Cornyn or Lamar Alexander .
But it 's ole Ben Nelson .
Lincoln , as usual , sounds just like your garden variety Republican shill .
“ I believe the people of Arkansas and our nation deserve a Supreme Court Justice who is able to interpret and apply the law fairly without political favor or bias .
Ensuring that a nominee meets this standard is an obligation I have sworn to uphold as a United States Senator , and moreover , is the standard that Americans expect for a lifetime appointment to our nation ’s highest court .
"
Oh , wait !
I hope I did n't insult Maine Senator Olympia Snowe ( R ) by inadvertantly comparing Blanche Lincoln to Republicans .
Snowe was far less afraidf to show her enthusiasm for Obama 's choice than the craven , hackish and cowardly Lincoln .
Snowe : " Indisputably , this is an historic selection , as Sonia Sotomayor is just the third woman to be nominated to The Court and the first Hispanic American .
I commend President Obama for nominating a well - qualified woman , as I urged him to do during a one - on - one meeting on a variety of issues in the Oval Office earlier this month .
So the DSCC is worried about " a fight on our hands ? "
It is n't the rump of a Republican Party that is watering down all of President Obama 's bills and killing chances for real change .
The Republicans alone do n't have the power to do all the damage the Senate has been doing .
They can only do it with the help of treacherous bought - off handmaidens of the corporate elites that normally lavish all their bribes on Republicans but who have found a handful of conservative Democrats to champion their causes .
The DSCC wants help keeping Blanche Lincoln in her seat ?
That 's where a portion of every single cent you donate to them goes -- to the woman who single - handedly is killing Employee Free Choice at the behest of the Walton family ( WalMart ) .
Support Lincoln ?
How about working to defeat her instead ?
I 'm hearing that the unions are going to try -- even if it means electing a Republican .
Ed Rollins has been a GOP operative for a long time .
He 's probably best known because he directed Reagan 's 1984 presidential campaign but he has always been a target of great enmity from George H.W. Bush and his last big brush with fame was in 2007 when , as campaign manager for Mike Huckabee , he was overheard saying that he wanted to " knock out " Mitt Romney 's teeth .
He and Huckabee certainly are n't on the same page regarding the Sotomayor nomination .
He should be allowed to knock Romney 's teeth down his throat , especially now that the two - faced Mormon bigot has decided to play a little demagoguery game with the nomination .

Of President Obama 's stated goals for the taxpayers ' investment in General Motors --" To get G.M. back on its feet , take a hands - off approach and get out quickly " -- the middle one is likely to work against those at either end .
The government can't hope to fix G.M. and sell it off without getting under the hood .
Over decades now of restructuring plans at the company , two things have demonstrably not helped get much done : Money and time .
The government can't simply give more of each to the automaker .
What 's needed is forceful , even ruthless , leadership to insist on the changes that everyone -- the managers , the union leadership , the dealers , everyone -- has known were necessary for about 20 years now .
Fritz Henderson , GM 's CEO , has earned a reputation as an able guy who understands the business and the company he grew up in .
But without someone above him bringing the hammer down -- repeatedly - - he's going to have the same problem busting through the culture that frustrated his worthy predecessors , like Jack Smith .
And if the government is really going to attempt to stand back , rather than insist on a particular direction , it 's likely only to complicate Henderson 's job by allowing him to be buffeted by all sorts of political cross-pressures .
Already , according to The Washington Post , John Dingell has written Henderson to complain about plans to close the Willow Run Transmission Plant in Ypsilanti , Michigan , where roughly 1200 workers build four - and six - speed transmissions for rear - wheel - drive vehicles ( half the workers will be transferred to a similar plant in Toledo ) .
President Obama ’s recent decision to release memos that describe the Bush administration ’s policy of torturing detainees in terrorism cases has raised a greater outcry among the ideological supporters of torture than actually banning the techniques did .
But if the question of whether it is appropriate to repeatedly waterboard a prisoner , keep him awake for 11 straight days , and confine him in a box filled with stinging insects amounts to a " policy difference , " as Sen .
John McCain recently claimed , why not release all the secret memos , shed light on how these policies have been implemented , and then debate the results ?
If this is merely a policy dispute , similar to debates about the estate tax or Social Security , why would those who support the torture of detainees fight to hide the policy that they believe is right from public view ?
After all , good ideas ought to be able to hold their own in open discussion .
But the truth is that this is about far more than a policy difference , and it is about far more than finding the most efficacious method of gathering intelligence .
The question of what values we should compromise in the pursuit of security is a question of conscience .
And so the desire of the apologists of torture to keep the torture memos and similar artifacts out of the public ’s eye is illuminating .
It is analogous to the criminal ’s desire to erase his trail and destroy all evidence of his crime .
At every step , torture supporters are fighting to increase and make permanent the cognitive and emotional distance that separates them from the crimes in which they have been co-conspirators .
They claim that it is about " moving on . "
No doubt any criminal would prefer to skip the indictment , the trial , and the conviction in favor of having the charges dropped so that he or she can " move on " and " look forward , not backward . "
Observe how the torture apologists constantly attempt to shift the debate away from what is concrete – narratives of a specific individual who was tortured by U.S. interrogators , photographs of torture taking place at Abu Ghraib , and memos describing and authorizing torture techniques in gruesome detail – to abstract questions of efficacy and hypothetical , " what - if " narratives about national security .
In a recent interview on Fox News , former vice president Dick Cheney , one of the most vocal and prominent American supporters of torture , condemned Obama ’s decision to release the memos on the grounds that Obama had not also released memos that supposedly show that torture " works , " i.e. , that it is an effective way of getting information from detainees .
But we heard no explanation from Cheney of how torturing another human being is consistent with a humane and just system of values .
One might also ask whether Cheney has ever witnessed the techniques he endorses , or been present while they were implemented , or inflicted them himself .
The struggle over the word " torture , " too , is a prime example of this desire of torture apologists to remove themselves from what they support .
Certainly , " torture " is a political word with political consequences .
But if television networks and newspapers think they are being neutral and apolitical by describing torture as " enhanced interrogation , " they ought to think again .
The adjective " enhanced " implies that enhanced interrogation is a superior form of ordinary interrogation or formal questioning .
" Enhanced interrogation " is a euphemism for torture , and its use is one more technique that allows torture supporters to maintain distance between their consciences and their crimes .
These distancing techniques allow torture apologists to attempt to reclaim the high ground in the debate by turning it into a conversation about who is ready to make the " tough calls " that are supposedly " necessary to keep American safe . "
The argument runs something like this :
Some go on about human rights , American values , and international law , but at the end of the day , the challenges we face require that we go beyond ordinary interrogation in favor of " enhanced " interrogation .
For all their supposed tough - nosed realism , however , torture supporters seem remarkably uncomfortable with hearing the details of exactly what they support .
For all their eagerness to confront and defeat America ’s enemies at all costs , their approach is decidedly more managerial than in - the - trenches ; not only are the ideologues of torture the the ones giving the orders , casting the votes , and providing the intellectual rationalizations from afar rather than anywhere near the dungeons where their fantasies are made real upon real human beings , they do n’t even want to hear or see the details , after the fact , of what they have done .
That , more than any argument , ought to tell us something about the justice of their cause .

China has embarked on a series of joint projects with Britain in Africa , with the aim of avoiding the abuses and mistakes committed by former colonial powers as it rapidly increases its economic role on the continent .
China invested $ 4.5bn in infrastructure in Africa in 2007 , more than the G8 countries combined , and much of the investment has been private .
The number of Chinese companies operating in Africa has more than doubled in just two years to 2,000 , with about 400 operating in Nigeria alone , according to new research .
In contrast to the " one- dimensional " stereotype of state - owned enterprises extracting natural resources , most of the investment is from privately - owned firms and many are involved in manufacturing .
However , many of the business practices followed by those companies , such as a preference for using Chinese workers , coupled with Beijing 's belief that human rights are the preserve of host country governments , have led to claims that the rapid rise in Chinese influence in Africa has not helped its human rights .
" The Chinese firms that are moving are building infrastructure , they are building roads , they are providing jobs for people , but at the same time : what they are not doing , neither the Chinese government nor the companies , is raising any issues about how the population are being treated , " Irene Khan , Amnesty International 's secretary general , said today .
" Therefore we find that the Chinese presence is not helping the human rights situation .
It might be aggravating it when revenues and resources are being paid into coffers of hugely corrupt and oppressive governments . "
In an apparent reflection of Chinese anxiety over its reputation in Africa , both embassies and companies have been urged by Beijing to forge closer links to local communities .
China has also entered into a partnership with Britain 's department for international development , ( Dfid ) intended to monitor and control the social and environmental impact of Chinese investment .
In the Democratic Republic of Congo , for example , Dfid is working with the government and Chinese companies to fund the drafting of social and environmental standards that road building projects will have to adhere to , and to carry out assessments of the impact of the new roads .
Until now , most attention has focused on the multibillion - pound infrastructure - for - resources deals which China has signed with African governments .
The problem facing such government - to - government programmes is that the projects are no longer being carried out by central planners , but by a plethora of Chinese firms .
Evidence from more than 100 interviews with businesspeople and officials in both China and Africa indicates that more than 80 % of the companies operating on the continent are privately owned .
In 2006 , the Chinese EXIM Bank estimated that there were only about 800 Chinese companies in Africa .
" These entrepreneurs have an agenda of their own , which they have been left free to pursue by the Chinese government .
It is the usual one of the pursuit of profit and the exploitation of business and market opportunity , " said dr Jing Gu , a research fellow at Sussex University 's Institute of Development Studies , which carried out the research .
She said Chinese businesses were well placed to tap into what some called " the last golden land " because of similarities to the Chinese market of the 1980s and 90s , and because there was so much competition domestically .
" The Chinese private entrepreneur ... is willing to take a long view and endure tough contemporary conditions and relatively low returns to be able to entrench himself locally , " she argued .
Plummeting exports to Europe and America – with trade hit by both the appreciating renminbi and the global economic crisis – have increased the keenness to move into new markets .
One Chinese newspaper described Africa as " the best refuge for sunstroke prevention from the financial crisis " .
While Beijing has encouraged businesses to move into overseas markets , officials monitor activity so loosely that many of the firms
Gu studied have not even registered their investments .
According to official figures , only 4 % of China 's foreign direct investment went to Africa in 2006 , compared to 26 % to Latin America and 64 % to Asia .
But
Gu said the pace of growth has been rapid .
While some firms employ significant amounts of local labour in Africa , Gu said resentment was building up in some places .
" Specific problems do arise because of the tendency of Chinese to behave quite ethno- centrically .
They prefer to employ their own people ; not so much Chinese nationals , as people from the same regions or even extended families as themselves , whom they know and are used to .
" Also , the Chinese work ethic is to work very hard , long hours for little money , hoping eventually to establish themselves in an area , to be able to replace others .
Some of them even import some labour illegally to get around local immigration restrictions .
This does produce some social tension and even violence between Chinese and Africans in such countries as Nigeria , Ghana and Madagascar , " she said .
" But there is also recognition of the actual and potential benefits of China 's involvement . "
Web market share for the iPod touch has tripled in just five months , outpacing even the iPhone among mobile devices .
Also , Windows ' share has dropped to its lowest point since tracking began even as the Mac managed to hold its ground .
While the iPod touch in November accounted just 0.05 percent of all the use on the tens of thousands of websites tracked by stats firm Net Applications , its use has seen steady gains that put the touchscreen Wi -Fi device at 0.15 percent — still small , but a threefold increase in its footprint in less than half a year .
i Phone share also grew substantially during the period but , despite having either 2G or 3G cellular Internet access , moved just one and a half times up from 0.37 percent of all web traffic to 0.55 percent .
The researchers do n't attempt to explain the discrepancy themselves .
However , the rapidly closing gap can be partly assigned to runaway sales of the iPod touch , which doubled in one year , even in the face of a poor economy and wider iPhone availability .
Analysts have also noted that software from the App Store is driving iPod touch sales , while the player is also more affordable and more readily available .
Customers are n't tied to a monthly service fee , are n't limited to particular cellphone carriers and do n't have to live in certain countries .
As has been the case for a long time , Apple continues to have the largest share by far of all mobile operating systems ; Java ME comes closest at 0.07 percent .
i Pod touch web market share , ranging from 0.04 percent to 0.15 percent .

On the desktop , Apple is n't seeing quite the same explosive growth as in mobile but still has some reason to be content .
Mac share dipped very slightly to 9.73 percent , but Windows continued its steeper descent and fell to 87.9 percent — the first time the company has dipped below 88 percent since Net Applications started its tracking and part of a consistent long - term decline .
The iPhone and iPod touch ate significant parts of this share but were also helped by Linux , which crested over the 1 percent mark for the first time .

Cold stored fruits and vegetables are the next best thing to fresh - picked .
Flavor and texture change little and nutritional value remains high .
They keep for an amazingly long time .
This and the great variety which can be stored make it a technique well worth using .
Compared to canning , and even to freezing and drying , little is involved in preparation .
This time savings greatly increases the ability to retain valuable produce .
By cellaring a large percentage of the harvest , these other more expensive or time consuming methods can be reserved for where each is truly superior for a particular finished product sweet corn frozen on the cob , canned relish , and spicy beef jerky , for example .
Cold storing also lengthens the time span in which foods can be processed for preservation by the other methods .
Fruits and vegetables can be moved at leisure from cellar to dryer or canning kettle and to the freezer as this space is vacated .
Even if you do n’t garden , cold storage can still be used to take advantage of low prices of the autumn cornucopia at local farms .
Or better yet , it can provide an opportunity to benefit by participating more extensively in community supported agriculture .
And as a bonus , we will see how certain roots ( including the noble asparagus ) can be tricked into producing delectable sprouts in the dead of winter .
A properly designed and well built root cellar is a marvel of appropriate technology .
It soon returns its cost and will ultimately return it many times over .
However , in the beginning , the problem of the initial investment can be the main drawback to opting for a walk - in unit .
Many of us , therefore , have for a time resorted , with varying degrees of success , to the traditional pit / mound storage .
And even after having built a full - size walk - in facility , pits are still often useful in handling the overflow of a bumper crop .
When properly done , their contents will not freeze ( except in the far north or at great elevation ) in even the coldest weather .
Over most of the northern United States and southern Canada the temperature inside tends to average between 50 and 55 degrees F. , being moderated by the earth below frost line .
This , however , is not nearly cold enough to produce the maximum possible storage life for most kinds of produce which do best from just above freezing up to 40 degrees or so .
It is also impossible with the old style “ squirrel job ” to regulate humidity or add warmth to counter extreme cold .
Other disadvantages of the traditional pit are the difficulty of access after a rain and hard freeze or a heavy snowfall , and having to take all of the contents of a particular installation at once due to the near impossibility of safely re-closing the mound under these conditions .
All of these limitations are overcome by this new development .
Figure 1 .
The vertical wooden duct
Pit storage
The crux of the system is three fold :
1 . A vertical wooden duct ( Figures 1 and 2 ) around which the produce is arranged
2 . The produce contained in sacks attached at intervals along a rope ( Figure 3 )
3 . A well box ( Figure 4 ) supporting an access hatch several feet above ground level .
The central duct provides several key features .
It serves variously to :
( a ) introduce cold outside air to the bottom of the pit when the temperature must be lowered
( b ) allow the installation of a hot or cold object when the temperature must be adjusted
( c ) admit a cloth sack containing a moisture absorbing , desiccant material to reduce humidity
( d ) channel water to the interior when humidity must be increased , and
( e ) to permit the temporary placement of a thermometer and hygrometer to monitor these variables .
The sack and rope arrangement allows easy access to a small amount of produce for consumption , or efficient removal and replacement of the entire contents for inspection .
Spacing the bags a sufficient distance apart along the rope permits hauling each without having to disturb the one behind it .
A combination of two easily tied and released knots readily fastens sacks to the main line .
Figure 2 . Internal cutaway view of well housing over the central duct
Construction of such a storage involves digging a square hole encircled at ground level by a shallow , gravel filled , drainage trench , installing the lower stage duct assembly , positioning the well box , and banking it with earth ( Figure 5 ) .
At storage time the produce is lowered into place , the upper stage is positioned , and the space between the top of the produce and the hatch is filled with sacks of insulation fixed to a separate long line system .
Except for occasional inspection and monitoring , that ’s it .
Perfect control of such an installation as with any root cellar is a little bit science and a whole lot of art .
But it ’s really not all that complicated or critical .
The great advantages of this decentralized storage are that it permits tailoring conditions to perfectly suit a particular kind of fruit or vegetable and provides a built in safety factor against any errors .
If detailed records are kept to help in pushing the limits from year to year , it becomes a challenging as well as rewarding hobby .
Managing your storage
You must watch the weather like a hawk , taking advantage of cold nights to lower the temperature prior to storing your produce in the fall .
Moisture may occasionally have to be added during dry spells or regularly in very dry climates .
This applies to all but a few varieties which require dry conditions .
When these are stored , the hole should be lined with plastic sheet if there is any appreciable amount of ground moisture .
In any case , this will reduce the amount of desiccant which must be used .
These sacks can be installed as necessary to remove the moisture inevitably brought in by the small amount of air which must be allowed to circulate .
This air is needed to provide oxygen for respiration and remove the waste products of plant metabolism .
Heat may need to be added from time to time to maintain the warmer temperatures preferred by some varieties or to keep the contents from freezing in extreme cold .
It ’s also important to inspect the contents every couple of weeks to remove any “ bad apples . ”
Happily this system makes short work of all this .
Figure 3 .
Bags strung together that are used to lower produce into  or remove it from  your cold storage pit .
The cold storage treatment list in Table 1 will give an overview of what can be kept and for about how long under specific conditions .
Tips for handling each and the general time for planting and / or harvesting have also been included .
This schedule is for areas where the first autumn frost occurs around mid October and will require adjustment north or south .
The varying number of days to maturity for specific varieties of a given fruit or vegetable must also be figured in .
Planting is timed so each crop is fully mature but not overripe when stored .
This challenge is part of what makes this game such fun .
Each type of produce is put away as late in the season as its tolerance for cold will permit .
The protracted harvest season extends from the first light frost to just before the ground freezes solid , and even the onset of this condition can be postponed by heavy mulching .
In any case , nothing should be stored away until after the weather has turned reliably cold .
Gardening for cold storage extends your land ’s potential by making use of space vacated by early and mid summer crops , and the later time of sowing and reaping extends your personal potential for satisfying work at self - provision .
Preparing produce
A garden fork is the most efficient tool for digging .
Roots should be dug and fruits picked in the cool morning hours .
The ground should be somewhat dry , this way there is less clinging earth , and what there is can be more gently removed without the need for washing .
Any remaining light dusting of soil is harmless with final washing being done just prior to cooking .
When circumstance necessitates digging from wet ground , clinging soil must be allowed to dry somewhat in the shade before removal .
Sometimes , harvesting must unavoidably be done later in the day .
In this case , everything should be kept overnight in a cold sheltered place to remove every possible degree of remaining field heat before storage the following morning .
This is important because warm produce will continue to lose moisture even in a highly humid environment .
As with most ventures , location is important .
Installations should be as close as possible to the house for convenience , in well drained high ground , and on the cooler north side of a large sheltering object such as the house , garage , shed , or barn .
The opposite and warmer south side would be a better choice in the far north .
Considering location on a larger scale , any place where the average winter temperature is 30 degrees F. is ideal .
However , cold storage is still practical as far south as to where the average is around 45 degrees , but a shorter storage life must be expected .
If you are new either to gardening or to your area , statistics of first frost , killing frost , hard freeze , and average winter temperature can all be had from the local weather bureau or agricultural extension service .
However , these dates can vary due to micro climates produced by terrain , so your own written records , or those of a dedicated gardening neighbor , will prove more accurate .
Another important consideration , the depth of the water table , can be provided by a local well driller .
It should be at least ten feet below the bottom of your excavation , and the lower the better .
It is best not to store fruits and vegetables together because gas given off by fruits can cause vegetables to ripen sooner and sprout or blanch , and the strong odor of vegetables can taint the delicate flavor of fruits .
Everything should be handled gently and as little as possible .
Immediately trim tops to prevent their wilting or drawing vitality from the roots .
Beware of anything sharpthings like the protruding ends of staples , nails , wire and splinters , as well as your own fingernails that can damage your produce .
And again , put off the harvest as long as possible while yet leaving a margin for the unexpected .
This is important mainly because cold induces the concentration of sugars and starches thus replacing water which would more easily be lost , and so shorten storage life .

The roots of the plants specified in the cellar gardening list will produce crisp , living sprouts for salads to compliment the cooked vegetables of winter meals .
This a good way to make use of specimens in some way not fit for long storage or those going soft by late season .
After being packed closely in soil in wooden crates or other suitable containers , the roots are exposed to freezing conditions as they would be in a natural setting .
When later introduced to the warmer environment of a cellar or unheated room , this artificial spring will induce them to sprout .
Though not quite as vitamin rich as when grown in light , they are a welcome mid-winter treat .
Some varieties such as dandelion , usually on the bitter side , are more mildly flavored when sprouted in darkness , and blanched witloof chicory is a real delicacy .
The drawing figures 6 through 9 show how to quickly make a hitch at any point along the main line for attachment of the individual sacks .
The neck of each sack will be secured by a short length of rope tied in a millers knot as illustrated in figures 10 through 14 .
To tie this knot twist and pinch the gathered neck of the sack between the thumb and first finger of your nonprimary hand .
Hold about a third of the rope as shown in figure 10 , grasping the long end with your other hand .
Bring it around , temporarily pinning it between the sack and the heel of your other hand as in figure 11 .
Now reach back around and bring the end of the line over to form the first complete turn seen in figure 12 .
In the same way make a second turn as in figure 13 .
Then hook the rope with the tip of your captured finger , as seen in figure 13 , and pull it through this space far enough so that you can bring it all the way out with your free hand .
At this point , snug it slightly then release your grasp on the bag neck as you grab the original rope end with this hand .
Finally both ends are evenly pulled to complete the tie as seen in figure 14 .
Each of these free ends is now tied in a simple overhand knot and it is these knobs that will be captured in the hitch in the main line .
The long planks attached to the well box serve to distribute weight over a larger area .
One or more shorter planks on each of two access sides help support the weight of a person to prevent compacting most of the insulating earth .
In regions of extreme cold it would be advantageous to mix into the earth used for banking the well box , some natural insulating material such as straw or dead tree bark .
A mulch over this earth will prevent erosion and add even more insulation .
Figure 5 .
Top view of the storage pit : a square hole encircled at ground level by a shallow , gravel filled drainage trench .
The lower stage duct assembly is installed , the well box positioned and is banked with earth .
At storage time , as the sacks are lowered , they must be manipulated into position .
A canoe paddle , used gently , is the best tool for this job .
The produce sacks should come up no higher than the top of the lower stage of the duct , which should be at ground level .
Sacks of insulation , similarly attached to a second long line , are then stuffed into any space remaining between the produce and the wall of the excavation .
The upper stage of the duct must then be wedged into the support structure created by the four wooden tabs on the lower stage .
Generously beveling the inside edge corners of these tabs will help guide the upper stage into place .
The remaining insulation sacks are then spiraled around into place until the well is filled .
The well box should be constructed as tightly as possible , but any slight gap between it and the lid is desirable in order to permit a small amount of air exchange .
If you ’ve done too good a construction job , a small diameter nail can be placed between box and lid to provide this gap .
A small hatch in the center of the lid is handy for when it is only necessary to have access to the duct for monitoring or adjusting conditions .
Monitoring is done by installing a small thermometer and hygrometer attached to an old broom handle .
If the inside dimensions of the duct are just greater than the diameter of a plastic two liter soda / pop bottle , one or more of these containing hot water is a convenient way to add warmth .
The neck is perfectly shaped for attaching a cord .
Tying each end of a double length creates a convenient handle and balances the jug .
In mild winters these same containers can be installed frozen to lower the inside temperature .
When humidity must be reduced , muslin bags containing ordinary cat box litter ( unscented ) will do the job .
Another desiccating material , silica gel , available at craft shops , although more expensive initially , can be reconditioned again and again by slow oven drying .
These sacks can be weighted with a fist size stone to aid installation .
Also , for this purpose , the inside surfaces of the duct need to be sanded fairly smooth .
When humidity must be increased a more common condition simply pour a small amount of water down the shaft and check on the effect the next day or so .
An aluminum foil pie tin filled with sand and placed directly below the shaft makes a good receptacle and evaporator of this moisture .
Four racks made of wooden lath , of a size to cover most of the pit bottom , will keep the produce sacks raised a couple of inches for good air circulation .
One final design detail , small homemade wooden cleats , strategically located , conveniently secure the various rope ends .
As for the size of these installations , a well box four feet square is a convenient size when working with dimension lumber and requires an excavation three feet on a side .
Four feet is a good hole depth and well box height .
This depth will reach below frost line in most places and this height will , even after being banked with earth and mulch half way up , remain above snow line in most winters .
Figures 6 - 14 .
Tying a main line hitch and making a millers knot
Perforated plastic bags are best for holding varieties which require high humidity .
The larger bread wrappers can be pressed into service for quantities of a few pounds each and for small containers of insulation .
They can efficiently be ventilated to any required degree by folding and re-folding until only two or three inches square and punched a half a dozen times more or less with a leather punch .
The cheaper models costing six or eight dollars are plenty good enough for this use and can be bought at many craft or hardware stores .
Roots of some varieties ( cabbage , leek , and celery ) , that need to be kept moist , can be bagged in unvented bags and secured with string or rubber bands .
Open mesh bags are best when dry conditions are wanted .
Each bagged specimen should ideally be separated by something like moss or sawdust to cushion them .
Best of all is cattail down , plentiful and free for the taking in the fall .
These materials are also used in the insulation sacks .
To hold roots for sprouting , four wooden crates ( Figure 15 ) can fit between the struts supporting the duct shaft .
Like the sacks , they can be stacked several tiers high on a long line .
Several holes high on the sides provide ventilation .
Braided nylon rope is best for this application .
It handles and grips well .
Quarter inch is adequate for all but huge sacks of heavy produce and three eighths is a better choice for heavy earth filled crates and much easier on the hands .
For the definitive word on cold storage see the book Root Cellaring by Mike and Nancy Bubel .
It contains a wealth of information including the fine points of designing and building full size installations .
Five unsuspecting French tourists received an unexpected welcome to the Big Apple when , instead of a routine taxi ride , they became unwilling participants in a seven mile police chase through New York .
Esther - Ethy Mamane , 26 , of Paris , her mother Claudie Mamane , 60 , and three companions attempted to hail a taxi at New York 's John F Kennedy International Airport , but instead they were steered to an unlicensed van , which was possibly a gypsy cab .
Police saw the tourists enter the van and attempted to intervene .
An officer reached through the van 's window trying to remove the vehicle 's keys , but the van 's driver sped off knocking the officer to the ground .
A chase ensued with the five French tourists in the van and with police in a close pursuit .
Esther - Ethy told the New York Post that she and her fellow travelers " screamed and prayed " through it all .
" It was a miracle that we survived , " she said .
" We were very frightened .
" Mamane said the ride was " like something from a film .
"
The van , with tourists still along for the ride , sped for seven miles along a highway and residential streets with the vehicle hitting a gate and a truck along the way .
Eventually the suspects jumped out of the van while it was still moving .
The police , with guns drawn , chased them and quickly arrested them .
Claudie Mamane suffered an arm injury from the ordeal .

A major part of BART 's 10 - year , $ 1.2 billion renovation program entailed complete restoration of the aging fleet of BART train cars .
Since that " body - off " restoration was supposed to extend the life of the existing 669 - car fleet 20 to 25 more years , why is BART now going to replace all of those rebuilt cars ?
I spent many years explaining and defending the expensive renovation program , particularly its promised extension of the fleet 's life .
So what gives ?

No fare ?
No fair
I would like to request that Mayor Gavin Newsom , the Muni general manager and Board of Supervisors not raise Muni fares .
Instead , they should require that all operators not open the rear doors of the buses to let off passengers , and request that all passengers get off through the front doors so all commuters boarding will pay their fare share .
I take two bus rides commuting to and from work , and I see a lot of people boarding the buses through the rear doors , not paying the fares , and they get away with it .
It 's not fair .
We 're talking about so much revenue lost .
We need Muni to be vigilant in enforcing payment of fares .

Failed war on drugs
Thank you for publishing Debra J. Saunders ' informative and fascinating piece regarding our failed drug policies ( " Huge crack in system of drug prosecution , " Thursday ) .
The column pointed out what the media and politicians have for long been largely afraid to :
The war on drugs makes absolutely no sense , is counterproductive and is so overwhelmingly racist .
We have progressed so far in this country in such a short time , but the sad fact is our draconian , racist and archaic drug laws have hardly changed .

I was dismayed to read the front - page article on morals in medicine ( May 6 ) .
Health care is a service .
The professionals who provide it leave their opinions and personal differences at the door when they arrive for work .
I have been a nurse for more than over 30 years , and it has always been so .
Nurses receive an assignment each day and carry out that assignment to the best of their ability .
There can never be a question of who should or should not receive a nurse 's care .
This is the nature of service .
Perhaps the meaning of " moral " and " ethical " have been confused in this article .
A nurse has a moral obligation to carry out her or his assignment .
If she or he has an ethical problem with the type of care provided , she or he has recourse to managers , ethics committees or other channels to work through this dilemma .
If she or he wants to give or withhold care depending on personal opinions or beliefs , she or he should not be in health care .

The victims of outing
Regarding " elephants in the closet " ( " Film purports to rip doors off GOP closet , " Friday ) :
I have worked with and on behalf of LGBT seniors for the past 20 years .
Most LGBT people in their 70s , 80s and 90s are in the closet because for most of their years , they could be put in jail or a mental institution for being who they are .
They have lost family , friends , school , housing , jobs and more when their sexual orientation or gender identity was revealed .
I believe the one exception about outing is when decisionmakers and community leaders actively promote the policies that have serious negative social , emotional , physical and spiritual consequences for our lives as LGBT people .
I have seen firsthand the damage that is done to people 's lives .
Enough is enough .

Privacy for politicians ?
There must be a secret training program for Republicans that teaches them how to make the most disingenuous statements imaginable to the press with a straight face .
How else can you explain the ability of Republican propagandist Jon Fleischman to say , without the slightest hint of irony , that the film " Outrage " " flies in the face of an American tradition - that is , that people 's personal lives are supposed to be just that . "
Why did n't the Republican spin machine offer such a patriotic paean to a politician 's right to privacy when those in the spotlight were Gary Hart , Bill Clinton or John Edwards ?

Begin the debate over legalizing marijuana
On the governor 's talk of legalizing marijuana ( Editorials , May 8 ) :
Yes , a serious debate should begin , and studies should be conducted .
This is an important decision for California and indeed America .
As your editorial suggests , it is not a decision to be taken lightly .
Marijuana is drug that affects the mind , and its widespread over - consumption , especially among the young , would not be beneficial to our health and culture .
One of the things that we have to ascertain is how we can shift away from a culture of frivolous use .
It 's one thing to legalize it , but to be responsible about it we need to change our attitude about it much the way we have about tobacco , so that marijuana is n't seen as a harmless game but as a substance that carries consequences .
If we can do that , we could set up a good model for legalization .

Keep government out
The argument to legalize pot is based on the high cost to prosecute pot crimes ; fair enough .
However , pot as a tax resource is a different argument altogether - once pot is taxed , pot bootlegging ( a.k.a. " growing your own " ) will still be illegal - except for that which the government taxes .
Therefore , the pot-prosecuting infrastructure will still be fully operational , while the government assumes the monopolistic role of hash slinger .
Freedom ?
Hands - off government ?
You can't have it both ways .
Either legalize it because prosecuting it is too expensive , or it is not too expensive to prosecute and must remain illegal .
No government drug- pushing .

Alcohol is much worse
The Chronicle 's editorial " Where there 's smoke , there 's revenue ? " ( Friday ) gets a major point wrong : Marijuana is not " no worse than alcohol . "
By any objective measure , marijuana is a far safer substance .
Marijuana is much less addictive than alcohol - with a dependence rate of only 9 percent compared to 15 percent for booze ( and 32 percent for cigarettes ) .
And it 's massively less toxic .
Every year , sadly , people die of alcohol poisoning due to binge drinking , while there has never been a medically documented marijuana - overdose death .
Long - term heavy alcohol use does gross , easily visible damage to the brain and liver - so obvious you do n't need a microscope to see it .
Marijuana does nothing of the sort .
And the main social cost of alcohol use is violence and aggression - booze is a leading cause of domestic violence .
In contrast , as the journal Addictive Behaviors reported a few years ago , " cannabis ( marijuana ) reduces the likelihood of violence during intoxication . "
Yes , let 's have a debate on marijuana policy .
And please , let 's base it on scientific facts .

Sanders and single - payer
Posted Friday , April 3 , 2009 12:21 pm
Sen. Bernie Sanders , a Vermont Independent , has just introduced a single - payer health care reform bill into the United States Senate .
This legislation stands in sharp contrast to the reform models offered by the White House and Sen. Max Baucus , which are similar to our current Massachusetts reform .
Unlike Massachusetts , the Sanders bill would eliminate the many private insurance companies and create a " single payer " to administer health care funds .
Single - payer health care would save American taxpayers $ 400 billion in administrative costs , says Sanders , which would be enough money to provide health care coverage for everyone in our country .
Sanders is a senator who knows how to save money at a time when taxpayers are paying billions to keep AIG afloat .
As we know from our Massachusetts experience with health care reform , preserving the role of private health insurance companies does not lead to universal coverage or contain rising health care costs .
The Massachusetts reform program has not been affordable for the individual or for the state , and access to health care continues to be problematic , with nearly a quarter of the state 's residents saying they had difficulty getting care in 2008 .
The provisions of Senator Sander 's bill are : ( 1 ) universal coverage ; ( 2 ) comprehensive benefits , including mental health , dental and prescription drug coverage ; ( 3 ) patient choice of doctors and hospitals ; ( 4 ) fully - funded community health centers to provide access to care for the 60 million people living in rural and other underserved areas ; and ( 5 ) resources for the National Health Service Corps to train 24,000 new health professionals to address the shortage of primary care doctors and dentists .
Article Continues After Advertisement
Massachusetts continues to have a critical shortage of primary care doctors , and providing health insurance for the uninsured through our current program has only made that deficiency more visible .
Having health insurance in Massachusetts does n't guarantee health care if you can't find a doctor when you are sick .
Others with insurance can't get care because they can't afford their co-payments and deductibles .

Sanders ' program would be paid for by taking the current sources of government health care spending , and combining them with modest new taxes that would be less than people now pay for insurance premiums and other out - of - pocket expenses .
Four hundred billion dollars would be saved annually by eliminating insurance company profits and overhead , as well as the paperwork that burdens doctors and hospitals .
Dr. Uwe Reinhardt said at a hearing before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee , " We have 900 billing clerks at Duke ( a 900 bed university hospital ) .
I 'm not sure we have a nurse per bed , but we have a billing clerk per bed .
. . it 's obscene . "
Doctors and hospitals are sick of the paperwork and the health care dollars that do n't go for health care delivery .
And everyone hates the intrusion of insurance companies into health care decisions .
A poll published in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that 64 percent of doctors in Massachusetts now support single - payer health care .
Article Continues After Advertisement
Sen. Bernie Sanders ' legislation is a bold step forward .
Five hundred physicians in Massachusetts have signed a letter to Sen .
Kennedy , asking him to support a single - payer reform similar to Sanders ' bill .
Kennedy supports universal coverage , but would leave the current dysfunctional system of multiple insurance company payers intact .
Kennedy has said , " Health care is not just a commodity . . . to be rationed based on the ability to pay .
It is time to make universal health insurance a national priority , so that the basic right to health care can finally become a reality for every American . "
Unfortunately , leaving the current system intact would not save the $ 400 billion now lost to administrative expenses .
We ask Sen. Kennedy to listen to Massachusetts physicians and reject the lobbying forces of the profit - driven insurance industry .
We also ask him to join Sen .
Sanders in sponsoring the only solution for health care reform that will cover everyone at a cost we can afford .

free skull knitting pattern
I was floundering about , wondering what it would take to get my husband to actually wear one of my sweaters .
the Skull click picture to launch
I was being sarcastic about it to a friend and said , Yeah , maybe if I put a skull on it , then he would wear it .
Well , the next thing you know , I am asking for Ethan 's help plotting out a skull grid for the project .
So my man whipped out his PC , cranked a clip - art skull through it and this is what came out on the other side .
Just as he finished up the graph , March 2001 , I got the news that my Grandma Hall had died .
It was in grief that I started the knitting .
I used recycled charcoal worsted weight wool I had gotten in Germany while we were living there , mixed in with some Bone colored Montera .
I was finishing it up 2 months later , when my Grandma Stafford died .

Somewhere in between the funerals , I took a business trip to New Jersey and found myself knitting this sweater on the plane with a copy of Already Dead by Denis Johnson in my bag for a little light reading .
This paralyzed the passenger beside me into silence for the entire flight .
Aaaw , yeah ... just the way I like it .
Here are some photos and links to projects others have made from my skull chart .
Be sure to scroll down if the skull does n't jump right out at you once you link out .
the Big Bad Wolf pullover with Skull
Michelle ( who has some awfully cool needlepoint charts for sale here ) made this pullover for her sexy husband using the Big Bad Wolf pattern found in the DomiKNITrix book .
This skull is grand due to the bulky gauge of the yarn .
The same skull knit onto the men's vest as shown in the book appears smaller in worsted weight yarn .
This turned out very similar to Voltaire 's skull sweater .
Excellent work !
Karen 's Double Scoop with skull
Karen used Knitty 's Double Scoop for this pirate pullover .
Karen had the best intentions , starting this pullover for the smaller of her lucky kids .
But yarn substitution led to gauge mishap and the end result turned out a bit large .
That means Karen is the lucky owner of a new pullover !
Her lemur - esque acrobatics really caught my eye .
Tia made this very big - boy skull AND crossbones afghan for her lucky nephew .

skull pullover by Mary
Here 's a subtle execution of the skull in texture rather than color .
For those looking for a lighter way to make their mark - classy and very wearable .
Mary knit this for a lucky nephew .
Husband Bill was a willing model for this photo shoot .
Mary tells me she did n't work the chart stitch for stitch , but that makes it no less fabulous !
Brainy lady was the first .
Then came Gidget , who interpreted it in texture rather than color .
Angela chose duplicate stitch to render the skull ( a technique you 'll see used on another cool chart in my book ) .
The upside of dupe stitch is that you can still knit your sweater in the round and add the chart as an afterthought .
In fact , you could buy any sweater and punk it up with the skull .
Is n't her husband a badass ?
( scroll down after clicking link ) .
Ragnar put the skull on the back of a sweater in bright colors .
Without its lower teeth , her skull smiles .
Anna used the Bad Penny as her canvas and added the skull in later using duplicate stitch .
Her duplicate technique is absolutely flawless .
Lisa 's skull afghan
Lisa crocheted this sweet afghan ( left ) with mega skull .
To make your own , use the skull chart as the pattern and add some extra black squares around the edges so that the skull does not fill the whole afghan space .
Look closely at this photo and compare it to the chart .
Notice that the first white square on chart ( chin ) and on afghan , there are 4 double crochet stitches making that single square .
So swatch to confirm that 4 double ( or treble ) crochet stitches makes a square slightly wider than tall .
Then it 's a simple matter to work the chart up into an afghan !
Just crochet 4 stitches for each square and change colors as dictated by the chart and your gauge .
Easy peasy

I 've been giving away the skull chart for a couple of years now .
Many have said it 's the best skull chart for knitting on the web .
But the problem of hotlinks ( and I do n't mean spicy sausages ! ) causes me to change the filename frequently to shake loose the hot linkers .
There is a right and a wrong way to link to an image on someone else 's site ; if you care to learn the RIGHT WAY , please get more info here .
It 's not at all difficult to do and it 's free .
Save the image and upload that , not the URL .
Uploading a URL ( a URL is http://etc ... ) that is n't yours is bandwidth theft .
When you are using someone else 's images , and they change the filname on you , you may find a very different and possibly embarrassing image appearing on your own blog one day and it will be your own fault .
People who hotlink got the snazzy result of my big skull grid appearing live on their page .
The downside of this for me is that it means people are using up bandwidth that I pay for without ever visiting my site .
Heck , if you want some really , really cool goth skull and bones images , please visit this site about Kutna Hora , an ossuary in the Czech Republic I visited when I was living there in 1993 .

The Obama administration is now considering reinstating the Military Commissions
Act after a four - month suspension , in contradiction to the president ’s promise to end military tribunals for detainees and to close down Gitmo .
While there is talk about reforming the act to restrict hearsay evidence and to permit defendants to challenge intelligence used against them , the disparity between the tribunals and due process for other criminals leaves intact the concept of “ unlawful enemy combatant , ” as contained in the act , and thus threatens further evisceration of the rule of law .
Running on the platform of a constitutional law professor who would restore the rule of law to the United States , the stench of hypocrisy pervades Barack Obama ’s administration .
This is not to challenge the need to make decisions based on available evidence and to fine - tune these decisions according to the facts — something that Obama has often held up as his modus operandi .
The problem is that one of these facts to be taken into account is that evidence against at least some of these detainees was unlawfully obtained .
The fact that the evidence against certain detainees may have been tainted by virtue of having been attained through torture ( let ’s not mince words ) is also a fact that cannot be buried under the rug in a fair trial process .
Criminal defendants like O.J. Simpson walked when his “ Dream Team ” was able to successfully argue that the blood samples the prosecution relied on to convict Simpson of a double murder may have been tainted .
Never mind that the most probable hypothesis was that Simpson committed the murders .
Our justice system is based on procedural justice , which means that the process of conviction must be as just as the outcome ; otherwise , we might as well resort to vigilante or shotgun justice every time we think someone has broken the law .
Rather than to admit that evidence attained through torture is tainted , in order to dispose of the cases in question , Obama is moving to retain the Military Commissions
Act and its notoriously vague , legally flawed and chilling definition of “ unlawful enemy combatant ” as “ an individual engaged in hostilities against the United States who is not a lawful enemy combatant . ”
This is not only a violation of the rule of law and of due process ; it is also a concession to torture , which the president has repeatedly claimed to be off the table .
To rely on evidence gained through torture is to dignify the use of torture , not to reject it .
Thus , there are implications of sustaining the Military Commissions
Act well beyond what meets the eye .
Not to mention that many detainees have been held without having been charged , in violation of their right of habeas corpus .
This is an egregious affront to the United States Constitution , as recently confirmed by the Supreme Court .
In retaining the system of military commissions that permitted such a flagrant miscarriage of due process , Obama dignifies the violation of the rule of law .
A coherent system of justice is not subject to fragmentation .
When one part of the rule of law is breached , it can have profound impact on other parts of the system .
Thus , retaining military commissions leads invariably to staying the course of operation of illegally run prisons like Guantanamo ; allows for the use of illegally obtained evidence ; sets a precedent for future trials in which such evidence can be used ; and opens up the possibility that others in the future will be labeled as unlawful enemy combatants and treated in a similar way as the current prisoners are being treated .
For a defense secretary like Robert Gates , who was willing to cooperate in such abridgements of due process under the George W. Bush administration , this may seem like business as usual .
But for someone like Obama , who has promised change , it reeks of duplicity and of the same old violations of the rule of law that we have seen time and again over the last eight years .
It appears North Korea is printing counterfeit U.S. bonds .
An Italian newspaper reports a recent mysterious case involving US $ 134.5 billion wo rth of counterfeit bonds has a North Korea connection .
Earlier this month two Japanese nationals were caught in Italy allegedly trying to smuggle the bonds into Switzerland .
Il Messaggero says the fake bonds may have been manufactured in North Korea since the two men are North Korean agents and are believed to have been seeking to purchase weapons .
Sen . Max Baucus -- a favorite recipient of donations from the health insurance industry -- has also been the key Democratic attack dog against single - payer healthcare .
He stated it 's " off the table , " and this morning convened a Senate Finance Committee hearing that included 15 expert witnesses on healthcare -- NONE of them in support of a medicare - for - all or single - payer healthcare system .
First of all , let 's realize how limited Baucus and DC insiders have already made the debate .
If you exclude healthcare economists and public policy experts who support Medicare - for - All , you 're playing the B - team .
The data from other countries is overwhelming : single - payer systems outperform American healthcare , and about half the cost .
If you only talk to people blind to this fact , then you 're not exactly bringing the best and brightest together .
Secondly , it 's hard to see how healthcare reform can succeed if we continue to allow insurance companies to take their 30 % off the top .
Not politically feasible some might say ?
It seems far less politically wise to pass healthcare reform that fails .
The American people need reform , want it , and are open to single - payer .
{ Not to mention single - payer is the choice of 59 % of the nation 's MDs and of the national nurses movement .}
What 's the matter with Baucus ?
Politico's hard - working Carrie Budoff Brown provides more details :
As soon as police escorted one protester out of the room , another would stand up , criticizing the committee for convening a panel of 15 experts and excluding witnesses who support creating a Medicare
system for all Americans .
About eight were led out of the hearing .
" We need more police , " Baucus said .
" Single - payer needs to be on the table , " one of the protesters
yelled .
" This is political theater . "
Here 's a Donna Smith blog previewing the meeting

And here 's A FAIR study about the media blackout on single - payer
Now that neuroscientists have identified the brain ’s synchronizing mechanism , they ’ve started work on therapies to strengthen attention .
In the current issue of Nature , researchers from M.I.T. , Penn and Stanford report that they directly induced gamma waves in mice by shining pulses of laser light through tiny optical fibers onto genetically engineered neurons .
In the current issue of Neuron , Dr. Desimone and colleagues report progress in using this “ optogenetic ” technique in monkeys .
Ultimately , Dr. Desimone said , it may be possible to improve your attention by using pulses of light to directly synchronize your neurons , a form of direct therapy that could help people with schizophrenia and attention - deficit problems ( and might have fewer side effects than drugs ) .
If it could be done with low - wavelength light that penetrates the skull , you could simply put on ( or take off ) a tiny wirelessly controlled device that would be a bit like a hearing aid .
In the nearer future , neuroscientists might also help you focus by observing your brain activity and providing biofeedback as you practice strengthening your concentration .
Researchers have already observed higher levels of synchrony in the brains of people who regularly meditate .
Ms. Gallagher advocates meditation to increase your focus , but she says there are also simpler ways to put the lessons of attention researchers to use .
Once she learned how hard it was for the brain to avoid paying attention to sounds , particularly other people ’s voices , she began carrying ear plugs with her .
When you ’re trapped in a noisy subway car or a taxi with a TV that wo n’t turn off , she says you have to build your own “ stimulus shelter . ”
She recommends starting your work day concentrating on your most important task for 90 minutes .
At that point your prefrontal cortex probably needs a rest , and you can answer e-mail , return phone calls and sip caffeine ( which does help attention ) before focusing again .
But until that first break , do n’t get distracted by anything else , because it can take the brain 20 minutes to do the equivalent of rebooting after an interruption .
( For more advice , go to nytimes.com /tierneylab . )
“ Multitasking is a myth , ” Ms. Gallagher said .
“ You can not do two things at once .
The mechanism of attention is selection : it ’s either this or it ’s that . ”
She points to calculations that the typical person ’s brain can process 173 billion bits of information over the course of a lifetime .
“ People do n’t understand that attention is a finite resource , like money , ” she said .
“ Do you want to invest your cognitive cash on endless Twittering or Net surfing or couch potatoing ?
You ’re constantly making choices , and your choices determine your experience , just as William James said . ”
The rates reflect several aspects of American medicine : increasing specialization , the lack of time for any doctor to give to complex cases , and fear of lawsuits over not consulting an expert .
At the same time , referrals are a way for cash - strapped doctors to generate business .

When I was in training , simple referrals from internists , like patients with only mild hypertension , bothered me as a waste of time .
Now that I am in practice , I welcome them .
I have n’t changed my mind that these referrals are probably unnecessary , and there is plenty of evidence that wasteful expert consultation is adding to health costs and creating redundant care .
But as a full - fledged doctor , I appreciate the business .
It is hard not to view a referral as an overture from another physician , and it is equally hard not to return the favor .
A sort of paradox is at work .
Specialists are better paid than primary care physicians , but they are also less autonomous because , unlike primary care physicians , they depend on other doctors for referrals .
There is pressure on specialists to keep referral sources happy , especially in doctor - saturated metropolitan areas like New York City .
There are limits , of course , on the autonomy of referring physicians , too .
For instance , by federal law a doctor cannot refer patients to himself or to a business in which he has a significant financial stake , like a laboratory or imaging center , and he can not be paid for a referral .
The reasoning is that such behavior can interfere with clinical judgment , decrease quality and increase costs .
In 2006 , Tenet Healthcare Corp. , based in Dallas , agreed to pay $ 21 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit asserting that a hospital it owned in San Diego had paid kickbacks to physicians for referrals .
( Tenet did not admit wrongdoing . )
That same year , a New Jersey teaching hospital was investigated for giving sham salaries to community doctors in a reported attempt to increase the number of referrals to its cardiac surgery program .
Two cardiologists pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges .
But there are gray areas in practice .
The Office of the Inspector General in the Department of Health and Human Services has investigated office space rentals , for example .
Across the country , mobile medical imaging companies have made arrangements with internists to perform , in their offices , cardiac ultrasounds , which the companies send to cardiologists for interpretation .
Insurance companies that cover the imaging pay the companies , and the companies pay rent to the internists .
By law , these rent payments must reflect fair market value and be unrelated to the volume of patients referred by the internists for imaging .
But according to doctors familiar with these agreements , that is n’t always the case .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. President George W. Bush , saying " our entire economy is in danger , " urged Congress to approve his administration 's $ 700 billion bailout proposal .
" We 're in the midst of a serious financial crisis , and the federal government is responding with decisive actions , " Bush said in a televised address Wednesday night from the White House .
Bush pointed out that the collapse of several major lenders was rooted in the subprime mortgage market that thrived over the past decade .
He said passage of the $ 700 billion bailout proposal was needed to restore confidence in the market .
" I'm a strong believer in free enterprise , so my natural instinct is to oppose government intervention , " he said .
But " these are not normal circumstances .
The market is not functioning properly .
There has been a widespread loss of confidence .
" Without immediate action by Congress , America can slip into a major panic . "
Watch Bush warn of the consequences »
If Congress fails to approve the rescue plan , the nation could face a " long and painful recession , " Bush said .
" The plan is big enough to solve a serious problem , " Bush said .
The plan calls for the government to buy from firms up to $ 700 billion in troubled assets -- mainly mortgage - backed securities -- whose values declined as the housing market imploded .
The goal is to stabilize the companies and prompt them to lend again .

" The government is the only institution patient enough to buy these assets at their current low prices and hold them until their prices return to normal , " he said .
Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke warned Wednesday that the Wall Street crisis is the worst the nation has faced since the end of World War II and urged Congress to take action on a proposed bailout package .
Congress is considering whether to allow Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to use federal funds to buy up to $ 700 billion in mortgage - related securities and other assets that have caused turbulence on Wall Street and have undermined credit markets worldwide .
But Paulson and Bernanke faced deeply skeptical lawmakers , including members of Bush 's own party , when they pitched the plan before congressional committees Tuesday and Wednesday .
Watch as lawmakers push back »
The White House had been taken a mostly hard line during the negotiations with Congress , but it is signaling a new spirit of cooperation that suggests the administration realizes the situation is so serious that it will have to compromise in order to get something done .
" This is not take - it - or - leave - it , " a senior administration official said earlier Wednesday .
" We 'll accept changes . "
The senior administration official said the president has been contemplating a prime - time speech for several weeks but finally decided to deliver it tonight because he believes that the situation has reached crisis stage .
" This is a bullet you only fire once , " the senior official said .
" We have reached a point in the process where we just have to get action . "

All About George W. Bush • National Economy
WASHINGTON – Wars rarely end at the first hint of truce .
But when the Obama administration quietly announced this week it will halt federal raids against dispensers of medical marijuana , advocates of drug policy reform found themselves in a tickertape mood .
Could this be Armistice Day for America 's decades - long war on drugs ?
Not quite .
Not yet , at least .
But the new government 's reversal of the Bush - era 's zero - tolerance on pot comes amid a confluence of signals that America may be nearing a turning point in its approach to prohibition .
Exit " reefer madness " and enter a more reasoned debate on what works , with the goal of targeting deadly cartels who today place drugs in the hands of American children with greater ease than ever before .
With the U.S. economy in shambles and its banking systems on life support , people on all sides of the great drug debate agree on this much : the last thing America needs right now is to get stoned .
Yet stoned it is , in increasingly grim numbers , despite the world 's most expensive sustained effort to use the full weight of law enforcement , prisons and foreign policy to staunch illegal drugs .
American demand today is estimated to be worth as much as $ 25 billion , a reality that has shredded Mexico 's ability to impose sovereignty along its northern border , where rampant drug violence claims 100 lives a week .
" This awful reality is forcing us toward a debate that for the past couple of decades we just could n't have because America 's official drug policy was controlled by wild - eyed ideologues , " said Dan Bernath , spokesperson for the Marijuana Policy Project , a Washington - based reform lobby group .
" But attitudes toward marijuana law reform have changed , even if policy has n't .
The opposition today is dwindling down to an ideological fringe rooted in a cultural war that does n't really matter to people any more .
And now , with a new administration , we find ourselves on the cusp of what we hope is going to be a reasoned , fact - based debate . "
The best evidence of changing attitudes is the sheer fact of Barack Obama 's ascendance .
America now has a president who readily admits to having not only smoked marijuana but actually having inhaled it in a period of misspent youth before finding God and the woman of his dreams .
That places him in the company of an estimated 40 per cent of Americans , or 100 million people , who tell pollsters they have tried the drug at least once .
Analysts say it never became an election issue simply because in today 's America – where 13 states sanction medical marijuana – it was not going to move votes one way or another .
" Opinions have evolved .
So many Americans have used marijuana that they are now kind of immune to the fear mongering intoning against its evils , " said author Glenn Greenwald , prominent civil rights lawyer and frequent contributor to Salon.com .
Greenwald knows firsthand how the U.S. debate is opening up .
In two weeks he will appear at the Washington - based Cato Institute to present a 50 - page analysis on the effects of drug decriminalization in Portugal , which in 2001 became the first EU member state to halt criminal penalties for marijuana , cocaine and heroin .
" The biggest surprise for me about the investigation in Portugal is that eight years after the fact there now is a consensus that crosses ideological lines .
It has worked so well that nobody is arguing for the policy to be reversed , " Greenwald told the Toronto Star .
" It is a hot - button issue in every society and it was in Portugal in 2001 , when they changed the laws .
But the results are pretty clear : there has been no huge increase in usage .
Money has been freed up for treatment , and at the same time lots of addicts have been able to get help because they are no longer terrified of being thrown into prison if they identified themselves as drug users with a problem . "
Greenwald , however , is under no illusions the Portuguese approach could easily be adapted to America .
Resistance to drug law reform in the U.S. , he points out , has long been a bipartisan condition held dear by significant portions of Democrats and Republicans alike .
" The emotion surrounding America 's drug war is very deeply entrenched , and the irrationality that has sustained it for so long is very difficult to uproot .
I truly believe the unquestioned premise – that changing the laws will create a spike in usage – is a myth .
But even as attitudes change , myths take time to break down , " he said .
" Yet I do believe the space is opening up now to debate the issue based on empirical analysis , based on what works and what does n't .
We owe it to ourselves to consider the results in Portugal as part of a reasoned debate . "
The Obama administration has yet to fully articulate its policies on illicit drugs , though the president has hinted he intends to tackle the problem from both a public health and law enforcement perspective .
But advocates of a more progressive approach take heart in the appointment of former Seattle police chief Gil Kerlikowske as Obama 's nominee for drug czar .
When Seattle citizens voted in 2003 to make marijuana prosecution the lowest law enforcement priority , Kerlikowske 's police force acted accordingly , enabling the city to champion the use of the public health system rather than criminal justice to address problems caused by illegal drugs .
" So far the new drug czar is an unknown quantity , but his record in Seattle shows Kerlikowske does not approach marijuana from an ideological point of view .
The city was able to take a new approach , respecting the wishes of the people it was serving , and that 's all we 've ever wanted at a federal level , " said the MPP 's Bernath .
Washington was conspicuously silent this week after Attorney General Eric Holder announced the feds will no longer raid medical marijuana dispensaries that comply with state law .
" It is a bit difficult for many conservatives to get worked up about it , since so many believe that states should be able to decide for themselves .
And that is essentially what the Obama administration is saying – if the dispensary complies with state law , the state has spoken , " said Bernath .
Peter Reuter , a professor of criminology at University of Maryland and a supporter of drug criminalization laws , noted : " We 've had drug - using presidents before .
But the great change now is that Obama is honest about it .
" Obama 's response when he was asked whether he had inhaled was perfect : ` I rather thought that was the point . '
He is not apologizing .
He does n't have Bill Clinton 's guilty conscience .
This is a president who is not afraid to talk about it . "
Reuter expects
Obama 's candour will help breathe new life into the stale drug war debate .
But rather than a wholesale redrafting of legislation , he believes the new administration may have a better chance of success at the judicial level .
" One of the questions is : why do we have such long sentences for drug offences ?
It is very difficult these days to find law enforcement people who disagree .
We have large numbers of people , particularly black males , in jail right now for long stretches , longer than is reasonable or efficient .
It might make sense for Obama to begin there , at a federal level , to see what can be done . "
Underpinning the entire debate , meanwhile , is money .
With every dollar of federal spending now subject to a line - by - line review , advocates for drug law reform are renewing the argument for a rerouting of billions from drug war funding into addiction treatment .
Two recent studies by academics at Harvard and Virginia 's George Mason University suggest the U.S. government could see a windfall of anywhere from $ 14 to $ 40 billion annually through decriminalization of marijuana .
The figures combine law enforcement savings and potential marijuana tax revenues .
" The argument is a bit similar to the situation during prohibition of alcohol in the 1930s , when the Great Depression was forcing everyone to look at expenditures and the government accepted that the alcohol policies were no longer affordable , " said Bernath .
" No matter what happens , the marijuana industry is never going to be as big as the alcohol industry .
And it would be disingenuous to argue it could be some kind of silver bullet for today 's economy .
But every billion counts , does it not ? "
Greenwald , however , observes that the money argument cuts both ways , pointing to the " range of vested interests " that are making money from the drug war .
" There may be few more grotesque wastes of money than the drug war .
But the industries that have sprung up around it are enormous and lucrative and powerful , " he said .
" Decriminalization would be a huge blow to the American prison industry , which is the largest in the world .
Lots of defence companies and paramilitary firms would suffer greatly .
They all have a strong interest in maintaining the drug war and they will not just go quietly . "
However the debate evolves , the United States can proceed confident the rest of the world will be watching .
Whatever lessons are to be drawn from beyond its borders , U.S. drug policy is ultimately expected to dominate policy beyond .
" The United States has a history of blocking reforms elsewhere .
There are other countries , especially in Europe , that are ready to take more practical measures , especially when it comes to marijuana policy , " said Bernath .
" There is no question America will continue to be the leader .
What we 're all looking for now is the most reasoned , highest quality debate to decide where we go from here . "

Breakthrough In Stereo Mission Could Help Prevent Satellite Damage
by Staff Writers
Greenbelt , MD ( SPX ) Apr 16 , 2009
Scientists working on NASA 's twin STEREO spacecraft have made a significant breakthrough that could play a major role in protecting satellites from the damage caused by solar explosions , known as Coronal Mass Ejections ( CMEs ) .
CMEs are powerful sudden eruptions of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun 's outer atmosphere that when directed towards Earth , can have damaging effects .
Protecting satellites from these potential negative consequences is vital for preventing disruption to everything from GPS to power stations .
Now scientists using data from the twin STEREO spacecraft have shown that these unique 3D images enable a CME to be tracked all the way to the Earth and predict its arrival at least 24 hours beforehand .
This allows more time for preventative measures to be put in place to minimize the damage caused to satellites and the resulting disruption to technologies .
A paper led by Dr Chris Davis , of the Science and Technology Facilities Council 's ( STFC's ) Rutherford Appleton Laboratory ( RAL ) due to be published in Geophysical Research Letters explains this has been made possible because of the UK - built Heliospheric Imagers ( hi - tech cameras ) onboard the twin STEREO spacecraft that view the space between the Sun and the Earth , using wide - angle telescopes .
" The images taken from the UK - built Heliospheric Imagers represent a major step forward in predicting the arrival of these solar storms at Earth " said Dr Chris Davis .
" These results demonstrate that we are now able to predict a storm 's arrival at Earth with over twenty - four hours notice .
That 's sufficient time for satellite operators and astronauts on the International Space Station to minimize their risks " .
Angelos Vourlidas , project scientist for the SECCHI imaging suite aboard STEREO said ; " The larger the separation between the STEREO spacecraft , the larger the structures we can examine . "
The NASA STEREO mission was launched in October 2006 .
Two identical probes are now in solar orbit , one flying ahead of the Earth and one behind the Earth , from where they look back at the Sun and the space between the Sun and the Earth .
This two - platform view allows 3D images of the Sun to be produced .
However , it is the RAL - led Heliospheric Images on STEREO that look at the space between the Sun and the Earth , using wide - angle telescopes .
They are being used to detect the CMEs as they propagate through interplanetary space .
In addition to leading the HI instruments , all of the imaging instruments on board the two STEREO spacecraft use a novel CCD - based camera system developed at RAL .
Apparently , Ronald Reagan had previous commitments .
Seriously , though , at some point someone in the Republican party is going to have to speak up and tell Cheney to STFU .
The man was at – what ?
– 20 % in the polls ?
And he ’s the Republican giving the speech responding to Obama ’s national security address ?
Of course , Cheney chose himself to be the GOP point man , but as Joe posted this morning , it ’s not like the Republicans are trying to distance themselves from good old Dick .
And while the media is busy covering Cheney , they might want to as Mr. National Security where bin Laden is , why they let him escape at Tora Bora , why they did n’t keep after him , and ultimately why they pretty much gave up .

Tom Fiebiger , a Democratic state senator from North Dakota , has mixed emotions about the events of April 3 .
On that morning , he learned that Iowa was to become the first state in the Midwest to recognize same - sex marriages .
In the afternoon , he watched as his own state ’s House of Representatives voted 54 - to - 34 to kill a bill that would have protected North Dakotans from being fired , denied credit , or evicted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity .
As the father of a gay son and the bill ’s chief sponsor in the Senate — where it passed 27 - to - 19 in a bipartisan vote — Fiebiger views the Iowa ruling as “ kind of bittersweet . ”
The news from Vermont was kind of bittersweet , too .
For four days , the Iowa Supreme Court ’s unanimous decision was being talked about as perhaps the unlikely tipping point for the lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) rights movement .
But then Vermont ’s legislature gave a thumbs - up to same - sex marriage , and the attention turned back toward the coasts — and ongoing battles in California and the Northeast .
While New England has several short - term prospects for same - sex marital bliss , the Midwest is primed for a bumper crop of basic anti-discrimination bills — legislation unthinkable just a few years ago — needed to build foundations for marriage equality down the road .
Sure , marriage is nice and all that , but it ’s nicer still to have laws that make it illegal for a gay man ’s boss to say , “ Hit the road , faggot . ”
A little national support now , state activists say , might mean the difference between incremental progress and a burst of progressive legislation in the Heartland .
After all , just about everybody expects California and New York — where Gov. David Paterson is pushing same - sex marriage legislation — to cave at some point .
But in states that have never passed a gay - rights bill , a string of legislative victories would make it hard to argue , as anti-discrimination opponents did in North Dakota , that those rights embody “ New York ” values .
“ For the people on the coasts , this is flyover territory , and nothing really important ever happens in the Midwest , ” says Glenn Carlson of Fair Wisconsin , a gay - rights group .
“ But that ’s really not true at all .
History shows that , and the Iowa decision really affirms it . ”
And in these Midwestern states , where much of the groundwork is already laid , a concentrated push could also lead to domestic partnerships and marriage rights faster than many people realize .
“ Iowa passed their nondiscrimination bill in 2007 , ” says Karen Mudd of Equality South Dakota Institute , “ and look where they ’re at now . ”
Indeed , marriage rights in Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa , and Vermont were preceded by years of lobbying for more fundamental protections and benefits for same - sex couples .
Until recently , in fact , activists in the Heartland were resigned to spending their time and energy blocking bills aimed at stripping away their rights .
Marriage seemed like a distant goal .
“ We ’re used to playing defense , ” says Mudd , whose group formed two years ago to pass pro-rights legislation .
Activists like Mudd have to contend with constitutional bans on same - sex marriage — and repealing those will require unprecedented levels of public support .
“ It ’s important for people to realize why we ca n’t have the same result that Iowa has right away , ” warns Fair Wisconsin ’s Carlson .
“ It raises expectations — maybe unreasonably — about what we can achieve in the next three to five years . ”
And yet the next legislative session could usher in a wave of game - changing achievements .
Before Iowa was on anyone ’s lips , 2009 was already notable for the amount of pro-LGBT legislation in play .
Gay - rights groups pushed anti-discrimination bills in Montana , Indiana , Michigan , Pennsylvania , Kansas , Missouri , Utah , Ohio , and North Dakota .
Lawmakers in Minnesota , Indiana , and Utah sought limited rights for gay couples , like power of attorney , hospital visitation , and right of inheritance .
The most controversial bills of the lot looked to expand same - sex adoption rights in Utah and create domestic partnerships in Montana and Wisconsin .
While the bills that were brought to a vote failed ( narrowly ) , first - time legislation fared surprisingly well , and legislation reintroduced from past sessions went further through hearings , committees , and floor votes than ever before .
Notably , pro-gay bills fared considerably better than anti-gay legislation .
Wyoming ’s House nixed a constitutional ban on same - sex marriage in February , and Indiana Republicans killed a similar measure shortly thereafter .
In March , conservatives tried to bring a marriage amendment to the floor in West Virginia , but were trounced , 67 - to - 30 .
In Minnesota , a perennial attempt to preempt gay marriage was postponed until session ’s end before finally fizzling .
Amy Johnson of OutFront Minnesota sees this as a sign that the bigots are losing traction .
“ I just do n’t think their message resonates with people , ” she says .
“ These families exist , and people are figuring it out . ”
Polls numbers bear this out .
Well over half of Montanans say they support anti-discrimination laws ; in Utah and Indiana it ’s about 70 percent and 80 percent , respectively .
Even in states that have seen bruising campaigns against same - sex marriage , a growing number of people have apparently made peace with some level of equality .
“ Pretty much across the board , the responses were incredible , ” says Travis McAdam of the Montana Human Rights Network .
“ When you tell them how the law is currently drafted , people say , ‘ Well , that ’s not right , how can that be legal ? ' ”
It ’s hard to say exactly when these sentiments will translate into law , for while conservative voters may believe in fairness , their elected leaders usually proceed with trepidation .
“ In the Midwest , I think the people , the voters , have changed more rapidly than the legislators , ” notes Indiana Equality ‘s Kathy Sarris .
“ But legislators are beginning to notice . ”
That ’s part of the reason state - level activists are now openly optimistic about their near - term prospects .
Lynne Bowman of Equality Ohio , for instance , predicts that her state ’s Equal Housing and Employment
Act will finally pass this session , and Carlson has high hopes that Wisconsin will become the second Midwestern state to recognize same - sex relationships .
“ The walls are coming down faster and faster , ” he says .
“ I think we ’ll get our domestic partnerships . ”
Virtually every state - level activist I spoke with says Iowa has helped matters along considerably .
“ People in Wisconsin relate to people in Iowa better than people in California , Vermont , or Massachusetts , ” explains Carlson , who sees same - sex marriage spreading across the Midwest within five to ten years .
Bowman and Sarris also predict a domino effect with more and more states acknowledging gay relationships .
“ I would predict that Illinois will have civil unions very quickly , ” Sarris says .
Minnesota ’s Amy Johnson envisions “ a three - to five - year horizon ” for marriage legislation in her state , where activists ’ efforts have been waylaid by Republican governor Tim Pawlenty ’s vow to veto anything resembling a step toward same - sex marriage .
While they would welcome help from the national gay - rights crowd , the state - level folks have no intention of ceding control .
“ I think they can help on some of the language framing and the arguments , ” Fiebiger says , “ but so much of this is based on long - standing values that differ from other parts of the country …
I think the local folks have a better handle on that piece . ”
What they do need is money , especially in states with small gay populations .
But historically , national groups have been reluctant to open their wallets unless a bill is close to passage .
This , state - level activists say , makes it hard for them to do the grunt work needed to secure those long - term victories .
They would also welcome national help to elect more Democrats at the state level .
The latest votes on gay rights in Montana , Utah , and West Virginia were split along party lines , and leaders in Minnesota and Wisconsin stress that their outlook has improved dramatically since the Dems took power .
In Wisconsin , bigotry itself helped facilitate the power shift .
“ I think under Karl Rove , the Republican Party decided that this was going to be a really good wedge issue for them — and it actually was , for a few years , ” notes Carlson .
The turning point , he says , came in 2006 , when anti-gay campaigning backfired on state Republicans , likely costing them control of the statehouse .
“ Not to sound like it ’s the school yard , ” Carlson quips , “ but they started it . ”

The CIA has used " stress and duress " techniques on al - Qaida suspects held at secret overseas detention centres , as well as contracting out their interrogation to foreign intelligence agencies known to routinely use torture , said a report published yesterday .
The Washington Post paints a harrowing picture of the procedures for extracting information from terrorism suspects at such centres as Diego Garcia , the Indian Ocean island leased from Britain , and Bagram , the large US airbase in Afghanistan .
Inmates at Bagram are kept in painful positions for hours , hooded or made to wear opaque goggles , or bombarded with light , the report says .
However , other detainees have faced far worse for not cooperating , being " rendered " to a foreign intelligence service which has no compunction about torture .
The Post suggests there has been a sweeping change in US policy on torture since September 11 , despite public pronouncements against its use .
It quotes Cofer Black , the former director of the CIA 's counter - terrorist branch , as telling a congressional intelligence committee : " All you need to know : there was a before 9/11 , and there was an after 9/11 ...
After 9/11 the gloves come off . "
Yesterday 's report has deepened concern in human rights circles about the fate of the roughly 3,000 people quietly detained around the world .
" I think there needs to be a clear statement from the US government that they are abiding by the Geneva convention with the treatment of detainees , " James Ross , a senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch , said yesterday .
" Turning people over to another government to do something that would amount to torture is a problem .
It is torture by proxy , and the US should not be doing that . "
The CIA refused to comment on the report yesterday .
Reports that there could be abuse of detainees at Diego Garcia could also prove embarrassing for Britain .
The Indian Ocean atoll is a British dependency and houses joint US and British air and naval facilities .
" If they know about this , and torture and mistreatment are taking place in Diego Garcia , British officials could also be viewed as taking part in torture , " Mr Ross said .
The report offers the first details of inmates ' treatment at CIA camps outside Guantanamo Bay , where some 600 al - Qaida suspects are held .
But the Guantanamo inmates have had at least limited access to lawyers , journalists , and the Red Cross , whereas Bagram is strictly off - limits , and human rights groups fear conditions could be worse .
Earlier this month , officials said they would launch a criminal inquiry into the death of two prisoners at Bagram .
One reportedly died of a heart attack , the other of a pulmonary embolism .
US laws apparently do not apply at the centres , where CIA agents oversee - or take part in - the interrogations .
While the US publicly denounces torture , the Post says each of the 10 serving national security officials interviewed by the paper defended the use of violence against captives .
" If you do n't violate someone 's human rights some of the time , you probably are n't doing your job , " an official who has supervised the capture of suspects told the newspaper .
" I do n't think we want to be promoting a view of zero tolerance on this .
That was the whole problem for a long time with the CIA . "
The report says CIA agents sometimes trick a detainee into thinking he is held in a state where torture is routine .
On other occasions , low - level suspects have been handed over to Jordanian , Egyptian , and Moroccan agencies - known for their brutality - with a list of questions from the CIA .
Some US officials claim the main motive of such " renditions " is the belief that a suspect will open up if questioned in his own language or on familiar terrain .
However , one official directly involved in rendering captives to foreign hands is quoted as saying : " We do n't kick the [ expletive ] out of them .
We send them to other countries so they can kick the [ expletive ] out of them . "

Crazy , unsustainable salaries doom San Francisco and other California cities
Consider the city of San Francisco a microcosm of what ’s happening in the rest of California .
A bankrupt microcosm .
As you ’d expect , it ’s doomed by its own socialist spending spree , the cost of providing education , medical and jail facilities to illegal aliens , and a bloated bureaucracy .
But the salaries it ’s paying city employees are absolutely insane .
In 2007 , the city had more than 8000 employees who “ earned ” more than $ 100,000 per year .
Here ’s a list of the city ’s twenty highest - paid public employees :
$ 350,324 for a Special Nurse .
$ 325,452 for the General Manager of the Municipal Railway .
$ 270,171 for a Captain in the Fire Department .
It ’s insane .
How can a nurse make $ 350,324 ?
In a word , overtime .
Here ’s how Special Nurse Christian Kitchin ’s income broke down :
Regular pay $ 117,262
Overtime pay $ 216,277
Other pay $ 16,785
Total pay $ 350,324
And do n’t forget that this is on top of generous government retirement and health care schemes that are n’t available to the rest of us .
You can see the details of all 8,000 of these government employees ’ salaries with the handy list generator at SFGate.com .
Mayor Gavin Newsom , the whiz kid whose managerial genius has bankrupted San Francisco , is now running for Governor of California .
We know how we ’ll vote .
Another day , another denunciation of Dawkins and Hitchens and their fellow New Atheists .
No sooner have we absorbed Chris Hedges ' I Don't Believe in Atheists ( 2008 ) , Tina Beattie 's The New Atheists : The Twilight of Reason and the War on Religion ( 2008 ) or David Bentley Hart 's Atheist Delusions ( 2009 ) when along comes God is Back : How the Revival of Religion is Changing the World Economist journalists John Micklethwait ( pictured right ) and Adrian Wooldridge .
But this " God book " is of a rather different order .
Unlike its rivals it contains a wealth of fact and subtle argument , empirical evidence and expert witness .
As we might expect from The Economist its perspective is global - it sweeps comfortably from the corridors of the Pentagon to a front room church in Shanghai , and speaks authoritatively about events in Nigeria , Pakistan and Egypt .
Altogether it lays down a very serious challenge to any of us who had waved God a not - so - fond farewell .
The challenge is threefold .
First in line is the secularisation thesis , the argument that religion simply fades away as a natural consequence of modernisation .
Not true , argue Micklethwait and Wooldridge .
Modernity does n't usher in secularisation , it actively promotes religious pluralism .
They then train their sights on the equally popular notion that religion contaminates all those who subscribe to its bogus myths and stories .
Not true , argue Micklethwait and Wooldridge .
Religion brings out both the best and worst in man , and secularists need to come to terms with the positive role religions have played in providing meaningful care and support for the oppressed as well as in the nurturing of aspirations for political freedom from Poland to Burma to El Salvador .
Secularists should therefore recognise the corollary of these two facts .
While it is perfectly appropriate to demand that religionists should accept the separation of church and mosque from state as a guarantee of freedom of conscience for all , secularists should play their part by accepting that religion is here to stay .
Consider the United States .
It is both the most modern and one of the most religious countries in the world .
It also provides solid evidence of how religions can provide a commendable array of social services in the absence of an effective welfare state .
But it is also a perfect example of how religion can be kept separate from the state .
If we could all become more like America , the book argues , we could all get along famously .
I met up with John Micklethwait in a spacious office on the 13th floor of the tallest building in West London 's Economist Plaza .
He sipped from a can of Coke as he apologised in a friendly , youthful manner for the mess on his very noticeably tidy antique desk .
I began by pressing him on his objections to the well - known secularisation thesis .
Were he and his co-author really saying that Durkheim , Weber , Marx , Freud and generations of sociologists had got it wrong ?
" Well , I 'm not sure we are the first people to say it - after all the distinguished sociologist Peter Berger changed his mind about it a while ago , which was a pretty seismic event , and sociologists have been arguing about it ever since .
The difference is that as reporters we have gone out into the world and seen the evidence .
We have seen that religion is not going away , that it is in many ways a partner with modernity and not in conflict with it .
Many people in Europe , ourselves included , missed the signs that religion was coming back .
It took 9/11 for us to take notice , but as a phenomenon it started well before .
Even as a Catholic I grew up in an environment which completely accepted the notion that modernity and religion are incompatible - we all thought that if religion did survive it would be a kind of subtle Anglicanism , some version of a doubting Graham Greeneish religion .
The evidence shows we were wrong . "
And , he went on to claim , it was n't only the classical academics who'd got it wrong .
The political class , across the West , was almost wilfully blind to the return of the sacred .
" Take the CIA looking at the Shah of Iran , just before the revolution .
Someone wrote a report saying that religion was an important factor in what might happen , and someone else scribbled a dismissive note on it that it was ' mere sociology ' .
Or when Hezbollah first appeared in Lebanon and people were trying to fit them into the old left - right spectrum - I mean this was a group calling itself ' the party of God ' .
When the Americans were preparing to invade Iraq it was clear that no one in the State Department knew anything about the differences between Shia and Sunni - they just did n't think it mattered .
In Europe there was this same pattern .
Immigrants from all over the world moved to the UK and set up organisations like the Muslim Council of Britain , and the secular British state kept trying to reinterpret them as national or ethnic groups - they did n't understand the significance of religious identity at all .
History does not record the dwindling importance of religion .
Instead it 's a story of people trying to push the issue aside - until September 11 . "
There was also the compelling evidence of the emergence of new forms of Christianity in China and Nigeria , the growth of Islam across the Arab world and in Asia , and the proliferation of different strands of belief in the USA .
And all of this was happening while modernisation proceeded apace .
At this point we were " joined " by Micklethwait 's co-author Adrian Wooldridge , on the phone from Washington .
His voice emerged , loud and clear and disconcertingly , from a golf - ball - shaped speaker in the ceiling .
( It crossed my mind that it was not unlike interviewing the Archbishop of Canterbury and having God join the conversation . )
Wooldridge took up the question of what we can learn from American religious pluralism : " European secularists assume that the church is on the side of the ancien régime , of the establishment , that it 's against reason and democracy and liberal emancipation , and there is a lot of evidence for that in Europe .
But in America the evangelical movement advanced alongside democracy and liberal enlightened values .
They were not oppositional forces but comrades in arms .
If you give people more freedom and more democracy they will talk about what they want to talk about and obviously for many people that is God.
Religion itself has also been important for advancing democracy - it's an example of the little platoons of civil society .
Churches nurture certain civic values , that 's why the Chinese government , and all totalitarian governments , have been very suspicious of them and have tried to crush them . "
Micklethwait was quick to provide reinforcement .
" In Eastern Europe religion has served as a battering ram for opening up the post - communist world because it serves as a focus for discontent .
In Poland or Latin America even the Catholic Church has been a focus for dissent .
The church can act as a barrier to democratisation , as the Catholic Church did for a long time in Europe , but it can also inspire democratisation . "
They are only too happy to concede that religion has been and still can be a disaster .
What they resist is a simple dichotomy .
Wooldridge put it like this : " The problem with this subject , and I speak as a Balliol atheist here , is that people want to see a neat antithesis between liberalism and religion , or modernity and religion , or reason and religion , and it just does n't work .
Religion has a good side and a bad side .
Sometimes they can come together in the same organisation , as with Hezbollah .
It 's complicated . "
I wondered if they realised the alarm with which rationalists and atheists would greet their suggestions that as democracy increases around the world we should expect to see the emergence of more " parties of God " .
Did they recognise that this was a kind of nightmare for many of us ?
" If the parties of God are Hezbollah then they are nightmares for us too , " says Micklethwait .
" The thing is , when democracy is concerned the secular - minded always think that people will go off and vote for ' normal guys ' but of course they do n't .
It 's not just the most oppressed who do this - in India and Turkey the educated bourgeoisie , exactly the people who should be the most secular , the driving force of the economy , have flooded towards religiously inspired parties . "
This is not necessarily a welcome development for either Micklethwait or Wooldridge .
They are pragmatists .
Religion is there , and you have to deal with it .
But did n't their pragmatism wear a little thin when they turned in their book to the manner in which religion did good ?
In their portrait , for example , of the many ways in which American Christianity provided vital welfare to the needy , an expertise they dub " soulcraft " .
Not so , argued Adrian Wooldridge ( pictured right ) .
" If you look at the world of social services , religion provides two things very well .
One is you have people who are willing to make sacrifices and do things that it is hard to believe that secular - minded people would do .
People like Pastor Richard Smith from the Faith Assembly of God in Philadelphia , who would just walk into crack houses where people were pointing guns at him and try and close them down .
No rational person , let alone any social services bureaucrat , would do that sort of thing .
He was absolutely convinced that God would protect him .
He devoted his entire time to helping the poor , the homeless , drug - addicted people , with very few resources .
His story is remarkable but I think it is multiplied in a lot of different places .
If you took away the work that is done by the church in Philadelphia alone it would represent about half a billion dollars of social services cost a year . "
But was n't there some traditional Economist bias against the welfare state here ?
Were n't the churches in the US merely compensating for the fact that US welfare is so threadbare ?
Would n't it be preferable if such care was provided by the state and not delivered in the context of faith ?
Wooldridge , the atheist , was having none of that .
" Care is actually better if it is provided in a faith context .
If you look at social services you have to fill in forms , people are antagonistic or they do it because they have to , whereas if you go to church for help you know you are talking to another human being who actually cares .
Its not just in the US - the same is true in China or Russia and part of the Middle East .
If you look around the world you have weak welfare states that do n't provide , and it is unlikely that they will provide in the future .
Most people who become welfare - dependent do so because of lack of skills , lack of opportunities , but also because of a lack of self - worth or a lack of a sense of meaning or purpose .
These are things that religion is very good at , that bureaucratic welfare systems can't do .
So yes , I think they are a good in themselves . "
Though the tone at times tends toward the celebratory , the authors recognise the catastrophic damage religion can do too .
" We disagree with European secularists in the idea that God is dead or unimportant , or that modernity and religion are incompatible , " says Wooldridge .
" Where we strongly agree with them is with the idea that religion can be dangerous , and we think that this happens when you get a fusion between political power and religion " .
And they think they 've found the solution .
" The lesson other countries should learn from America , " Wooldridge continues , " is that the separation between church and state is the basis for a flourishing civil society . "
Just as American entrepreneurial can - do provides the model for the Economist - approved form of global capitalism , so religion American - style is the exportable model for faith .
" We think internally America has the best system for dealing with the return of religion , " insisted Micklethwait .
" If only they could recognise it , and model their foreign policy on it .
They have plurality of religion , which does not clash with progress , and if people are going to continue believing in God , which they are , then some kind of formal separation between religion and the state seems a really good idea .
With the constitution America has that bit cracked . "
But did we really want more exporting of American models to the world ?
Would n't we end up with more megachurchs and McMosques , with the emergence of powerful consolidated global religious brands ?
" There may be a degree of consolidation , but the thing about American religions is they come and go .
The Methodists swept through everything , then the Baptists were in the ascendant , then the Catholics come back a bit .
Nobody ever quite hangs on to dominance .
It 's a vigorous , competitive marketplace of ideas . "
This might well be true of America .
But when , I asked , might we expect to see a free market of religions in Saudi Arabia ?
Micklethwait happily conceded that Islam has a good deal further to travel but pointed out that it is losing significant ground to Christianity in the new markets of Asia and Latin America .
" This is not what we expected given how well Islam did compared with Christianity in the 20th century in terms of expansion , and given that it was the arrival of Jihadi violence that alerted the world to the return of religion .
Islam 's problems with plurality and individual conscience will drag it back .
It has to go through a process - a Reformation or Renaissance or Enlightenment - which will be painful .
It 's entirely possible that Islam will go through some horrific revolutions .
Equally what might happen is that Muslims who live in the West , those with experience of living in a plural society , might start to change Islam from within .
Saudi Arabia does not look like a likely candidate to offer a modernised Islam . "
It is because of their ( very Economist ) emphasis on the benefits of religion as a kind of spiritual marketplace , with traders free to set up stall , consumers free to choose , and rules against monopoly , that the authors choose to end their argument with a clarion call for global disestablishment , and a more local demand for the ending of the established church in Britain .
" Rowan Williams is a decent man but there is no way you can defend the situation where we are the only country other than Iran to have clerics at the heart of our political system , " says Micklethwait .
" Disestablishment would also be a very good thing for the church - it would allow them speak more clearly and compete in the marketplace of ideas .
Has the Church of England gained from the past 200 years of being an organ of the state ?
I think not . "
I left feeling in need of more proof that the secularisation thesis was completely wrong : experience seems to suggest that rising educational standards do reduce religious affiliation .
But I felt more able to acknowledge that the process is far from even and that globalisation is throwing up more diversity of belief .
Nor did I feel ready to accept that faith - based social welfare is the best model for developing countries , but then perhaps I am romantic about the NHS .
We should all be cheered , however , by Micklethwait and Wooldridge 's unconditional support for disestablishment - they will make useful allies in keeping up the pressure on theocracies worldwide , as well as launching the long overdue expulsion of the bishops from the second chamber here at home .
Secularists might find some of the arguments in this book hard to swallow , though they should welcome the opportunity to sharpen their own against them , but as a clear and convincing case for the separation of religion and politics , it counts as a considerable , and unapologetically secular , achievement .

Now , this is how I want my potatoes from now on !
Do you really need a recipe ?
All you do is peel whole potatoes , cut them all across , not too thin , and not all the way through , sprinkle with some salt , but not too much , the bacon is salty .
Then fill with small bacon slices in between .
Bake in a pan with some oil until potatoes are fully cooked , and serve !
In the original recipe , the potatoes are first cooked half way , and I guess this is done to cut the baking time , which I did n’t do , and they took a while to be completely baked , but I did n’t mind waiting .
CLARKSVILLE , Tenn .
( AP )  Tennessee authorities have invalidated the 18 - month marriage of a transgender woman and a man , saying the state considers them both men .
Jo T. Rittenberry , 46 , was born a man and claims to have had sex reassignment surgery in Canada .
The Clarksville Leaf Chronicle reported that she had officials legally change the gender on her Kentucky birth certificate and Tennessee driver 's license .
Rittenberry married Jeffery Scott Phillips , 36 , in November 2007 .
Kelly Farmer , director of communications at the Davidson County Clerk 's Office , said Tennessee authorities will not honor the marriage because Rittenberry was not born a woman .
Tennessee does not permit same - sex marriage and does not recognize gender change even after sex reassignment surgery .
" The marriage is real to me , " said Rittenberry , also known as Terri Jo Colby .
" It was n't anything planned to be deceptive .
I 'm not gay , and Jeff ai n't either . "
The Canadian clinic where Rittenberry claims to have had gender reassignment surgery says she was a patient there but no operation was performed .
Rittenberry disputes that .
Authorities began raising questions of gender after Rittenberry was booked into jail in March , charged with domestic assault against a relative and criminal impersonation stemming from allegations of credit card fraud .
Montgomery Sheriff 's Department spokesman Ted Denny told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Rittenberry is being housed with men and was patted down by both male and female officers because Rittenberry has breasts and male genitalia .

Oprah Buys Everyone Free KFC , Chickens Everywhere Cry Fowl
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
Remember that special Oprah had last year addressing the “ dark side ” of chicken factory farming ?
The same one that helped earn her PETA ’s 2008 “ Person of the Year ” Award ?
Yea , well , we do n’t see a repeat performance anytime soon .
On Oprah today , the host announced that she was hooking up with Kentucky Fried Chicken to give away a free two - piece Kentucky Grilled Chicken meal to every family in America .
Obviously , this is going to come as a shock to PETA — who is in the middle of a renewed campaign urging KFC to change the way its suppliers treat their chickens .
Famous folks like Pamela Anderson , Sir Paul McCartney , His Holiness the Dalai Lama , The Rev. Al Sharpton , and countless others have signed on to boycott KFC .
Some will argue that this is a free meal — and in a time of economic hell , any food is good food .
It just bothers me that with everything Oprah has done to bring attention to the plight of chickens and animals in factory farms , that she would approach a chain like KFC to give people a free meal .
Why not give something relatively healthy like a free salad instead ?

Under the Obama administration 's proposed rules for funding embryonic stem cell research , hundreds of existing cell lines could be ineligible , even those that qualified under President Bush .
The guidelines were written by the National Institutes of Health and are currently in draft form and expected to be finalized in July .
But in their current state , they restrict funding to stem cell lines produced according to new rules that are only now being established .
Few existing cell lines will meet those requirements .
" The so - called Presidential lines are n't suitable for actual medical application , " said Patrick Taylor , deputy counsel at Children 's Hospital Boston , who criticized the NIH guidelines in a paper published Thursday in * Cell Stem Cell .
*" But we 're talking about many , many more lines .
The new lines were created with extensive ethical oversight .
They 're at stake here . "
When President Barack Obama announced on March 9 that research restrictions enforced by President Bush would be overturned , scientists rejoiced .
Under Bush , only 21 embryonic stem cell lines already established by August 2001 qualified for federal funding .
A few scientists chafed at Obama 's remaining restrictions on research cloning , produced through cloning , but most believed the new rules would finally let researchers to pursue the awesome medical promise of embryonic stem cells with full governmental support .
In recent weeks , however , scholars parsing the NIH 's draft guidelines , released April 18 , have realized they could prove even more restrictive .
At issue are informed consent requirements for women who donated eggs left unused during fertility treatments , and eventually used to generate embryonic stem cells .
Though egg collection has long been governed by widely lauded consent standards established by the National Research Council and International Society for Stem Cell Research , those standards did n't previously meet the letter of the NIH 's proposed law .
The NIH requires consent forms that clearly mention human embryonic stem cell research , forbid donating eggs for the benefit of a specific person , and contain various other stipulations that were generally mentioned during older consent processes , but not rigorously codified .
These rules could have a massive impact on existing and proposed research .
" The NIH estimated that their draft guidelines would make available 700 new lines of ESCs derived over the past 10 years , " said Sean Morrison , a University of Michigan cell biologist .
" My personal guess is that unless they loosen the informed consent standard that they 're going to retroactively apply , then most of those 700 lines would not be eligible . "
Morrison said the new consent standards are good , but should be applied to future cell lines , not old ones .
" The standards for informed consent evolve over time , " he said .
" It would make no sense to take out lines that , 10 years ago , everyone agreed were ethically derived , just because they do n't meet the letter of the new requirements . "
Patrick Taylor agreed with Morrison .
" If someone 's been doing clinical research and they apply a new protocol , we do n't ask them to go back and do all that research over again , " he said .
" We ask them to change their conduct going forward . "
Taylor noted that removing federal support for ESC lines supported by Bush would n't only affect use of the cells , but all the work done to characterize line - specific behaviors and tendencies .
" When you take a cell line and say we 're not going to use it any more , you 're talking about a tremendous body of information , " he said .
Researchers who currently receive federal support for research on Bush - approved lines would be able to continue working until their grants run out , but the grants would not be renewed , said Morrison .
Most ESC lines that are not now eligible would never become eligible .
The NIH will accept public comments on the guidelines until May 26 .
The comment form form can be found on the NIH website , and the International Society for Stem Cell Research has provided a form letter for use by commenters .
" Nobody thinks those lines were n't ethically derived .
It 's just that some of the details were n't there because nobody thought of writing them down in informed consent documents , " said Morrison .
" And now they'd be forcing scientists to abandon their work and start from scratch on new lines . "

US Energy Secretary Steven
Chu says the US will not be able to cut greenhouse emissions as much as it should due to domestic political opposition .
Prof Chu told BBC
News he feared the world might be heading towards a tipping point on climate change .
This meant the US had to cut emissions urgently - even if compromises were needed to get new laws approved .
Environmentalists said Prof Chu , a Nobel physicist , should be guided by science not politics .
The American political system is in the throes of a fierce battle over climate policy .
President Barack Obama says he wants cuts in greenhouse gases but has left it to Congress to make the political running .
The House of Representatives is debating a climate and energy bill but even if it passes it may be rejected by senators , many of whom are funded by the energy industry .
Prof Chu is a Nobel prize - winning physicist and a world expert on clean energy .
But he said it was impossible to ignore political reality .
" With each successive year the news on climate change has not been good and there 's a growing sensation that the world and the US in particular has to get moving , " he said .
If you could convert ( with photovoltaic cells ) 20 % of the Sun 's energy into electricity you would need 5 % of the world 's deserts .
This is not much land
Steven Chu , US Energy Secretary " As someone very concerned about climate I want to be as aggressive as possible but I also want to get started .
And if we say we want something much more aggressive on the early timescales that would draw considerable opposition and that would delay the process for several years .
The US energy secretary said that awareness of climate tipping points had increased greatly only in the past five years .
He added : " But if I am going to say we need to do much , much better I am afraid the US wo n't get started . "
To the anger of environmentalists , he said that one compromise would be approving new coal - fired power plants without obliging them to capture and store their carbon .
The UK government has made this a stipulation for new coal plants but Prof Chu declined to explain why the US government would not follow suit .
' Tough standards '
The first step in America , he said , should be a massive programme of efficiency for commercial buildings .
This could save 80 % of their energy demand , he said .
He said the government would provide the research and encourage states to adopt tough standards .
He envisaged a future in which the US was largely p Please turn on JavaScript .

owered by wind and solar but admitted there were technical difficulties .
On solar he explained : " The challenge is to make solar energy cost - effective .
The amount of energy hitting the Earth - if you looked at it , if you could convert ( with photovoltaic cells ) 20 % of the Sun 's energy into electricity you would need 5 % of the world 's deserts .
This is not much land .
So the opportunity is enormous .
" The question is whether we can make it cost - effective .
You have to transport this long distances because people do n't live in deserts . "
Similarly , on wind , Prof Chu told BBC News : " The good news is that many of the areas with good wind are where there are n't many people , so there are fewer objections to wind farms .
The bad news is that there are n't many people .
So we are planning to look at how you get an interconnecting ( transmission ) system , to allow us to develop these great resources . "
An overriding challenge for both technologies was the need to develop storage for energy from renewables .
When informed about research from HSBC suggesting that China had invested twice as much in greening its economy with its fiscal stimulus as the US had done , he said he had not seen the figures but that he wished for more money for clean energy .
' Pressing challenge '
He said the challenge was pressing , and agreed that the world could face future spikes in energy prices because the recession had halted investment in many energy projects .
This would be an issue at the upcoming G8 finance ministers meeting , he said .
Damon Moglen from Greenpeace USA was alarmed by Prof Chu 's comments .
" Obama has had something of a honeymoon with environmentalists , " he said .
" But we are getting very concerned .
Professor
Chu is a good man and a good scientist , but the science on global warming is clear and he should be guided by the science not the politics .
" It is out of the question that the US should agree new power stations burning coal - the dirtiest fuel .
Our targets on emissions are too low anyway - and there is no way we will meet even those low targets if we allow more coal to be burned .
" Professor Chu 's comments on coal are contradictory and illogical .
This administration should give him the head to develop the sort of energy policy he knows we really need . "
But Prof Chu said : " I am optimistic for the first time in my life that the US will start to move in this direction ( of cutting emissions ) and that 's why I am heartened by these efforts .
If you had asked me two or three years ago what 's the possibility we could move in the direction of reducing carbon emissions in the US I would have said I do n't know . "
When asked whether he was frustrated , he said : " No , I am realistic about the politics and as in time we can make adjustments . "

Restricted red band trailer for Bruno :
As created for Sacha Baron Cohen 's Da Ali G Show , the gay Austrian supermodel , Bruno , is prepping to runway it up on the bigscreen .
After the film was completed , Bruno had to undergo more editing to remove an interview with LaToya Jackson after Michael Jackson 's death .
In the interview , Bruno says Michael Jackson is a man he would like to meet with .
Another scene depicting Bruno trying to get tickets to a Michael Jackson concert was also cut .
Sacha Baron
Cohen worked out , shaved all his body hair and dyed his hair to play Bruno .
Baron Cohen claims that Harrison Ford is in the only scene that was scripted , and that he was the only actor in on the joke .
Audience members in a talk show scene were hired for $ 50 each and genuinely thought they were attending the taping of a new show .
As comedians go , Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the most intelligent ones out there .
His comic creations of Ali-G , Borat , and now Bruno have shocked , outraged and angered many ... and also made many of us laugh .
Personally , I 've followed his work since his first appearances on a British TV show as Ali - G .
I loved that character , but Borat was the one that really stood out for me .
The character was so well thought out , so well rounded and so entirely believable , that Cohen fooled many , many people into thinking they were taking part in a genuine documentary .
What I also loved about Borat , was that he made people smile .
Sure , some were angered , but a lot of those who ' met ' him for an interview found him to be quite endearing and they often tried to help him understand .
Bruno is much more ' in your face ' much more crude , offensive and really , at times , it makes for uncomfortable viewing .
The trailer has clear examples of this .
As trailers go , it gives a good overview of what to expect from the film ; which is more of the mockumentary style for which Cohen is becoming known .
It worked for Borat , right ?
So it must also work for Bruno too .
Well , wrong .
A lot of the jokes here fall flat in the trailer , and things like him illegally gatecrashing a Milan fashion show , or deliberately seeking to rile people up , make for quite awkward viewing .
Because of that , the bits of this trailer that are funny , suddenly do n't seem as great after all .

Mr. Gawne is the author of many books about World War II .
His latest is : Finding Your Father 's War : A Practical Guide to Researching and Understanding Service in the World War II U.S. Army ( Casemate ) .
Every June the press carries stories about the invasion of Normandy in 1944 .
One of the most common questions raised is “ what does the term D - Day mean and where does it come from ? ”
The answer to what it means is readily known .
They are used for the day and hour on which a combat attack or operation is to be initiated .
However , the question of where the U.S. Army got the term has remained a mystery .
The First World War saw the start of massive operations involving the coordination of hundreds of thousands of troops , enormous logistics operations , and week long artillery barrages .
The need for staffs to begin planning the details of an attack weeks and months before , led to a simple notation for the planned date and hour of the attack : D - day and H - Hour .
Once the plans were distributed , all the commander had to do was announce the correct date and hour , and everyone would begin working in synch .
It also helped keep the secrecy of an attack by not having the exact dates and times written on every set of orders .
An artillery barrage set to be fired at H - Hour minus one ( H - 1 ) would be understood to begin one hour before the official start of the attack .
A brigade could be told their objective was to reach hill X by H - Hour plus three ( H+3 ) .
If the attack was delayed , or moved up the brigade would still know that they had 3 hours after the start of the attack to take that hill .
By not using exact dates and times these carefully planned attacks had flexibility .
The first use of the term “ D - Day , H - Hour ” by U.S. forces appears to be around 7 September 1918 when the term was used in the First Army Field Order Number 9 regarding the battle of St. Mihiel .
However , working further backwards in A.E.F. records to the Battle of Cantigny , the First Division Field Order Number 18 from 22 May 1918 uses the term “ D - Day , J - Jour . ”
The American staffs had clearly been using the French terminology in their planning .
Soon afterwards these terms change to “ D - Day ” and “ J - Day ” in American orders .
One might hypothesize that random letters were being chosen to indicate the time of operation , but this was simply a case of a translator not understanding that the correct English translation of “ J - Jour ” would actually be “ D - Day . ”
But could the French have borrowed the term from the British ?
In WW1 the British Army used the designation of “ Z - Day ” and “ Zero Hour ” for the time of attack .
The days leading up to an attack were called X - Day and Y - Day .
Artillery Instruction Number 267 issued by the Australian Corps on 23 September 1918 to the US 27th and 30th Divisions , who were serving with the British forces , use the terms Z - Day and Zero Hour .
Orders issued internally by the two American divisions for the same attack change these references from Z - Day to D - Day .
So it appears that the term “ D - Day , ” which has become synonymous with the invasion and liberation of France , originated with the French themselves .

Guatemala police arrested I.T. professional Jean Ramses Anleu Fernández at his Guatemala City home on Thursday on charges of having incited financial panic via messages posted to the Twitter social networking web site .
Known as " Jeanfer " on Twitter , Anleu Fernández 's home was raided and his computer seized after he posted a message ( known as a " tweet " ) on Tuesday afternoon proposing that people " withdraw cash from Banrural , and break the bank of the corrupt , " ( ( Translated from Spanish ) ) Spanish : ‍ " sacar el pisto de Banrural " quebrar al banco de los corruptos a response to high profile allegations that the Guatemalan Banrural bank is involved in corruption .
The logo of social networking web site , Twitter
Anleu Fernández 's message was posted with the tag " #escandalogt , " identifying it as part of an ongoing discussion on the scandal that broke on Monday when a video recorded by assassinated Guatemalan attorney Rodrigo Rosenberg was distributed at Rosenberg 's funeral and posted to the Internet .
In the video , recorded days before he was shot while riding his bicycle in Guatemala City , Rosenberg accuses President of Guatemala Álvaro Colom of complicity in his death .
Rosenberg also accused President Colom of responsibility for the April murder of Rosenberg 's client , Khalil Musa , alleging that Musa was killed because he refused to cooperate in corrupt business deals operating within the structure of Banrural , a partly state - run bank .
Musa had been appointed by President Colom to the board of Banrural .
Anleu Fernández was arrested according to a law which specifies fines of Q5,000 - Q50,000 Guatemalan quetzales ( about $ 600 - $ 6,000 U.S. dollars ) and 1 - 3 years of prison for those who " elaborate , divulge or reproduce in any media or communication system , false or inexact information which harms the confidence of customers , users , depositors or investors " ( ( Translated from Spanish ) ) Spanish : ‍elabore , divulgue o reproduzca por cualquier medio o sistema de comunicación , información falsa o inexacta que menoscabe la confianza de los clientes , usuarios , depositantes o inversionistas of an institution under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of Banks .
Prosecutor Genaro Pacheco told journalists that Anleu Fernández admitted to sending the message in question .

Flu vaccine studies that are funded by industry are significantly more likely to be published in prestigious journals and to later be cited in the scientific literature than studies without such funding , according to a survey of 274 studies conducted by researchers from the Cochrane Vaccine Field in Italy , and published in theA good methodology , in contrast , had little impact on such factors .
The study also found few studies providing good evidence that the flu vaccine is actually effective .
In principle , a higher quality study should be published in a more prestigious journal and should be cited more frequently than a low quality study .
But the researchers found no relationship between study quality and either of those factors .
Instead , having a study partially or fully funded by industry was the best way to boost the prominence of a study .
Overall , the authors also found that most flu vaccine studies were of poor quality , with only 18 percent of them reporting conclusions that were actually supported by their findings ( concordance ) .
" The study shows that one of the levers for accessing prestigious journals is the financial size of your sponsor , " said researcher Tom Jefferson .
" Pharmaceutical sponsors order many reprints of studies supporting their products , often with in - house translations into many languages .
They will also purchase publicity space on the journal .
Many publishers openly advertise these services on their Web site . "
" It is time journals made a full disclosure of their sources of funding , " Jefferson concluded .
The researchers also found that studies supporting the effectiveness of flu vaccines tended to be more poorly designed than studies not supporting their effectiveness .
Concordance was also significantly lower in studies supporting vaccine effectiveness than in those refuting it -- meaning that most studies failed to support the effectiveness of the flu vaccine Government - funded studies were significantly less likely to find the flu vaccine effective than industry - funded studies .

As modern cosmologists rely more and more on the ominous " dark matter " to explain otherwise inexplicable observations , much effort has gone into the detection of this mysterious substance in the last two decades , yet no direct proof could be found that it actually exists .
Even if it does exist , dark matter would be unable to reconcile all the current discrepancies between actual measurements and predictions based on theoretical models .
Hence the number of physicists questioning the existence of dark matter has been increasing for some time now .
Competing theories of gravitation have already been developed which are independent of this construction .
Their only problem is that they conflict with Newton 's theory of gravitation .
" Maybe Newton was indeed wrong " , declares Professor Dr. Pavel Kroupa of Bonn University´s Argelander - Institut für Astronomie ( AIfA ) .
" Although his theory does , in fact , describe the everyday effects of gravity on Earth , things we can see and measure , it is conceivable that we have completely failed to comprehend the actual physics underlying the force of gravity " .
This is a problematical hypothesis that has nevertheless gained increasing ground in recent years , especially in Europe .
Two new studies could well lend further support to it .
In these studies , Professor Kroupa and his former colleague Dr. Manuel Metz , working in collaboration with Professor Dr. Gerhard Hensler and Dr. Christian
Theis from the University of Vienna , and Dr. Helmut Jerjen from the Australian National University , Canberra , have examined so - called " satellite galaxies " .
This term is used for dwarf galaxy companions of the Milky Way , some of which contain only a few thousand stars .
According to the best cosmological models , they exist presumably in hundreds around most of the major galaxies .
Up to now , however , only 30 such satellites have been observed around the Milky Way , a discrepancy in numbers which is commonly attributed to the fact that the light emitted from the majority of satellite galaxies is so faint they remain invisible .
A detailed study of these stellar agglomerates has revealed some astonishing phenomena : " First of all , there is something unusual about their distribution " , Professor Kroupa explains , " the satellites should be uniformly arranged around their mother galaxy , but this is not what we found " .
More precisely , all classical satellites of the Milky Way - the eleven brightest dwarf galaxies - lie more or less in the same plane , they are forming some sort of a disc in the sky .
The research team has also been able to show that most of these satellite galaxies rotate in the same direction around the Milky Way - like the planets revolve around the Sun .
Contradiction upon Contradiction
The physicists do belief that this phenomenon can only be explained if the satellites were created a long time ago through collisions between younger galaxies .
" The fragments produced by such an event can form rotating dwarf galaxies " , explains Dr. Metz , who has recently moved across to the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft - und Raumfahrt ( German Aero- space Center ) .
But there is an interesting catch to this crash theory , " theoretical calculations tell us that the satellites created cannot contain any dark matter " .
This assumption , however , stands in contradiction to another observation .
" The stars in the satellites we have observed are moving much faster than predicted by the Gravitational Law .
If classical physics holds this can only be attributed to the presence of dark matter " , Manuel Metz states .
Or one must assume that some basic fundamental principles of physics have hitherto been incorrectly understood .
" The only solution would be to reject Newton´s classical theory of gravitation " , says Pavel Kroupa .
" We probably live in a non-Newton universe .
If this is true , then our observations could be explained without dark matter " .
Such approaches are finding support amongst other research teams in Europe , too .
It would not be the first time that Newton 's theory of gravitation had to be modified over the past hundred years .
This became necessary in three special cases : when high velocities are involved ( through the Special Theory of Relativity ) , in the proximity of large masses ( through the theory of General Relativity ) , and on sub-atomic scales ( through quantum mechanics ) .
The deviations detected in the satellite galaxy data support the hypothesis that in space where extremely weak accelerations predominate , a " modified Newton dynamic " must be adopted .
This conclusion has far - reaching consequences for fundamental physics in general , and also for cosmological theories .
¬¬ Famous astrophysicist Bob Sanders from the University of Groningen declares : " The authors of this paper make a strong argument .
Their result is entirely consistent with the expectations of modified Newtonian dynamics ( MOND ) , but completely opposite to the predictions of the dark matter hypothesis .
Rarely is an observational test so definite . "

Last week I showed how you can remove the digg bar from your blog using javascript .
Jonathan Bailey also wrote about this subject and he later emailed me about an article John Gruber wrote .
As some of you may know , Javscript has some limitations .
One of the biggest problems is that users have the option of switching javascript off .
Thankfully , John has posted a PHP solution to removing the Digg Bar .
By placing this code in your header template you can give a customised message to Digg Users .
You can see an example of this on Johns site here .
<? php
if ( preg_match ( ' # https://digg.com/\w{1,8}/*(\?.*)?$#',
$ _SERVER [ ' HTTP_REFERER ' ] ) ) {
echo " < p > Special message for Digg users here . </ p > " ;
exit ;
}
?>
Which code to use ?
The PHP solution above will post a message to all Digg users so in that regards , it is the best solution to use .
The Javascript solution I posted last week has some limitations , the main one being that some users turn Javascript off .
However , using the simple Javascript solution breaks frames from all websites whereas the PHP solution posted above only removes the Digg Bar .
Therefore , the decision is really up to you i.e. do you want to remove all frames or do you just want to tell Digg Users they can’t view your blog using a frame ?
I ’d also like to give the following a mention :
DiggBar Killer – A Firefox plugin which lets non Digg users ( and those not signed in ) kill the Digg Bar ( note : signed in members can turn it off in their profile ) .
No Frames WordPress Plugin – I personally think the Javascript solution is much easier to add but if you use WordPress , you may prefer to break frames by installing this plugin .
The Digg Bar is Bad For SEO
When I first read about the new Digg Bar I was annoyed because Digg would be denying PageRank Juice to thousands of bloggers .
I was then informed that PR juice was still passed on because Digg add a rel= ” canonical ” tag to all outgoing links .
The rel= ” canonical ” tag is supposed to pass all PR Juice to the designated page .
However , according to seOverflow , Digg is misleading users :
The problem with this is that the canonical tag only works on pages of the domain it ’s on .
Since Digg is not your website , this canonical tag is doing nothing .
I was n’t 100 % sure if this was true so I checked online and confirmed that it is the case ( the announcement of the tag was made in February when I was travelling ) .
Apparently , the tags main use is to help those with the same content on the one site .
For example , if you own a shopping site you may have one product listed in 3 or 4 different categories .
This tag allows you to tell Google that all the juice should be going to one page .
As previously mentioned , the canonical only works within the same domain so why are Digg using it ?
For more information on the canonical tag , please check out randfish ’s article entitled ‘ Canonical URL Tag – The Most Important Advancement in SEO Practices Since Sitemaps ‘ .
It 's conventional wisdom , written in stone and set in concrete , that Republicans are stronger on terrorism while Democrats do better on other issues , particularly domestic ones .
On Monday , we covered the latest ABC / WaPo poll , and included this graphic :
Greg Sargent at the Plum Line reviewed the same poll , and noted that terrorism number :
Obama Leads Republicans By Over 20 Points — On Terrorism !
Does anyone else find this number from the internals of the new Washington Post / ABC News poll just stunning ?
Who do you trust to do a better job handling the threat of terrorism — ( Obama ) or the ( Republicans in Congress ) ?
Obama 55 % Republicans in Congress 34 % A year ago , when the conventional wisdom held during the campaign that terrorism was a weak point for Obama , would you have predicted that he would come to hold a 21 - point lead over the GOP on the issue ?
To highlight that point , we reviewed older polling data at Polling Report on terrorism , and found some interesting comparisons of Dems and Republicans .
Three polls ( Fox , CNN / USA Today / Gallup and NBC / WSJ ) went back before 2006 .
In that 2006 year , Republicans had a generic 8 - 10 point lead on terrorism inmultiple polls .
But going back further , in 2002 Republicans had as much as a 36 point lead .
Who would do better on terrorism , R's or D's ?
( For exact wording , click on name of poll )
Republicans Democrats Difference ( D - R )
CNN / USA Today / Gallup 2002 57 22 - 35
NBC / WSJ ( RV ) 2002 49 13 - 36
Fox 2003 53 19 - 34
ABC / WaPo ( Obama v GOP ) 2009 34 55 +21
Seems obvious to me the reason Republicans lost their edge is Iraq .
The day Bush claimed that we invaded Iraq because they had WMDs , and tried to link Al Queda and Saddam , was the day the Republican advantage on terrorism began to disappear .
Regardless of whether you agree about why , that 's quite a shift in the numbers ... more than 50 points in seven years .
Make a note of it .
You may need it one day to correct some conventional wisdom .
Added : yes , the question of a sitting president v another party is different than generic R v D , and previous data exists on the economy for the last three presidents v congress , but not for terrorism ( at least in the ABC / WaPo poll ) .
The point remains , however , that assuming the GOP always has an edge on terrorism no matter what is out the window .
Security researchers have released a proof - of - concept rootkit for Windows 7 , in the hopes that its availability will assist in the prompt development of an antidote .
Indian security researchers Vipin Kumar and Nitin Kumar demonstrated the toolkit , dubbed Vbootkit 2.0 , at the Hack In The Box security conference in Dubai last month .
Initially the security boffins wanted to keep the code under wraps , in case malicious hackers latched onto the approach .
They 've since had second thoughts , prompting them to release the code for Vbootkit 2.0 under an open source licence , in the belief that its availability will assist the work of other security researchers .
As things stand , Vbootkit 2.0 does n't lend itself to remote attack .
It might also be thwarted by features such as BitLocker hard drive encryption and the Trusted Platform Module , in cases where this feature is available and enabled .
BitLocker is only due to be available in Enterprise and Ultimate versions of Windows 7 .
The Kumars are concerned that the attack approach against Windows 7 they have unearthed might be modified by skilled miscreants to develop remote attacks , hence the decision to give white hat security researchers a leg up in developing defences .
They also want to make the case to Microsoft that it ought to make improved security features available across all versions of Windows 7 , not just the higher - end versions .
" We would really like Microsoft to release one single edition with all features available to all user [s ] instead of crippled editions , " Kumar told eWeek .
" Right now BitLocker and TPM are only available in the high - end versions . " ®
As a military officer for 30 years , I came to recognize the necessity of good leadership .
When I retired from the military in 1998 , I became active politically in the Republican Party .
Since that time , I ’ve been elected to two National Republican Conventions , acted as a military spokesperson for the Bush / Cheney campaign in 2004 , and served as national veterans coordinator for Fred Thompson ’s presidential run .
In 2007 , I ran for Minnesota GOP party chair as a reform candidate , and lost .
Over the years I have raised tens of thousands of dollars for GOP coffers , donated many thousands of dollars to local and national GOP candidates , worked many hours at the grass - roots level and been asked repeatedly to run for state or federal office by Minnesota GOP officeholders .
So why on Earth have I decided to leave the Minnesota GOP ?
Simple :
When a political party becomes so dysfunctional that it no longer can operate without tyrannical domination over the grass - roots , it is time to stop enabling bad behavior from that party .
I have come to the conclusion that a majority of Minnesotans and many Republicans no longer trust the message of the Minnesota GOP .
After years of ineffective party leadership resulting in a record number of defeats , lack of transparency in party dealings , alleged financial impropriety by former party employees , and numerous Federal Election Commission problems , can you really blame the electorate for abandoning the Minnesota GOP ?
On June 13 , the party continued its death spiral by electing the same failed leadership that has lost the last two elections .
The “ old guard ” network of the GOP State Central Delegates continued to imitate lemmings gleefully following each other over the cliff to the political abyss below .
Possibly the last chance to reform and re-energize the Minnesota GOP before the 2010 governor ’s race has been lost .
For me , it was the last straw .
I refuse to enable poor performance any longer .
In my opinion , the new party leaders are rabid , power - hungry ideologues and the former attack dogs of the previous party chairman .
They will not provide a message of inclusiveness or willingness to discuss contrary opinions .
Honest , open and transparent party operations will not exist .
The party is increasingly controlled by a small group of major financial donors and lobbyists who demand that their hand - picked people maintain the leadership positions .
Most elected GOP politicians do n’t dare support reform out of fear of retribution .
When lobbyist and corporate money has this type of stranglehold on a political party , fresh ideas and quality leadership fail to rise to the top .
The Minnesota GOP is no longer capable of competing .
If you need further evidence , you only need to look at these two examples : the decision of Gov. Tim Pawlenty not to seek a third term and the decision of businessman Brian Sullivan , long thought to be the party ’s hand - picked successor to Pawlenty , of declining to run .
I ’m convinced both men , after watching the abandonment of Sen.
Norm Coleman by principled conservatives and the debacle at last year ’s state GOP convention , where Ron Paul supporters were attacked and shouted down , have read the party tea leaves and decided the Minnesota GOP is so divided it is in no condition to contend in 2010 .
After June 13 , I came to the conclusion that the Minnesota GOP is no longer capable of being saved .
My detractors will attack me , anonymously , or claim that I have hard feelings or that I ’m just taking my ball and going home .
Wrong —
I ’m only doing what thousands of Minnesota Republican voters have done over the last two elections ; it just took me longer to pull the plug .
Somewhere is a political party that is inclusive and wanting of seasoned political grass - roots talent .
Somewhere there is a political party that will stand on principle , not radical partisanship .
Somewhere there is a political party that is n’t bought and paid for by large financial donors or special interests .
There must be a party in need of fiscally conservative , principled individuals who will work for the people of Minnesota and not for the blind political ambition of a few .
I encourage like - minded Republican voters to join me .
I ’m sure we ’ll find that new home .

Warren police said the 911 caller said a huge animal resembling a 150 - pound cat was spotted in an old cement drainpipe in Bates Park and 10 officers were sent to the scene , WDIV - TV , Detroit , reported Monday .
The officers saw the outline of the animal in the pipe and shot it with the Taser — only to discover it was a large toy cougar .
Police Commissioner William Dwyer said investigators believe the incident , which cost the department $ 1,000 in wasted police hours from responding to the scene and filling out paperwork , was a prank .
Dwyer said the prankster could face 90 days probation and fines equivalent to the wasted police money if caught .

Grassley Skeptical of Industry ’s Health Care Plans
Created : June 01 , 2009 17:01 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Earlier today , the giants of the health care industry delivered to the White House their plans to trim the nation ’s skyrocketing medical costs — strategies they say will save a cool $ 2 trillion over the next decade .
A few minutes ago , Sen. Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) issued a two - sentence statement reacting to that plan , which can be translated like this : I ’ll believe it when I see it .
I ’m skeptical that these proposals will add up to anywhere near $ 2 trillion .
In the legislative process , proposals rise or fall based on what [ the Congressional Budget Office ] says about them , and the same will be true here .
Two things to keep in mind here : ( 1 ) Grassley , as the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee , will be on the front lines of the looming health reform debate , so his skepticism could easily translate into policy .
And ( 2 ) claims of “ savings ” in Washington often do n’t mean savings at all , but instead indicate a reduction in projected growth .
The balance these industries are trying to locate is how to pull in as much money as they can without bankrupting the entire system .
US military brainiacs have notified the boffinry community that they need a new miracle material called " Power Skin " , which would " harvest " energy from its surroundings and also be strong enough to make robots out of .
The Power Skin notion comes of course from DARPA , the Pentagon techwar shop where they 're not at home to Mister Practical ; but where rooms are always kept prepared for Mister Unfeasible and his old chum Mister Cockup .
The new miracle - stuff is to be a " lightweight structural material that provides its own day and night power ... essentially a thin monolithic sheet ... to be used as an independent power source and , simultaneously , serve as the structural material to build lightweight platforms such as UAVs and other robots " .
According to the Pentagon warboffins :
The objectives of the “ Power Skin ” concept are three - fold : 1 ) Day / Night energy harvesting from the environment 2 ) Energy storage and recharge capabilities 3 ) Integration of the harvesting and storing components into thin sheets and / or on a thin lightweight backing material for structural integrity
As a notional scenario , the “ Power Skin ” development can be framed as power material to be used in small UAVs to demonstrate continuous flight for four days .
The ultimate goal is to develop a technology that will enable indefinite flight endurance .
DARPA seems to be inspired here by plans and prototypes for solar - powered UAVs , able to store enough juice during sunlight to keep flying through the hours of darkness .
These have already demonstrated quite long flights , though so far mainly near the Equator and at midsummer .
The agency is already seeking to build much more capable , larger versions able to stay airborne for years at a stretch , even in polar regions .
Building such aircraft would be hugely easier if their airframe structure generated and stored electric power itself , rather than needing separate solar cells and batteries .
The new material would actually be functioning in the role of " Power Bone " or " Power Skeleton " as much as " Power Skin " .
There would be plenty of other applications for working solar - cell / battery / structural combo material , of course .
Spacecraft designers would surely find it useful : so would gadgetry or car makers - or even architects , perhaps , if it was cheap enough .
There does seem to be a slight air of " why do n't they just invent a simple cheap pill which turns a tank of water into petrol " about this , though .
It would obviously be great if the requested " Power Skin " miracle - stuff existed , and the fuselage of an aircraft or the bodywork of a car could be solar cells and batteries too .
But that does n't mean it'll happen . ®
The big question is : what conditions ?
For Mr Geithner knows the truth of the old adage : when you owe the bank a small amount , the bank has the power .
But when you owe the bank a huge amount , it 's the other way round .
Luo Ping , a director - general at the China Banking Regulatory Commission , put it nicely in an interview back in February : " Except for US Treasuries , what can you hold ?
US Treasuries are the safe haven .
For everyone , including China , it is the only option .
We hate you guys .
Once you start issuing $ 1 trillion to $ 2 trillion [ of bonds ] we know the dollar is going to depreciate , so we hate you guys , but there is nothing much we can do . "
One of the policemen who participated in the assaults on the London G20 protesters had earlier posted to his facebook that he could n't " wait to bash some long haired hippys . "
The police officer 's profile page on social networking site Facebook contained a message apparently written by Pc Ward at 2017 BST on 1 April .
It stated : " Rob Ward ca n't wait to bash some long haired hippys up @ the G20 . "
Twenty minutes later another Facebook user posted a reply that said : " Dats bad but good in da same way lol [ laugh out loud ] . "
Ron Paul ’s Economic Theories Winning GOP Converts

Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) and Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) ( bachmann.house.gov , Flickr )
From time to time , a few members of Congress — as many as 10 , sometimes fewer — gather with Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) to eat lunch and hear from an author or expert whose opinion he thinks is worth promoting .
They grab something to eat off of a deli plate .
They take notes .
They loosen up and ask questions .
“ It ’s not all that easy for the other members to get here , ” Paul said in an interview with TWI , sitting just outside of his office before heading back to Texas for a few days .
“ It ’s just that there ’s so much competition .
Once they get here and they get going , they all seem to enjoy it . ”

A funny thing has started happening to Paul since his long - shot presidential campaign ended quietly in the summer of 2008 .
More Republicans have started listening to him .
There are the media requests from Fox Business Channel and talk radio , where he ’s given airtime to inveigh on sound money and macroeconomics .
There is HR 1207 , the Federal Reserve Transparency
Act of 2009 , a bill that would launch an audit of the Federal Reserve System , and which has attracted 112 co-sponsors .
When Paul introduced the Federal Reserve Board Abolition
Act just two years ago , no other members of Congress signed on .
And then there are the luncheons .
The off - the - record talks have brought in speakers such as ex-CIA counterterrorism expert Michael Scheuer , libertarian investigative reporter James Bovard , iconoclastic terrorism scholar Robert Pape , and George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley .
Perhaps the most influential guest has been Thomas Woods , a conservative scholar whose previous books include “ The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History ” and “ Who Killed the Constitution ? : The Fate of American Liberty from World War I to George W. Bush , ” and whose current book “ Meltdown ” has inspired Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn. ) to question Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner about economic fundamentals .
Paul ’s unexpected and sudden clout with his fellow Republicans — even some of Paul ’s staff have been surprised with the momentum of his “ Audit the Fed ” bill — come as the GOP engages in a tortured internal dialogue about its future .
Since January , no small number of new coalitions have formed between current members of Congress , former advisors to President George W. Bush , and perennial party leaders such as former Gov. Mitt Romney ( R - Mass . ) and former Gov. Jeb Bush ( R - Fla . ) .
Few of those conservatives , however , have spent much time criticizing the very foundations of America ’s modern economic system and worrying about a 1929 - style crash .
Few of them had a drawer stuffed with off - brand economic ideas and forgotten libertarian texts , ready to explain what needed to be done .
Ron Paul did , and as a result the ideas that made the Republican establishment irate enough to bounce him from a few primary debates are more popular than ever .
“ There ’s a growing recognition that the GOP is intellectually bankrupt and morally bankrupt , ” explained Bovard .
“ Most of these Republican ‘ rebranding ’ efforts amount to a group of overpaid consultants getting detached from reality , but I ’m glad that Paul is putting together these meetings .
I hope the battle of ideas is changing . ”
The success of Paul ’s events , however under - the - radar , have been a pleasant surprise for the experts .
“ I ’ll admit it , ” said Thomas Woods .
“ I was dead wrong in my first reaction when I heard Ron talking about the Fed on the campaign trail .
I said , ‘ This is too complicated for most Americans .
This is n’t going to galvanize people . ’
I was wrong !
He ’s taken an issue that was n’t even an issue , and he ’s got a lot of Americans suddenly fascinated by the Fed , by monetary policy , by the Austrian business cycle theory , ” economic ideas promoted by thinkers like Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard that blame central banks for painful business cycles .
Since his congressional comeback in 1996 — after a long stint as a Libertarian Party politician , and after only narrowly defeating a Democrat - turned - Republican that Newt Gingrich ’s Republican leadership supported —
Paul has maintained a small circle of allies in Congress .
Some of them , like Rep. Walter Jones ( R - N.C. ) , are regular guests at the expert luncheons .
But the most prominent new face is Bachmann , the rising conservative star who left C - SPAN and YouTube watchers scratching their heads with a constitutional grilling that seemed to puzzle Geithner .
“ What provision in the Constitution could you point to to give authority for the actions that have been taken by the Treasury since March of ‘ 08 ? ” asked Bachmann during a hearing on March 24 .
“ What in the Constitution could you point to to give authority to the Treasury ’s extraordinary actions that have been taken ? ”
Bachmann “ goes to these luncheons on a weekly basis , ” said Debbee Keller , Bachmann ’s press secretary .
Keller noted that Bachmann was reading “ Meltdown , ” which argues that the New Deal failed and that the Federal Reserve is responsible for the current economic crisis .
“ Just as Austrian theory suggests , ” wrote Woods , “ the Fed ’s mischief was responsible for the Great Depression . ”
“ I had a feeling she ’d have some interest in the book , ” said Woods , “ because she asked some good questions .
She was taking notes .
She was asking if this or that point could be found in the book .
I thought I recognized a sincere person who wanted knowledge , not the usual politician who could n’t care less about what the truth is and just wanted to propagandize . ”
Paul did n’t take credit for turning Bachmann on to Austrian theory ( “ He ’ll give credit to everyone on the planet except himself , ” laughed Woods ) but said he was pleased to see more members of Congress delving into economics .
“ She ’s very open to studying , ” said Paul .
“ In fact , she ’s been working really hard to get me back to Minneapolis .
She says , ‘ You ’ll get such a great reception there ! ’ ”
Paul ’s other influence has reached further across the aisle .
Since he introduced the Federal Reserve Transparency
Act of 2009 , he has locked in the support of a majority of the Republican conference as well as 13 Democrats , for a bill that would mandate an “ audit of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal reserve banks ” before the end of 2010 to reveal how the board makes it decisions and moves around money .
“ As Congressman Paul pointed [ out ] many times , ” said freshman Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) after co-sponsoring the bill , “ the Federal Reserve should have come clean with the American people a long time ago .
The Fed is disbursing trillions of dollars and the taxpayers have a right to know who is getting it . ”
It ’s been a rapid rise for an idea that , only months ago , was located firmly in the political fringe .
The John Birch Society , the far - right group that Paul has often defended from media criticism , was one of the first groups to encourage members to contact their members of Congress to support an audit of the Fed .
Paul ’s own coalition , the Campaign for Liberty , has engaged in a months - long grassroots campaign for the bill , something that Paul credited for a surge in support unlike anything he ’s introduced in his second stint in Congress .
“ People today are clamoring for transparency , ” said Paul , “ and there is more awareness of the Federal Reserve .
I do think it has something to do with the focus we put on this during the campaign .
It ’s not so much that I ’m personally converting people , it ’s that we ’ve got people at the grassroots converting their members of Congress . ”
Rep. Zach Wamp ( R - Tenn . ) , a conservative who is running for governor of Tennessee next year , has told Paul that his support for the Fed audit and his condemnation of a Missouri law enforcement policy to watch out for cars with Ron Paul bumper stickers get some of his loudest , most positive reactions on the campaign trail .
Paul has remained surprised and bemused at his new influence .
“ I was talking with one of the other Republicans on the floor , ” he remembered , “ one of the types that had been voting with Bush , for big spending and all of that .
I asked him : ‘ Are you voting with me now or am I voting with you ? ’
They just laugh .
They know what the situation is . ”
Geographers from Kansas State University map the spatial distribution of the seven deadly sins in the United States .
These types of maps are always kind of iffy as they draw from data from various sources gathered with different methods and usually use some kind of researcher - defined metric .
Still interesting though … right ?

Writers are getting mad as hell about digital versions of their books getting pirated online .
Ursula K. Le Guin and Harlan Ellison will sue you .
But we like horror mogul Stephen King 's approach : insults !
Asked about digital piracy , King emailed Motoko Rich of the New York Times :
The question is , how much time and energy do I want to spend chasing these guys .
And to what end ?
My sense is that most of them live in basements floored with carpeting remnants , living on Funions and discount beer .
Or reading novels by Cory Doctorow , the Boing Boing blogger with a little - known sideline in fiction .

The article The 3rd Army into the Ukraine and the retreat to Romania 1943 - 44 was added in the Military Operations section .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - General Growth Properties
Inc , the second largest U.S. mall owner , filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday in one of the biggest real estate failures in U.S. history .
Ending months of speculation , the Chicago - based mall owner , which listed total assets of $ 29.56 billion and total debts of $ 27.29 billion , sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors along with 158 of its more than 200 U.S. malls , while it seeks to restructure some of its debt .
Since November , General Growth has warned that it may have to seek protection from its creditors when it was unable to refinance maturing mortgages .
The company said in a statement that it planned to continue exploring strategic alternatives during the bankruptcy protection , from which it is seeking to emerge as quickly as possible through a reorganization that preserves its national business .
General Growth ’s filing in the U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan makes it one of the largest nonfinancial companies to succumb to the financial crisis in the U.S .
Before the bankruptcy protection filing , the company had defaulted on several mortgages as well as a series of bonds .
It has also put several of its flagship properties up for sale .
Analysts and other real estate experts have speculated that mall owners Simon Property Group Inc and Westfield Group would be interested in buying some of General Growth ’s assets from bankruptcy .
General Growth has been generating enough cash flow for the company to pay monthly interest costs and expenses , but it has been unable to refinance the principal of loans and mortgages as they come due because banks and other financing sources have been reluctant to issue large mortgages and loans .
“ Our core business remains sound and is performing well with stable cash flows , ” General Growth Chief Executive Adam Metz said in a statement .

“ While we have worked tirelessly in the past several months to address our maturing debts , the collapse of the credit markets has made it impossible for us to refinance maturing debt outside of Chapter 11 . ”
General Growth has received a commitment for a debtor - in - possession financing facility of about $ 375 million from Pershing Square Capital Management LP , as agent .
The hedge fund run by William Ackman also owns about 25 percent of General Growth shares .
Ackman , who has been urging General Growth to file for bankruptcy protection , described it as “ a great company ” with “ phenomenal assets ” at a conference on April 2 .
At the end of 2008 , about $ 15.17 billion of General Growth ’s debt was comprised of mortgage loans that had been securitized into commercial mortgage - backed securities , according to research firm Trepp .
“ This underscores that real estate companies are most vulnerable to refinancing risk rather than market risk , ” said Nomura ’s London - based property analyst Mike Prew .
“ The U.S. insolvency process is , we think , a cure for General Growth ’s liquidity problems , which stem from external factors , and not a traditional bankruptcy per se . ”
Shares of General Growth have deteriorated as the credit crisis worsened .
They closed at $ 1.05 in the United States on Wednesday , making the company ’s market capitalization $ 283.90 million , down from $ 11.l8 billion when it traded at a 12 - month high of $ 44 in May .
So far , fallout from the General Growth bankruptcy has not hit European mall owners .
Europe ’s biggest mall owner , Unibail Rodamco , was trading up 2 percent at 118.69 euros , while Anglo - French retail specialist Hammerson edged up 0.2 percent to trade at 307.75 pence .
HIGH QUALITY MALLS AND TENANTS
The Chicago - based company started when brothers Martin and Matthew Bucksbaum decided to expand the family grocery business and build a shopping center in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , in 1954 .
It grew by new development as well as by acquisitions , the largest being the 2004 purchase of Rouse Cos for $ 14.2 billion .
Rouse brought the company 37 of the highest - quality and most valuable malls in the country , including Fashion Show in Las Vegas and Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston .
General Growth ’s refinancing troubles in the frozen credit markets led to the firing of former Chief Financial Officer Bernard Freibaum in October .
John Bucksbaum , who succeeded his father Matthew in 1999 , stepped down as chief executive the same month , although he remained chairman .
In recent months , the new management team under Metz has been wrestling with loan after loan coming due , bargaining for extensions .
As of the end of 2008 , General Growth had $ 1.18 billion in past due debt and an additional $ 4.09 billion of debt that could be accelerated by its lenders .
Earlier this month , the company had been seeking to restructure $ 2.25 billion of Rouse bonds , offering bondholders a percentage on their bonds if they allowed the company to skip interest payments and principal until the end of the year .
But the company failed to garner the necessary support it needed .
General Growth said several of its other subsidiaries in addition to the malls were also placed into bankruptcy protection , while several properties that are part of joint ventures were unaffected .
The company has hired law firms Weil Gotshal & Manges and Kirkland & Ellis to represent it , according to court papers .
The case is In re : General Growth Properties Inc , U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York , No. 09-11977 .
Senate Bill 1381 , which passed the Illinois Senate on Wednesday by a vote of 30 - 28 , also passed the House Health and Human Services Committee on Thursday and is expected to move to a floor vote .
If medical marijuana becomes legal , suffering patients who seek to use it for medical purposes wo n't have to break the law in order to get it , said state Sen.
William Haine , D - Alton , who sponsored the Senate bill .
" It 's an idea whose time has come .
I will never sponsor a bill that I do n't personally believe in .
This bill is reasonable , " said Haine , who comes from a conservative family and a background in law .
" This bill will enhance the common good . "
Haine said his constituents are generally aware of what 's going on in Springfield and are quick to voice their opinions if they feel strongly either way .
" I 've gotten a few letters against it , but more for it , " Haine said .
" I 've received not a lot of mail on the subject , which means the majority of people really do n't care . "
As a former Madison County state 's attorney , Haine is tuned into the concerns posed by law enforcement and knew the obstacles he could face in sponsoring the bill .
" I love a challenge , " he said .
Although the Illinois House passed a similar medical marijuana measure earlier in the year , the Senate version included a number of amendments to tighten restrictions , Haine 's response to those concerns .
While Haine said local law enforcement entities appreciate the measures he 's taken , as of Thursday , most remained officially opposed .
Jersey County State 's Attorney Ben Goetten declined to comment specifically on the legislation or its possible ramifications , but he issued the following statement :
" As a prosecutor , it is my duty to follow the law and hold those accountable for breaking it .
I would like to say I not only respect Sen .
Haine , but I trust in his judgment .
Proponents of this bill could not have chosen a more capable sponsor .
Sen .
Haine 's legislative experience , coupled with his law enforcement background and common sense , exponentially increase the likelihood that this bill will be successful . "
Not everyone sounds so positive .
Illinois State Police have opposed the bill in part because they lack a way to measure impairment .
Haine added an amendment removing the right of medical marijuana users to drive while under the influence and increased the oversight of dispensers and the penalties on those who sell marijuana illegally .
Madison County Sheriff Robert Hertz could n't speak on behalf of all law enforcement officials but said he opposes the legislation personally .
" Specifically myself , I 'm dead against it , " he said .
" What 's next ?
Cocaine ? Meth ? "
Hertz worries that marijuana would be hard to control once an authorized person gets possession of it .
Like other prescription drugs , there is a chance that someone outside of the patient who holds the prescription could come into possession of it .
" Hopefully , ( the bill ) will have enough oversight to it , making certain those who are supposed to be entitled to it are the only ones getting it , " he said .
Haine said he thinks the restrictions will help prevent abuse .
He also said that drug dealers will suffer because patients in need of the drug no longer will be forced to turn to their illegal sources .
Hertz said he also worries about the message legalization would send to children .
" I could see some kids thinking , ' Well , if it 's OK for people who are in pain and suffering , it could be good for me , ' " Hertz said .
" Marijuana use leads to use of other illegal drugs .
I just think it sends the wrong signal to youth . "
Hertz said he and a handful of other law enforcement officials approached Haine months ago and indicated their displeasure with the bill .
" I do n't think that you 'll find many law enforcement professionals ( who support this ) , " he said .
" I would think that they would have better things to do in Springfield in light of what 's going on instead of spending any time on this subject .
My guess is the majority of people would not be supportive . "
Despite his stance on this issue , Hertz describes himself as a humanitarian and said nobody should have to live in pain .
" With the way medical technology is today , they can develop a drug that can have the same effect , assuming what they say about medical marijuana is accurate , " he said .
In fact , that drug already exists in the form of a tablet called Marinol , synthetic THC .
Doctors throughout the area and state have varying opinions on whether Marinol is enough or whether the legalization of medical marijuana would present another viable treatment option .

This is the first in a two - part series regarding pending legislation on the legalization of medical marijuana in Illinois .

WINNIPEG–A second Manitoba social worker told a child custody hearing Tuesday that a girl removed from her parents ' care after she showed up at school with racist symbols drawn on her body was raised to believe that non-white people should be killed .
But the mother accused child welfare officials of feeding controversial responses to her daughter in order to remove her from the family home .
" I think my daughter was either force - fed to say these things ... or she was coaxed , maybe into saying them , if she did in fact say them , " the woman , who now lives in another province , said in a phone interview with The Canadian Press .
" I 'm looking at these things that are being said , and I think , ' no , my daughter would never say that . " '
Manitoba Child and Family Services removed the girl and her younger brother from the family home last year after the girl showed up at her elementary school with white supremacist symbols and slogans drawn on her skin in permanent marker .
No one involved in the case can be identified under Manitoba law .
Two social workers have testified this week the girl told them in separate interviews that her mother made the drawings .
They have also testified that the girl talked about being raised in a hate - filled home where violent racist videos were displayed , where the parents discussed killing minorities , and where drugs were used frequently .
The social workers have also said the girl casually and frequently used racial epithets , and talked calmly about a method for killing black people .
The mother , however , paints a very different picture .
She taught her children to be proud of their heritage but not to hate others , she said .
" That 's not something we ever discussed in the home .
That 's not something we ever preached to our children , " the woman said .
The violent videos were only historical TV programs about the Second World War , she said .
The drug use is also untrue , according to the mother .
" We have a very hard stance against drug use .
It 's not a white thing to do . "
The mother also denies drawing multiple racial symbols on her daughter .
She drew only one small symbol to demonstrate racial pride , she said , and has no idea who drew white supremacist slogans and other material that were found on her daughter 's body and captured on photographs entered as evidence in the court case .
" We have been asking to see these photos .
I 'm wondering where they actually came from . "
It 's not just social workers who are behind the accusations .
According to the worker who testified Tuesday , relatives of the couple have said the two were skinheads who met on a racist website .
The couple at one point travelled to Brandon , Man. , where one relative believed they were trying to set up a white supremacist group , the social worker said .
It 's not yet clear whether those relatives will testify in the case .
The mother does not have a lawyer and plans on attending court next month when the case resumes .
The father has not yet spoken about the case either in interviews or in court .
He has filed an affidavit showing he plans to argue he has a constitutional right to raise his children according to his beliefs .

The racism concern is not the sole reason cited by child welfare officials for seizing the children .
The parents are also accused of neglecting the kids ' emotional and education needs , and being physically violent with each other .
The father , in his affidavit , denies any wrongdoing and says the two were " excellent " parents .
Traders and brothers , Rodney and Derek " Del Boy " Trotter , work from the streets of London buying what they can from the auctions and flogging it down at the market , always saying " This time next year , we 'll be millionaires " .
Their Granddad and , later in the series , Uncle Albert also live in their council flat as the wise old man saying their next scheme wo n't work and offering in their jokes .
Gladwell - Simmons II : Part 2
OK , let 's get going with Part 2
Did Jennifer Aniston hit on Malcolm Gladwell ?
The facts remain unclear .
GLADWELL
Let 's set the record straight on Jennifer Aniston .
She was not hitting on me .
I think she was bored because her friends had n't arrived yet .
She just wanted to make conversation .
And what was my excuse ?
I do n't really have one .
I was trying to work , and I was n't wearing my glasses , and who on earth thinks Jennifer Aniston is going to sit down next to them in some random cafe in Miami and start chatting away ?
So I gave her that do n't - bother - me glare , and then about five minutes passed and I thought to myself , " You know , she was really cute . "
And another five minutes passed and I thought , " You know , she looks really familiar . "
And another five minutes passed and I thought , " You idiot . "
And by then it was too late , of course .
The window of opportunity for a woman like that is 45 seconds , max .
By the time I got the check , I think she 'd already started dating John Mayer .
Sigh .
I had a similar random encounter with Baron Davis once in the lobby of a hotel in Chicago , only I recognized him .
I think you can safely say you 've watched too much " SportsCenter " when you whiff on Jennifer Aniston and spot Baron Davis from across a crowded room .
You 're right .
I am a bit obsessed with the full - court press at the moment .
I just did a story for The New Yorker about how underdogs beat favorites , which had a lot about basketball in it .
For the story , I went down to Louisville and had a long chat with Rick Pitino .
He argued that the press is the best chance an underdog has of being competitive with stronger teams , and I think his record proves the case .
That Providence team he took to the Final Four in 1984 has to have been just about the least talented team EVER to reach that level .
( One of the forwards on that team was Dave Kipfer , who grew up just down the road from me , in the southwestern Ontario Mennonite country .
He was considered slow for our high school league . )
Then , of course , Pitino takes one of his first Louisville teams to the Final Four in 2005 and this season 's team to the Elite Eight , and no one 's going to argue that either of those teams were filled with future Hall of Famers .
Given that , then , why do so few underdog teams use the press ?
Pitino 's explanation is that it 's because most coaches simply can't convince their players to work that hard .
What do you think of that argument ?
There are two other things here that fascinate me .
After my piece ran in The New Yorker , one of the most common responses I got was people saying , well , the reason more people do n't use the press is that it can be beaten with a well - coached team and a good point guard .
That is ( A ) absolutely true and ( B ) beside the point .
The press does n't guarantee victory .
It simply represents the underdog 's best chance of victory .
It raises their odds from zero to maybe 50 - 50 .
I think , in fact , that you can argue that a pressing team is always going to have real difficulty against a truly elite team .
But so what ?
Everyone , regardless of how they play , is going to have real difficulty against truly elite teams .
It 's not a strategy for being the best .
It 's a strategy for being better .
I never thought Louisville -- or , for that matter , Missouri -- had a realistic shot at winning it all in the NCAAs this year .
But if neither of those teams pressed , they would n't have been there in the first place .
I wonder if there is n't something particularly American in the preference for " best " over " better " strategies .
I might be pushing things here .
But both the U.S. health - care system and the U.S. educational system are exclusively " best " strategies :
They excel at furthering the opportunities of those at the very top end .
But they are n't nearly as interested in moving people from the middle of the pack to somewhere nearer the front .
The other , related question is whether you can ever truly run the press with elite players .
Pitino did it once , with that stacked 1996 Kentucky team .
But I think even he realizes that was a once - in - a - lifetime achievement .
Think about it :
He got Antoine Walker to play defense for 94 feet .
And John Wooden used the press a lot with some of his great teams at UCLA .
But he was John Wooden , and that was another era .
Realistically , could you convince a couple of McDonald 's All - Americans , who have been coddled and indulged their whole lives , to play that way today ?
When we were talking , Pitino called over Samardo Samuels , who is , of course , Jamaican -- his point being that this was his ideal kind of player , someone who substituted for a lack of experience with a lot of hunger .
There is something weird , is n't there -- and also strangely beautiful -- about a coach who deliberately seeks out players who are n't the most talented ?
I know you have very , um , complicated feelings about Pitino .
I love the man .
The biggest question , though , is whether there is any way to apply the press at the pro level .
Thoughts ?
SIMMONS
You 're preaching to the floor - burn choir .
I watched the press succeed ( to a decent degree ) during Pitino 's first season in Boston , and attended most of those home games .
Of course , Coach P undermined his own cause by panic - trading rookie Chauncey Billups after 50 games to acquire Kenny Anderson , an all - offense guard who was making $ 10 million a season and had no interest in sprinting for 40 - plus minutes , especially when he had n't yet sweated out all the Courvoisier from the night before .
Still , three things happened during that 50 - game stretch to make me believe presses could work at the professional level .
1. That 1997 - 98 Celtics team overachieved .
Pitino made so many preseason moves that they started with just three incumbents ( Antoine Walker , Dee Brown and Dana Barros ) and played 19 different guys in all , but they still finished 36 - 46 with a group of rookies and castoffs , as well as Antoine shooting 42 percent , making 292 turnovers and offending approximately 572 officials as their crunch - time guy .
Before the Billups trade , they had one really nice pressing unit : two athletic rookies ( Billups and Ron Mercer ) , young Bruce Bowen , Walter McCarty ( the best cog in the history of Pitino 's press , as the coach told you ) and either Travis Knight or Andrew DeClercq ( two agile , coachable and extremely pale big men ) .
This group wreaked havoc a few times .
I remember attending one November home game during which they dismantled the Nuggets with it .
Just for kicks , I looked it up on basketball - reference.com .
The Celtics won 96 - 86 .
They forced 29 turnovers .
They had a whopping 16 steals .
Denver 's point guard ( a young Bobby Jackson ) committed eight turnovers .
Seven Celtics finished with two - plus steals .
If Pitino had just kept that nucleus -- Walker , Billups , Mercer , Barros , Brown , McCarty , Bowen , Knight and DeClercq -- been patient and allowed his young guys to take their lumps , we would have had something ( and remember , Pierce was coming in the ' 98 draft ) .
So frustrating .
Pitino took the concept of " own worst enemy " to new heights .
Walter McCarty was an ideal cog in the full - court press .
2. Once Walker got his big contract ( a max extension before the ' 98 - 99 season ) , suddenly he wanted to jog around and jack up bad 3 - pointers , and since he was guaranteed $ 71 million , who was going to talk him out of it ?
This proved that a press can only work professionally if you are using guys who carry 10s and 20s in their wallets instead of 100s .
Which leads me to the following tweak , something that Pitino even mentioned when you spent time with him .
With a 12 - man roster , you 'd only need to train five or six guys to pull off that press .
Let 's say next season 's Bulls trained the following five : Joakim Noah , Ty Thomas , Kirk Hinrich , Lindsey Hunter and Generic Athletic / Hungry Swingman X .
They practice and practice until they become a well - oiled pressing machine .
For the first five minutes of every second and fourth quarter , they unleash that killer press on their opponents who , by the way , would be playing backups during that time , making it even more effective .
Would n't that be an ENORMOUS advantage ?
Would n't that swing a few games ?
Would n't opponents dread playing them ?
Would n't opponents have to waste practice time preparing to break that press ?
Would n't it be even better at home with the Bulls flying around and their fans going bonkers ?
The key would be not putting " press miles " on your top guys and your wealthiest guys ( who would never be totally invested because , again , they 're really , really wealthy and do n't need this crap ) .
In this scenario , the Bulls would n't press with Rose , Deng , Brad Miller , Ben Gordon or even John Salmons if they could help it .
Which brings me to my third point .
3 . You can easily find 10th , 11th and 12th men to make that press work .
You know how many athletic swingmen are out there ?
Oodles .
There 's always another Dahntay Jones or Josh Powell killing himself in the D - League hoping for a chance .
It 's just a logical way to use your roster .
You could build the press around one scorer ( one of your top - five guys ) and the ninth , 10th , 11th and 12th guys on your team .
Like the 2008 - 09 Clippers .
Could n't they have pressed for 10 minutes a game with Al Thornton , Mike Taylor , DeAndre Jordan , Fred Jones and Mardy Collins ?
Why the hell not ?
Oh , wait , I forgot they have a dunce as a coach .
The bigger point : NBA teams rarely , if ever , think outside the box , and that 's one of at least 50 reasons why I could succeed as a GM .
Over the course of an 82 - game season , a killer press might swing five or six games .
If I ran an NBA team , I would study tapes of those first 50 games the ' 97-98 Celtics played with Billups .
Carefully .
They were 21 - 24 through 45 games with the youngest team in the league during an extremely competitive season .
Hmmmmmm .
GLADWELL
Let me get this straight .
Pitino uses the press at Boston for 50 games and achieves a surprising result .
And an entire league full of very thoughtful and knowledgeable coaches watch him do that , and in the past decade not a single one has even tried to follow Pitino 's example ?
SIMMONS
Yup .
Although the late '90s were the peak of the NBA 's Too Young Too Much Too Soon Era : too many young guys getting paid too much too soon , and handling it about as well as your average group of successful child actors getting their first fake IDs .
This stretch was dominated by posses , tattoos , crotch - grabs , sneers , coach - choking and everything else ; just a bunch of immature guys who carried themselves like superstars even though they had n't done squat .
Really , 1993 - 99 was one of the two " Wasted Eras of Young Talent , " along with 1978 - 86 ( the coke era ) .
So the thinking was probably " I can't even get these guys to run a high screen without them glaring at me or MF - ing me I 'm gonna get them to press ? "
Players are much more humble and responsible and self - aware these days , so it might have a better chance .
GLADWELL
Still , is there any other industry in the world ( well , outside of Detroit ) so terrified of innovation ?
I went to see a Lakers - Warriors game earlier this season , and it was abundantly clear after five minutes that the Warriors ' chances of winning were , oh , no better than 10 percent .
Why would n't you have a special squad of trained pressers come in for five minutes a half and press Kobe and Fisher ?
Worst - case scenario is that you exhaust Kobe , and make him a bit more vulnerable down the stretch .
Best case is that you rattle the Lakers and force a half - dozen extra turnovers that turn out to be crucial .
And if you lose , so what ?
You were going to lose anyway .
When you become GM of the Timberwolves , I 'm guessing you 'll put the special - press - squad concept into effect immediately .
SIMMONS
Yes .
In a heartbeat .
It 's one of the few roster advantages you have :
By using that killer press , you are turning your 10th , 11th and 12th men into assets instead of guys who are measured by their ability to execute chest - bumps and feign excitement over someone else 's success .
So yeah .
The killer press is on the agenda .
GLADWELL
Would you pay Pitino $ 4 million to do a one - year consultancy at Minnesota , to set up and train the squad ?
And -- since I know you love lists -- who would be your all - time full - court press team ?
One rule : you can't pick people who would otherwise be considered all - time greats .
So no Jordan or Pippen .
SIMMONS
I 'll give you two different teams .
If you went with superstars or All - Stars , you 'd go with 1993 - 94 David Robinson , ' 88 - 89 Dennis Rodman , '91 - 92 Scottie Pippen , 2008 - 09 LeBron and 1991 - 92 Jordan .
Good luck bringing the ball up against those five guys .
You'd have a better chance of drinking 24 beers , then trying to pee from midcourt into one of the baskets .
We 've definitely got to have the Christies on our all - full - court press squad .
For non-superstars , I 'd go with this group : '97-98 Walter McCarty , 2002 - 03 Lindsey Hunter , '03 - 04 Andrei Kirilenko , '01 - 02 Ben Wallace , and ' 00 - 01 Doug Christie ( narrowly edging '02-03 Bruce Bowen only because we get Jackie Christie cheering the press from the stands as part of the deal ) .
When you think how frightening those five guys would have been -- and by the way , none were lottery picks except Hunter -- it makes you wonder :
Would it be that hard to find a poor man 's version of the five guys above , bring in Pitino for two weeks as an expensive consultant to train them and a specific assistant to handle it , then cultivate it throughout the season ?
More importantly , why would n't you try ?
Or at least investigate it ?
GLADWELL
I feel the same way about the attitude of professional football teams toward the no-huddle offense .
Right now , great teams ( such as the Colts and Patriots ) use the no-huddle selectively , as a way to maximize their dominance .
But why do n't bad teams use it ?
If you were the Lions , why not run the no-huddle this season ?
Why not put together a lighter , better - conditioned offensive line and a radically simplified playbook and see what happens ?
It 's not as if you are risking a Super Bowl if it backfires .
Your offensive line is lousy anyway , so there 's no harm in tearing it down , and your fans are n't going to turn on you if you get killed while you work out the kinks .
Last I checked , your fans have already turned on you .
On the plus side , maybe the no-huddle exhausts the other team 's defense so much you slow down their pass rush in the second half .
And maybe giving your quarterback a bit more autonomy helps develop his knowledge of the game , and his leadership skills .
The consistent failure of underdogs in professional sports to even try something new suggests , to me , that there is something fundamentally wrong with the incentive structure of the leagues .
I think , for example , that the idea of ranking draft picks in reverse order of finish -- as much as it sounds " fair " -- does untold damage to the game .
You simply cannot have a system that rewards anyone , ever , for losing .
Economists worry about this all the time , when they talk about " moral hazard . "
Moral hazard is the idea that if you insure someone against risk , you will make risky behavior more likely .
So if you always bail out the banks when they take absurd risks and do stupid things , they are going to keep on taking absurd risks and doing stupid things .
Bailouts create moral hazard .
Moral hazard is also why your health insurance has a co-pay .
If your insurer paid for everything , the theory goes , it would encourage you to go to the doctor when you really do n't need to .
No economist in his right mind would ever endorse the football and basketball drafts the way they are structured now .
They are a moral hazard in spades .
If you give me a lottery pick for being an atrocious GM , where 's my incentive not to be an atrocious GM ?
I think the only way around the problem is to put every team in the lottery .
Every team 's name gets put in a hat , and you get assigned your draft position by chance .
Does that , theoretically , make it harder for weaker teams to improve their chances against stronger teams ?
I do n't think so .
First of all , the principal engine of parity in the modern era is the salary cap , not the draft .
And in any case , if the reverse - order draft is such a great leveler , then why are the same teams at the bottom of both the NFL and NBA year after year ?
The current system perpetuates the myth that access to top picks is the primary determinant of competitiveness in pro sports , and that 's simply not true .
Success is a function of the quality of the organization .
Another more radical idea is that you do a full lottery only every second year , or three out of four years , and in the off year make draft position in order of finish .
Best teams pick first .
How fun would that be ?
Every meaningless end - of - season game now becomes instantly meaningful .
If you were the Minnesota Timberwolves , you would realize that unless you did something really drastic -- like hire some random sports writer as your GM , or bring in Pitino to design a special - press squad -- you would never climb out of the cellar again .
And in a year with a can't - miss No. 1 pick , having the best record in the regular season becomes hugely important .
What do you think ?

• ' I would like to go to Spain , ' says frustrated striker • ' I do n't see why I should lie because the fans support me '
Carlos Tevez has admitted that he is likely to leave Old Trafford for a Spanish club at the end of the season after seeing his gut - busting efforts fail to cement him a regular place in the Manchester United attack .
The 25 - year - old striker has made only 16 starts for United this season and scored just three goals .
He believes his poor return is down to his staccato run in the team having often been overlooked for Dimitar Berbatov , Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney .
" I 've spent a lot of time on the bench and I 'd like to play more .
But every time I 'm given a chance I do all I can to take full advantage , " he told Madrid radio station Cadena COPE .
" It 's true , I see myself more leaving United , than staying here .
I do n't see why I should lie to people or anything because the fans support me a lot as you can see .
So I do n't have any reason to lie to them .
I need continuity in the team to offer my best .
If this does n't happen I believe this will be my last year . "
Tevez received a standing ovation from the Manchester United supporters as he was substituted in the 66th minute against Arsenal .
The fans have been vocal in their appreciation of the Argentinian 's indefatigable approach to every match since he joined the club in a convoluted £ 10 m loan deal in 2007 .
Those supporters need no convincing as to Tevez 's commitment but he was quick to make clear that any desire he has to leave Old Trafford is born of a frustration at being left on the bench rather than any lack of desire .
" While I wear the United shirt I will leave my life on the pitch .
You can see that in every game I play .
I respect people a lot and I am grateful to them , " he said .
" My future ?
I would like to go to Spain , yes , but I do n't know yet .
I have no preference for a team .
We 'll see . "
His decision to air his frustration on a Madrid radio station may hint at the striker 's preferred destination , but with Liverpool rumoured to be interested in Tevez , who is still owned by a third party not Manchester United , the Spanish flavour at Anfield may prove a tempting alternative .

Mr. Watt did research using draft animals and found that , under optimal conditions , a dray horse could lift 33,000 pounds one foot off the ground in one minute .
Mr. Watt — the eponymous watt not yet existing — called this unit of energy “ 1 horse - power . ”
In 1970 a Pontiac GTO ( may the brand name rest in peace ) had horsepower to the number of 370 .

Lose the capitalization and the dictionary says , “ insouciant and debonair ; marked by a lofty disregard of others ’ interests , rights , or feelings ; high - handed and arrogant and supercilious . ”
How cool is that ?
Then there are cowboys — always cool — and the U.S. cavalry that coolly comes to their rescue plus the proverbially cool - handed “ Man on Horseback ” to whom we turn in troubled times .
Early witnesses to the automobile urged motorists to get a horse .
But that , in effect , was what the automobile would do — get a horse for everybody .
Once the Model T was introduced in 1908 we all became Sir Lancelot , gained a seat at the Round Table and were privileged to joust for the favors of fair maidens ( at drive - in movies ) .
The pride and prestige of a noble mount was vouchsafed to the common man .
And woman , too .
No one ever tried to persuade ladies to drive sidesaddle with both legs hanging out the car door .
For the purpose of ennobling us schlubs , the car is better than the horse in every way .
Even more advantageous than cost , convenience and not getting kicked and smelly is how much easier it is to drive than to ride .
I speak with feeling on this subject , having taken up riding when I was nearly 60 and having begun to drive when I was so small that my cousin Tommy had to lie on the transmission hump and operate the accelerator and the brake with his hands .

Car Culture / Corbis
After the grown - ups had gone to bed , Tommy and I shifted the Buick into neutral , pushed it down the driveway and out of earshot , started the engine and toured the neighborhood .
The sheer difficulty of horsemanship can be illustrated by what happened to Tommy and me next .
Nothing .
We maneuvered the car home , turned it off and rolled it back up the driveway .
( We were raised in the blessedly flat Midwest . )
During our foray the Buick ’s speedometer reached 30 .
But 30 miles per hour is a full gallop on a horse .
Delete what you ’ve seen of horse riding in movies .
Possibly a kid who ’d never been on a horse could ride at a gallop without killing himself .
Possibly one of the Jonas Brothers could land an F - 14 on a carrier deck .
Thus cars usurped the place of horses in our hearts .
Once we ’d caught a glimpse of a well - turned Goodyear , checked out the curves of the bodywork and gaped at that swell pair of headlights , well , the old gray mare was not what she used to be .
We embarked upon life in the fast lane with our new paramour .
It was a great love story of man and machine .
The road to the future was paved with bliss .
Then we got married and moved to the suburbs .
Being away from central cities meant Americans had to spend more of their time driving .
Over the years away got farther away .
Eventually this meant that Americans had to spend all of their time driving .
The play date was 40 miles from the Chuck E. Cheese .
The swim meet was 40 miles from the cello lesson .
The Montessori was 40 miles from the math coach .
Mom ’s job was 40 miles from Dad ’s job and the three - car garage was 40 miles from both .
The car ceased to be object of desire and equipment for adventure and turned into office , rec room , communications hub , breakfast nook and recycling bin — a motorized cup holder .
Americans , the richest people on Earth , were stuck in the confines of their crossover SUVs , squeezed into less space than tech - support call - center employees in a Mumbai cubicle farm .
Never mind the six - bedroom , eight - bath , pseudo - Tudor with cathedral - ceilinged great room and 1,000 - bottle controlled - climate wine cellar .
That was a day ’s walk away .

We became sick and tired of our cars and even angry at them .
Pointy - headed busybodies of the environmentalist , new urbanist , utopian communitarian ilk blamed the victim .
They claimed the car had forced us to live in widely scattered settlements in the great wasteland of big - box stores and the Olive Garden .
If we would all just get on our Schwinns or hop a trolley , they said , America could become an archipelago of cozy gulags on the Portland , Ore. , model with everyone nestled together in the most sustainably carbon - neutral , diverse and ecologically unimpactful way ,
But cars did n’t shape our existence ; cars let us escape with our lives .
We ’re way the heck out here in Valley Bottom Heights and Trout Antler Estates because we were at war with the cities .
We fought rotten public schools , idiot municipal bureaucracies , corrupt political machines , rampant criminality and the pointy - headed busybodies .
Cars gave us our dragoons and hussars , lent us speed and mobility , let us scout the terrain and probe the enemy ’s lines .
And thanks to our cars , when we lost the cities we were n’t forced to surrender , we were able to retreat .
But our poor cars paid the price .
They were flashing swords beaten into dull plowshares .
Cars became appliances .
Or worse .
Nobody ’s ticked off at the dryer or the dishwasher , much less the fridge .
We recognize these as labor - saving devices .
The car , on the other hand , seems to create labor .
We hold the car responsible for all the dreary errands to which it needs to be steered .
Hell , a golf cart ’s more fun .
You can ride around in a golf cart with a six - pack , safe from breathalyzers , chasing Canada geese on the fairways and taking swings at gophers with a mashie .

We ’ve lost our love for cars and forgotten our debt to them and meanwhile the pointy - headed busybodies have been exacting their revenge .
We escaped the poke of their noses once , when we lived downtown , but we wo n’t be able to peel out so fast the next time .
In the name of safety , emissions control and fuel economy , the simple mechanical elegance of the automobile has been rendered ponderous , cumbersome and incomprehensible .
One might as well pry the back off an iPod as pop the hood on a contemporary motor vehicle .
An aging shade - tree mechanic like myself stares aghast and sits back down in the shade .
Or would if the car were n’t squawking at me like a rehearsal for divorce .
You left the key in .
You left the door open .
You left the lights on .
You left your dirty socks in the middle of the bedroom floor .
I do n’t believe the pointy - heads give a damn about climate change or gas mileage , much less about whether I survive a head - on with one of their tax - sucking mass - transit projects .
All they want to is to make me hate my car .
How proud and handsome would Bucephalas look , or Traveler or Rachel Alexandra , with seat and shoulder belts , air bags , 5 - mph bumpers and a maze of pollution - control equipment under the tail ?
And there ’s the end of the American automobile industry .
When it comes to dull , practical , ugly things that bore and annoy me , Japanese things cost less and the cup holders are more conveniently located .
The American automobile is — that is , was — never a product of Japanese - style industrialism .
America ’s steel , coal , beer , beaver pelts and PCs may have come from our business plutocracy , but American cars have been manufactured mostly by romantic fools .
David Buick , Ransom E. Olds , Louis Chevrolet , Robert and Louis Hupp of the Hupmobile , the Dodge brothers , the Studebaker brothers , the Packard brothers , the Duesenberg brothers , Charles W. Nash , E. L. Cord , John North Willys , Preston Tucker and William H. Murphy , whose Cadillac cars were designed by the young Henry Ford , all went broke making cars .
The man who founded General Motors in 1908 , William Crapo ( really ) Durant , went broke twice .
Henry Ford , of course , did not go broke , nor was he a romantic , but judging by his opinions he certainly was a fool .
Preston Tucker , in one of the few Tucker cars produced , celebrates being acquitted of charges of fraud over the failure of his automobile business in 1950 .

America ’s romantic foolishness with cars is finished , however , or nearly so .
In the far boondocks a few good old boys have n’t got the memo and still tear up the back roads .
Doubtless the Obama administration ’s Department of Transportation is even now calculating a way to tap federal stimulus funds for mandatory OnStar installations to locate and subdue these reprobates .
Among certain youths — often first - generation Americans — there remains a vestigial fondness for Chevelle low - riders or Honda “ tuners . ”
The pointy - headed busybodies have yet to enfold these youngsters in the iron - clad conformity of cultural diversity ’s embrace .
Soon the kids will be expressing their creative energy in a more constructive way , planting bok choy in community gardens and decorating homeless shelters with murals of Che .
I myself have something old - school under a tarp in the basement garage .
I bet when my will has been probated , some child of mine will yank the dust cover and use the proceeds of the eBay sale to buy a mountain bike .
Four things greater than all things are , and I ’m pretty sure one of them is n’t bicycles .
There are those of us who have had the good fortune to meet with strength and beauty , with majestic force in which we were willing to trust our lives .
Then a day comes , that strength and beauty fails , and a man does what a man has to do .
I ’m going downstairs to put a bullet in a V - 8 .

Grybauskaite won a clear victory over her nearest rival Dalia Grybauskaite has been elected Lithuania 's first female president , according to official results .
" I am grateful for the responsibility invested in me , " said Ms Grybauskaite , the European Union budget commissioner .
With all ballots counted , she won 68.17 % of the votes .
Turnout at 51.7 % was just above the threshold needed to give her an outright first round win .
Her nearest challenger , Social Democrat lawmaker Algirdas Butkevicius came a distant second with 12 % of the vote .
Seven candidates contested the poll which was held amid widespread concern about the economic downturn in the Baltic state .
Under the Lithuanian constitution presidents have limited influence over economic policies .
Though as president Ms Grybauskaite , whose inauguration is set for 12 July , she will have the right to veto the budget .
The president 's main power lies in foreign policy and here she has promised to be less confrontational , especially towards Russia .
The president also formally appoints the prime minister and the cabinet .
' Level - headed ' President - elect Grybauskaite , the EU 's tough - talking budget commissioner who has a black belt in karate , ran as an independent .

Dalia Grybauskaite
Lithuanian readers ' reaction Lithuania 's crashing economy has dominated what little policy debate this presidential election has generated , the BBC's Adam Easton says .
Ms Grybauskaite has been critical of the way the economy has been handled by governments in the past .
" Our local political establishment is so boring for people , and they want to see some new faces , " she told reporters after voting in the capital Vilnius .
" In the difficult times I can give my experience , my knowledge to my country , " Ms Grybauskaite added .
She is widely seen as being a level - headed caretaker and has also avoided being tainted by domestic scandals , our correspondent says .
After enjoying years of impressive growth since it joined the European Union in 2004 , Lithuania is experiencing double digit economic contraction and rising unemployment .
Frustration turned into violence in January when demonstrators smashed windows in the parliament building in Vilnius .

I think it 's just automatic now .
When a high - profile Republican gets into trouble , Fox News steps in to mislead their sheep viewers by labeling them as Democrats .
Here 's a short list of Fox 's chyron hackery :
John McCain - Democrat
Joe Lieberman - Democrat
Arlen Spector - Democrat ( when he was still a Republican ! )
Mark Foley - Democrat
Media Matters also caught
Fox listing a Democratic strategist as Bush 's head of FEMA -- because his name happened to be Michael Brown .
Oh , and we can't forget the time they announced Rep. William Jefferson 's indictment using footage of Congressman John Conyers .
They apologized to their audience , but never to Conyers personally .
I 'm sure it was just an oversight , just like all the rest ... riiiight .
Have I missed any ?
Dave N :
It 's almost a clockwork thing .
Whenever Fox News wants you to forget that someone is actually a Republican , they , ah , accidentally label them a Democrat on their chryon and let it go .
So they did that today , as you can see , while Mark Sanford was explaining that he had been in Argentina to screw around on his wife .
( They corrected it in later chryons . )
Hardly the first time this has happened .
There was the time they ID 'ed Mark Foley , in the midst of another sex scandal , as a Democrat too .
At other times with sex scandals , as with Sen. Larry Craig , they simply have forgotten to identify them as Republicans .
They 've also done it when someone 's Republican status is inconvenient :
When Arlen Specter was attacking conservative shibboleths , he got labeled a D too .
And then there was the time John McCain was labeled a Democrat too .
At the time that just seemed weird , but now , with Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and a host of other conservatives promoting the notion that McCain was just a fake Republican anyway , it makes a certain kind of sense .
Fox sense , that is .

He was awarded three Purple Hearts , two Distinguished Service Crosses , and two Silver Stars .

How do you think it went ?
General Barry McCaffrey : Good .

It 's hard for me to overstate the degree of respect I have for the agency .

We ought to be grateful they 're there .
Having said that , it 's almost an out of body experience to me to listen to this debate going on [ whether these techniques were torture ] .
We should never as a policy maltreat people under our control , detainees .
We tortured people unmercifully .
We probably murdered dozens of them during a course of that , both by the armed forces and CIA .
[ Releasing the memos ] was the right thing to do .
We have to move forward . [ snip ]
There is prosecutorial discretion .
We should n't in my view go after the CIA officers involved in this .
There is a good argument in my view for reviewing the White House justice council and the Attorney General 's office who okayed this .
I think as a policy matter we better find out how thing went so wrong .
Nora O’Donnell : Wow !

► Meanwhile , legendary covert CIA officer Robert Baer also calls for an investigation .
The Administration was absolutely right to declassify the Department of Justice - CIA interrogation memos .
The argument that the letters compromise national security does not hold water . [ snip ]
But Obama should not stop there .
The memos justify abusive interrogations by the completely discredited " ticking time - bomb " defense — that if we do n't torture a suspect when we know there is an imminent threat , we stand to lose many , many American lives . [ snip ]
Not everything related to abusive interrogations can be declassified , but nonetheless should be looked at by a blue - ribbon presidential commission . [ snip ]
On a more public level , a thorough clearing of the air will go a long way toward discrediting the idea that we either torture terrorists or die . [ snip ]
A complete investigation into the quality of that information , I suspect , will prove we are going through this national trauma and international humiliation for absolutely nothing .

You 'll see a lot of news stories today about the credit card bill just passed by the U.S. Senate .
Here are the changes you 'll actually see in your statements , assuming it becomes law .

Photo by Brett L..
Consumer Reports '
Money blog runs down both the big picture and granular changes enforced by the bill , which generally seeks to cut back on unforeseen and unannounced fees and agreement changes .
Here 's a few of the items that you 'll want to take note of , especially if you 're signing up for a new card any time soon :
Bills can be paid online or over the phone without incurring a processing fee .
Customers must be over 60 days late on payments before their interest rate can be raised on balances ; if the rate is raised , it will go back to the lower rate if customers make the minimum payment on time for six months in a row .
Overlimit fees can't be charged unless cardholders are told that the purchase will put them over their limit and they authorize it to go through anyway .
If your card has more than one interest rate on balances , then payments must be applied to the highest interest rate first .

The full breakdown resides at Consumer Reports ' post , but that first item , especially , is worth noting for the future ; a certain Lifehacker editor 's card issuer charges $ 15 to pay by phone , even through an automated system , leaving him with the occasional Hobson 's choice of fee vs. late payment .
If President Obama signs off on the compromise bill between the House and Senate versions , the changes would go into effect nine months from the signing .
Glad to see the new laws ?
Still waiting on other reforms ?
You 've got the floor in the comments .

Ursula Le Guin ’s Faux Pas May 13 , 2009
New York , N.Y .
According to yesterday 's New York Times ( 5/12/09 , B1 ) , science fiction writer Ursula Le Guin recently found one of her books posted on the internet :
“ I thought , who do these people think they are ? ” Ms. Le Guin said .
“ Why do they think they can violate my copyright and get away with it ? ”
It 's a rookie mistake .
Seasoned victims of piracy know that nothing inflames the hornets more than denying their right to freely download and share all forms of media .
But certainly Ms. Le Guin 's initial reaction is understandable .
The first time you see your book posted on the web , it 's equivalent to the sensation of being shat upon .
As the years pass by , however , and it happens more and more , you realize there 's not a damn thing you can do about it , and the initial insult modulates to the somewhat less offensive feeling of merely being sprayed with spittle .
The best thing to do is to just keep your mouth shut .
Try instead to cherish those ever - dwindling readers whose curious morals persuade them to buy books rather than download them , and who thereby thank the author with kindly hug .
Today American taxpayers in more than 300 locations in all 50 states will hold rallies -- dubbed " tea parties " -- to protest higher taxes and out - of - control government spending .
There is no political party behind these rallies , no grand right - wing conspiracy , not even a 501 ( c ) group like MoveOn.org .
So who 's behind the Tax Day tea parties ?
Ordinary folks who are using the power of the Internet to organize .
For a number of years , techno - geeks have been organizing " flash crowds " -- groups of people , coordinated by text or cellphone , who converge on a particular location and then do something silly , like the pillow fights that popped up in 50 cities earlier this month .
This is part of a general phenomenon dubbed " Smart Mobs " by Howard Rheingold , author of a book by the same title , in which modern communications and social - networking technologies allow quick coordination among large numbers of people who do n't know each other .
In the old days , organizing large groups of people required , well , an organization : a political party , a labor union , a church or some other sort of structure .
Now people can coordinate themselves .
We saw a bit of this in the 2004 and 2008 presidential campaigns , with things like Howard Dean 's use of Meetup , and Barack Obama 's use of Facebook .
But this was still social - networking in support of an existing organization or campaign .
The tea -party protest movement is organizing itself , on its own behalf .
Some existing organizations , like Newt Gingrich 's American Solutions and FreedomWorks , have gotten involved .
But they 're involved as followers and facilitators , not leaders .
The leaders are appearing on their own , and reaching out to others through blogs , Facebook , chat boards and alternative media .
The protests began with bloggers in Seattle , Wash . , who organized a demonstration on Feb. 16 .
As word of this spread , rallies in Denver and Mesa , Ariz . , were quickly organized for the next day .
Then came CNBC talker Rick Santelli's Feb. 19 " rant heard round the world " in which he called for a " Chicago tea party " on July Fourth .
The tea -party moniker stuck , but angry taxpayers were n't willing to wait until July .
Soon , tea -party protests were appearing in one city after another , drawing at first hundreds , and then thousands , to marches in cities from Orlando to Kansas City to Cincinnati .
It is time to put an end to fortress America and force Jack Bauer to retire .
President Barack Obama is reportedly reviewing America ’s involvement in various conflicts overseas as well as its domestic defenses .
He would be well advised to make the review a thorough one , starting at zero and challenging every assumption being made about the nation ’s security .
Over the past seven years the United States has struck the devil ’s own bargain , trading liberty for security and receiving neither in return .
Given the tumult in the U.S. economy , Obama might also consider broadening the inquiry to include a serious cost - benefit analysis , because George Bush ’s Global War on Terror and his monstrous Department of Homeland Security do n’t come cheap .
Indeed , the heedless borrowing of money from foreigners to fight a series of wars without end " to protect the homeland " was undeniably a contributing factor in America ’s economic meltdown .
The British Empire collapsed due to the huge budget deficits in running a global enterprise that , like the war on terror , had no beginning or end and no bottom line .
The Soviet Empire , sheltered for a time by a command economy , was likewise doomed because its economy could not sustain the burden of a swollen military budget combined with support of numerous client states .
It is arguably now America ’s turn to learn about the twilight of empire .
What comes out of the process might well be a new and better place , but the transformation could be a traumatic one .
The stream of revenue that supports a huge military , more expensive than almost the rest of the world combined , plus a burgeoning domestic security complex , could easily vanish if President Obama ’s stimulus program fails to work , as is all too likely .
The Chinese and Japanese will call in their chips , and the dollar will sink to the level of the Belarusian ruble .
It is not surprising to note how the generals and their mouthpieces in the media are already starting to groan and stage their counterattack , stressing the need for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to guarantee America ’s security .
Petraeus and Odierno are being described as military geniuses on a par with Hannibal and Napoleon , with the implication that all that is needed is for them to " finish the job . "
The bill of goods about trusting the generals has been sold a number of times in the past seven years , and there is no reason to assume that it cannot be sold again , even though the American people are now confronting very hard times .
The issues of security and the federal government budget are , of course , linked and are further complicated by hidden costs in maintaining a constant war footing that distorts the economy overall .
America ’s heavily armed troopers are vastly more expensive than the conscript grunt of Vietnam , as are the armored vehicles that transport them into battle , the technical wizardry that supports them , and even the defense contractors who feed them .
The tenuous Iraq supply line snaking up from Kuwait , guarded as it is by platoons of mercenaries , drives the cost of food , fuel , and equipment to support the occupation to unimaginable levels .
Harvard economist Joseph Stiglitz has estimated that the total cost of the war in Iraq alone will exceed $ 3 trillion , and that war is not over yet .
Afghanistan is already promising to be worse .
The supply line from the port of Karachi in Pakistan up through the Khyber Pass into Afghanistan has been cut repeatedly over the past three months .
The militants have figured out that the long streams of trucks constitute a vulnerable jugular for the entire Afghan project .
Overland shipment through Turkey and Russia will increase the costs even more .
Obama should , for starters , negotiate without preconditions with all of Iraq ’s neighbors and non-state players to create a stable security environment for the entire region .
Groups and nations described as " rogues "  Syria , Iran , Hezbollah , and Hamas  will behave accordingly if they are deliberately marginalized .
Their legitimate concerns need to be addressed .
Obama should then bring the troops home from Iraq , all of them .
There is nothing more that they can accomplish , and it is time for the Iraqis to sort things out for themselves with America ’s best wishes .
Israel should be made to understand that they should roll back the settlements and seek a viable two - state solution with the Palestinians or risk forfeiting both economic and political support from Washington .
Obama should then provide evidence that the age of American imperialism is over by declaring the war in Afghanistan over and working closely with all relevant parties among the Pakistanis , Afghans , and Indians to create a security structure for the region that will preempt any development of a state sponsor of terrorism .
He should then look hard at the other vestiges of America ’s post - World War II empire , including the U.S. hostage soldiers in Korea , the large military presence in Japan , and the still considerable U.S. bases in Germany .
All served a function during the Cold War , but none of them any longer have any role apart from convincing America ’s allies that Washington is serious about mutual defense .
Europe , Korea , and Japan should all work with the United States to determine how to defend themselves , a relatively easy task as they face no serious threats apart from a bellicose but barefoot North Korea .
The U.S. defense budget is 40 percent of the world ’s total for military expenditures , even though there is no real enemy to fight .
By eliminating " wars of choice " and removing bases around the globe , the Pentagon budget could be pared down from its projected $ 663 billion for 2010 by at least a third to $ 440 billion .
We do n’t need three more infantry divisions , as we will not be looking around for someone to fight , nor the F - 22 fighter , as no one can challenge the U.S. in the air , and we surely do n’t need more carrier groups , as Washington already has the world ’s only blue - water navy .
Obama should also look at the Department of Homeland Security .
Its budget of $ 50 billion is only the tip of the iceberg , as many of its costs are subsumed or hidden in other budgets .
By all means , take every step necessary to secure America ’s borders but the compilation of no-fly and terrorist lists has been largely a mismanaged fraud , with many innocent Americans caught up in a Big Brotherish nightmare from which there is no escape .
If there were really as many terrorists in the U.S. as appear on the list , the homeland would have fallen long ago .
Contrived show trials of paint gunners and pizza delivery men hardly provide convincing evidence that there is a terrorist hiding under every bush .
Homeland Security has been an albatross ever since it was created .
Its color codes have been a joke , its leadership has been moribund , and its claims that it has protected the country from attack have been largely a fiction .
It has driven up costs for American companies operating internationally and turned the U.S. into a destination that few tourists seek because of a corps of hostile officials puffed up on testosterone at ports of entry .
And then there is the huge and growing intelligence budget , semi-officially running around $ 55 billion but actually at least half again bigger than that .
Shut down the office of the director of national intelligence , since it only duplicates functions elsewhere and adds extra layers of bureaucracy and cost .
Reconstitute the CIA and give its director genuine authority over budgets and intelligence operations worldwide .
Then fire most of the tens of thousands of intelligence contractors and all of the staff employees who are doing anything that does not directly relate to terrorism or nuclear proliferation .
It really does n’t matter who is elected in Botswana next month , and we do n’t need the local CIA station to recruit a spy to figure it out .
Anything that cannot actually harm the United States we should ignore .
That way costs will be reduced and the intelligence community will become efficient , centralized , and able to truly speak with one voice .
This would also reverse the militarization of intelligence operations that took place under the Bushies .
A little more lopping here and chopping there and , voilà , there will be a balanced budget .
America will also be able to stand tall in the world again , no longer the school bully , no longer interfering in other people ’s quarrels , a friend to all .
A fantasy ?
Not really .
It could be done .
The United States quickly demobilized and returned to a peacetime economy after the Second World War .
In those days , the U.S. produced more of what it consumed and was energy efficient , with huge cash reserves , so admittedly things are a little different now .
But if Barack Obama were able to bring about even a tiny shift in direction for an impoverished America circling the globe in search of dragons , it would truly be change that we can all believe in .

BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Anyone who has followed batteries knows the likelihood of a new technology to come along and save the world from itself is close to nil .
All we can hope for are tweaks that incrementally improve battery performance .
But there is a tweak that interests me , and it should interest investors as well .
It 's a lithium - titanate battery developed by Altair Nanotechnologies ALTI , and it's now being experimented with by the U.K.'s Lightning car company , as well as at least one U.S. carmaker .
What makes this battery valuable for automotive use is its recharging speed .
It 's optimized to recharge in minutes , not hours .
That makes the idea of fueling stations for electric vehicles feasible , perhaps even practical .
It also can be recharged more than 5,000 times , or every day for more than a decade .
Indeed , the recharging potential of these batteries could outlast a car 's lifetime , and so the company needs to figure out ways to recycle .
The key to this battery is its unique nanotechnology anode , which increases the actual surface area of the anode by 30 times .
That allows for faster charging and discharging .
But the drawback is price .
Costing perhaps three times that of the competition , this battery will remain pricey until mass production techniques are used .
Meanwhile , this is one of the many companies in the lithium - ion business to watch -- and one of the few that is publicly traded .
There are two basic types of batteries that will power the electric cars of the future -- the NiMH , for nickel metal - hydride , and the lithium - ion batteries first proposed in the 1970's and tweaked substantially since .
There are numerous lithium battery technologies getting research attention because no other battery delivers so much power at such a low weight .
Anyone who uses a disposable lithium battery in their camera soon realizes that they weigh almost nothing , yet deliver more power for a longer period than anything available .
The problem with lithium is that it 's extremely volatile .
Nobody makes an over - the - counter lithium battery larger than AA because of the danger .
Many are packaged to appear larger , but if you open it up you 'll find AA batteries stacked inside .
Further , the FAA has rules against flying with lithium batteries .
And the recent episode of exploding laptop batteries was all about the lithium .
There are numerous formulations for both rechargeable lithium -ion and lithium batteries depending on their eventual use .
One of the considerations is operating temperature .
Many modern battery technologies simply stop working when the temperature gets below freezing , which concerns carmakers .
According to the Altair brochure , though , the company 's battery is designed to operate from minus - 40 to plus - 55 Celsius .
This makes the battery practical for all sorts of uses including backup and wind - farm storage .
Whether this sort of technology will ever find its way into cell phones or laptops is unclear , but it looks like the best solution so far for the electric car .
This is a company worth watching .
Technology is all around us – it has now become an integral ( some might even say essential ) part of our daily lives .
With the complexity of technology comes a huge assortment of misconceptions and misunderstandings .
This list looks at ten of the most common and dispels them .
If you think of others that you feel ought to be here , mention them in the comments .
10 Mobile Explosion
Misconception :
It is dangerous to use a cellphone at a gas station
This misconception came about due to a bunch of emails being spread around the Internet describing cases of explosions caused by cellphone use .
The emails were purported to have been sent by Shell Oil .
When questioned , Shell denied sending the emails .
Furthermore , not only has there never been a case of a cellphone causing an explosion at a gas station , no one has been able to prove that it is even possible in scientific testing .
According to Snopes : “ News reports routinely attribute gas pump fires to cell phone use whenever a fire occurs at a service station where such a phone was in use at the time , and police and firefighters at the scene often simply assume the connection between the two to be valid . ”
Despite this complete lack of evidence of likelihood of accident , Australia and New Zealand both display signs at gas stations telling people to turn off cellphones and the city of Cicero in Illinois has made the use of cellphones at gas stations illegal .

9 First Transatlantic Flight
Misconception : Charles Lindbergh was the first man to fly the Atlantic Ocean
Charles Lindbergh was not the first man to fly the Atlantic Ocean , although he was the first to have flown across it solo .
The first flight had been done first in stages between May 8 and May 31 , 1919 , by the crew of the Navy - Curtiss NC - 4 flying boat which took 24 days to complete its journey .
The first truly non -stop transatlantic flight was made in 1919 by John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in a modified Vickers Vimy bomber .
8 Take the High Road
Misconception :
The US Highway system was designed to allow planes to land in emergencies
The United States Interstate Highway System was not designed with airplane landings in mind .
A common urban legend states that one out of every five ( or ten ) miles of highway must be straight and flat to allow emergency ( or military ) airplane landings , but this is not the case .
However , several parts of the German and later the Swiss Autobahn system were indeed designed to be auxiliary military airports , both during World War II and the Cold War . [ Source ]
7 Gutenberg – Our Hero !
Misconception : Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press or movable type
Johannes Gutenberg was not the first to invent the printing press or movable type ; these were in use in China and Korea centuries before .
Gutenberg was the first European to use movable type , and he probably invented it independently ; the printing press did have a larger influence on Western than on Eastern culture .
Another misconception about Gutenberg is that the first thing he printed was the Latin Vulgate ( known as the Gutenberg Bible ) .
Gutenberg ’s Bible was printed in Latin because he believed it would be more widely accessible to the common people .
But prior to the Bible , he had printed a number of Catholic Church documents and papal letters .

6 Cookie Monstrosity
Misconception : Web cookies are dangerous and should be avoided
In fact , cookies are plain text files which a website can store on your computer with information to manage your browsing .
Unless there is a security flaw in your webbrowser , cookies can not access or modify files or settings on your computer , nor can they execute code .
The only thing you have to fear from web cookies is the lack of privacy regarding some of your browsing habits .
In general , cookies are helpful things – for example , they can keep you logged in to your favorite websites saving you from having to enter your login data every time you visit .
5 Macs and Viruses
Misconception : Apple Macs do n’t get viruses
While it is true that Macs almost never get viruses , it is also true that there are some in existence .
First of all there are Macro Viruses which infect Microsoft Word and Excel documents .
Because Word and Excel are available for the Mac also , this means that they can be potentially harmful on Macs as well ( thanks Microsoft ) .
As of writing , Apple recognizes four possible viruses for Macs , though they are seldom seen .
The reason for the low number of viruses is that the Mac operating system is based on a Unix subsystem which usually prevents the average user from running software with sufficient privileges to allow harmful software to cause damage .
4 Hitler ’s Motorway
Misconception : Hitler created the autobahn
Many people believe that Hitler and the Nazis conceived of the idea of the first Autobahn ( essentially a large motorway ) in Germany ( and the first laned free public motorway in the world ) .
But in fact the autobahn was built in 1931 and opened by Konrad Adenauer , the Mayor of Cologne .
This was two years before Hitler became Chancellor of Germany .
Interestingly , however , the very first motorway ( unlaned ) was the pet project of a dictator : the Autostrada dei laghi was inaugaurated on the 21st of September 1924 in Milan during the rule of Benito Mussolini .
3 Plane Toilets
Misconception : Planes dump their toilet waste while up in the air
Not only do planes not dump their waste mid-flight , it is also impossible for them to do so short of some kind of catastrophe which causes the waste tanks to explode open ( because the valve is on the outside of the plane ) .
When toilets are used on a plane , the waste is dumped into a special tank .
The waste remains in the tank until the plane lands , and then special ground crew members pump the tanks .
So now you can rest safe in the knowledge that you do n’t need to watch out for flying chunks of frozen poop when a plane flies over you .
In case you are wondering about the sucking noise toilets on planes make , a vacuum is used to allow the toilet to be flushed with less water and because plumbing cannot rely on gravity alone in an aircraft in motion .
2 First Video Game
Misconception : Pong was the first video game
Computers are much older than many people think and when you talk about the very first game , most people tend to think of Pong .
Pong was invented in 1972 by Atari and it was an arcade style game that featured two opposing paddles and a ball with which you played virtual tennis .
It was the first commercially successful video game and it launched the video game industry .
But …
Twenty years earlier ( in 1952 ) , another game was created .
It was called OXO and it was a noughts - and - crosses ( tic - tac - toe ) type game which was played on the EDSAC computer .
It was made by Alexander Douglas for his PhD thesis at Cambridge University .
It is quite astonishing to think that the very first computer game was created nearly sixty years ago !
1 The Web / Internet
Misconception :
The web is the Internet
This is a very common misconception , most likely brought about due to the fact that most people use the web as their almost exclusive method of using the Internet .
But in fact , the Internet technically began to exist in the form we know it on January 1 , 1983 when its predecessor ( Arpanet ) began using TCP / IP – the system of network communication still used today .
The web was invented by an Englishman called Tim Berners - Lee in 1989 .
The World Wide Web is made up of servers ( which serve the pages ) and clients ( like Firefox , Safari , and IE ) which display the page .
The Internet is the set of technologies beneath the web which enable the web to exist .
If the Internet did n’t exist , the web would not be able to function ; if the web did n’t exist , the Internet still would .
Other programs that use the Internet which have nothing at all to do with the web are email , IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) , most internet messaging programs , newsgroups , BitTorrent , telnet , FTP , etc .

By Troy Senik - May 2 , 2009
It is a curious fact of American history that many of the great men of the Republic never ended up in the White House .
Benjamin Franklin was too old , having turned 83 the year of the first presidential election .
Henry Clay - despite five attempts to make it to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - had to settle for being one of the most important members in the history of the U.S. Senate .
Daniel Patrick Moynihan , one of the preeminent public intellectuals of the late 20th century , was perhaps too blunt for the presidency , once telling a Third World audience " Food growing is the first thing you do when you come down out of the trees .
The question is how come the United States can grow food and you can't ? "
As John McCain enters into the twilight of his legislative career , it is virtually certain that he will never be enshrined in the presidential pantheon .
But whether he will bequeath a legacy in the same stratum as Franklin , Clay , or Moynihan is far more debatable .
So far , McCain 's biggest legislative accomplishment as a U.S. senator has been the McCain - Feingold Act , restricting the means and manner of campaign finance .
This law , of course , has totally purified American politics from the taint of moneyed influence .
No , really .
Stop laughing .
But regardless of one 's feelings about the effects of campaign finance reform , this much is certain : it is not the stuff of a truly historic career .
One hundred years from now , the history of the 21st century will be able to be competently written without so much as a word on how the electoral process was funded .
Nor are McCain 's good government crusades against earmarks , Pentagon waste , or pork - barrel spending - however noble - defining and enduring improvements on the American landscape .
Yet perhaps now , in the shadow of his presidential defeat , Senator McCain has found his moment in history .
The occasion is President Obama 's decision to release to the public documents describing the terrorist interrogation techniques of the Bush Administration .
Sensible patriots can be forgiven for ambivalence towards the president 's gesture .
In one light , it is perhaps a renewal of the nation 's charter principles .
In another , it is possibly a gesture of weakness - a limp concession delivered out of fear that the sins of the fathers will be visited upon the sons .
What can not be debated , however , is that this is a matter of the gravest importance .
It involves serious and sophisticated questions about the lengths to which a free society may go to defend itself .
What does it profit a nation , after all , to gain the whole world and suffer the loss of its soul ?
Perhaps no issue in the brief history of the Obama Administration has been as worthy of the president 's inaugural call to " a new era of responsibility . "
Yet on that front , President Obama has failed .
And the man he vanquished at the polls has succeeded .
Had the president truly wanted to " acknowledge [ mistakes ] and move forward " as he said in an April 20 speech at the CIA , the course before him would have been clear .
He could simply have signed the January executive order banning the techniques , informed the nation that we were turning over a new leaf , and proceeded to put his own stamp on the war on terror .
Instead , Obama has chosen to lead the country in a sort of nationwide catharsis .
With the memos related to the CIA 's interrogation techniques now made public , every last detail will be fodder for the two most capricious species in American life - cable news producers and congressional committee chairmen .
And when the Pentagon releases photos of alleged prisoner abuse later this month , the national temperature will only rise .
A congressional investigation is already underway .
Influential liberals are calling for a federal appellate judge who authored some of the memos to either resign or be impeached .
Some in Congress are beginning to demand a special prosecutor tasked with ferreting out wrongdoing in the CIA 's interrogation program .
Even ostensibly serious commentators are publicly fantasizing about show trials that punish members of the previous administration ranging from Justice Department lawyers to Obama 's predecessor in the Oval Office .
Into these fever swamps has waded John McCain , a man whose life was nearly extinguished by the agony of torture four decades ago and half a world away .
Of the 537 men and women elected to federal office , he is one of only two who ever had to stiffen their spines and peer into that abyss .
And because of his national platform , no one speaks to the American people on this issues from a position of greater authority .
McCain was adamantly opposed to the methods used by the Bush Administration .
But in this hour of grave national unseriousness , he has chosen to be the adult in the room .
After years of protesting the extreme techniques , McCain 's message of late has been simple : dutiful public servants attempting to shield the American people from another terrorist attack should n't be prosecuted because they failed to anticipate that a future administration would n't like their advice .
If we expect these men and women to devote the full force of their talents to keeping the nation safe , then we have to promise them something better than victors ' justice .
Only a suicidal society flogs those who are trying to save it .
At the heart of liberal democracy , there is a notion - humble and just - that policy differences are not to be criminalized .
Destroy that standard and you substitute the raw force of power for the cool reason of law .
If John McCain 's courageous stand can preserve that principle , he will have saved a hallmark of the American system .
And he will have earned his place in history .
Correction :
An earlier version of this article stated that Senator McCain was the only federal elected official to undergo torture .
Rep. Sam Johnson ( R - TX ) also experienced torture while a prisoner of war in Vietnam .
The author regrets the error and honors Rep. Johnson ’s service to his country .
Peppers signs franchise tender
The wait is finally over for the Panthers , as defensive end Julius Peppers will sign his tender on Wednesday according to the team ’s official website .
He ’ll earn $ 16.683 million this season .
The Panthers could still try and trade him , but it ’s doubtful that they find any suitors who will be willing to give up draft picks and long - term money .
It ’s more likely at this point that the Panthers sign Peppers to a long - term deal than trade him .
Carolina wants to win now and with John Fox and GM Marty Hurney ’s jobs seemingly on the line every year , draft picks for future years do n’t help them in the present .
Peppers wanted to play outside linebacker in a 3 - 4 scheme , but the grass is n’t always greener on the other side .
The Panthers hired Ron Meeks to replace Mike Trgovac as defensive coordinator and while Meeks is n’t necessarily a scheming genius , Dwight Freeney excelled under him in Indianapolis so Peppers could thrive in Carolina ’s new scheme .
It ’ll be interesting to hear what Peppers says once he reports to training camp in a month .
If he ’s going to be bitter all season about the Panthers franchising him , then it ’s going to be a long year .
But if he shows up hell bent on having a great year so he could hit the market and prove his free agent worth , then maybe both he and the team can get what they want out of the situation .
Arsenal may not have as many European trophies tucked away in the cabinet as some of the other sides to have featured so far but that has n't stopped them continually being at the forefront of revolutions in the domestic game .
From Herbert Chapman 's 1930s team to Bertie Mee 's 1971 Double - winning side and George Graham 's 1980s defensive rocks to Arsene Wenger 's Invincibles , the Arsenal dream team has caused many headaches .

What .
The .
Fuck .
I think the seccesionist movement has found their captain , a Mr. Neal Horsley from Georgia , who among other unique life experiences , has spent his life making love to various animals and inanimate objects
No , seriously — Georgia candidate for governor says sex with mules , watermelon behind him :
NH : “ Absolutely .
I was a fool .
When you grow up on a farm in Georgia , your first girlfriend is a mule . ”
AC : “ I ’m not so sure that that is so . ” NH : “ You did n’t grow up on a farm in Georgia , did you ? ” AC : “ Are you suggesting that everybody who grows up on a farm in Georgia has a mule as a girlfriend ? ”
NH :
It has historically been the case .
You people are so far removed from the reality …
Welcome to domestic life on the farm … ”
With the coup de grace :
“ You experiment with anything that moves when you are growing up sexually .
You ’re naive .
You know better than that …
If it ’s warm and it ’s damp and it vibrates you might in fact have sex with it . ”
Strike that , this just gets worse and more disturbing :
“ We ’re talking about the mule now ? ” Yes , he says .
The mule .
“ A small mule ? ” I ask .
“ No , a full grown mule , ” he says .
“ She loved me , though . ”
We both laugh , but I ’m still trying to figure out the logistics .
How big is this thing ?
The size of a horse , he says .
“ All I had to do was give her an ear of corn . ”
He laughs again .
“ She was a [ prostitute ] mule . ”
“ How did you reach ? ” “ I do n’t know … I stood on something .
The kicker is , as soon as I was done she pissed all over me .
It was embarrassing .
I never told anyone that before . ”
……………………………….
Not only that , but Horsley has had sex with men .
He was in the Air Force , it was a cold night , yadda , yadda , yadda , he had sex with him , ahem , the way he did the mule .
“ It was gross , ” he says .
Really ?
He had n’t described the mule that way .
“ I ’ve [ screwed ] a watermelon , ” he says .
And that ’s just for starters .
He ’s had sex with just about everything it ’s physically possible to have sex with , and some that is n’t .
“ How many times have I masturbated in my life ? ” he asks .
Now he ’s 65 and orgasm - free for two years ( his wife finally divorced him — too much “ drama ” , she said ) .
“ The bottom line is , I never treated it as if it were not a sin . ”
Good thing that Mule did n’t get pregnant .

Graham Cluley of antivirus firm Sophos says the Twitter website is vulnerable to viruses written in the Javascript web - programming language .

Let ’s get this straight : the US government through the funds of the American taxpayer have given GM over $ 10 billion in bailout funds ( lower range estimate ) .
In turn , General Motors is closing over 1,100 of it ’s dealerships and plans to move factories to China to export cars to United States .
Did the United States government just pay over 10 billion dollars to General Motors to close 20 % of it ’s American dealerships and outsource American jobs to China ?
What kind of fucking investment is that ?

Perhaps one of the most beloved foods in our house is bacon .
We 've tried all kinds and like most of them .
After reading up a bit , I learned that making bacon is n't really that complicated .
This is a pork belly .
Bacon is made from pork belly .
To be clear , American bacon is cured and smoked pork belly , British back bacon is cured pork loin .
I am American , so I make bacon from pork belly .
The first step is curing the pork belly with a dry cure of salt , sugar , and pink salt ( sodium nitrite ) .
The main purpose of the cure is to prevent any bacterial growth on the meat and draw out some water .
Let 's remember that refrigeration is a relatively new invention .
In the past , a big life problem was finding ways to preserve meat for use long after it was killed .
Curing by salting , smoking , and drying are methods to prevent meat from spoiling .
Making bacon was a way to save the pork belly for later use .
Pork belly was also the main ingredient of salt pork , a mainstay of the military diet for centuries .
I triple bagged the meat and put it in the refrigerator to cure for a week .
After a week , I pulled the now cured pork belly out and washed it well .
I patted it dry and prepared it for a smoke .
Traditionally , bacon is cold smoked .
The goal is to apply smoke to the meat without cooking it .
That means keeping the temperature well under 150 � F .
That 's not easy to do in a traditional smoker .
So , I built a cold smoker unit from my regular smoker and a trash can .
I 'll post more about that project .
Here is the cured pork belly being smoked .
The goal is to get a good amount of flavor into the meat without cooking it .
I smoked it for about 3 hours .
I measured the temperature and it did n't get above 120 � F . I pulled it out and let it rest a bit and then put it in the fridge to cool .
After cooling down , I started slicing .
Sure enough , it had the look , feel , and smell of bacon .
The real test was cooking it .
I fried up a few slices and eagerly took a bite .
Sure enough it was bacon .
I am very happy with the result .
It 's a lot of work to make bacon , from the curing time to the smoking , but I enjoyed the process .
When I make it again , I 'm going to try a maple syrup cure process to get a bit of a sweet flavor .
Give it a try , you 'll have fun .

As a kid I ’ve always been a fan of toys that gave my brain a little tease , but as time passed on I was sucked into video games , Blizzard games especially .
Maybe its time for Blizzard and Lego to partner up and create Blizzards Universe in Lego .
Below are some awesome samples of some popular Blizzard games created with Lego .
The World from Berlin US ' Dilettantism ' in Opel Negotiations ?
Politicians in Berlin , these days , are doing everything they can to save Germany 's GM subsidiary Opel , but Washington is making it difficult .
German commentators wonder if it is US incompetence , or if the failures can be found closer to home .
Tobias is laughing .
And laughing .
The effect is disconcerting .
It 's a bwa - ha - ha kind of evil mastermind laugh — appropriate if you 've just sacked Constantinople , checkmated Deep Blue , or handed Superman a Dixie cup of kryptonite Kool - Aid , but downright scary in a midtown Manhattan restaurant during the early - bird special .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Our fellow diners begin to stare .
Tobias does n't notice and would n't care anyway .
He 's as rumpled and wild as a nerdy grizzly bear .
His place mat is covered in diagrams and sketched floor plans and scribbled arrows .
His laugh fits him like a tinfoil hat .
It goes on for a solid 20 seconds .
But Tobias is n't crazy .
Far from it .
He 's a professional lock breaker , a man obsessively — perhaps compulsively — dedicated to cracking physical security systems .
He does n't play games , he rarely sees movies , he does n't attend to plants or pets or , currently , a girlfriend .
Tobias hacks locks .
Then he teaches the public how to hack them , too .
Like many exceedingly bright people , Tobias has the exhausted air of a know - it - all .
Over dozens of dinners , he has walked me through how to pick simple locks ( " Uh , is there something wrong with your hands ? " ) and bypass combination dials ( " A brain - damaged monkey could do it faster " ) .
He has described how to outwit security technologies like motion detectors ( " Duh " ) , face - recognition software ( " It 's stupid , even if you think about it ! " ) , fingerprint scans ( " What child came up with that ? " ) , and heat sensors ( " You can get this one — maybe " ) .
3 cylinder lock .
For more , visit wired.com / video Marc Tobias and Tobias Bluzmanis attempt to bump the high - security Medecocylinder lock .
We 've covered key card hotel locks over seafood , in - room credit card safes over sandwiches .
While we ate a decent steak dinner , Tobias used the house crayons to diagram one of the largest jewel robberies in history ; over dessert , he showed me how a person less honest than himself would pull the heist again .
Thinking like a criminal is Tobias ' idea of fun .
It makes him laugh .
It has also made him money and earned him a reputation as something of the Rain Man of lock - breaking .
Even if you 've never heard of Tobias , you may know his work :
He 's the guy who figured out how to steal your bike , unlock your front door , crack your gun lock , blow up your airplane , and hijack your mail .
Marc Weber Tobias has a name for the headache he inflicts on his targets : the Marc Weber Tobias problem .
Lock - breaking is equal parts art and science .
So is the ability to royally piss people off .
Tobias is a veritable da Vinci at both endeavors .
His Web site 's streaming video of prepubescent kids gleefully opening gun locks has won him no points with mothers or locksmiths , and his ideas about how to smuggle liquid explosive reagents onto commercial airlines spookily presaged the Transportation Security Administration 's prohibitions against carry - on liquids .
Over the past 20 years , Tobias has been threatened by casinos , banned from hotel chains , and bullied by legions of corporate lawyers .
And enjoyed every minute of it .

Tobias discusses full disclosure , his obsession , and his favorite pranks .
But to Tobias , pissing off
The Man is n't the point , not entirely .
Nor is it , entirely , to make himself famous or rich — not that he 's allergic to either outcome .
The point , he says , is to " make shit better . "
Tobias thinks of himself as a humble public servant .
When he attacks the Kryptonite bike lock or the Club ( or those in - room safes at Holiday Inn or Caesars Palace ) , he 's not a bad guy — he's just Ralph Nader with a slim jim , protecting consumers by exposing locks , safes , and security systems that are n't actually locked , safe , or secure .
At least , not from people like him .
The problem , if you 're a safe company or a lock maker , is that Tobias makes it all public through hacker confabs , posts on his Security.org site , and tech blogs like Engadget .
He views this glasnost as a public service .
Others see a hacker how - to that makes The Anarchist Cookbook read like Betty Crocker .
And where Tobias sees a splendid expression of First Amendment rights , locksmiths and security companies see a criminal finishing school .
Tobias is n't just exposing problems , they say .
He is the problem .
But forget bike locks and hotel room safes :
These days , Tobias is attacking the lock famous for protecting places like military installations and the homes of American presidents and British royals .
Between stabs at his salad , Tobias hands me his latest idea of fun : nearly 300 pages of self - published hacker - porn detailing his attack on the allegedly uncrackable Medeco high - security lock .
" Trust me , this will cause a goddamned riot ! " he says , dabbing at tears of joy with a paper napkin .
" Oh yeah , this is way , way bigger than the liquid explosives thing ! "
And he 's right , it is bigger — and with way , way bigger consequences .
Some Marc Weber Tobias problems rattle companies .
Others end as consulting contracts or dropped lawsuits or forcibly improved design .
But all Tobias problems , like all hacker stories , start with a nerdy kid in a basement workshop , taking things apart .
Tobias is Ralph Nader with a slim jim .
Photo : Phillip Toledano Tobias ' basement was in the Denver suburbs of the 1950s , back when the global data carrier was n't the Internet but Ma Bell .
The Bell System said you had to use its equipment and protocols and pay a dime to access its network ; Tobias figured out how to do it with a penny .
At the time , the saying was " Ma Bell has you by the calls . "
Young Tobias saw the company as a Goliath , " a big corporate monopoly intent on ripping everyone off . "
It was the perfect target for an aspiring pain in the ass .
With practice , the inscrutable pay phone boxes began giving up their secrets .
Tobias was fascinated , then disappointed ; once you saw how the machine worked , it was obvious , stupid even .
All you had to do was hit the coin return thingy at the right moment , launch a penny into the nickel slot , and the circuit connected .
Stupid .
And the stupidest thing of all was that the phone company counted on customers being more stupid than their stupid machine .
To a 15 - year - old troublemaker , this was either an insult or a challenge .
Tobias decided it was both and decided to take it personally .
Cheap phone calls were n't the point .
Beating the machine , hacking the lock :
These were acts of vindication , proof that you were right and others wrong , proof that you were better than the suckers .
Now Tobias started turning up at school dances — not to show off his Hand Jive , of course , but to showcase his new phone trick .
It was a nerdy cool : David outgeeking Goliath .
He felt a ripple of electricity whenever he teased a dial tone out of a machine , and at collection time the company men found pennies where nickels should have been .
But penny games were greasy kids ' stuff .
Soon Tobias started phone phreaking — building devices known as blue boxes that mimic phone tones to speak directly to the switching machines .
Like his other Ma Bell trick , the point of this hack was n't just to get free long - distance calls ; it was to solve the most interesting puzzle possible .
He had a lot of fun .
Recounting these triumphs delights Tobias , and soon his rant becomes a waggle dance of pure geek glee .
His eyelids flutter as his eyeballs scan and rescan space like a stuttering robot .
Tobias can present a closed and curmudgeonly attitude to strangers , but this subject opens him up like a tickled child .
" All lock breakers talk about the intellectual challenge being like chess , " he says .
" But really , it 's much better , because you 're pitted against smart guys and millions of dollars of engineering designed to keep you out ! "
Through the late ' 60s and early ' 70s , as his university campus exploded in drugs and protest , Tobias was monkishly working his way through the dorm 's pin-tumbler master key system .
For a solitary kid with fierce concentration and odd social skills , locks provided rewards the outside world never could .
" Basically , I 've given up women for locks , " Tobias laughs .
" They 're dependable , and their problems are understandable — if you focus long enough , you can actually figure them out ! "
On weekends he did file - drawer wafer locks , combination dials from lockers , and , eventually , simple safes .
The technical permutations filled notebooks , then a filing cabinet .
By senior year , Tobias was methodically chronicling his discoveries in what became a hacker 's encyclopedia .
Over the next few decades , this would evolve into a book and multimedia CD - ROM called Locks , Safes , and Security : An International Police Reference ( 1,411 pages ; $ 220 ) .
In the trade , it 's usually just called the bible .
Since Tobias had his sights set on being a professional pain in the ass , law school was a natural choice .
So was a private investigator 's license .
And a polygraph license .
And invitations to help sheriff 's department investigations .
Soon Tobias was trapping racketeers through wiretaps and rigging hidden cameras in hospitals and churches to catch junkie night nurses and pedophile Catholic priests .
( " That was really fun , " Tobias says .
" Especially as a Jew . " )
And if in the course of an investigation a locked door needed opening or a security system needed circumventing — well , he had some methods for that , too .
By the 1980s , Tobias had settled into a career working the edges of law enforcement .
His gigs had paired him with the South Dakota attorney general 's office , the state highway patrol , and more than half a dozen police and sheriff 's departments .
He had been a PI .
He had worked with informants in two states ' penitentiaries and as a wired - up undercover operative buying dope , a prosecutor , and a consultant .
He was a personal friend of the governor .
By all conventional measures , Tobias was a successful adult .
But somewhere deep inside , that 15 - year - old tinkerer was still looking for trouble .
He found it by doing street theater to disgrace a parking - meter manufacturer in Sioux Falls , by planning a mock press conference in Minneapolis ( resulting in a panicked attempt to ban him from the Marriott hotel chain ) , and by threatening to take his in - room safecracking show to the Vegas Strip .
( " Caesars ' security really did n't find it funny , " Tobias says .
" So I flew to a hotel near Disney World and did it there instead . " )
When the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor came and went without an apology from the Japanese government , Tobias decided to sneak - attack a Japanese company by decoding the magnetic key cards for its hotel door locks .
" Do I like to make trouble ?
Of course , I 'm a lawyer ! " Tobias says .
" Ask yourself , why does a lawyer pick locks ?
The answer is liability .
A lot of companies are arrogant and greedy and stupid bullies who put people at risk .
They deserve to have a Marc Weber Tobias problem ! "
And year after year , Tobias delighted in creating them , hitting Elsafe and the Club , Targus combination and Master locks , iPod leashes and laptop cables .
He did the Kryptonite with a Bic pen , post office boxes with a filed key , and electronic home security systems with a UHF walkie - talkie .
He was having fun .
And in response , the lock companies were forced to address his hacks by upgrading their technology .
True to his code , Tobias ' meddling was " making shit better . "
It was all going swimmingly .
Then , in the early 2000s , he became increasingly fascinated with the crack cocaine of lock - picking : a technique called bumping .
It would lead him to a lock breaker almost as obsessed as he was — and to the biggest security drama of his career .
Bumping is simple : Insert a filed - down key into a lock , then knock it with a hammer to momentarily pop the lock 's pins into an open position .
Like the Bic pen technique for defeating the Kryptonite lock , it 's perfect for opportunistic bad guys ; any idiot with a few tools and minimal skill can use it to open most cheap front - door locks worldwide .
Though well - known in Europe , bumping was still relatively obscure in the US — until Tobias began introducing it at hacker conferences in 2004 .
Not surprisingly , news of the imminent bumping epidemic was media catnip .
Tobias was interviewed dozens of times for the kind of scare pieces that local newscasts wedge between weather and sports .
It did n't take much to imagine all the paranoid scenarios : Kids study Tobias ' online video , crack the lock off Dad's Glock , and put holes in things that should n't have them .
Enterprising junkies embark on habit - feeding crime waves .
Hotel rooms , no longer secure , become magnets for burglary and rape .
High school truants walk the halls shimming combination locks off rows of lockers .
Crime gangs use Tobias ' case study to copycat the 2003 Antwerp diamond heist , while tech terrorists simply co-opt the master list of Marc Weber Tobias problems to outwit America 's Keystone Kop - homeland security and generally blow stuff up .
The world is unzipped .
And our innocence — not to mention a good deal of our cash , jewelry , and portable electronics — is lost .
Tobias shrugged off such concerns , along with the hate mail .
Scaring citizens to attention is part of his educational program .
" Do you really think ignorance will keep you safe ? " he asks .
" Is it even an option ? "
But what did worry him was the growing anger among members of the Associated Locksmiths of America , the largest lock - industry trade group in the country .
An ALOA member filed a formal grievance for violation of the association 's code of ethics after Tobias spoke at the 2004 HOPE ( Hackers on Planet Earth ) conference in New York City .
After Tobias appeared at the 2007 Defcon meeting in Las Vegas , ALOA threatened to kick him out of the organization for presenting security weaknesses to hackers and continuing to associate with enterprises of " questionable character . "
Since much of Tobias ' income comes as a consultant to lock companies that rely on ALOA , for once he'd met a threat he could n't afford to shrug off .
Tobias understands why some ALOA members despise him , and he 's sympathetic , to a point .
" They 're pissed because I keep telling them that it 's not a guild and that there are no secrets , " he says .
" It 's called the Internet — duh ! " But Tobias ' information - age philosophy belies a practical problem : Locks are not software , and you can't download a patch for your front door .
Until someone pays to swap out that hardware , it 's vulnerable .
And so are you .
But where most locksmiths saw menace , a manufacturer called Medeco High Security Locks sensed a marketing opportunity .
For four decades , Medeco systems have defined high security ( a technical designation indicating resistance against covert - entry attack for 10 to 15 minutes , depending on which of two laboratory standards is used ) .
While Medeco locks are obviously not the only barrier between an evildoer and , say , US nuclear codes , they are some of the best locks ever made — and over the years , they have secured most everything worth protecting : storefronts and corporate offices , even the Department of Defense , courthouses , UN buildings , and military and munitions facilities worldwide .
And the company 's newest line of locks , Medeco3 , was essentially a promise in brass and steel .
Medeco trumpeted the fact that the lock protected the residences of the British royals and the US president .
A press release emphasized that while cheaper locks might be susceptible to bumping , " not all locks can be bumped . "
And consumers should " know the differences . "
Soon Clyde Roberson , Medeco 's director of technical services , also began appearing on those local news scare pieces , raising the alarm about the bump menace while touting a lock that , the news reports said , " ca n't be bumped . "
And Medeco did n't deny the " bump - proof " claims .
( As this article went to press , the company Web site continued to link to the reports . )
In August 2006 , Medeco even filed paperwork to trademark the term bump - proof .
Bumping was a PR boon for Medeco's $ 100 - plus high - security locks , and Tobias was the technique 's American prophet .
But even as Medeco's Roberson thanked Tobias for the publicity , the lock cracker had begun to preach a new message : Medeco 's hardware was good , but not good for everyone — and certainly nowhere as good as company executives claimed .
" I told them the whole ' bump - proof ' thing was a terrible idea , " Tobias says .
One reason : a young Latin American locksmith named , coincidentally , Tobias .
Like Marc Tobias , Tobias Bluzmanis had started his lock - hacking career by taking things apart down in his parents ' basement ( in this case , in Caracas , Venezuela ) .
After moving to Miami , Bluzmanis spent nearly two years moonlighting in his workshop , obsessed with inventing a gizmo to determine pin position in Medeco locks .
His lawyer wrote to Medeco , describing the device .
The company evinced little interest , replying with a form letter .
When Bluzmanis turned to Tobias for advice , the older man spotted something special .
It was n't the invention — several lock engineers had designed similar decoders decades earlier , to no effect .
The impressive thing was that Bluzmanis had done it without formal engineering training or knowledge of the previous efforts .
Essentially , Bluzmanis had been clever enough to reinvent the wheel .
Tobias saw potential in Bluzmanis — and a possible partner .
By July 2006 , the two were meeting regularly in the back of a Miami locksmith shop , hunting for the Medeco 's vulnerabilities .
Bluzmanis and Tobias are a classic odd couple : Bluzmanis is a tall , soft - spoken Venezuelan with a new family and a taste for red wine .
Tobias is an outspoken , midsize , middle - aged , middle - American bachelor and lifelong teetotaler .
But crouching geek - to - geek at a workbench , squinting into a puzzling keyhole , the differences did n't matter .
The lock - cracking quest took on the intensity of a recurring fever dream as night after night they employed paper clips , needle - nose pliers , a plane sander , safe - deposit key blanks , plastic sheets , lock - picking tools , tension wrenches , and lots and lots of paper .
They divided the Medeco3 mechanism into a series of problems , then devised theories to attack each in order .
By December 2006 , Bluzmanis and Tobias had discovered a method for opening the Medeco3 in about a minute .
Tobias called Roberson immediately .
" We figured he'd be as interested as we were , " Bluzmanis says .
" But he said , ' No , it 's impossible ; the locks must have been defective . ' "
So a few weeks later , Tobias sent Roberson the breached hardware along with a video of them opening a couple of Medeco locks .
" I even posted the clip on my Web site , " Tobias says .
The password for access : Roberson 's initials and phone extension .
Then Tobias and Bluzmanis sat back and waited .
What did they expect ?
Perhaps a press conference , at least some attaboys for cracking the lock equivalent of Fermat 's last theorem .
They had just slain Goliath on digital video .
But Goliath did n't appear to care .
In fact , according to Tobias , Goliath was no longer returning phone calls .
Tobias says that even after five weeks he had heard nothing substantial from Roberson : " He said nobody had looked at the video or examined the locks ; they were too busy .
I mean , give me a break ! "
( Roberson says he can't remember the specifics but has " always appropriately responded to any reasonable inquiry " that Tobias made . )
But internally , Medeco was making adjustments .
Online , the company changed its claim to " virtually bump - proof " and stopped pursuing its application to trademark bump - proof .
Yet Medeco still would n't comment on Tobias ' discovery .
Nothing could piss off Tobias more .
And so what had started as an intellectual pursuit now became a crusade .
Tobias needed proof , a confession .
But Medeco would no longer engage in any substantial conversation with him .
So he started using surrogates and taping the calls .
" Customer service was still saying they could n't be picked or bumped , " Tobias fumes .
" At the conferences , my colleagues were being told , ' Hey , Marc Tobias is just a crank and a liar trying to extort hush money from the company ! ' "
Sitting across from Tobias at dinner , protecting my food from flying spittle , I do n't really need to ask if he 's pissed off .
But I do anyway .
" What ? " he shrieks , alarming the waiter .
" Of course I 'm pissed off !
Everybody should be pissed off ! "
" It 's not about me .
It 's about what these locks protect , " Tobias says .
" Medeco locks are the best in the world — that 's why they 're used by the Pentagon , the embassies .
These agencies believe that the locks can't be picked in under 15 minutes , that they can't be bumped , that you can't trace keys onto plastic .
It 's the definition of high security — and it 's wrong !
We proved it . "
" Look , " he says , taking it down a few notches .
" If we can do it , so can the bad guys .
Medeco needs to acknowledge it and let the locksmiths know it — and the DOD , FBI , CIA , Secret Service , and all their clients . "
Tobias blinks frantically , trying to clear this appalling reality from his view - screen .
" You know , they could have just admitted the problem .
Just said , ' Marc , you 're right and we 're wrong and we need to admit this publicly and fix it . '
But did they do that ? "
Tobias waggles an emphatic no .
" Instead , they called me an extortionist and trashed the Marc Tobias reputation .
And they 're going to pay for that , " he says , stabbing the defenseless tablecloth for emphasis .
" Oh yeah , arrogance does have its price . "
Cheated of intellectual laurels and shut out by one of the most revered lock companies in the world , his only option now was to go Rambo .
He would take this Marc Weber Tobias problem directly to the public .
First , Tobias wrote another encyclopedic manual , called Open in Thirty Seconds , and in 261 excruciatingly detailed pages , he and Bluzmanis explained exactly how they exploited the Medeco vulnerabilities — and exactly how you could exploit them , too .
They spelled out not only picking and bumping attacks but other Medeco3 hacks as well and crowned the work with a cheeky introduction " thanking " Clyde Roberson of Medeco for " making this possible . "
( Their DIY method for duplicating keys using a photocopier , an X - Acto knife , and some old credit cards will be included in the next edition . )
Then Tobias had 3,000 copies printed ( it 's available on Amazon.com and his Web site ) , packed up his locks , socks , and underwear , and hit the road .
Maybe this meeting was in Myrtle Beach or Dallas or Dubai .
Or Kuala Lumpur or Amsterdam or San Francisco — it does n't matter , since nobody was officially here anyway .
Call them spooks , black - bag operators , whitehats , covert - entry men .
You can't call them anything else , because the people who run security for federal agencies do n't wear uniforms or name tags .
They do n't introduce themselves , and they never , ever speak on the record .
When they meet , it 's by personal invitation in rented rooms stocked with Styrofoam cups and nondairy creamer .
Theirs is a universe of complete secrecy and total deniability , of national secrets and nuclear footballs , clothed in the anonymity of Dockers and Ecco walkers .
But even in this shadow world , these men had faith in certain fundamental truths , like the reliability of Medeco locks .
These were the locks that defined high security .
They could n't be hacked , not quickly and quietly , not covertly , not with picks or jiggle keys , and definitely not with blanks cut from credit cards .
These men had known this for sure , and for decades .
And yet they gathered last summer to sit in rented chairs and experience the latest Marc Weber Tobias problem .
Laid out on a rented table were new Medeco locks , picking kits , bump hammers , jiggle keys , a paper clip , and a vise .
Tobias clicked through his PowerPoint slides , then hit the lights .
He stood aside while the spooks tried the technique themselves , one after another .
" Well , I 'll be damned , " said the man from the European military security organization .
" Good golly , " said the man with desert cargo pants and a jarhead cut .
" Hmm , " said the security guy for a US government acronym .
Tobias swallowed a smirk .
" I 'm sure you know what these protect … " " Uh - huh , " the American spook said .
The lock was open .
It was n't supposed to be .
He held it between his fingers like a radioactive turd .
" This , " he said , " is a problem . "
Suddenly , it was all too easy to imagine real - life Tobias attacks : A mole in Defense or Treasury borrows a key for five minutes .
He photocopies it and emails the scan , distributing a master key that can access a whole floor .
And all those security protocols based on 10 - minute response times ?
Now an expert covert team might take seconds , not hours or minutes , to open a target 's door .
Not every lock , not every door — but still , the impossible was now clearly possible .
And how long had the Tobias attack been out there ?
Did the Chinese have it yet ?
You could see part of the room thinking , " Holy crap , if the terrorists are half as smart as the hackers , they 've already won , " and the other part thinking , " Holy crap , how can we use this trick to screw everyone else ? "
Suddenly , there was a new menu of spy - world options , from embassy break - ins and bug placement to military , diplomatic , and industrial espionage .
In the bitter debate over the nation ’s counter - terrorism policies , former Vice President Dick Cheney has introduced an assertion that substantially raises the stakes .
Twice in the last two weeks -- including during his speaking duel with President Obama on Thursday -- Cheney has said that the Bush administration ’s approach may have saved “ hundreds of thousands ” of lives .
It is a claim that goes beyond anything Cheney or former President George W. Bush said while in office -- crediting their approach with preventing casualties on a scale that the United States has not seen since World War II .
But terrorism experts said that though it is possible to envision scenarios that involve casualties of that magnitude , no evidence has emerged about the plots disrupted during the Bush administration to suggest that Cheney ’s claim is true .
Advertisement
“ It ’s an easy thing to say and a difficult thing to prove , ” said Bruce Hoffman , a terrorism expert at Georgetown University .
“ I think it ’s another broadside in this ongoing feud . ”
Cheney first used the language during a May 10 appearance on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation . ”
“ I ’m convinced , absolutely convinced , that we saved thousands , perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives , ” he said .
Cheney ’s assertion is plausible if he is referring to concerns that Al Qaeda had ambitions of acquiring a nuclear , biological or chemical weapon , said Gary J. Schmitt , an intelligence expert at the American Enterprise Institute , where Cheney delivered his speech Thursday .

“ Because they disrupted the leadership of Al Qaeda , ” Schmitt said , Cheney can reasonably argue that “ they were able in some larger sense to preclude a [ weapons of mass destruction ] attack in the years ahead . ”
But in his second reference to six - figure casualties , Cheney went further , saying that those lives were saved as a direct result of the CIA ’s use of waterboarding and other so - called “ enhanced ” interrogation methods .
“ The intelligence officers who questioned the terrorists can be proud of their work and proud of the results , ” Cheney said in his speech Thursday , “ because they prevented the violent death of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , of people . ”
That assertion is more difficult to support , experts said , because there is no evidence that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed or other Al Qaeda suspects formerly in CIA custody yielded intelligence on plots involving nuclear or other mass - casualty weapons .

Last year , then - President Bush listed a series of plots that he said had been thwarted during his administration .
Among them were alleged plans to blow up fuel tanks at a New York airport and airliners bound for the East Coast , and to destroy the U.S. Bank skyscraper in Los Angeles .
Al Qaeda ’s efforts to produce anthrax at laboratories in Afghanistan were derailed by the U.S. invasion in 2001 .
The terrorist network ’s plots involving illicit weapons have been unsuccessful and small in scale .
After his arrest in Chicago in 2002 , Jose Padilla was accused of plotting to detonate a radiological bomb , a device that uses a conventional explosive to spread contaminating debris .
He was ultimately convicted of aiding terrorists .
In perhaps the most advanced terrorism plot involving unconventional weapons , Kamel Bourgass was accused in 2003 of making the poison ricin in a London apartment .
Authorities found recipes but no actual ricin , however , and Bourgass was convicted of plotting “ to cause a public nuisance . ”
Advertisement
“ No matter how you slice this , it ’s very hard to get to the hundred thousand figure unless Al Qaeda had a nuclear weapon , ” Hoffman said .
“ Which they did n’t . ”
Cheney ’s transition office did not respond to a request for comment .
Obama has also made assertions in the counter - terrorism debate that are difficult to assess .
In making the case Thursday for closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility , he said that the island prison had “ likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained . ”
But “ nobody knows that for a fact , ” Schmitt said .
“ That is the reason why this is such a hard debate in some ways -- because until one actually sees the intelligence they ’re sitting on , it ’s virtually impossible to make a judgment that what either Obama or Cheney is saying is spot on . ”

Amazon 's cloud is infinitely large .
At least in theory .
But bandwidth to the cloud is not .
If you like , you could upload a full terabyte of data to that data center in the sky .
But even over a T1 connection , it would take you a good 80 days .
Amazon realizes that 's a long time , so it 's now giving you the option of sending your data via mail .
Not email - mail mail .
Over at the Amazon Web Services blog , the company has unveiled a new service it calls AWS Import / Export .
You mail in your storage device , and Amazon uploads all that data for you .
" Customers with AWS storage requirements at the terabyte and petabyte level often ask us if they can sidestep the internet and simply send us a disk drive , or even a 747 full of such drives , " writes Amazon cloud guru Jeff Barr .
" I can now say ' Yes , you can ! ' "
That would be a Boeing 747 .
At the moment , Import / Export is a limited beta .
And Amazon is only accepting drives with USB 2.0 or eSATA connectors , formatted in FAT32 , ext2 , ext3 , or NTFS .
The cloud is set to handle sub - 50 - pound drives that fit into an 8U rack - but if you ask , it may accommodate other drives .
Barr even says you can ship a SAN .
But give him a call first .
Amazon wo n't upload unreadable files or files larger than 5GB .
But it 'll send you a log file letting you know what was rejected and what was n't .
And when it 's finished , it 'll send your drive back home at no expense .
Security ?
You can encrypt your files but not your file systems .
And Amazon says it 's trustworthy : " We track custody of your device from the time it arrives in our mailroom until it is shipped back to you .
All personnel involved in the process have undergone extensive background checks . "
You can sign up for the beta here .
It 's only available in the US , but Amazon plans on expanding to Europe " in the near future . "
Currently , Import / Export does n't do exports .
But it will .
Downloading a terabyte takes just as long . ®
Sandsend in North Yorkshire is newly recommended
The number of UK beaches recommended for bathing in the new Good Beach Guide has fallen by almost a sixth owing to last year 's heavy rain and floods .
The Marine Conservation Society ( MCS ) is recommending 370 UK beaches out of 777 tested - a drop of 74 since 2008 .
This is the biggest annual fall in the guide 's 22 - year history , and the first time since 2002 that under half of UK bathing beaches are recommended .
The MCS said rain had swept pollutants like raw sewage into rivers and sea .
The latest bathing water tests were carried out between May and September 2008 , coinciding with the seventh wettest British summer on record .
We 're becoming concerned that the existing infrastructure for handling storm pollution may not be up to the job
Thomas Bell
Marine Conservation Society
Marine Conservation Society - Good Beach Guide 2009 - UK Results [ 92.6 KB ]
The number of bathing beaches which failed even the mandatory EC standards for water quality increased by almost half to 78 , up from 53 the previous year .
" Today 's results reflect last summer 's heavy rain which swept waterborne pollutants like raw sewage , petro-chemicals and farm waste into rivers and the sea , " said Thomas Bell , MCS coastal pollution officer .
" MCS is now recommending 25 % fewer beaches than three years ago and we 're becoming concerned that the existing infrastructure for handling storm pollution may not be up to the job . "
Health concerns
The MCS is calling for specific counter - pollution measures , such as investment in more sustainable urban drainage systems , new farming practices and expansion of the sewers system to handle storm water .
It says this is necessary in the face of changing weather patterns brought on by climate change .
Mr Bell warned bathers that to avoid health risks , they should pick places to swim in the sea which had a good water quality record .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I do n't want to say which is my favourite beach because it might become more popular and then it would n't have the same beauty and privacy Ali , London , UK People are advised to stay out of the water for at least 24 hours after heavy storms and report pollution problems to the MCS .
A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs said they were " aware of the effect heavy rain and flooding can have on our coastal bathing waters and are working to improve our sewerage systems " .
She said : " In April , we announced as part of the draft Flood and Water Management Bill that we will end the automatic right to connect to sewers for surface water drainage and make connection conditional upon meeting new national standards of drainage .
" This will result in less water reaching sewerage treatment works and consequently reduce the risk of flooding from overflows and pollution to our beaches . "

Arkansas Police seized nearly 500 lbs of marijuana on a tour bus returning from NBA All - Star Weekend in Phoenix , this week .
According to the driver , the bus was allegedly escorting Fabolous to Boston to pick up " a rapper whose name he could n't recall . "
Though Fab was not on the bus at the time of the seizure , the two men who were arrested , Edward Thimas , 52 , and Robert Morris , 44 , claimed that Fabolous had loaded the marijuana into the locked compartment , as well as close to $ 6,500 in cash , which the police also confiscated .
Though both men agreed that the marijuana belonged to Fabolous , according to the police reports , their stories conflicted regarding the pickup of the drug shipment .
What we can do
Do n't publish in overpriced journals .
Do n't do free work for overpriced journals ( like refereeing and editing ) .
Put your articles on the arXiv before publishing them .
Only publish in journals that let you keep your articles on the arXiv .
Support free journals by publishing in them , refereeing for them , editing them ... even starting your own !
Help make sure free journals and the arXiv stay free .
Help start a system of independent ' referee boards ' for arXiv papers .
These can referee papers and help hiring , tenure and promotion committees to assess the worth of papers , eliminating the last remaining reasons the existence of traditional for - profit journals .
The nice thing is that most of these are easy to do !
Only items 5 through 7 require serious work .
As for item 4 , a lot of journals not only let you keep your article on the arXiv , but let you submit it by telling them its arXiv number !
In math it 's easy to find these journals , because there 's a public list of them .
Of course , you should read the copyright agreement that you 'll be forced to sign before submitting to a journal or publishing a book .
Check to see if you can keep your work on the arXiv , on your own website , etcetera .
You can pretty much assume that any rights you do n't explicitly keep , your publisher will get .
Eric Weisstein did n't do this , and look what happened to him : he got sued and spent over a year in legal hell !
Luckily it 's not hard to read these copyright agreements : for math journals , you can get them off the web from the arXiv .
A more extensive list is available from Sherpa , an organization devoted to free electronic archives .
If you think maybe you want to start your own journal , or move an existing journal to a cheaper publisher , read Joan Birman 's article about this .
Go to the Create Change website and learn what other people are doing .
Also check out SPARC - the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition .
They can help .
And try the Budapest Open Access Initiative - they give out grants .
You can also support the Public Library of Science or join the Open Archives Initiative .
Also : if you like mathematics , tell your librarian about Mathematical Sciences Publishers , a nonprofit organization run by mathematicians for the purpose of publishing low - cost , high - quality math journals .
Which journals are overpriced ?
In 1997 Robion Kirby urged mathematicians not to submit papers to , nor edit for , nor referee for overpriced journals .
I think this suggestion is great , and it applies not just to mathematics but all disciplines .
There is really no reason for us to donate our work to profit - making corporations who sell it back to us at exorbitant prices !
How can you tell if a journal is overpriced ?
Up - to - date information on the rise of journal prices is available from the American Mathematical Society .
They even include an Excel spreadsheet that lets you do your own calculations with this data !
Some of this information is nicely summarized on a webpage by Ulf Rehmann .
Using these tools you can make up your own mind which journals are too expensive to be worth supporting with your free volunteer labor .
When I first learned how bad the situation was , I started by boycotting all journals published by Reed Elsevier .
This juggernaut was formed by merger of Reed Publishing and Elsevier Scientific Press in 1993 .
In August 2001 it bought Harcourt Press - which in turn owned Academic Press , which ran a journal I helped edit , Advances in Mathematics .
I do n't work for that journal anymore !
The reason is that Reed Elsevier is a particularly bad culprit when it comes to charging high prices .
You can see this from the above lists of journal prices , and you can also see it in the business news .
In 2002 , Forbes magazine wrote :
If you are not a scientist or a lawyer , you might never guess which company is one of the world 's biggest in online revenue .
Ebay will haul in only $ 1 billion this year .
Amazon has $ 3.5 billion in revenue but is still , famously , losing money .
Outperforming them both is Reed Elsevier , the London - based publishing company .
Of its $ 8 billion in likely sales this year , $ 1.5 billion will come from online delivery of data , and its operating margin on the internet is a fabulous 22 % .
Credit this accomplishment to two things .
One is that Reed primarily sells not advertising or entertainment but the dry data used by lawyers , doctors , nurses , scientists and teachers .
The other is its newfound marketing hustle : Its CEO since 1999 has been Crispin Davis , formerly a soap salesman .
But Davis will have to keep hustling to stay out of trouble .
Reed Elsevier has fat margins and high prices in a business based on information - a commodity , and one that is cheaper than ever in the internet era .
New technologies and increasingly universal access to free information make it vulnerable to attack from below .
Today pirated music downloaded from the web ravages corporate profits in the music industry .
Tomorrow could be the publishing industry 's turn .
Some customers accuse Reed Elsevier of price gouging .
Daniel DeVito , a patent lawyer with Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom , is a fan of Reed 's legal - search service , but he himself does free science searches on the Google site before paying for something like Reed 's ScienceDirect - and often finds what he 's looking for at no cost .
Reed can ill afford to rest .
Why should we slave away unpaid to keep Crispin Davis rolling in dough ?
There 's really no good reason .
More recently I have had to boycott Springer - Verlag as well .
I did this with real regret : this publisher had demonstrated a serious interest in mathematics for its own sake in years past .
But then they were bought by Bertlesmann Media World , which also owns Random House , the record company BMG , and so on ... and on February 2004 BertelsmannSpringer was bought by Cinven and Candover , who had already bought Kluwer in January 2003 .
So , they are now part of an enormous publishing conglomerate , and we can expect them to pay increasing attention to the " bottom line " .
Many Springer - published journals are already very expensive , and they will probably raise prices to the limit of what the market will bear .
I have also boycotted Birkhäuser , for similar reasons .
By now I mainly do free work for free journals and journals run by the AMS and other professional societies .
There are a lot of these , so I 'm sure I 'll still be busy .
Sneaky tricks
You think that these robots would start investing in a GPS system .
Recently , Singularity Hub covered the Tweenbot , a simple cardboard - wrapped automaton that was guided through New York City by the hands of New Yorkers .
The next step in the lost robot evolution has appeared : Autonomous City Explorer ( or ACE ) a robot that navigated the mean streets of Munich just like any tourist would : by asking directions from the natives .
ACE identified and queried people around it to point it in the right direction , and , against my most cynical expectations , it arrived safely and sound at its destination .
( Check out the video from New Scientist and the end of the post )
So what makes this lost robot so unique ?
Unlike its tween counterpart , ACE is n’t just picked up and pushed in the right direction .
The bot is roughly human sized and packed with instruments to help it detect and query humans for help .
First , there are cameras and image recognition software geared towards finding people and moving ACE towards them .
When a human is found , an audio message is played while virtual lips move on a screen .
If the human is friendly ( are n’t we all ? ) he or she uses a touch - screen to indicate it ’s willingness to give directions .
The human will then point in the direction ACE should go .
And ACE follows your finger !
That ’s really kind of cool .
By using multiple cameras and more image software , ACE is able to build a 3D model of the human and where he or she is actually pointing to .
Compared to a toddler , this is n’t a remarkable skill , but following visual cues is really difficult for most robots out there .
ACE also prompts its helper human to use the touch - screen to suggest a given path , but in the end , it can rely on just the pointing .
ACE ’s point and go navigation avoids the hassle of interpreting humanity ’s subjective audible directions .
“ It ’s over there , behind that building , then you sort of take a right and keep going for a while . ” — that ’s a message fit to make a robot pull its hair out .
ACE just has to query enough people ( 38 for its maiden voyage ) and it will build up a developing map of its surroundings .
Simple and effective , the ACE system allowed the robot to travel little more than 1 km in 5 hours .
Not a speedy journey , but very promising .
Just wait ’til your robot comes home !
While Tweenbot is definitely the cute one , and ACE is light years ahead in technology , both lost bots illustrate how humanity and robots are being taught to work together .
According to ACE ’s mandate , it seeks to develop new cognitive abilities to make robots more useful in a human - rich environment .
Likewise , Tweenbot was an experiment in humanity ’s generosity ( read here : kindness to something foreign ) .
As robots leave the factory and warehouse ( sorry KIVA ) , they will have to accommodate the needs of , and rely on the input from humans .
The ACE experiment showed that the robot - human interaction could be successful , but it was n’t very efficient .
It also demonstrated human willingness to interact with the artificial , but would this trend continue once the robot ’s novelty wore off ?
The secret is making robots more life - like ( what ’s more human than wandering around asking for directions ) and making humans more robot - aware .
Human - like robots may be destined to take a larger part in our society , but only if we decide to accept them .
Experiments like ACE and Tweenbot show that the potential exists , we just have to find it .
Luckily , we have people ( and robots ) willing to point us in the right direction .
Numerous studies have shown that depression is associated with an increased risk of heart disease , but exactly how has never been clear .
Now , researchers at Rush University Medical Center have shown that depression is linked with the accumulation of visceral fat , the kind of fat packed between internal organs at the waistline , which has long been known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes .
The study is posted online and will be published in the May issue of Psychosomatic Medicine .
" Our results suggest that central adiposity – which is commonly called belly fat – is an important pathway by which depression contributes to the risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes , " said Lynda Powell , PhD , chairperson of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Rush and the study 's principal investigator .
" In our study , depressive symptoms were clearly related to deposits of visceral fat , which is the type of fat involved in disease . "
The study included 409 middle - aged women , about half African - American and half Caucasian , who were participating in the Women in the South Side Health Project ( WISH ) in Chicago , a longitudinal study of the menopausal transition .
Depressive symptoms were assessed using a common screening test , and visceral fat measured with a CT scan .
Although waist size is often used as a proxy for the amount of visceral fat , it is an inaccurate measure because it includes subcutaneous fat , or fat deposited just beneath the skin .
The researchers found a strong correlation between depression and visceral fat , particularly among overweight and obese women .
The results were the same even when the analysis adjusted for other variables that might explain the accumulation of visceral fat , such as the level of physical activity .
The study found no association between depressive symptoms and subcutaneous fat .
The findings were the same for both black and white women .
Powell speculated that depression triggers the accumulation of visceral fat by means of certain chemical changes in the body – like the production of cortisol and inflammatory compounds – but said that more research is needed to pinpoint the exact mechanism .
Sprints Marketing department has ruined my day like a kid who did n’t get the Red Ryder B.B. gun he so wished for .
How you may ask ?
Well let me tell you …A long time ago , at a gadget convention far far away …
Palm announced and showed off the very cool looking Palm Pre .
( The phone I ’ve kind of blogged about recently ) .
Well as we grew closer to a release date I decided I really liked the phone and would love to have it .
Being the Geek that I am I could n’t wait for the release date to be announced .
Well they finally announced when it would be available , and how much and I was very happy and excited !!
While waiting for the Palm Pre release date ( still a few weeks away ) , I read some things online about it here and there , and learned more of what it would and would n’t have .
That was all fine and dandy … until I saw a sentence I could n’t believe ..
This will not work with the SERO Plans !
What is a SERO Plan you ask ?
A while back sprint had a Sprint Employee Referral Offer plan .
It was a discounted plan for friends and families of Sprint employees .
It included ALL of the following for $ 30 ( plus taxes / fees ) per month :
500 Anytime Minutes
Unlimited txt messages
Unlimited mobile data ( Web )
Unlimited mobile to mobile
Nights and weekends starting at 7pm
Standard stuff , but great price .
Unfortunately they did discontinue that offering a year or so ago , sorry .
So today I gave good ole Sprint Customer Service a call to check this and see what was going on .
After a few holds transfers and the like I was informed that the Palm Pre would not work on my SERO plan .
To get the Palm Pre I would have to sign up for one of their Everything type plans at $ 60 a month .
Twice what I currently pay .
I complained that this did n’t seem right and I got escalated up to a voice mail .
I did not leave a message and decided to check a different route to get answers .
I used their Email Us link and filled out a quick web form .
My basic question was Why and / or how could it not work on my current plan .
What was the reason that I had to upgrade to a plan that has the exact same features as my current plan , but at twice the price ?
After 4 - 5 email transactions between a support drone named Rosie , I finally got an answer to my initial question .
The first few responses I get did not specify why I had to change to a new plan , just that it was required .
Then the fun response of my plan “ is not compatible with the Palm Pre . ”
So I asked how it was not compatible and finally got the truth out of them :
The Palm Pre Palm phone is programmed to be activated with some specific plans only .
The phone is not compatible with all the plans .
Therefore , to activate Palm Pre on your phone , you need to change your plan .
Being a reader of The Consumerist , I was not happy with this answer and decided to take this up the chain to Executive Customer Service .
I called Executive Customer Service thanks to a number provided by The Consumerist and got to talk to Veronica .
After explaining the situation and spending some time on hold I found out what was going on .
The Palm Pre ( And Extinct ) on Sprint , are not allowed to be activated unless they are on certain ( higher priced ) plans .
EVEN IF I BOUGHT THE PHONE AT FACE VALUE OF $ 550 !
This decision has been made by MARKETING , and there are no plans to reverse this condition anytime in the near future I was informed .
I expressed my disapproval and how it really is n’t the best way to treat a loyal , and up to this point , Happy Customer .
She apologized , let me know there was n’t really anything we can do and the conversation came to an end .
So now thanks to Marketing at Sprint I ’m left with a choice to make .
Upgrade to a new plan and end up paying $ 360 more a year to have a cool phone
Stick with my current plan and pray and hope someday I would be able to have the phone I ’ve been wanting
Tell Sprint to fuck off and get the new iPhone like the rest of the mindless sheep later in June
I hate all three options .
For the moment I ’ll stay with Sprint , at least I ’m saving $ 200 by not buying the new phone .
Bastards .
China hits back at Japan PM 's nuclear comments
by Staff Writers
Beijing ( AFP ) May 7 , 2009
China hit back on Thursday at Japan Prime Minister Taro Aso after he said Beijing 's defence spending was not transparent and it was modernising its atomic weapons .
" China 's nuclear strategy and policy are very clear , and our advocacy of nuclear disarmament is widely recognised , " foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu told reporters .
" I wonder what aim the Japanese leader is attempting to achieve in the current situation . "
Aso made the comments on a visit to Germany on Tuesday , in a speech touching on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation , and given to AFP by Japan 's foreign ministry .
" China 's defence spending has increased by a double - digit rate year - on - year for the last 20 years consecutively , yet the content is lacking in transparency , " he said .
" In addition , China has been proceeding with the modernisation of its nuclear arms . "
His comments mirrored others made by Japan 's foreign minister at the end of April which questioned Beijing 's commitment to nuclear arms reduction and were also angrily rejected by China .
Just over a week ago , Aso ended a two - day official visit to China during which he pledged to work with Chinese leaders towards the resumption of stalled six-nation talks aimed at ending North Korea 's nuclear activities .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 17 - The government said Friday that it had asked an immigration judge to deport John Demjanjuk , a Ukrainian immigrant and retired autoworker who is accused of working as a guard at several Nazi camps .
Mr. Demjanjuk , who was once thought to be the sadistic Nazi death camp guard known as Ivan the Terrible , has been found guilty of lying to gain entry to the United States .
In April , a federal appeals court affirmed a lower court decision revoking his American citizenship on multiple grounds , including his " willing " service in a unit " dedicated to exploiting and exterminating " Jewish civilians in Nazi- occupied Poland .
A document filed Friday by the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security seeks Mr. Demjanjuk 's deportation for his participation in Nazi - sponsored persecution while serving as an armed SS guard and because he lied about his wartime job and residences when he applied for an immigration visa in 1952 .
It was not clear where he might be sent .
The United States accused Mr. Demjanjuk in 1977 of being Ivan the Terrible at the Treblinka death camp .
Extradited to Israel , he was tried and sentenced to death .
But subsequent evidence from the former Soviet Union undermined eyewitness testimony , and Israel 's supreme court freed him in 1993 .
Kunsten å koke et egg
Egg har en spesiell plass i vårt kosthold .
Men vet du egentlig hvor lang koketid du trenger for å få egget akkurat slik du vil ha det ?
Har du ikke alltid ønsket deg et verktøy for å hjelpe deg å beregne akkurat dette ?
Det er det du finner her : Vår egg - koketid - kalkulator .
Velg størrelse på egget .
Ønsker du hard eller bløt plomme ?
Tar du egget rett ut fra kjøleskapet eller lar du det ligge på kjøkkenbenken ?
Hvilken høyde over havet befinner du deg på ?
Alt dette taes med i beregningen .
Mens du venter på at egget skal koke , kan du lese om hva som ligger bak alt dette lenger nede på siden .
Vel bekomme !
Skal du forstå kunsten å koke et egg må du forstå hvordan egget er bygd opp .
Eggehviten utgjør den største delen av eggets vekt , omtrent 2/3 .
Eggehviten endrer karakter over tid .
Hviten til et friskt egg er tåkete fordi den inneholder karbondioksid .
Denne forsvinner etter hvert ut og hviten blir med det klarere med også mer tyntflytende .
Dette er viktig for hvordan du koker egget , for mens friske eggehviter koagulerer ( stivne og bli hvitt ) i temperatur - området 62 - 65 ºC så vil eldre egg koagulere ved lavere temperatur .
Så det tar litt mer tid å koke et ferskt egg !
Plommen utgjør omtrent 1/3 av eggets vekt .
Denne inneholder alt fettet i egget , halvparten av proteinene og i tillegg vitamin A , D og E. Plommen koagulerer ved noe høyere temperaturer enn hviten , typisk fra 65 til 70 ºC .
Da ser vi med en gang problemet .
Den ytre hviten koagulerer ved lavere temperatur enn den indre plommen og koker du egget så får du jo nødvendigvis en temperaturgradient som er motsatt .
For at gulen skal være ved 70 ºC må hviten være enda varmere og det har konsekvenser for smak og konsistens .
Mange vil si at koketiden for et bløtkokt egg er 3 - 6 minutter , og 8 - 10 minutter for et hardkokt egg .
Vil du ha halvbløt plomme koker du dermed egget i 6 - 8 minutter .
Dette holder for de aller fleste av oss , men det kan gjøres bedre for her har du ikke tatt hensyn til eggets størrelse .
Vanligvis tar man egget direkte ut av kjøleskapet , men hva om egget er romtemperert før du putter det i vannet .
Det har vel også en effekt på koketiden ?
Dessuten ; skal du putte egget i kaldt vann eller kokende vann og når starter du klokka ?
Skal tiden beregnes fra når du skrur på plata , eller fra når vannet begynner å koke ?
Og til sist , har mengden vann noe å si ?
Svaret på det siste spørsmålet er nei .
Dette fordi vi forutsetter at mengden vann i kjelen er så stor at vanntemperaturen ikke synker når egget legges i .
Men de andre faktorene er reelle nok og det finnes faktisk en formel som gir deg den riktige koketid og hvor alle størrelsene vi har vurdert over går inn .
Koketiden avhenger av eggets omkrets , temperaturen på egget i utgangspunktet , hvilken type plomme du ønsker deg og temperaturen i vannet ( avhenger av høyde over havet ) .
Bløtkokte egg tilsvarer plommetemperatur på 65 ºC , hardkokte tilsvarer 85 ºC .
Og så kan du jo velge deg alle avskygninger mellom disse to ytterlighetene .
Formelen er
Tid i minutter .
Eggets omkrets , c , er oppgitt i cm .
Her kan du finne ut hvordan du skaffer deg et passe kokt egg på Galdhøpiggen .
Er du til fjells så koker jo vannet ved lavere temperatur enn ved havets overflate , og dermed tar det lengre tid .
Formelen virker bare dersom du putter egget rett i det kokende vannet .
Putter du egget direkte i kaldt vann og så slår på plata blir det vanskelig å koke egget med den presisjon som skal til for at egget blir som ønsket .
Når koketiden er ute bør egget avkjøles med en gang , for å stoppe videre koagulering .
Fyll hele kjelen med kaldt vann , f.eks .
Da er det bare en ting som gjenstår .
Du må unngå at egget sprekker .
Det dummeste du kan gjøre er å slippe egget i kokene vann uten videre .
Det er en luftlomme i den butte enden av egget og denne luften må få tid til å forsvinne ut gjennom porene i eggeskallet .
Slipper du egget i kokende vann utvider hviten og plommen seg fortere enn luften kan flykte og dermed bør du lage et lite hull i den butte enden før du koker egget .
Det er også fornuftig å sette til salt eller eddik til vannet .
Dette gjør at hviten koagulerer fortere dersom det dannes en sprekk i skallet med tilhørende lekkasje .
Men selv når du lager et hull , får du ofte problemer .
Poenget her er jo at du svekker skallet når du lager hullet .
En bedre løsning er å først dyppe eggets butte ende i lunka / varmt vann og så legge det direkte i kokende vann .
Da presses lufta ut i to omganger og det reduserer sannsynligheten for sprekker betydelig .
Koketemperaturen varierer med høyde over havet , men selv hjemme på kjøkkenet kan du velge vannets temperatur - vi er så vant med at vannet må koke , men du må ikke bruke kokende vann .
Egentlig er det lurere ikke å koke vannet for det gjør hviten så altfor varm .
I kokende vann vil ytterdelen av hviten være nær 100 ºC og da blir hviten alt for seig .
Løsningen er enkel ; det beste er å " koke " egget uten å koke det .
Hvordan gjør du det ?
Du kan varme vannet til 80 ºC og så sette det i stekeovnen som på forhånd er varmet til den samme temperaturen .
Dersom vannet holder 80 ºC får hviten en helt annen konsistens , men da fungerer ikke kokeformelen dessverre .
Du kan faktisk nøye deg med vann som holder 64 - 65 º C .
Men det tar fort litt tid… .
Prøv deg fram ( tips du trenger nok minst 10 timer ) .
Det fine er at det ikke er så farlig om du glemmer tiden .
Lar du egget stå i et døgn har det fortsatt den samme konsistensen .
Og er du god med temperaturreguleringen så kan du faktisk lage et egg med ganske så bløt hvite og hard plomme .
Dette fordi et av de viktigste proteinene i eggehviten ikke koagulerer før omtrent ved 80 ºC .

Maturfag / Erik Fooladi , som forteller deg om : " Påskeegg til frokosten "
This prank is almost six years old , but we just heard about it and had to share it :
In 2002 , Dylan Reiff and Joe Korsmo began tracking the internet activities of Kolin , aka V. Gnome , an 18 - year old computer gamer .
They monitored and recorded Kolin ’s AOL instant messages and gathered information about his friends and family from other sources on the net .
Blending this data with scenarios from videogames and sci-fi films , they developed a mythology in which Kolin is “ singled out as the savior of the human race . ”
The story is told in Gem Missile : A Tribute to V. Gnome , a 40 - page book that incorporates photographs of Kolin and excerpts from his personal correspondence .
In August 2003 , Reiff and Korsmo showed up on Kolin ’s parent ’s doorstep in Chicago .
Reiff introduced himself as “ Z. Figiam , ” Kolin ’s “ mentor from the future , ” presented him with the book , and left without further explanation .
The plot thickened several days later with Kolin posted a detailed description of the encounter to an on - line gaming forum , along with digital photos of every page in the book .
Members of the forum quickly added their own theories and responses , which ranged from close readings of the text and speculations about the gender of its authors , to admissions of jealousy and accusations that Kolin had invented the story in order to get a high rating for his thread ( which in a few weeks had received over 40,000 hits ) .
A year passed after this initial contact .
In August 2004 , Reiff and Korsmo mailed Kolin a package containing a photograph of their meeting a year earlier , along with a note , a certificate , and a plane ticket to Minneapolis .
Kolin was met at the airport by a man in a beat up Lincoln Town Car who identified himself as “ The Gatekeeper . ”
For two days , Kolin was lead around the city in search of robots , buried treasure and information needed to save the future .
Reiff and Korsmo involved numerous actors and another on - line gamer who , equally baffled , was driven with Kolin to a forest and abandoned there .
At some point , Kolin noticed that his new friend had mysteriously disappeared .
“ I stood there alone in the woods , in Minnesota , with a shovel and a large black locked box , more confused then I have ever been in my life . ”
Kolin survived the trip and posted a detailed account of his adventure , concluding , “ it was a great experience , and I would not hesitate to save the future again , if the chance ever arose . ”

Bones found at a former hospital in Worcestershire show evidence of early amputations and other medical research , say archaeologists .
County council archaeologists were called in after workers building the new city university campus found about 200 bone pieces in a pit at the former Worcester Royal Infirmary site .
The old hospital is being demolished to make way for a new campus Simon Sworn , archaeologist and project officer , said many of the 19th Century bones had been deliberately cut and were " evidence of amputations in their infancy " .
The British Medical Research Association ( BMA ) was founded in the hospital in 1832 and Mr Sworn believes the bones from dead prisoners were among those used for research after this became legal practice .
Mr Sworn said the bones were a rare find .
" It 's a very fascinating and important find and appears to show a great deal about early medical practice , " he said .
Worcestershire County Council said its archaeologists were immediately called in after the discovery to " make sure the remains were treated appropriately " .
Dead prisoners
The bones , which were removed under a Home Office licence , are being stored and preserved at the council offices and will be sent to a specialist who is expected to report on their significance .
" The remains are likely to be studied by experts in the history of surgery before reburial , " a county council spokeswoman said .
Workers found letters and invitations to nurses at the site Worcester University said work at the site had also revealed the entrance to a tunnel linking the infirmary with the old city gaol .
Mr Sworn said an Act of Parliament in the mid-19th Century permitted research on dead prisoners , so bones of former inmates could be among those found .
" It could be criminals or it could be poor people who could not be identified and had no family , " he said .
Mr Sworn said the bones were from many individuals and included arm and leg bones and fragments of skull and vertebrae .
" They do indicate early anatomical investigations , when people were first dissecting human remains , " he said .
' Saw marks '
" There 's evidence of research into varying diseases , such as syphilis , which was widespread at the time .
There are bones that have been cut into where the disease had taken hold . "
He said the bones could be linked to the work of Sir Charles Hastings , a medical surgeon and founder of the BMA .
About 200 bone pieces have been found .
( c ) University of Worcester Mr Sworn added there were also animal bones , including those of pigs , found in the pit .
" Some have several saw marks , as if the students had practiced amputations on the animals ' bones first , " he said .
The bones include a hip joint punctured by a nail which Mr Sworn said could be evidence of an early hip replacement operation .
Worcester University said discoveries " charting more than 1,700 years " had been found at the site since last year , including Roman pottery and 1940s dance invitations to nurses .
" The university is keen to ensure the history of this important part of the City is fully recorded and has been working closely with the county council 's archaeologists , " a spokeswoman said .
Its new £ 100 m city campus was " progressing well " and two new halls of residence were set to open in September , she added .

What ’s that old saying about throwing stones and glass houses ?
It sure comes to mind today .
And it relates to President Clinton and two Republicans who just admitted they cheated on their wives .
The Charleston Post and Courier reports that Mark Sanford , as a congressman , called on Clinton to resign when his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky was revealed .
Sanford is now Gov. Sanford .
And , as just about everyone knows by now , he confessed today that he had an affair with a “ dear , dear friend ” in Argentina .
But back in 1998 , according to the Post and Courier , he said of Clinton , “ Very damaging stuff .
This one ’s pretty cut and dried . ”
Calling the overall situation messy , he added : “ I think it would be much better for the country and for him personally [ to resign ] . "
John Ensign had similar thoughts back then .
Ensign is now Nevada ’s junior senator .
As the Ticket reported , Ensign 's popularity slumped after he admitted that he had an affair with a former staffer .
In 1998 he served in Congress and had this to say to the Las Vegas Review - Journal : " The honorable thing for him to do is to resign and not put the country through this . "
No word from Sanford or Ensign on whether either man plans to resign .

Di Montezemolo says Fota have agreed on a common viewpoint for FIA talks
By Andrew Benson
BBC Sport in Monaco
Formula 1's teams and the sport 's governing body , the FIA , say they have made " small progress " in talks over the controversial £ 40 m budget cap .
Team bosses met with Max Mosley on Friday having earlier united in their opposition to the cap proposed for 2010 by the FIA president .
The teams said they may pull out of F1 altogether if the row is not resolved .
But discussions will now continue on Saturday in Monaco after a meeting that Mosley described as " constructive " .
Mosley , who says a budget cap is necessary to safeguard the future of the sport in the global financial crisis , said he felt optimistic following the meeting .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" We had a good constructive meeting and there are on - going discussions , " he told BBC Sport .
" We spent three hours in there .
Everybody knows what the issues are .
" I 'm always confident there will be an agreement . "
While no agreement was reached between the two parties on Friday , the F1 teams ' umbrella group , Formula One Teams ' Association ( Fota ) , was successful in agreeing a common position from which to negotiate with Mosley .
Mosley argues that without dramatic cost reductions , smaller teams wishing to enter F1 will not be able to afford it and that , additionally , big road - manufacturers may be forced to pull out of the sport .
But Ferrari , the longest - running team in F1 , had threatened to quit anyway - along with Toyota , Red Bull and Renault - if the regulation changes were enforced in 2010 as planned .
And all 10 teams now say they want a compromise on the budget cap plans .
" We had a very long , productive meeting , " said Fota chairman and Ferrari president , Luca di Montezemelo .
Fota is now an organisation with a common view ... we want Formula 1 , we do n't want something different
Fota chairman Luca Di Montezemolo
" Fota will have another meeting tomorrow [ Saturday ] , to discuss , and then we will meet Mosley again . "
After meeting earlier on Friday ahead of their latest discussions with Mosley , Fota had said all teams could collectively leave F1 if the row is not resolved satisfactorily .
" We will not enter with these rules and with this governance , " said di Montezemolo .
" Fota is now an organisation with a common view .
" We have to discuss about the possibility to change the situation in a constructive way , but in a very clear way , because we want Formula 1 - we do n't want something different . "
Though all teams are agreed on the need to cut costs , Ferrari have made it known in recent weeks that they are implacably opposed to the proposed £ 40 m budget cap .
F1 MOLE BLOG Super - rich Monaco might not be the obvious place for a revolution but there is unrest in the air in the Principality ...
On Wednesday , their appeal to stop the FIA introducing rules that limit team spending was dismissed by a French court in Paris .
It has also emerged in the last week that Ferrari and the FIA had signed an agreement four years ago that gave the Italian team the right of veto over the sport 's rules .
Ferrari say Mosley 's rule changes contravene that agreement , an argument which the FIA president disputes .
Meanwhile , F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone had this week in Monaco threatened to take legal action against Ferrari if they go through with their threat to quit at the end of the season .
He says that would be in contravention of a contract that commits them to F1 until 2012 .

When I first announced tinyrb there was no Float , no Module , no Proc or Bloc , no Array , Hash , IO , Range , Metaclass .
Frankly it was not really Ruby .
But now , most of those are in , except Float and IO , and Proc is halfway there ( see proc branch ) .
Lets just say that it ’s running a lot more code .
New Grammar
The first big problem I hit was the parser , initially written in Ragel and Lemon it was not flexible enough .
I since rewrote it using peg / leg .
I ’m having some trouble with {...} because of the ambiguity between Hash and blocks .
But other then that , it works like magic .
The downside of using a PEG parser is poor error reporting and less secure as it is prone to infinite recursion .
The later might become a problem , but maybe it ’s just a bug in peg /leg .
Upvals , Cheap Proc
One of the problems with most Ruby implementation is that using a Proc might end up costing more memory that you think .
The reason is that a part of the stack frame ( or another structure where local variables are stored ) must be saved to allow you to access local variables from the outer scope later inside your Proc .
def add ( x ) proc { | y | x + y } end add2 = add ( 3 ) add2 . call ( 4 ) # => 7
You see , the context of add must be saved because we access the local variable x that is defined outside of the Proc .
If you create lots of Procs , that might become a problem and it ’s not very “ tiny ” .
Once again , the solution can be found inside Lua .
And it is named upval !
An upval ( or upvalue ) is a local variable from an outer scope , like x from inside the Proc in the previous example .
I ’ll spare you the implementation details but it has 2 advantages .
First , accessing an upval only requires dereferencing a pointer .
As compared to other VMs that save the full stack frame .
They need to browse the frames array to find where the local variable is defined each time .
( Let me know if I ’m wrong , but I ’ve checked Rubinius ( push_local_depth instruction ) and YARV ( getdynamic instruction ) source ) .
Second , when the enclosing scope of a Proc goes out of scope , for example when we leave the add method in the previous example , we just copy the value of the local inside the upval .
value will point to closed in the TrUpval struct .
No need to copy and save a bunch of frames , just update a pointer .
typedef struct { OBJ * value ; /* points to a local or closed */ OBJ closed ; /* value when closed */ } TrUpval ;
Please note this is not fully implemented yet , I ’m working on the “ closing ” of upvalues at the moment .
Compact bytecode
Another thing I ported from Lua is the way it stores local variables on the stack .
For the VM , it means local variables are no different then any other values you pass around ( return values , arguments , etc ) .
The advantage of this approach is that it makes the bytecode a lot smaller when using local variables .
This is only possible in register based VM like Lua , tinyrb and Parrot .
For tinyrb ’s VM , local variables are just named registers .
So the code a = b = 1 is compiled to the following .
; block definition : 0xc2f00 ( level 0 ) ; 1 registers ; 0 nested blocks ; 0 args .local b ; 0 .local a ; 1 .value 1 ; 0 [ 000 ] loadk 0 0 0 ; b = 1 [ 001 ] move 1 0 0 ; a = b [ 002 ] return 0 0 0 ; block end
In YARV , it requires twice more instructions .
0002 putobject 1 0004 dup 0005 setlocal b 0007 dup 0008 setlocal a 0010 leave
Well , that does n’t mean tinyrb is faster , but it needs to run half the code as the other Ruby VMs to do the same thing with local variables .
Also , the code takes half the space in memory too of course .
So we ’re on the right track .
FFI
Wayne Meissner , the creator of the FFI gem and FFI stuff inside JRuby , has been working on FFI integration .
This is probably the most exciting things you can use tinyrb for at the moment .
Wayne also started implementing some more corelibs in Ruby using FFI .
I hope to use this to implement more of tinyrb in Ruby .
Garbage Collector
I ’ve been using the Boehm GC as a way to move development faster .
I think it ’s more important to get some core features in first .
And I was n’t sure which type of GC would fit tinyrb best .
But being “ tiny ” code wise and memory wise , refcount seems the best match .
While refcount is often viewed as a poor solution , it ’s the most efficient one in terms of memory consumption as far as I know .
As soon as an object is no longer used , it is freed from memory .
Oppositely , VMs using mark and sweep algorithms must allocate a large quantity of memory up front and generally can’t give it back to the OS .
Hopefully for me , some people mentioned on the IRC channel they ’ll be working on a GC for tinyrb as part of their master thesis .
I hope this works !
That Was A Lot of Text
At first , I was n’t sure about the focus of the project .
It was just a learning experience .
But now I think there ’s a need for a small and efficient Ruby VM that use very little memory .
Expect to see more development in those directions .
“ I HAD made it clear to my family that I would not accept an arranged marriage , ” said Tabish Rizvi , who grew up in New Jersey and whose parents come from India .
He said he had been too influenced by the romantic relationships of those around him and in American pop culture to go for that .
So early on in his relationship with Dr. Maliha Ahmad , when he suggested that they “ take a break , ” it was more than a little ironic that he came to see Maliha and himself in the uncomfortable mold of the Rachel and Ross characters from the “ Friends ” television show .
Dr. Ahmad , 29 , and Mr. Rizvi , 33 , met at a gambling - themed New Year ’s Eve party ushering in 2006 .
In the New York apartment where the event was held , Mr. Rizvi had temporarily been drafted to run a blackjack table as Dr. Ahmad , then a medical resident , laid down a bet using the fake money provided to partygoers .
Seeing her for the first time , Mr. Rizvi , recalled being dumbstruck by Dr. Ahmad .
“ I ’m a relatively confident fellow , ” he said , adding that he did n’t want to sound foolish .
Mr. Rizvi , now a senior manager in New York with FTI Consulting , a bankruptcy and restructuring consulting firm , recalled how he mulled over a clever introduction , but that his hosts relieved him of his table duty .
He would have the rest of the night to consider his words .
Marriage equality in Iowa ?
Folks , maybe it ’s time give Iowa a try .
I ’m reminded of the clip from Music Man below …
[ pro - player width = ” 426 ″ height = ” 218 ″ ]

I guess they are not so stubborn after all .
From the DesMoines Register …
Today ’s decision makes Iowa the first Midwestern state , and the third in the country , to allow same - sex marriages .
Lambda Legal , a gay rights group , financed the court battle and represented six couples who challenged Iowa ’s 10 - year - old ban on gay marriage .
Supreme Court Justice Mark Cady , who wrote the unanimous decision , at one point invoked the court ’s first - ever decision , in 1839 , which struck down slavery laws 17 years before the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of a slave owner to treat a person as property .
Iowa ’s gay marriage ban “ is unconstitutional , because the county has been unable to identify a constitutionally adequate justification for excluding plaintiffs from the institution of civil marriage , ” Cady wrote in the 69 - page opinion that seemed to dismiss the concept of civil unions as an option for gay couples .
The ruling also addresses the religious concerns of those against gay marriage …
“ Our constitution does not permit any branch of government to resolve these types of religious debates and entrusts to courts the task of ensuring that government avoids them , ” the opinion says .
The ruling explicitly does not affect “ the freedom of a religious organization to define marriage it solemnizes as unions between a man and a woman , ” the justices stressed .
It ’s a great day to be from I - o - wa !

- Il 14 maggioha rivolto al presidente del consiglio dieci domande che apparivano necessarie dinanzi alle incoerenze di un " caso politico " .
Veronica Lario , infatti , ha proposto all ' opinione pubblica e alle élites dirigenti del Paese due affermazioni e una domanda che hanno rimosso dal discreto perimetro privato un " affare di famiglia " per farne " affare pubblico " .
Le due , allarmanti certezze della moglie del premier - lo ricordiamo - descrivono i comportamenti del presidente del Consiglio : " Mio marito frequenta minorenni " ; " Mio marito non sta bene " .
Al contrario , la domanda posta dalla signora Lario - se ne può convenire - è crudamente politica e mostra le pratiche del " potere " di Silvio Berlusconi , pericolosamente degradate quando a rappresentare la sovranità popolare vengono chiamate " veline " senza altro merito che un bell ' aspetto e l'amicizia con il premier , legami nati non si sa quando , non si sa come .
" Ciarpame politico " dice la moglie del premier .
Silvio Berlusconi non ha ritenuto di rispondere ad alcuna delle domande diE , dopo dieci giorni , Rprova qui a offrire qualche traccia e testimonianza per risolvere almeno alcuni dei quesiti proposti .
Per farlo bisogna raggiungere Napoli , una piccola fabbrica di corso San Giovanni e poi un appartamento , allegramente affollato di amici , nel popolare quartiere del Vasto a ridosso dei grattacieli del Centro Direzionale .
Sono i luoghi di vita e di lavoro di Gino Flaminio .
Gino , 22 anni , operaio , una passione per la kickboxing , è stato per sedici mesi ( dal 28 agosto del 2007 al 10 gennaio del 2009 ) l'" amore " di Noemi Letizia , la minorenne di cui il premier ha voluto festeggiare il diciottesimo anno in un ristorante di Casoria , il 26 aprile .
Gino e Noemi si sono divisi , per quel breve , intenso , felice periodo le ore , i sogni , il fiato , le promesse .
" Quando non dormivo da lei a Portici - è capitato una ventina di volte - o quando lei non dormiva qui da me , il sabato che non lavoravo mi tiravo su alle sei del mattino per portarle la colazione a letto ; poi l'accompagnavo a scuola e ci tornavo poi per riportarla indietro con la mia Yamaha .
Lei qualche volta veniva a prendermi in fabbrica , la sera , quando poteva " .
Gino Flaminio è in grado di dire quando e come Silvio Berlusconi è entrato nella vita di Noemi .
Come quel " miracolo " ( così Gino definisce l'inatteso irrompere del premier ) ha cambiato - di Noemi - la vita , i desideri , le ambizioni e più tangibilmente anche il corpo , il volto , le labbra , gli zigomi ; in una parola , dice Gino , " i valori " .
Il ragazzo può raccontare come quell ' ospite inaspettato dal nome così importante che faceva paura anche soltanto a pronunciarlo nel piccolo mondo di gente che duramente si fatica la giornata e un piatto caldo , ha deviato anche la sua di vita .
Quieto come chi si è ormai pacificato con quanto è avvenuto , Gino ricorda : " Mi è stato quasi subito chiaro che tra me e la mia memi non poteva andare avanti .
Era come pretendere che Britney Spears stesse con il macellaio giù all ' angolo ... " .
È utile ricordare , a questo punto , che il primo degli enigmi del " caso politico " è proprio questo : come Berlusconi ha conosciuto Noemi , la sua famiglia , il padre Benedetto " Elio " Letizia , la madre Anna Palumbo ?
A Berlusconi è capitato di essere inequivocabile con la( 4 maggio ) : " Io sono amico del padre , punto e basta .
Lo giuro ! " .
Con ( 6 maggio ) , il capo del governo è stato ancora più definitivo .
Ricordando l'antica amicizia di natura politica con il padre Elio , Berlusconi chiarisce : " Ho avuto l'occasione di conoscere [ Noemi ] tramite i suoi genitori .
Questo è tutto " .
Un affetto che il presidente del consiglio ha ripetuto ancor più recentemente quando ha presentato Noemi " in società " , per così dire , durante la cena che il governo ha offerto alle " grandi firme " del made in Italy a Villa Madama , il 19 novembre 2008 : " È la figlia di miei cari amici di Napoli , è qui a Roma per uno stage " ( Repubblica , 21 maggio ) .
All 'antico vincolo politico , accenna anche la madre di Noemi , Anna : " [ Berlusconi ] ha conosciuto mio marito ai tempi del partito socialista " .
Berlusconi , qualche giorno dopo ( e prima di essere smentito da Bobo Craxi ) , conferma .
" [ Elio ] lo conosco da anni , è un vecchio socialista ed era l'autista di Craxi " . ( , 29 aprile , ore 16,34 ) .
Più evasiva Noemi : " [ Di come è nato il contatto familiare ] non ricordo i particolari , queste cose ai miei genitori non le ho chieste " . ( , 29 aprile ) .
Decisamente inafferrabile e chiuso come un riccio , il padre Elio ( ha rifiutato di prendere visione di quest ' ultima ricostruzione di ) .
Chiedono a Letizia : ci spiega come ha conosciuto Berlusconi ?
" Non ho alcuna intenzione di farlo " ( , 13 maggio ) .
Gino ascolta questa noiosa tiritera con un sorriso storto sulle labbra , che non si sa se definire avvilito o sardonico .
C'è un attimo di silenzio nella stanza al Vasto , un silenzio lungo , pesante come d'ovatta , rispettato dagli amici che gli stanno accanto ; dalla sorella Arianna ; dal padre Antonio ; dalla madre Anna .
È un silenzio che si fa opprimente in quella cucina , fino a un attimo prima rumorosa di risate e grida .
La madre , Anna , si incarica di spezzarlo : " Quando un giorno Gino tornò a casa e mi disse che Noemi aveva conosciuto Berlusconi , lo presi in giro , non volli chiedergli nemmeno perché e per come .
Mi sembrava ridicolo .
Berlusconi dalle nostre parti ?
E che ci faceva , Berlusconi qui ?
Ripetevo a Gino : Berlusconi , Berlusconi ! ( gonfia le guance con sarcasmo ) .
Un po ' ne ridevo , mi sembrava una buffonata di ragazzi " .
Gino la guarda , l'ascolta paziente e finalmente si decide a raccontare : " I genitori di Noemi non c'entrano niente .
Il legame era proprio con lei .
È nato tra Berlusconi e Noemi .
Mai Noemi mi ha detto che lui , papi Silvio parlava di politica con suo padre , Elio .
Non mi risulta proprio .
Mai , assolutamente .
Vi dico come è cominciata questa storia e dovete sapere che almeno per l'inizio - perché poi quattro , cinque volte ho ascoltato anch 'io le telefonate - vi dirò quel che mi ha raccontato Noemi .
Il rapporto tra Noemi e il presidente comincia più o meno intorno all ' ottobre 2008 .
Noemi mi ha raccontato di aver fatto alcune foto per un " book " di moda .
Lo aveva consegnato a un'agenzia romana , importante - no , il nome non me lo ricordo - di quelle che fanno lavorare le modelle , le ballerine , insomma le agenzie a cui si devono rivolgere le ragazze che vogliono fare spettacolo .
Noemi mi dice che , in quell ' agenzia di Roma , va Emilio Fede e si porta via questi " book " , mica soltanto quello di Noemi .
Non lo so , forse gli servono per i casting delle meteorine .
Il fatto è - ripeto , è quello che mi dice Noemi - che , proprio quel giorno , Emilio Fede è a pranzo o a cena - non me lo ricordo - da Berlusconi .
Finisce che Fede dimentica quelle foto sul tavolo del presidente .
È così che Berlusconi chiama Noemi .
Quattro , cinque mesi dopo che il " book " era nelle mani dell ' agenzia , dice Noemi .
È stato un miracolo , dico sempre .
Dunque , dice Noemi che Berlusconi la chiama al telefono .
Proprio lui , direttamente .
Nessuna segretaria .
Nessun centralino .
Lui , direttamente .
Era pomeriggio , le cinque o le sei del pomeriggio , Noemi stava studiando .
Berlusconi le dice che ha visto le foto ; le dice che è stato colpito dal suo " viso angelico " , dalla sua " purezza " ; le dice che deve conservarsi così com'è , " pura " .
Questa fu la prima telefonata , io non c'ero e vi sto dicendo quel che poi mi rifer ì
Noemi , ma le credo .
Le cose andarono così perché in altre occasioni io c'ero e Noemi , così per gioco o per convincermi che davvero parlava con Berlusconi , m'allungava il cellulare all ' orecchio e anch 'io sentii dalla sua voce quella cosa della " purezza " , della " faccia d'angelo " .
E poi , una volta , ha aggiunto un ' altra cosa del tipo : " Sei una ragazza divina " .
Berlusconi , all ' inizio , non ha detto a Noemi chi era .
In quella prima telefonata , le ha fatto tante domande : quanti anni hai , cosa ti piacerebbe fare , che cosa fanno tua madre e tuo padre ?
Studi ?
Che scuola fai ?
Una lunga telefonata .
Ma normale , tranquilla .
E poi , quando Noemi si è decisa a chiedergli : " Scusi , ma con tutte queste domande , lei chi è ? " , lui prima le ha risposto : " Se te lo dico , non ci credi " .
E poi : " Ma non si sente chi sono ? " .
Quando Noemi me lo raccontò , vi dico la verità , io non ci credevo .
Poi , quando ho sentito le altre telefonate e ho potuto ascoltare la sua voce , proprio la sua , di Berlusconi , come potevo non crederci ?
Noemi mi diceva che era sempre il presidente a chiamarla .
Poi , non so se chiamava anche di suo , non me lo diceva e io non lo so .
Lei al telefono lo chiamava papi tranquillamente .
Anche davanti a me .
Magari stavamo insieme , Noemi rispondeva , diceva papi e io capivo che si trattava del presidente .
Quando ho assistito ad alcune telefonate tra Berlusconi e Noemi , ho pensato che fosse un rapporto come tra padre e figlia .
Una sera , Emilio Fede e Berlusconi - insieme - hanno chiamato Noemi .
Lo so perché ero accanto a lei , in auto .
Ora non saprei dire perché il presidente le ha passato Emilio Fede , non lo so .
Pensai che Fede dovesse preparare dei " provini " per le meteorine , quelle robe lì " .
( Ieri , a tarda sera , durante , Fede ha affermato di aver conosciuto la nonna di Noemi .ha chiesto a Gino se , in qualche occasione , Noemi avesse fatto cenno a questa circostanza .
" Mai , assolutamente " , è stata la risposta del ragazzo ) .
" Comunque , quella sera , sentii prima la voce del presidente e poi quella di Emilio Fede - continua Gino - Non voglio essere frainteso o creare confusione in questa tarantella , da cui voglio star lontano .
Nelle telefonate che ho sentito io , Berlusconi aveva con Noemi un atteggiamento paterno .
Le chiedeva come era andata a scuola , se studiava con impegno , questa roba qui .
Io però ho cominciato a fuggire da questa situazione .
Non mi piaceva .
Non mi piaceva più tutto l'andazzo .
Non vedevo più le cose alla luce del giorno , come piacevano a me .
Mi sentivo il macellaio giù all ' angolo che si era fidanzato con Britney Spears .
Come potevo pensare di farcela ?
Gliel 'ho detto a Noemi : questo mondo non mi piace , non credo che da quelle parti ci sia una grande pulizia o rispetto .
Mi dispiaceva dirglielo perché io so che Noemi è una ragazza sana , ancora infantile che non si separa mai dal suo orsacchiotto , piccolo , blu , con una croce al collo , " il suo teddy " .
Una ragazza tranquilla , semplice , con dei valori .
Con i miei stessi valori , almeno fino a un certo punto della nostra storia " .
Intorno a Gino , questo racconto devono averlo già sentito più d'una volta perché ora che il ragazzo ha deciso di raccontare a degli estranei la storia , la tensione è caduta come se la famiglia , i vicini di casa , gli amici già l'avessero sentita in altre occasioni o magari a spizzichi e bocconi .
C'è chi si distrae , chi parlotta d'altro , chi parla al telefono , chi si prepara a uscire per il venerdì notte .
Gino sembra non accorgersene .
Non perde il filo e a tratti pare ricordare , ancora una volta , a se stesso come sono andate le cose .
" Ho cominciato a distaccarmi da Noemi già a dicembre .
Però la cosa che proprio non ho mandato giù è stata la lunga vacanza di Capodanno in Sardegna , nella villa di lui .
Noemi me lo disse a dicembre che papi l'aveva invitata là .
Mi disse : " Posso portare un'amica , un'amica qualunque , non gli importa .
Ci saranno altre ragazze " .
E lei si è portata Roberta .
E poi è rimasta con Roberta per tutto il periodo .
Io le ho fatto capire che non mi faceva piacere , ma lei da quell ' orecchio non ci sentiva .
Così è partita verso il 26 - 27 dicembre ed è ritornata verso il 4 - 5 gennaio .
Quando è tornata mi ha raccontato tante cose .
Che Berlusconi l'aveva trattata bene , a lei e alle amiche .
Hanno scherzato , hanno riso ... C'erano tante ragazze .
Tra trenta e quaranta .
Le ragazze alloggiavano in questi bungalow che stavano nel parco .
E nel bungalow di Noemi erano in quattro : oltre a lei e a Roberta , c'erano le " gemelline " , ma voi sapete chi sono queste " gemelline " ?
Penso anche che lei mi abbia detto tante bugie .
Lei dice che Berlusconi era stato con loro solo la notte di Capodanno .
Vi dico la verità , io non ci credo .
Sono successe cose troppo strane .
Io chiamavo Noemi sul cellulare e non mi rispondeva mai .
Provavo e riprovavo , poi alla fine mi arrendevo e chiamavo Roberta , la sua amica , e diventavo pazzo quando Roberta mi diceva : no , non te la posso passare , è di là - di là dove ?
- o sta mangiando : e allora ? , dicevo io , ma non c'era risposta .
Per quella vacanza di fine anno , i genitori accompagnarono Noemi a Roma .
Noemi e Roberta si fermarono prima in una villa lì , come mi dissero poi , e fecero in tempo a vedere davanti a quella villa tanta gente - giornalisti , fotografi ? - , poi le misero sull ' aereo privato del presidente insieme alle altre ragazze , per quello che mi ha detto Noemi ...
Al ritorno , Noemi non è stata più la mia Noemi , la mia alicella ( acciuga , ) , la ragazza semplice che amavo , la ragazza che non si vergognava di venirmi a prendere alla sera al capannone .
A gennaio ci siamo lasciati .
Eravamo andati insieme , prima di Natale , a prenotare per la sua festa di compleanno il ristorante " Villa Santa Chiara " a Casoria , la " sala Miami " - lo avevo suggerito io - e già ci si aspettava una " sorpresa " di Berlusconi , ma nessuno credeva che la sorpresa fosse proprio lui , Berlusconi in carne e ossa .
Ci siamo lasciati a gennaio e alla festa non ci sono andato .
L'ho incontrata qualche altra volta , per riprendermi un oggetto di poco prezzo ma , per me , di gran valore che era rimasto nelle sue mani .
Abbiamo avuto il tempo , un' altra volta , di avere un colloquio un po ' brusco .
Le ho restituito quasi tutte le lettere e le foto .
Le ho restituito tutto - ho conservato poche cose , questa lettera che mi scrisse prima di Natale , qualche foto - perché non volevo che lei e la sua famiglia pensassero che , diventata Noemi Sophia Loren , io potessi sputtanarla .
Oggi ho la mia vita , la mia Manuela , il mio lavoro , mille euro al mese e va bene così ché non mi manca niente .
Certo , leggo di questo nuovo fidanzato di Noemi , come si chiama ? , che non s'era mai visto da nessuna parte anche se dice di conoscerla da due anni e penso che Noemi stia dicendo un sacco di bugie .
Quante bugie mi avrà detto sui viaggi .
A me diceva che andava a Roma sempre con la madre .
Per dire , per quella cena del 19 novembre 2008 a Villa Madama mi raccontò : " Siamo stati a cena con il presidente , io , papà e mamma allo stesso tavolo " .
Non c'erano i genitori seduti a quel tavolo ?
Allora mi ha detto un 'altra balla .
Quella sera le sono stati regalati una collana e un bracciale , ma non di grosso valore .
E il presidente ha fatto un regalo anche a sua madre .
Sento tante bugie , sì , e comunque sono fatti di Noemi , dei suoi genitori , di Berlusconi , io che c'entro ? " .
Le parole di Gino Flaminio appaiono genuine , confortate dalle foto , dalla memoria degli amici ( che hanno le immagini di Noemi e Gino sui loro computer ) , da qualche lettera , dai ricordi dei vicini e dei genitori , ma soprattutto dall ' ostinazione con cui il ragazzo per settimane si è nascosto diventando una presenza invisibile nella vita di Noemi.lo ha rintracciato con fatica , molta pazienza e tanta fortuna nella fabbrica di corso San Giovanni dove tutti i suoi compagni di lavoro conoscono Noemi , la storia dell ' amore perduto di Gino .
Compagni di lavoro che - fino alla fine - hanno provato a proteggerlo : " Gino ? E chi è ' sto Gino Flaminio ? " e Gino se ne stava nascosto dietro un muro .
La testimonianza del ragazzo consente di liquidare almeno cinque domande dalla lista di dieci che abbiamo proposto al capo del governo .
La ricostruzione di Gino permette di giungere a un primo esito : Silvio Berlusconi ha mentito all 'opinione pubblica in ogni passaggio delle sue interviste .
Nei giorni scorsi , come quando disse adi aver " avuto l'occasione di conoscere [ Noemi ] tramite i suoi genitori " .
O ancora ieri a Radio Montecarlo dove ha sostenuto di essersi addirittura " divertito a dire alla famiglia , di cui sono amico da molti anni , che non desse risposte su quella che è stata la nostra frequentazione in questi anni " .
Come di cartapesta è la scena - del tutto artefatta - disegnata dalle testate ( ) della berlusconiana Mondadori .
Il fatto è che Berlusconi non ha mai conosciuto Elio Letizia né negli " anni passati " , né negli " ambienti socialisti " .
Mai Berlusconi ha discusso con Elio Letizia di politica e tantomeno delle candidature delle Europee ( Porta a porta , 5 maggio ) .
Berlusconi ha conosciuto Noemi .
Le ha telefonato direttamente , dopo averne ammirato le foto e aver letto il numero di cellulare su un " book " lasciatogli da Emilio Fede .
Poi , nel corso del tempo , l'ha invitata a Roma , in Sardegna , a Milano .
Le evidenti falsità , diffuse dal premier , gli sarebbero costate nel mondo anglosassone , se non una richiesta di impeachment , concrete difficoltà politiche e istituzionali .
Nell 'Italia assuefatta di oggi , quella menzogna gli vale un ' altra domanda : perché è stato costretto a mentire ?
Che cosa lo costringe a negare ciò che è evidente ?
È vero , come sostiene Noemi , che Berlusconi ha promesso o le ha lasciato credere di poter favorire la sua carriera nello spettacolo o , in alternativa , l'accesso alla scena politica ( , 28 aprile ) ?
Dieci giorni dopo , ci sono altre ragionevoli certezze .
È confermato quel che Veronica Lario ha rivelato a ( 3 maggio ) : il premier " frequenta minorenni " .
Noemi , nell ' ottobre del 2008 , quando riceve la prima , improvvisa telefonata di Berlusconi ha diciassette anni , come Roberta , l'amica che l'ha accompagnata a Villa Certosa .
La circostanza rinnova l'ultima domanda : quali sono le condizioni di salute del presidente del Consiglio ?
Analysis
The Government has announced plans to push ahead with the next phase in launch of a controversial child protection database , despite ongoing concerns about the security of data held on the system .
The delayed ContactPoint system , which is due to include names and addresses on every child under 18 in England , will be accessed by frontline care workers in real - life trials for the first time from this Monday .
Security experts contacted by El Reg remain concerned that information housed on the database might leak out despite ministerial assurances on security provisions that will accompany the roll - out of the directory system .
From Monday onwards social workers , police , schools and health officials will have access to data held on the ContactPoint database .
The start of frontline trials , announced in the House of Commons last week by Children 's Secretary Ed Balls ( Hansard extract below ) , follows repeated delays in the development of the system .
Since January , important progress has been made .
Seventeen early adopter local authorities in the north west of England , along with leading national charities , Barnardo ’s and KIDS , now have trained management teams in preparation for practitioners to start to use the system .
At the same time , as part of the extensive ContactPoint security arrangements , local authorities have shielded the records of children who are potentially at greater risk if their whereabouts were to become known , to provide an additional layer of security , ( for example , if a child is fleeing domestic violence or is under witness protection , or in some cases where children have been adopted ) .
Approximately 52,000 records have now been shielded on ContactPoint .
Building on this work , we will continue to take an incremental and steady approach to delivery .
We are now moving ahead with the second phase of delivery .
From 18 May , and over a period of several weeks , ContactPoint early adopters will train around 800 practitioners to use ContactPoint .
They have been hand - picked to ensure they reflect the broad range of professionals working for children ’s services organisations who will use ContactPoint when the directory is fully rolled out .
We will carefully monitor the activity of those practitioners considering what further improvements may be required in the light of their experience of using the system .
From June to August , we will train management teams in the other local authorities and national partners .
This will allow them to prepare for deployment of ContactPoint more widely in due course .
Throughout this second phase , we will continue to evaluate the experience of early adopters .
This will ensure that the deployment of ContactPoint continues to take account of the experience of new users in the next stages of delivery .
Creation of the multi-million pound database - which will hold information on an estimated 11 m children in England in a form of online directory - was proposed in the wake of Victoria Climbié 's killing by her abusive guardians in 2000 .
Police , social services and health agencies all noted signs of abuse in the run-up to her death , but each agency acted in isolation .
The database is designed to give social workers , police and hospital with common access to contact details on children and other professionals working with them , so that care professionals can more easily contact each other and exchange information .
Case history files will not be housed on the system .
The database will include details such name , address , date of birth , gender , and contact details for parents or carers for each child in England .
Contact details for the child ’s school , family doctor and other careers working with the child will also be included within the same cross-reference entry .
ContactPoint will cost an estimated £ 224 m to set up , followed by annual running costing of around £ 44 m a year .
Contact details on an estimated 52,000 at - risk children will be shielded .
Chairman Max Baucus tries to restore order , calls for more police .
Health care activists disrupt hearing
Health care activists disrupted a Senate Finance Committee hearing Tuesday , standing up one after the other as Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) tried to restore order .
As soon as police escorted one protester out of the room , another would stand up , criticizing the committee for convening a panel of 15 experts and excluding witnesses who support creating a Medicare system for all Americans .
About eight were led out of the hearing .

“ We need more police , ” Baucus said .
The mini-protest was organized by Healthcare Now , Physicians for a National Health Program and Single Payer Action , all of whom support a single - payer , government - run health care system .
“ Single - payer needs to be on the table , ” one of the protesters yelled .
“ This is political theater . ”
Baucus eventually restored order to the hearing , asking those who remained in the audience not to cause further disruptions .
“ I want you to know I care deeply about your views , ” Baucus said .
Taipei has strived to achieve “ zero landfill , total recycling ” by 2010 , 30 years ahead of the UN ’s trash targets .
It will probably fall short , but its policies are still exemplary .
The city has encouraged the private sector to build composting facilities and recycling plants , and requires residents to pay for trash collection by the bag .
Garbage trucks playing Beethoven ’s “ Für Elise ” and Badarzewska ’s “ The Maiden ’s Prayer ” collect trash , which must be in city - approved bags , from residents , who toss the bags into the trucks themselves .
Taipei promotes trade in secondhand goods and introduced new methods of kitchen - waste disposal — one pilot program turns food waste into pig feed .
The result :
The volume of trash has been slashed by well over 60 % .

A music only torrent indexer , Coda.fm stands out from other sites with its clean design and innovative features .
One of these features is a link to buy the various albums on Amazon , after downloading them on BitTorrent and enjoying the sample .
Surprisingly enough , Amazon objects to getting business this way and has taken action .
When we first reported on Coda .fm we praised the site for its great design and functionality .
It has a full - blown recommendation engine that makes it a great tool to discover new music and its ease of use is superior to that of most industry sanctioned ‘ legal ’ alternatives .
On the album download pages Coda.fm has a short bio of the artist , the album ’s track list , recommended albums , but also a link to buy the album on Amazon .
Contrary to the “ pirates of the Amazon ” firefox plugin we covered previously , users are encouraged to buy the music instead of downloading it – not the other way around .
“ We give the user the option to easily buy an album that they liked after downloading and hearing it for free , ” the Coda.fm founder told TorrentFreak .
He thought it was a good idea , and it therefore came as a surprise when Amazon asked him to remove the links from the site .
In addition , the world ’s largest online retailer closed his associate account .
“ I ca n’t overstate enough the idiocy of said request : they ’re actually telling us to stop helping them selling albums , ” the Coda.fm said venting his frustration .
Indeed , in theory this is a win - win situation for all parties involved .
Amazon , the artists , labels and the Coda founder all made extra money while the users of the site could buy off their guilt .
U2 ’s latest album on Coda.fm , with Amazon link .
So why did Amazon request the links to be removed then ?
Most likely they do n’t want to be affiliated with a BitTorrent site because that might hurt their image .
The Amazon links are still on Coda.fm though , and the founder of the site has no intention of removing them anytime soon .
“ Although we ’re no longer an Amazon Associate , we ’re going to keep the links to buy the albums .
A couple of hundred albums and digital downloads have been sold to date , proving it ’s usefulness , and that is the only criteria we use to decide what features we keep or remove , ” Torrent Freak was told .
The fact that already hundreds of albums were sold through Coda .fm shows that ‘ pirates ’ are willing to pay for music .
It ’s time for the music industry to find out how to get them on board .
Obama , Pakistan and the Rule of Law In the first hour of his administration President Barack Obama affirmed his dedication to the rule of law : Email
Printer friendly “ Our Founding Fathers , faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine , drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man -- a charter expanded by the blood of generations .
Those ideals still light the world , and we will not give them up for expedience sake . ”
In his first full day in office President Obama said : “ Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this administration . "
The remarkable campaign and inspiring oratory of the first African - American to be elected to the planet ’s most powerful public office sparked worldwide optimism and hope for new and creative approaches to serious national and international challenges .
Two days later , on Jan. 23 , the CIA launched two missile attacks on Pakistan .
Fifteen people in Waziristan , in Pakistan ’s Northwest Frontier Province , were killed by Hellfire missiles launched from unmanned drones .
The attacks were the latest in a series that began several years earlier and intensified in 2008 .
As such , despite the Obama campaign mantra , “ Change We Can Believe In , ” they represented the President ’s commitment to a critical component of the Bush administration ’s foreign and military policy : expansion of what George W. Bush dubbed the “ global war on terror ” – from one key theater of the GWOT in Afghanistan across the border into Pakistan .
The attacks are ostensibly aimed at leaders of al - Qaeda who are blamed for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington , and at Taliban militants who slip across the Afghan border to attack U.S. , NATO and Afghan government forces .
Hawkish Address Candidate Obama outlined his position in a hawkish address at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington on Aug. 1 , 2007 .
He said : “ Al - Qaeda terrorists train , travel , and maintain global communications in this safe haven .
The Taliban pursues a hit - and - run strategy , striking in Afghanistan , then skulking across the border to safety .
This is the wild frontier of our globalized world . …
“ But let me make this clear .
There are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3,000 Americans .
They are plotting to strike again . …
If we have actionable intelligence about high - value terrorist targets and [ Pakistan ’s leader ] wo n’t act , we will . ”
Since the start of the Obama administration about 170 people have been killed inside Pakistan in at least 17 of these attacks .
The Pakistan newspaper , “ The News , ” says the great majority have been civilians .
For many , the killings have thrown a shadow over early hopes for new thinking about Bush ’s GWOT , which the Obama administration rebranded as the “ Overseas Contingency Operation . ”
The missile attacks indicate , as well , that President Obama ’s perspective on the rule of law may have less in common with the uplifting eloquence of January than with the disdain consistently displayed during the previous eight years by his predecessor in the Oval Office .
Killing people in Pakistan with Hellfire missiles is against the law .
The attacks violate the Geneva Conventions , the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights , the United Nations Charter , UN General Assembly Resolution # 3314 and the Nuremberg Charter .
Even when the missiles hit their intended targets in Pakistan , the orders to fire are given from thousands of miles away by CIA officials watching on computer screens in North America .
CIA teams sit , in effect , as collective judge , jury and executioner .
Protocol II , Article 6 ( 2 ) of the Geneva Conventions says : “ No sentence shall be passed and no penalty shall be executed on a person found guilty of an offence except pursuant to a conviction pronounced by a court offering the essential guarantees of independence and impartiality . ”
Extrajudicial Killings
The 170 or so people who have been killed by Hellfire missiles in Pakistan since Inauguration Day represent 170 extrajudicial killings – outlawed not only by the Geneva Conventions but by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights :
Article 6 ( 1 ) : “ Every human being has the inherent right to life .
This right shall be protected by law .
No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life . ”
Article 6 ( 2 ) : Sentence of death “ can only be carried out pursuant to a final judgment rendered by a competent court .
Unless the Pakistani government has invited the United States to fire missiles into Pakistan , the attacks violate the United Nations Charter Article 2 ( 4 ) : “ All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state , or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations . ”
Perhaps the most far - reaching aspect of the illegality of the drone attacks is that each is an act of aggression .
The United Nations Definition of Aggression , General Assembly Resolution # 3314 , provides a list of acts defined as aggression , including Article 3 ( b ) : “ Bombardment by the armed forces of a State against the territory of another State or the use of any weapons by a State against the territory of another State . ”
Article 5 makes it clear -- aggression is never legal : “ No consideration of whatever nature , whether political , economic , military or otherwise may serve as a justification for aggression . ”
This was the position of the Tribunal at the first Nuremberg Trial .
At Nuremberg 22 of the most prominent Nazis were tried for war crimes , crimes against peace ( aggression ) , crimes against humanity and conspiracy following World War II .
In the judgment the Tribunal left no doubt as to the enormity of the crime of aggression , labeling it “ the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole . ”
Eight German leaders were convicted of aggression at Nuremberg .
Five of these received death sentences .
Certainly the scale of American aggression in Pakistan is small compared to that of German aggression in World War II .
But how many civilian deaths , destroyed homes and summary executions does it take for the firing of remote - controlled missiles into Pakistan to qualify as a crime ?
Creative Alternatives
It ’s not as if there is a lack of compelling and creative alternative visions being proposed by smart people with experience in and knowledge of the region .
For example , as recently reported in The Nation , Akbar Ahmed , former High Commissioner from Pakistan to the UK emphatically told the Congressional Progressive Caucus on May 5 that the best strategy in Pakistan is to work through tribal organizations and networks .
He emphasized aid , education and the certain failure of an approach that is primarily military :
“ The one thing every Pakistani wants for his kids is education ....
Within one to three years you will turn that entire region around .
The greatest enemies of the Americans will become their allies . ”
In the book outlining Barack Obama ’s vision , Change We Can Believe In -- Barack Obama ’s Plan to Renew America ’s Promise , are these words ( p. 104 ) “ To seize this moment in our nation ’s history , the old solutions will not do .
An outdated mind - set which believes we can overcome these challenges by fighting the last war will not make America safe and secure . ”
Unfortunately , in its first few months the Obama administration has been fighting the last President ’s war .
As far as Pakistan is concerned , neither the President ’s foreign policy nor his perspective on the rule of law seem to be materially different from those of President Bush .
However , President Obama apparently is now “ re-evaluating ” the missile strikes , in light of their widespread unpopularity in Pakistan and the threat to the survival of Pakistan ’s government .
Perhaps now is a good time to look for an approach that is both legal and more effective in the long term than extra-judicial killings of Taliban militants , al - Qaeda extremists and Pakistani civilians .
Perhaps this is an opportunity for change we can believe in .

The race is on for networking vendors to get their share of the $ 7 billion in broadband grants being offered through the Obama administration 's massive economic stimulus bill .
At its core , the program will involve billions in new networking gear to help improve the state of broadband in the United States , and networking vendors like Alcatel - Lucent ( NYSE : ALU ) and Juniper Networks ( NASDAQ : JNPR ) are planning to cash in , helping their carrier customers across the United States figure out how to get a piece of the stimulus pie .
That , in turn , is likely to lead to greater sales of their own offerings , with the final outcome potentially becoming a bonanza for networking vendors .
For one thing , the volume of stimulus grant applications could well exceed the dollars allocated by the government -- and that could lead to sales even beyond the $ 7 billion allocated in the stimulus package .
" Our customers are starting to wonder what does the broadband stimulus mean to them and whether they should take advantage of the dollars , " Rich Wonders , an executive vice president at Alcatel - Lucent , told InternetNews.com .
" The government has made it clear that although this is about delivering broadband to consumers in rural market , there is also a set of target institutions and audiences that they are very interested in being part of the program -- healthcare , schools and libraries are all on the targeted list . "
Wonders added that Alcatel - Lucent realized that many of its smaller customers were not equipped to navigate their way through a federal program like the broadband stimulus and craft a federal grant proposal .
To that end , Alcatel - Lucent is helping its customers to draft their funding applications .
It 's also retained the services of Nancy Victory , the former head of the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration ( NTIA ) , to help with its stimulus - related efforts .
The NTIA is tasked with figuring out the rules by which the broadband stimulus grants will be awarded .
The agency has also launched its own informational Web site to help promote its efforts .
At Alcatel - Lucent , Wonders said the company is trying to engage its own employees as well .
" We employ over 20,000 people in the U.S. , " Wonders said .
" So our employees also live and work in cities -- some have broadband , some do n't -- and as taxpayers and citizens , we want to make sure they have a voice . "
Juniper Networks is also engaging with its customers on stimulus - related work .
" As you may be aware , the majority of broadband stimulus funding is targeted at smaller , rural providers -- since the portion that included funding for larger players was cut from the final version " of the stimulus bill , Don Root , public sector marketing manager at Juniper , told InternetNews.com .
" With that said , many of Juniper 's customers in this space already have local expertise in applying for grants and are already doing so .
We work with them on an as - needed basis . "
Networking tech for stimulus
There are broad range of broadband related items that the stimulus funding will end up supporting .
From a networking vendor point of view , Wonders commented that transport and routing are key as are the community applications that ride on top of the network .
In his view , the stimulus effort is about more than just providing basic internet access such that those in rural America can connect to Facebook .
Rather , he noted that the plan is about connecting Americans to education and health care resources where such access is not currently available .
Wonders expects that in order to expand broadband access , carriers will need to expand both their edge networks , which connect to users , as well as their core networks , which deliver the network traffic infrastructure .
Wonders said he sees it as an opportunity for Alcatel - Lucent to grow its Metro Ethernet deployments to provide access .
Business and social motives
But it's also an opportunity to dramatically improve Internet access for many Americans , vendors said .
One of the key goals of the broadband stimulus effort is to help underserved areas of the U.S. -- a fact that they say is also a key driver behind their efforts .
[ cob:Special_Report ]
For Juniper 's Root , the challenge of expanding broadband adoption in the U.S. for service providers is about addressing the " digital divide " of the haves and have - nots .
" This concept is where a lack of a U.S. national strategy that emphasizes universal access with affordable prices , creates a division between citizens that can or can't connect to the Internet , " he said .
" So it 's not really a problem with adoption , but rather a problem with access , one that we hope the stimulus will help resolve . "
That could lay the groundwork for a major reshaping of rural providers ' capabilities , he added .
" There are many rural areas within the U.S. that do not have sufficient access to high - speed broadband infrastructure , " Root said .
" There are still a lot of areas that do n't even have basic telephone infrastructure in place , thereby steering some of the smaller Tier 2 / Tier 3 service providers to look at options like broadband over power ( BPL ) technology .
The key issue here is by not being linked up to the global economy , businesses in these rural and underserved areas are at a distinct disadvantage as the world of e-commerce continues to grow . "
Win -win for networking vendors ?
Alcatel - Lucent 's Wonders said he does n't expect that all those grant proposals that his company helps put together will result in government funding .
Still , he said that having qualified leads and interested customers is never a bad thing .
" We clearly expect that there will be more opportunities than there is free money , but I do n't think that means that every project that does n't get funded from the government will die on the vine , " Wonders said .

No less an authority than Miss Universe has visited Guantánamo Bay and pronounced the infamous US detention centre a " relaxing , calm , beautiful place " .
According to a blog posting that will strike fear into the hearts of diplomats in Caracas and Washington , the beauty queen - who is also known as Dayana Mendoza from Venezuela - visited the facility last week with her friend , Miss USA , Crystle Stewart .
" It was a loooot of fun ! " Mendoza wrote on the Miss Universe blog .
She also recounted how she and Stewart met US military personnel and toured the camp , with its barbed wire fences , minefields and watchtowers .
As well as a bar on the base , the pair also discovered an " unbelievable " beach in the bay .
" We also met the military dogs , and they did a very nice demonstration of their skills .
All the guys from the army were amazing with us . "
But the " deployment " - organised to entertain US troops and " boost morale " - also had its educational aspects .
" We visited the detainees ' camps and we saw the jails , where they shower , how the[y ] recreate themselves with movies , classes of art , books .
It was very interesting , " wrote Mendoza .
" I did n't want to leave , it was such a relaxing place , so calm and beautiful . "
Her experiences are a far cry from those of former detainees , who have alleged that torture , including " waterboarding " , was practised at Guantánamo Bay .
Britain announced last week it would investigate whether its secret services were complicit in the torture of a UK resident released from the camp last month .
Barack Obama has set a one - year deadline for shutting the prison .

The report 's author referred to Soca as a failure .
The government 's battle against UK drug use has been condemned as a " phoney war " in a report by a think tank .
The Centre for Policy Studies document called Labour 's £ 1.5 bn - a - year anti-drugs policy an " expensive failure " .
It said the UK 's policy of spending most of its drug budget on treatment was less effective than spending more on prevention and enforcement .
The Home Office said the report " inaccurately portrays the impact of the government 's drug strategy " .
According to author Kathy Gyngell , spending on methadone increased threefold between 2003 and 2008 , as the government switched focus from combating illegal drug use to dealing with addicts .
She argued that this " harm - reduction approach " had failed , instead leaving 147,000 people in " state - sponsored " addiction .
The author also said Class A consumption and " problem drug use " had " risen dramatically " during the past 10 years , with drug use spreading to rural areas and the age of children 's initiation into drugs falling .
Labour 's
War on Drugs has not , despite the rhetoric to the contrary , been fought

The report for the right - wing think tank claims more than 10 % of 11 - year - olds have taken drugs , while 41 % of 15 - year - olds had done so .
Turning her attention to the Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) , Ms Gyngell said the agency - which was set up in 2006 - had been a " failure " in its bid to tackle the drugs trade in the UK .
The report 's author said the UK 's drug policy should bear down on the illicit use of all drugs and feature a tougher enforcement programme to reduce the supply of drugs .
" Labour 's War on Drugs has not , despite the rhetoric to the contrary , been fought .
It has been a phoney war - and an expensive failure , " she said .
" While the UK spends the majority of its drug budget on its so - called treatment programmes , both the Netherlands and Sweden spend most of their drugs budget on prevention and enforcement .
Drug seizures " Their drugs problems are a half and a third of the size of the UK respectively . "
Her comments come just days after Soca said at least 5,000 criminals were now in the sights of the agency after a 75 % rise in operations .
Of the 287 cases that reached court , 266 - or 93 % - ended in a conviction , according to the agency 's annual report .
The Home Office rejected the claims made in the think tank 's report .
A spokesman said overall drug use was at its " lowest level " since measurements began .
" Record numbers are entering and staying in treatment and recorded acquisitive crime - to which drug related crime makes a significant contribution - has fallen by 28 % since the introduction of the Drug Interventions Programme , " he said .
The spokesman also referred to figures showing that , in 2007 / 08 , police and HM Revenue and Customs made 216,792 seizures of drugs in England and Wales - an increase of 17 % since 2006/07 and the highest since records began in 1973 .

What do you get for that person who has everything ?
Or even the person who has nothing ?
If you ever watched a television show or movie and thought , “ hey that would be cool ” or “ I want one of those ” , then this list is for you .
These are the top twenty fictional gadgets that we wish we possessed .
Granted , not all of them are all that useful .
But at least they ’d be great to own .
And no , the list is n’t sixteen different versions of a time machine .
We figure one time machine is good enough , so we tried to diversify the choices to gadgets that performed different functions .
20 . Tricorder
As seen in : Star Trek
Why it ’s Cool ? :
For the more outdoorsy person , comes the Tricorder , a device which can scan an area , interpret and display data from its scans to the user , and record information .
Useful to both scientists and weekend adventurers , you ’ll never know what you might find in your own backyard .
I call dibs on the golden scepters .
It ’s like a more awesome metal detector !
19 . Cornballer
As seen in : Arrested Development
Why it ’s Cool ? :
It ’s not exactly a useful gadget , but it ’s the perfect gag gift or something you give to get revenge on someone .
Invited to a wedding you ’re not to excited about ?
Give them a Cornballer and watch the burns appear .
18 . Food Replicator
As seen in : Star Trek and Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy
Why it ’s Cool ? :
The exact form may change from source to source , but the main idea remains the same .
The capacity to produce any food at the whim of the user .
Even those discontinued items .
Craving some Ecto Cooler or a bowl of Cröonchy Stars ?
Bam !
It ’s right there in front of you .
Not that Americans need something else to make them fat , but having Krispy Kreme donuts or bacon cheeseburgers at the touch of a button would be pretty excellent .
It ’s the seemingly limitless ability to imagine all things bizarre and unlikely for a party in your mouth !
17 . Al Czervik ’s Golf Bag
As seen in : Caddyshack
Why it ’s Cool ? : I guess some people just do n’t belong .
If you ’re a golfer and a little less on the snobbish side , this golf bag is for you , complete with a built - in stereo ( Journey not included ) :
16 . Inspector Gadget ’s Hat
As seen in : Inspector Gadget
Why it ’s Cool ? : Inspector Gadget has a bevy of bionic “ gadgets ” at his disposal , but his hat seems to contain the coolest selection of tools .
For example , it comes with a umbrella that can also double as a crappy parachute .
Not that one needs a parachute when the hat also has a set of helicopter propeller blades that enable you to fly .
Another great use are the gadget hands , which are mechanical hands that come out of the hat for whatever use necessary .
And although of little use , a spring can also emerge from the hat .
15 . Hypertime
As seen in : Clockstoppers
Why it ’s Cool ? :
A watch that allows the user to effectively “ stop time ” as the person ’s molecules speed up to the point where the world appears to be standing still .
Or essentially you could turn into the Flash .
Imagine all that one could get done in a a minimal amount of time , or what forbidden areas one you sneak into , just for the fun of it .
Not to mention you can seriously mess with people if you have a wicked side .
14 . Interactive User Interface Computer
As seen in : Minority Report
Why it ’s Cool ? : Just look at Tom Cruise use this awesome futuristic computer , I think the video speaks for itself :
13 . Lotus Esprit
As seen in : The Spy Who Loved Me
Why it ’s Cool ? :
One if by land , two if by sea .
Orbe like James Bond and just get one car that can traverse both .
Q branch is up to it .
When dealing with a villain who lives in an underwater lair , it is necessary to have a submarine car .
This Lotus does the trick , with wheels that turn inward to reveal four lateral fins and a periscope which appears from the roof .
It ’s also useful if google maps give you these directions .
12 . Transporter
As seen in : Star Trek , Galaxy Quest
Why it ’s Cool ? :
Having nothing to do with B - level Jason Statham movies , the transporter is a staple of Star Trek lore with the patented tagline , “ Beam Me Up Scotty ! ”
And who does n’t have a use for a teleportation machine that can dematerialize a person ( or object ) into an energy pattern and beamed to target somewhere else in the world ?
As long as you avoid the pitfalls like being combined with a household fly , you should be alright .
And I take it from that little impressed noise that you are interested in purchasing that matter transporter , sir .
Cost is only two bucks ( Emm … Two bucks …
And …
It only transports matter …
Um … Well ah… I ’ll give you thirty five cents ) .
11 . Remote Control
As seen in : Click
Why it ’s Cool ? : Finally someone bought something from the Beyondsection of Bed , Bath & Beyond .
The remote has many functions , with its most useful feature being that it can actually pause or freeze time .
It can also fast forward past unpleasant experiences , andit can even rewind ( although one cannot change the past ) .
There are other less cool features , although Adam Sandler did highlight the use of slow - motion to slowly watch a woman ’s breasts bounce while running .
The volume control would be useful to those utilizing a Miracle Ear .
10 . Orgazmorator
As seen in : Orgazmo
Why it ’s Cool ? :
An arm mounted device that forcefully triggers climax in those he uses it on ?
I do n’t know , you tell me why it ’s cool .
Use it for good and pleasure ( even on yourself ) , or use if for evil as a weapon and stop villains in their tracks by giving them mind - blowing orgasms .
If there ’s one way to go down in defeat , that ’s the way .
It ’ll work either way ( except on Neutered Man ) , just choose wisely .
9. Cloaking Device
As seen in : Predator
Why it ’s Cool ? :
The advantages of being invisible , who would n’t want that ?
This wrist - computer will provide active camouflage , bending light around the wearer and projecting a semi- transparent image in front .
As always with electronic equipment , keep out of water .
Also , if you ’re not fluent in Predator , there ’s a good chance of activating a self - destruct device resulting in a small nuclear - like explosion which destroys an area equivalent to 300 city blocks .
8. Sonic Screwdriver
As seen in : Doctor Who
Why it ’s Cool ? :
It ’s small , easy to carry , but yet has a variety of uses .
Mostly it ’s used to open virtually any lock , mechanical or electronic , so no need for keys anymore .
But it can also be utilized as a repairing tool , magically fixing equipment , and in a pinch can serve as a decent weapon .
Goes great in a set with some Psychic paper .
7. Iron Man ’s Suit
As seen in : Iron Man
Why it ’s Cool ? : Tony Stark ’s amazing suit can make anyone be a superhero .
Some of the features include jet boots to fly with , repulsor rays to fight with , and a cybernetic helmet to use to control all the various devices within the armor .
If you ’re not interested in fighting crime , or at least work as a mercenary , there ’s limited long term appeal .
But even just going to the grocery store you ’ll look bad - ass .
6. Holodeck
As seen in : the Star Trek universe
Why it ’s Cool ? :
Do you really need an answer why a simulated reality facility could be useful ?
People do n’t need to drink to forget their sucky lives , instead they can trick all five senses into believing another reality .
Go to any time , any place , and be anyone .
Fill the room with you wildest desires , which is probably going to be naked women .
The drawback is that you can still die ( so be careful ) , and more importantly , reality may begin to really suck .
5. Hoverboard
As seen in : the Back to the Future trilogy
Why it ’s Cool ? : Mattel brand or not , any Hoverboard will do provided that it ’s a magnetic - induction type .
And do n’t tell me they can’t exist , why would Back to the Future lie to us ?
These things are great to fly around the neighborhood , to avoid the rocky terrain of the country , or for future careers as the Green Goblin .
A word of warning , as everyone knows , Hoverboards do n’t work on water ( unless you got power ! ) .
4. KITT
As seen in : Knight Rider
Why it ’s Cool ? :
Holy crap , a talking car !
We ’re going with the original here , the Knight Industries Two Thousand Pontiac Firebird Trans Am .
Among its many features include : a front mounted scan bar , the ability to drive himself , and Turbo Boost , which allows for quick bursts of speed or jumping over obstacles .
Although there ’s a reasonable debate whether KITT is cooler than Knightboat , the crime solving boat , we ’ll stick with the land vehicle .
3. Neuralizer
As seen in : Men in Black
Why it ’s Cool ? :
There ’s probably a lot of things you ’d be better off forgetting .
A bad relationship .
Those Skidz pants you wore in seventh grade .
That time you went to the “ basement ” of a port - o - john .
Two girls , one cup .
Maybe this post .
And it does n’t have to be you , it can be for others too .
Just flashy thing your embarrassing or otherwise unworthy memories away with the push of one button .
Caution , may cause brain cancer .
2. The TARDIS
As Seen in : Doctor Who
Why it ’s Cool ? : Short for Time And Relative Dimension(s )
In Space , you can travel throughout space and time in this thing , all in the convenient size of a 1950s - style London police box .
So , it ’s basically a time machine combined with a rocket ship .
Of course , the negative is that you ’ll destroy the space - time continuum with such a device .
And if it falls into the wrong hands , your mortal enemies will go back in time to steal for mojoor send killer robots to assassinate your mother .
But other than that , it ’s pretty cool .
1. Lightsaber
As seen in : the Star Wars universe
Why it ’s Cool ? :
Let ’s face it , many of you would probably kill your own mother for a real lightsaber .
It ’s simply the coolest weapon ever .
Search your feelings , you know it ’s true .
The downside is that ’s there ’s a strong probability you ’ll chop off one or more of your appendages .
But until such a time , you can do this :

[ Editor ’s note : Last night I received an email from Kathy , who co-coordinates Voices for Creative Nonviolence , with this report .
She is visiting cities and villages in Pakistan until June 12 , as part of a delegation that includes Dan Pearson , Fr. Steve Kelly , Gene Stoltzfus , and Razia Ahmed . – ES ]
ISLAMABAD – Shortly after arriving in Pakistan , one week ago , we met a weaver and his extended family , numbering 76 in all , who had been forcibly displaced from their homes in Fathepur , a small village in the Swat Valley .
Fighting between the Pakistani military and the Taliban had intensified .
Terrified by aerial bombing and anxious to leave before a curfew would make flight impossible , the family packed all the belongings they could carry and fled on foot .
It was a harrowing four day journey over snow - covered hills .
Leaving their village , they faced a Taliban check point where a villager trying to leave had been assassinated that same morning .
Fortunately , a Taliban guard let them pass .
Walking many miles each day , with 45 children and 22 women , they supported one another as best they could .
Men took turns carrying a frail grandmother on their shoulders .
One woman gave birth to her baby , Hamza , on the road .
When they arrived , exhausted , at a rest stop in the outskirts of Islamabad , they had no idea where to go next .
While there , the weaver struck up a conversation with a man whom he ’d never met before .
He told the man about the family ’s plight .
Hearing that they were homeless , the man invited them to live with him and his family in a large building which he is renovating .
He offered to put the reconstruction on hold so that the family could move into the upper stories of his building .
The weaver was also fortunate to have known , for many years , a family that had sold his art work through a small shop in Islamabad .
Women in this family have been working , as volunteers , to assist refugees who ’ve come to Islamabad .
They and their companions have delivered one thousand “ food kits , ” plus cots , mats and cooking supplies , to desperately needy people .
Two of the women , Fauzia and Ghazala , invited our small delegation to visit the weaver and his family , in Islamabad ’s Bara Koh neighborhood .
When we arrived , older men and boys were outside , ready to unload a truck delivering mats and flour .
The generous building owner invited members of our group into his home , on the ground floor , where plans were already being made to turn the top floor into a school for the children .
Several tots led me upstairs to meet their grandparents .
The elderly couple sat , cross-legged , on cots .
When we entered , the grandmother stood , embraced me , and then softly wept for several minutes .
Soon , about twenty men , women and children clustered around the cots .
All listened attentively while one of the weaver ’s brothers , Abdullah Shah , spoke with pride about the school in Fathepur where he had been a headmaster .
The village had three schools , and his school was so successful that even Taliban families sent their children to study there .
Now , the Taliban has destroyed all of the schools in Fathepur .
He and his brothers wonder what their future will be .
How and when can they return to their village ?
And how will they start over ?
The crops are ruined , livestock have died , and land mines have been laid .
Most of the shops and businesses have been destroyed .
Many homes are demolished .
The trauma endured by the refugees is overwhelming .
Yet , numerous individuals and groups have swiftly extended hospitality and emergency aid .
We visited a Sikh community , in Hassan Abdal , which has taken in hundreds of Sikhs , housing them inside a large and very famous shrine .
Nearby , we stayed for several days in Tarbela , where families in very simple dwellings have welcomed their relatives .
The townspeople quietly took up a collection to support the refugee families .
Some of the townspeople accompanied us to Ghazi , just up the road from Tarbela , where 155 people are staying in an abandoned hospital , relying entirely on the generosity of their new neighbors .
Doctors from Lahore invited two of us to go with them to villages near Mardan , where people from the Swat Valley are still arriving .
The doctors were part of a project organized jointly through Rotary Lahore , Pakistan Medical Aid , and Jahandan , which has worked with area councils to convert schools into refugee centers .
The doctors take turns , several times a week , delivering relief shipments and helping supervise distribution .
Generosity in the face of such massive displacement and suffering is evident everywhere we go .
But Pakistan needs help on a much larger scale .
The U.S. has pledged 100 million dollars toward relief efforts .
Two other disclosures about money budgeted for Pakistan should be considered in light of the unbearable burdens borne by close to two million new refugees .
First is the decision to spend 800 million dollars to renovate and expand the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad and to upgrade security at U.S. consular offices elsewhere in the country .
Secondly , the U.S. will spend 400 million dollars , in 2009 , to teach counter - insurgency tactics to Pakistan ’s military .
The 2010 Defense Spending budget requests an additional 700 million for counter - insurgency training in Pakistan .
What would happen if U.S. officials put plans to expand the U.S. Embassy on hold ?
Suppose the U.S. were to declare that helping alleviate the misery of people forcibly displaced by Taliban violence and the recent military offensive is a top priority , one that trumps spending money on renovating and expanding the U.S. Embassy .
Suppose that the U.S. were to redirect funds designated to train counterinsurgents and instead make these funds available to help alleviate impoverishment in Pakistan .
No one seems to know how the Taliban are funded , but they clearly use large sums of money to build their ranks , giving each new recruit 25,000 rupees , a sum that exceeds what a teacher earns in one year .
In villages where people do n’t have enough resources to feed their children , the Taliban would initially move in with plans to build schools and offer two meals a day , plus clean clothes , to the children .
Later , they would exercise increasingly fierce control over villages .
But their initial forays into villages were marked by offers to reduce the gaps between “ haves and have - nots . ”
Enormous resources will be spent to “ crush ” the Taliban , and as always happens in warfare , the bloodshed will fuel acts of revenge and retaliation .
The relationship that began when a stranger took the risk of offering shelter to a weaver holds a lesson worth heeding .
The weaver and his family will never forget the extraordinary , immediate kindness extended to them when a man put his renovation project on hold so that he could help them find shelter in his building .
The U.S. could help assure that every Pakistani family displaced by the fighting has enough to eat and the security of at least a temporary home .
It would be an unusual but sensible homeland security initiative within Pakistan .
And it would be a signpost pointing to greater security for the United States .
The maxim that guides this idea is simple : to counter terror , build justice .
Build justice predicated on the belief that each person has basic human rights , and that we have a collective responsibility to share resources so that those rights are met .
This means eliminating the unjust and unfair gap between the “ haves ” and the “ have - nots . ”
It means weaving new relationships that do n’t rely on guns and bombs for security .
President Obama pledged more open government on his first day in office Americans are getting a say in the way the Obama administration opens up the policy making process .
Via a website , Americans are being asked for ideas about making government more transparent .
The best ideas , from this first stage , will be debated online and then used in central discussions about moves towards more open government .
Finally , citizens will help draft the wording of recommendations about what the administration should do .
Three stages
The proposals to include citizens make good on a promise laid out in a memo , issued by the Obama administration , on its first day in office .
In that memo the President Obama " committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government " saying that it should govern in a manner that was transparent , participatory , and collaborative .
How it should go about doing this will be explored in May and June as Americans are invited to give their opinions and advise the Obama administration as it draws up plans .
The first phase involves " brainstorming " ideas and runs until 28 May in which citizens can send in ideas via post , e-mail , or a website .
From 3 - 14
June , the ideas generated in the first phase will be debated online via a centrally - hosted blog .
Finally , from 15 - 19 June , via a wiki , Americans will be able to help draft the language used to describe the best proposals .
Following the public collaboration phase , the US government plans to consult with its agencies on the final wording .
After this an Open Government Directive will be issued that will guide agencies in adopting the ideas .
" The process of making policy must benefit from the best available information in society , " said the White House in a statement announcing the plan .
" Much of the expertise we need can be found among the nation 's citizens . "

Nine Inch Nails ' frontman Trent Reznor recently spoke out about Apple 's approval process for iPhone applications after an update to the band 's own application was rejected due to " objectionable " downloadable content that was n't housed within the app itself .
In an update to the situation , Reznor reports via his Twitter account that the update has now been accepted by Apple and that the app remains unchanged from the previously - submitted version , suggesting that Apple has revisited its previous rejection .
Recent reports have suggested that parental controls coming in iPhone OS 3.0 this summer would open the door for the approval of more apps containing such " objectionable content " , and the latest beta version of the new operating system released last night does in fact include such controls .
Yesterday was not a day for the faint hearted .
We started off with a long bond Gilt auction failing in the UK and this of course put pressure on the US 5 - year auction , resulting in much higher yields ( extra 5 bp ) .
Supply and demand issues are coming back to haunt us .
Traders believe the Fed also paid up for the buy back off - the - run $ 7.8b issues ( 3b premium ) .
Makes you wonder after one day , the Fed with such poor implementation and execution , will be able to outstrip any AIG bonuses in no time .
And this was only in the FI market .
Geithner whose days must be numbered certainly provided some Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœjuiceÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ for forex , his mistakes were that of a rookie , but from a man seeking Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœabsolute powerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ , trader confidence thins quicklyÃ¢â‚ ¬Â¦..
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 11 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in an Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœerraticÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
A combination of surprises added to volatility in FXland yesterday .
Treasury Secretary Geithner initially saying he was open to the idea of a new reserve currency ( how else was he going to appease the Chinese ? ) , and then clarifying his comments , reinforcing the USD as the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s reserve currency and saying it is Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœlikely to remain soÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ for some time .
This was a rookie mistake causing near panic amongst traders .
How long has he got ?
On the fundamental front , US durable goods orders posted a +3.4 % , m / m increase last month after falling - 7.3 % in Jan. ( revised down from - 5.4 % ) .
This is the 1st positive reading in nearly a year and certainly surprised all analysts where market consensus was for another negative reading of - 2.5 % .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that given the downward revision for Jan. the landscape for the first two QÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s remain bleak .
Despite the m /m increase , Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœtotal - ordersÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ were down by - 29 % in Mar. vs. - 27.9 % in Jan .
Digging deeper , ex-transportation , goods were up by +3.9 % after falling by - 5.9 % in Jan .
The transportation component advanced a modest + 2 % after falling nearly - 12 % last time .
Investment spending remains a major drag for growth in the 1st Q , but some analysts are optimistic that the negative contribution will not be as bad as some have predicted .
Unfilled orders declined by - 1.3 % ( 5th straight month ) .
One expects further declines as companies continue to receive cancelled orders during this Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdownturn of activityÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ .
Other data showed that purchases of new homes in the US unexpectedly rose last month ( +4.7 % or +337 k units vs. +302 k ) from its record low as plummeting prices ( median prices have dropped - 18 % , y/y ) and cheaper mortgages enticed new buyers .
However , inventory levels remain high and record supplies need to be absorbed before we can declare a turn around .
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.14 % , CHF - 0.27 % , JPY - 0.69 and lower against GBP + 0.38 % .
The commodity currencies are little changed this morning , CAD +0.09 % and AUD +0.49 % .
Yesterday was a whiplash trading day that saw the loonie initially gain vs. the USD by default after GeithnerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s comments on Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœnew reserve currencyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and quickly give it back as the greenback rebounded by late afternoon .
The loonie remains range bound .
This week , the currency has been driven by the strength of commodity prices ( 50 % of CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s total export revenue is commodity based ) .
It has soared over the last couple of trading sessions as the USD $ plummeted vs. its largest trading partners .
Canadian fundamentals remain weak , according to ex-BOC governor Dodge Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœeven if everything is done right , it is going to be well into 2011 , 2012 and 2013 before we see the level of output and the rates of growth return to something approaching capacity in CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
To think that Canada is one of the stronger global economies !
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s all about the big dollar , for now look to buy USD $ on pull backs as Canadian fundamental data does not support a stronger loonie .
Capital markets seem to have got ahead of the curve with the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœeuphoricÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ announcements this week .
The AUD $ advanced , hand in hand with Asian equities , all on the back of greater risk tolerance by investors who seek higher yielding assets for now .
Rio Tinto ( the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 3rd- largest mining group ) believes that the metals markets will recover in the 2nd - half of this year .
Commodities similar to Canada account for 55 % of total exports .
Traders are looking to buy on dips ( 0.7017 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 53.48 down +71c ) .
Demand destruction remains healthy .
Yesterdays EIA report showed that US inventories climbed to their highest level in 16 - years as demand wanes .
Inventories rose +3.3 m barrels , w/w , vs. an expected rise of +1.1 m .
This is another bearish report that requires demand to move higher for prices to at least stabilize , it will once again shift focus towards OPEC and further production cuts scenario .
However , supplies of gas and distillate fuel ( includes heating oil and diesel ) dropped as refineries cut utilization rates .
Combine this with JapanÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s crude imports falling for a 4th Ã¢â‚¬â€ œconsecutive month last month on the back of weaker industrial output and EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 3rd- largest producer ( TOTAL ) cutting its out put in the US just vindicates how weak the market has become .
The fundamentals of supply and demand do not justify oil penetrating that psychological level of $ 60 a barrel anytime soon .
Global demand destruction remains a concern ; there is nothing to suggest that demand will increase in the short term .
Crude prices could remain vulnerable unless the greenback continues on this path of weakness .
The fear of inflation occurring on the back of the FedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s plans to buy debt has investors wanting the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as an alternative form of investment on pull backs ( $ 937 ) .
The Nikkei closed 8,636 up +156 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,236 up +13 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,901 up + 2 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year Treasury backed up 10 bp yesterday ( 2.80 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasury prices eased as a failed long Gilt auction in the UK added pressure to the US sale of $ 98 b notes this week .
Traders remain concerned that government supply will exceed demand going forward .
All this occurred despite the Fed buying back $ 7.5 b off - the - run maturities .
Policy makers are determined that yields will not aggressively rise given the current economic environment .

A Fulton County , Atlanta , Georgia jury has just returned this afternoon a verdict in the amount of $ 2.3 Million in a medical malpractice case involving a botched circumcision .
The trial on March 16 , 2009 , and the jury deliberated from 10:30 a.m. yesterday until about 1:45 p.m. today , when they returned a verdict in the amount of $ 1.8 million for the minor child , and $ 500,000.00 for the mother .
The case involved an alleged botched circumcision , in which the young male child involved ( who was 2 - days old at the time of the incident ) , had about five millimeters ( or about one - third ) of his glans penis negligently removed during a circumcision procedure on November 6 , 2004 .
This is obviously a significant permanent injury that will go with the child the rest of his life .
Defendants not only contended they had committed no negligence , and that any injury was an accepted risk of the procedure , but also somewhat surprisingly contended that the incident did not even occur , asserting that the child was suffering from a congenital deformity of the penis .
I guess the jury just did n’t buy that argument .
There are some detractors of the Georgia Civil Justice System who might decry this verdict as excessive , but my guess is those who do have 100 % of their penis .
Bless this Fulton County jury for taking into the consideration the emotion toil this unnecessary deformity will have on this child as he grows into a young man…something he will have to live with every day of his life , all due through no fault of his own .
Are you disappointed because ITV's " most stressful game show on TV " , The colour of money , seems to have been pulled ?
Do you think that you had just the right strategy to win ?
Then check out if you were right with John Haigh 's analysis of best play .
The game consists of 20 boxes , each identified by its own colour , and each containing one of the integers from 1 to 20 , which have been randomly allocated to the boxes .
The contestant , let 's call her Louise , is given a target number at least 50 and up to about 80 .
She chooses a box at random , not knowing which integer it contains , and then sees the sequence being generated in front of her .
If she calls out " Stop ! " , then the last number shown is banked towards her target .
If she fails to call out at or earlier , the sequence is extinguished , and that box contributes zero towards her target .
If she called stop before was reached , that is , if she banked , then the true value of is revealed .
She may select up to ten boxes , one at a time , and wins thousand pounds if she reaches her target , otherwise she wins nothing .
Louise 's aim is obviously to maximise her chance of reaching the target .
Whatever her long - term strategy , she has only one decision to make in any round — at what value does she intend to call " Stop " ?
Is there an optimal strategy Louise should follow ?
Starting at the end
What 's the best strategy to get your hands on this ?
There is indeed and we can find it by backward induction .
We 'll use the word position to describe the state of the game at a particular moment : the position tells us how far Louise is from her target value ( that is , it tells us the residual target ) , and which boxes she has left .
Now suppose that Louise is just about to begin the final round .
Her strategy is clear — wait for the residual target , then bank .
At any position in the penultimate round , there is a finite list of decisions : there is a finite number of boxes to choose from , and for each box there is a finite number of values at which Louise can say " Stop " .
For each of these decisions you can find the distribution of positions reached in the final round , and thus you can find the chance of reaching the target .
Hence the optimal decision , and its success chance , can be found for all these positions .
It 's possible to continue this argument all the way back to the initial round .
Thus an optimal strategy to reach any target exists : but as its description must specify the decision to be made in each round for all possible residual targets , and boxes remaining , it is infeasible to write it down here .
However , we can offer some pointers to possible long - term strategies , and show how to find the best strategy near the end of the game .
The first ever game
Let 's look at the first game seen on ITV to illustrate the optimal end game strategy .
With two rounds to go , the residual target was 15 , and the twelve boxes left contained the values 1 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 20 .
Four boxes have value of 15 or more , so there are two routes to success : the " bold play " of aiming for 15 immediately ( that is not saying " stop " until 15 is reached ) , or intending to take two steps , such as 9 , then 6 .
We compare their respective merits by counting how often each route would succeed .
It does no harm to assume that both boxes are used , even if the target is met first go .
What 's the best end game ?
There are 12 choices for the first step , and 11 for the second , so there are choices altogether .
With bold play , Louise 's first choice succeeds four times , and fails eight times .
In the first case , she wins whatever happens with the 11 possibilities on her second go .
In the second case she wins four times , as the same chance of success applies to second attempt as did to the unsuccessful first attempt .
So altogether , of the choices will win
Now suppose Louise aims to bank 9 first , that is , she does not call stop until 9 is reached .
With eight of the remaining boxes this strategy succeeds , leaving her with eight boxes that score the residual 6 or better , giving chances of success .
There are four boxes which fail to score 9 , in which case she must hope to select one of the four boxes that score 15 in the last round , giving another chances .
So we have a total of chances of success by this route .
Similarly , the success frequency if aiming to bank 10 first go is ; and going for 12 first wins times - this is the best option .
We will show here that it is never better to try to bank the lower of two scores before the higher , so , by a margin of just one chance in 132 over its nearest competitor , best tactics are to aim for 12 first , winning 84/132 = 7/11 of the time .
The answer may be counter - intuitive , as this intended route would lead to a total of 16 , not 15 — but it is indeed optimal !
Two Rounds Left
Consider the penultimate round , with residual target .
We 'll assume that it is actually possible to achieve the target .
Suppose that
( 1 )
( 2 )
( 3 )
Three rounds left - illustration
are the numbers in the remaining boxes .
We 'll show how to find the best strategy to reach the target .
Suppose thatof the boxes have value at least , and assume - otherwise the target will definitely be reached in one selection .
One possible strategy whenis to have two shots at reachingwith one box .
The success frequency out of the 132 possible box choices , using the argument deployed above , isNow suppose Louise aims to reach the target in two steps , and .
Supposewithand , but : we will prove that aiming to stop at , then at , is at least as good as aiming for , then .
The first strategy works if firstand thenare banked ; or ifis not reached , butis achieved in the last round .
Simple counting , as in the example above , shows that the success frequency is The second one works if bothand thenare banked , or ifis not reached , butis scored in the last round ; whenis banked , we must separate the cases when the first box has a value less than , or is at least .
The overall success frequency is thusInspection shows that this cannot exceed ( 2 ) , as .
So our claim is proved .
There may be several candidate pairssatisfying the given conditions ; the best choice amongst them is that pair that maximises the value of ( 2 ) .
( When , so that it is not possible to reachin one round , then aiming for , then , or for , the nhave the same chance of success . )
Finally , suppose thatand , but also .
Here seeking to banktwice is clearly better than aiming forfirst .
The success frequency isOptimal play in the penultimate round comes from whichever of the expressions ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) is largest , across all relevant choices ofand
Things become quite a lot more complicated when there are three rounds left .
To get a feel for what 's going on , let 's look at a particular example .
Suppose that the 13 remaining boxes contain the twelve amounts noted above for the first game played , along with a box containing the number 3 .
For any residual target , we can find optimal play by considering as putative stop values each of the 13 box values , and exploring the consequences for whichever of them is selected next .
We used a programmed computer to find the best initial stop value and the overall success chance .
The results are shown in table 1 .
Optimal play reaches any residual target of 6 or below , scores above 56 are impossible .
There are 13 × 12×11=1716 possible choices for the three boxes .
Table 1 : Suppose values { 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 20} are in the last 13 boxes .
For the residual targets shown , the optimal quantity to seek to bank on the first move is shown ( ' Best aim ' ) , as is the frequency ( out of 1716 occasions ) that this strategy , followed by optimal strategy in the remaining two rounds , would achieve the target .
For some targets , there are several optimal strategies ; only that with the lowest initial target is given .
The calculations for table 1 apply specifically to 13 boxes listed .
The subtle changes demonstrate how impractical it is to find best play in a TV studio , with no pre-programmed computer at hand to run through the possibilities .
However , the margin of superiority of the best play , over its nearest rivals , may be very thin .
The corresponding calculations for a range of other collections of 13 boxes reinforce a message seen in the table : Louise must not be too cautious - even for a target as low as 14 over three rounds , she should not " safely " bank 5 or 6 .
She can ill afford to waste boxes with high values .
Starting at the beginning - maximising the mean
Using backward induction to work out the best strategy rapidly becomes very hard , so let 's take another approach , starting at the beginning .
One strategy might be to look at all the possible stopping values in each round and to choose the one that , on average , gives the highest score .
Suppose that , in the first round , Louise intends to stop at .
There are boxes whose value is at least , and she succeeds , but boxes where she would fail , so her mean score is
How much should you aim to bank first ?
This is maximised at 5.5 whenis either 10 or 11 .
In later rounds , suppose the valuesremain in the lastboxes .
It can not be optimal to stop at a value not in this list , and the mean score obtained is maximised by stopping at that valuefor whichis largest .
Detailed analysis shows that using this for the first two rounds gives an overall mean score offrom these rounds , just over twice the best mean value from the first box .
We have run computer simulations of this strategy for all ten rounds : we found that the mean score was 55.7 ( with standard deviation of 13.6 ) , and that the respective chances of reaching targets of 50 , 60 , 70 and 80 are about 72 % , 44 % , 20 % and 5 % .
This strategy is not as good as one that pays regard to the actual target , but it indicates floors for Louise ’s chances of success .
We saw earlier that , where a desired sum could arise both in one step , or as the sum of two values , in the last two rounds , it might not be best to go for two roughly equal values .
By contrast , earlier in the game , suppose there are several pairs for which the sums are equal .
Among these pairs , the highest chance of banking both sums in the next two rounds will arise when and are as close together as possible .
This suggests aiming to bank similar amounts in each of the early rounds , when it 's difficult to work out an optimal strategy from the backward induction .
Starting at the beginning - going for the same R
So suppose that , over the full ten rounds , Louise uses the same stop value each time , irrespective of the unfolding outcomes .
Since we 'll be thinking in multiples of , we 'll assume that for some integer - if is not exactly divisible by , then we simply " round it up " to the next biggest integer that is .
As Louise chooses ten boxes at random , she has
equally likely choices .
The chance she achieves her targetis just the fraction of times her selections of stop values lead to a total ofor more over the full ten rounds .
Recall that boxes contain or more , and boxes have less than .
Thus , with a fixed stop value of ,
Table 2 : For a range of targets , the best fixed stop values , and the success frequencies ( out of N = 184,756 ) .
( Considerations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) below are ignored . )
choices will score exactly .
and sochoices will score at least .
Louise 's chance of reachingis .
We can use this to work out optimal stop valuesfor each target .
For some targets there are several possible fixed stop values – e.g. 72 might come from six 12s , eight 9s , or nine 8s .
Table 2 shows the figures only for the best methods in such cases .
We can do much better than these figures in places : for example , the stop value of 11 achieves a total of 66 in 60,626 ways , so totals of 63 , 64 or 65 can also be reached at least that often .
Two obvious modifications , that can only increase her chance of success , are :
if ever the box containing R is revealed , the stop value in later rounds can safely be increased to the next lowest score in the remaining boxes ; if her residual target falls below R , so her stop value drops .
Practical strategies
Table 2 shows that using a constant stop value can succeed , at least half the time , for all targets up to 60 .
However , table 1 illustrates the difficulties of making the best decision , with only three rounds left , even for a modest residual score .
So what is Louise 's best strategy ?
Before each round , she knows the average sum needed to meet the target : if there are rounds to go , then the average target per round is .
One possible strategy is to use the minimum stop value that would bank That amount .
Computer simulations of this strategy are not encouraging , especially for low targets .
It does not get good value from high scoring boxes in the early rounds , where the remaining average is 8 or less .
It turns out to be uniformly inferior to the two strategies we discuss next .
The calculations needed for optimum play in the last two rounds are not too hard , so we assume that Louise uses the best strategy from that stage , and that she always pays regard to factors ( a ) and ( b ) .
An easy to recall strategy is to simply seek to bank the value that maximises the mean score obtained for the first eight rounds .
Alternatively , in a gesture at tailoring the strategy to the target , and based on aiming to bank a similar amount each round , Louise could use the following strategy :
A. Select a stop value for round one , and decrease ( increase ) that value by one unit if ahead of ( behind ) the pro rata target during round two to seven ;
B . In round eight , note the residual target , and use a stop value based on a " smoothed " version of table 1 .
By " smooth " in step B , we acknowledge that table 1 was constructed for a specific list of the last 13 boxes , but we will be guided by the pattern shown therein : for residual targets up to 28 , gradually increase the stop value to 12 , and use table 1 for higher targets .
Computer simulations lead to the following recommendations as stop values for step A :
For , use 9 or 10 ;
, use 9 or 10 ; for , use 10 ;
, use 10 ; for , use 10 or 11 ;
, use 10 or 11 ; for , use 11 ;
, use 11 ; for , use 11 or 12 .
The success rates for these two strategies are very similar , ranging from around 85 % when to about 10 % when .
The success rate does not quite fall linearly : in round figures , each time increases by one unit , the percentage chances of success drop by 2.5 up to , then by 3 up to , and finally by 2 up to .
Neither strategy is optimal , but we suggest that perfect play will do only slightly better .
Luck plays a large role , and optimal play , even if identified , is by no means a guarantee of success !
Variations
The extra difficulty of hitting higher targets is not matched by a corresponding increase in prize value .
If the target will always be in the range 50 to 80 , then the utility of the potential prize to most contestants will not change dramatically .
And an 85 % chance to win £ 50 K is far more attractive than a 30 % chance to win £ 70 K .
Perhaps the prize for reaching might increase more rapidly than linearly , for ?
One can imagine two ( or more ) players competing in a contest to see who could obtain the highest total score , for a given set of boxes ( which they would take turns to select ) .
Each player would have a hidden button to press , indicating when they wished to bank the current total displayed ; the scores and box values would be revealed round by round .
As in the TV programme Countdown the winners could take on new opponents , with periodic championships between the most successful players .

Indian security researchers have released proof - of - concept code that can be used to take over a computer running Microsoft 's upcoming Windows 7 operating system , despite earlier promising not to make the code public for fear it could be misused .
VBootkit 2.0 was developed by researchers Vipin Kumar and Nitin Kumar and is now available for download under an open - source license .
They unveiled the proof - of - concept code at the Hack In The Box ( HITB ) security conference in Dubai last month , where they showed how it could be used to give an attacker complete control over a Windows 7 computer , including the ability to remove and restore user passwords without a trace and strip DRM ( digital rights management ) protections from media files .
" We do n't have any plans to make it open source , due to chances of misuse , " Nitin Kumar wrote in an April 27 e-mail .
In an e-mail announcing the release of the VBootkit 2.0 , Vipin Kumar did not offer a reason for their apparent change of heart .
But in a follow - up message , he said they wanted to help spur other researchers to develop new defenses against these types of attacks .
" All we are trying to do is help more people understand the real enemy , malware , so new innovations can occur , " Vipin Kumar wrote .
Microsoft does n't consider VBootkit 2.0 a serious threat .
" Any claims made at the event relating to Windows 7 having a security vulnerability are not true , " the software maker said in an e-mail statement .
Microsoft 's assertion is technically true .
VBootkit 2.0 does not exploit a security vulnerability .
Instead , it exploits a design flaw in the operating system , which assumes that the boot process can be trusted and is safe from attack .
VBootkit 2.0 works by modifying files as they are loaded into the main memory of a computer , a type of attack that Windows 7 is not designed to stop on its own .
This type of attack can be blocked by using BitLocker Drive Encryption ( BDE ) and a Trusted Platform Module , but these features will not be available on many Windows 7 computers .
Microsoft also cited the nature of the VBootkit 2.0 demonstration as further evidence that it does n't present a threat .
" With the scenario we have seen reported there is no question of Windows 7 being broken into or comprised remotely -- by an attacker using a malicious exploit over the Internet for example , " Microsoft said .
However , VBootkit 2.0 is only a proof of concept , meant to illustrate that an attack can work .
The code can be modified by an attacker and used for a remote attack , as has been done with other bootkit attacks , Nitin Kumar said .

So if you 're a lady looking to score some attention from the lesser sex , but are n't ready to go topless ( I urge you to reconsider ) , you may want to mod yourself a Nintendo purse .
Thanks to modder Jeri Ellsworth 's creation , nerds everywhere finally understand the purpose of the purse .
Hers has a built - in LCD and two velcro - on NES controllers for some on - the - go Super Mario Bros .
The guts of the purse are made from one of those system - on - a - chip deals that modders worldwide are so fond of , and the screen is just taken from a portable DVD player .
The system also has a Commodore 64 on a chip and some other basic computing capabilities .
Which .... is that Joust ?
ZOMG , Jeri , tell me you 're in the DC area -- I 'll meet you out for a drink !
And not just to steal your purse .
Okay , to steal your purse .
Do n't hate -- I look good with a manbag !

id Software Acquired by Bethesda Owner ZeniMax
" id Software will continue to operate as a studio under the direction of its founder , John Carmack , " vowed ZeniMax .
" No changes will be made in the operations of id Software in the development of its games .
All the principals at id Software have signed long - term employment contracts , assuring they will continue in their roles ... at the studio . "
Founded as an independent game developer in 1991 , id Software is currently working on the post - apocalyptic shooter RAGE ( PC , PS3 , 360 ) and the long - awaited Doom 4 .
" Our intention is to make sure id Software will continue to do what they do best -- make AAA games , " said ZeniMax CEO Robert Altman .
" Our role will be to provide publisher support through Bethesda Softworks and give id Software the resources it needs to grow and expand . "
Going forward , Bethesda will handle publishing duties for all future id Software games , " other than upcoming releases previously committed to other publishers . "
Last year , id signed a publishing deal with EA Partners over RAGE .
" This was a unique opportunity to team with a smart , sophisticated publisher like Bethesda Softworks where the interests of the studio and the publisher will be fully aligned in the development and marketing of our titles , " explained id CEO Todd Hollenshead .
" We will now have financial and business resources to support the future growth of id ... a huge advantage which will result in more and even better games . "
Along with The Elder Scrolls series and Fallout 3 maker Bethesda , other studios under the ZeniMax umbrella include casual developer Vir2L and ZeniMax Online , which is working on an MMO strongly rumored to be set in The Elder Scrolls universe .
" As trite as it may be for me to say that I am extremely pleased and excited about this deal , I am , " noted id technical director and founder John Carmack .
" This puts id Software in a wonderful position going forward .
We will now be able to grow and extend all of our franchises under one roof , leveraging our capabilities across multiple teams while enabling forward looking research to be done in the service of all of them . "
" We 're really getting kind of tired competing with our own publishers in terms of how our titles will be featured , " Carmack added in a Kotaku interview .
" And we 've really gotten more IPs than we 've been able to take advantage of .
And working with other companies has n't been working out as spectacularly as it could . "

The simple answer to the question how did Barack Obama win the 2008 election would be that people wanted change , but as MSNBC ’s Chuck Todd and Sheldon Gawiser reveal in their book How Barack Obama
Won that the reasons for Obama ’s victory are n’t as simple as you might think .
How Barack Obama
Won is worth reading if only for Chuck Todd ’s 48 page introduction that analyzes the 2008 race .
One of Todd ’s major points is that Barack Obama won because he could tell people why he was running for president .
He points out that neither Clinton nor McCain could ever clearly explain why they were running , and if a candidate can’t tell voters why they are in the race , they usually also struggle to explain to voters why they should support them .
Obama was clear about why he was running and spent the next two years echoing the same themes .
This book is full of interesting statistics that dispel some of the simple myths about Obama ’s success .
For instance , Obama only carried four of the top ten states with the highest proportion of voters under 30 .
However , Obama carried seven of the ten states with the lowest proportion of voters under 30 years old .
Despite giving Obama around 70 % of their supports , they were n’t what powered Obama .
The Democrat won because middle age voters went away from the Republican Party in 2008 .
The top ten states with the most senior citizens split evenly for Obama and McCain , so the myth that older voters went solidly for McCain does n’t hold up either .

One of the biggest lessons here is that the Republican Party sowed the seeds of their own demise with their immigration policy .
Hispanic voters were critical to Obama ’s success .
Obama carried eight of the top ten states in proportion of Hispanic voters , and demographic trends in the two that he did n’t carry , Arizona and Texas , are showing signs of becoming potential battleground states in the future .
After Todd ’s introduction , the book is divided into sections titled Battleground States , Receding Battleground States , Emerging Battleground States , and Red and Blue States .
Each state gets its own chapter consisting of how the state voted in past presidential elections , how the state voted in 2008 , and an analysis of the political direction the state is trending towards .
This sounds like a great deal of material but the authors cover it in highly narrative fashion over a few pages .
The book is only 258 pages long , but it is loaded with information , and is bound to teach even the most devout political zealot something that they did n’t know .
The potential pitfall with this type of book is that the narrative can become buried in a sea of polling data and numbers .
Todd and Gawiser avoid this problem by using only relevant polling data and returns to tell the story .
Interestingly , the story they tell is one not only of how Obama won , but also how McCain lost .
It looks at the possibility of Democratic realignment , and points out just how much work Republicans have to do at both the state and national levels before they will be competitive again .
This is a book that I can’t recommend highly enough .
It is well worth your time .

What does it mean when there is significant evidence of election fraud , and our media and government refuse to address it ?
It means that we no longer live in a true democracy .
That is the state of America today .
George Carlin was right , ~ “ Politicians are there to give you the illusion of choice . ” ( mp3 – clean ) *
For example , we had a president that liked war and torture .
A true alternative would be a President that would end the war and torture .
Obama has condoned both of those abominable Bush practices , he ’s actually ramping up the war .
Obama even kept the same Secretary of Defense and the same Goldman Sachs “ Bailout ” team to give away your money to the banksters .
The illusion of choice .
On a positive note , millions of Americans have been trying for years to wake up the “ sheeple ” blindly following a corrupt president ’s evil actions in lockstep .
Now that Obama is in charge , those same people that blindly followed the Bush / Cheney horror are now Mad as Hell at the goverment .
Finally !
The question now is , will the activists that fought so hard to end the war , step down and accept it now that it ’s Obama ’s war ?
Will the Democrats become the new sheeple , blindly following the President ’s bad ( corrupt ) decisions simply because he ’s “ their guy ” ?
I do n’t think so .
That is why we have a unique opportunity right now .
This generation of Americans has the chance to break through the Divide and Conquer tactics of our rulers and unite behind a common cause , the future of our children .
This $ 12.8 TRILLION dollar giveaway is actually a blessing in disguise , because nobody is buying it .
Republicans , Democrats , Independents , we ’re all Mad as Hell .
We all know this “ bailout ” is akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham , robbing from the poor to give to the rich .
Now we are faced with a true choice .
Do we allow this unfettered greed and corruption to continue , hoping that we can vote out the incumbents during the next election ?
Or do we realize that we are beyond voting , knowing that 80 % of America ’s ballots are counted by machine , in secret , by two companies ( ES&S & Diebold ) ‘ coincidentally ’ run by brothers .
This point needs to be drilled home : Elections will not solve anything .
For years I ’ve been hoping for a Mosh ( video ) like moment where citizens descend on the capitol , overwhelm the police and take over Congress .
Yet this is increasingly unlikely , especially now that there is a military brigade deployed in DC .
Then it hit me , the solution is to confront each member of Congress in their home district .
On July 4th !
Every CongressCritter goes to their home state and attends an Independance Day Parade where they can kiss babies and pose for the cameras .
This July 4th is going to be different .
This time when they stand up to give their speech , they ’ll be facing an angry mob of citizens , no longer divided by the false Republican vs Democrat scam .
This July 4th we ’ll be united in our anger at this blatantly corrupt government .
Are we supposed to just submit like cowards ?
Are we supposed to remain willfully ignorant , hoping that Obama ’s going to start the real change in next year ?
Hoping that Jeb Bush or Sarah Palin will save us in 2012 ?
Yeah right .
In America , we are allowed to make a citizen ’s arrest when we see a crime .
The practice dates back to medieval England and the English common law , when sheriffs encouraged ordinary citizens to help apprehend law breakers .
Well , we see the crimes committed by this government , and we see that the current crop of Politicians are not going to fix the situation .
“ The system ” has failed .
There is no white knight coming to save us .
We ’re going to have to save ourselves .
Some might say , “ What about the police ?
Let ’s get them to join us . ”
By all means , that would be wonderful , however , Upton Sinclair was right ,
“ It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it . ”
The police , like the military and many others , do n’t want to know - it ’s easier that way .
It ’s up to those of us that do know , to take the necessary action .
As Malcom X said ( mp3 ) ,
“ Since the Federal Government has shown that it is n’t going to do anything about it , but talk .
Then it is a duty , it is your and my duty , as men , as human beings .. it is our duty to our people . ”
Now , to be clear , we are not calling for violence .
We are calling for The People to voice themselves , for The Angry Mob that is sure to be present at each and every 4th of July speech by our “ Representatives ” , to speak loud and clear about how they feel about our current Congress .
It might start with the crowd booing during the Critter ’s speech .
( roflmao video !
Perhaps next time instead of a beach ball , someone will bring a basket of rotten tomatoes ; o ) )
It ’s important to note that this speech was at a Tea Party where the 4000 strong Republican crowd booed the Republican critter .
This proves the anger is non-partisan , we ’re not standing behind any politician just because they ’re from ‘ our party ’ – we are n’t buying that BS anymore .
It might start when one member of the crowd yells out , “ I ’m mad as hell and I ’m not going to take it anymore !!! ” ( video )
And then another yells out , and another … .
Or maybe it will be the impassioned speech of one individual that will galvanize the crowd ( video ) into the realization at just how badly they ’ve been screwed , and the realization that we outnumber them !
Like this crowd ( video ) , we see our countrymen beaten and brutalized , and we know it has got to stop .
So it starts with two people charging the field , and then the floodgates open … the police have no choice , either stand down or be overrun .
The angry mob , having collared the criminal , will take the “ Representative ” up on stage , in full view of the media cameras , and deliver a list of charges ( to be developed ) , then read the miranda rights while the criminal is placed under citizen ’s arrest .
( No cuffs ?
Use plastic zip - ties like the military . )
The next few hours might consist of a spontaneous debate with the crowd present electing a temporary representative , with the full understanding that a new election is to be held within months .
For the first election in our return to true democracy , all ballots will be counted by hand , with the results posted locally and digitally at every level - precinct , city , county , state .
This is the only way to ensure an honest count - with results posted in such a way that local citizens can verify the results .**
Sure , this seems like an impossible dream , but what the hell , go big or go home , eh .
*******************************************
Ideally this idea would take off on the net like Susan Boyle , but even if that does n’t happen , know that you can still do it .
Even if there is no mass movement for citizen ’s arrests on July 4th , there could still be one or two .
If someone , somewhere has the connections and resources to organize a few dozen Mad as Hell Citizens ….
that could be enough to get the ball rolling and make at least one arrest in their town .
This one event would surely be nationwide news , “ Angry Mob Arrests Feinstein in SF – Says She ’s Guilty of Corruption , Treason ”
… and thus the Revolution began .
* To be clear - I am not advocating a “ coup ” .
A coup has already taken place in America .
The government is no longer of , by and for the people .
The government has been hijacked by corporations .
Congressmembers are hardly “ public servants ” any longer , they are useful idiots that vote on bills they do n’t even read .
What I am advocating is a restoration of our Republic , in a 100 % peaceful manner .
** To contrast , our state ’s current system has the Diebold central tabulator count all votes , then the paper ballots are shipped to the state warehouse .
Even if there is a recount , there is no way of knowing if the ballot boxes have been switched since voting day .
NASA scientists modeled freezing conditions on Mars to test whether liquid water could have been present to form the surface features of the Martian landscape .
Researchers report that fluids loaded with dissolved minerals containing elements such as silicon , iron , magnesium , potassium and aluminum , can remain in a liquid state at temperatures well below freezing .
The results of this research appear in the May 21 issue of Nature magazine entitled " Stability Against Freezing of Aqueous Solutions on Early Mars . "
" We found that the salts in water solutions can reduce the melting point of water , which may help explain how liquid water existed in a frozen Martian environment , " said Alberto Fairén , a space scientist at NASA Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif . and the lead author of the study .
To understand what formed the surface features on Mars , scientists have focused on the early Martian conditions .
Was early Mars warm and wet , or cold and dry ?
Surface features throughout most of the Martian landscape suggest the presence of water ponds ranging from seas to lakes , and rivers and gullies formed by flowing water , which imply that early Mars was wet .
But there also is some evidence that suggests that Mars may have been permanently cold , with global temperatures well below the freezing point of pure water .
To study the ' liquidity ' of water on Mars , climate modelers first simulated various concentrations of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere .
They found that these gases cannot efficiently raise the surface temperature above freezing .
A greenhouse atmosphere produced by carbon dioxide and water would have been saturated well below freezing .
In addition , the amount of methane needed to raise the surface temperature above freezing , implies the planet had a terrestrial - like biological source for its methane supply , according to previous investigations .
Scientists then took another approach and looked at water solutions containing weathering basalts , similar to those seen at the Mars landing sites .
They calculated these fluids ' freezing points and evaporative processes .
Results showed that a significant amount of weathering fluids containing silicon , iron , magnesium , calcium , chloride , sodium , potassium and aluminum remain in the liquid at temperatures well below freezing .
In addition , they studied the minerals that precipitated in the liquid solutions over time .
These minerals are similar to those actually found on the Martian surface .
Scientists concluded that salty liquid water on Mars may explain the stability of fluids against freezing on the Martian surface at temperatures below 0°C .
" Our goal was to learn how a combination of different processes of evaporation and freezing affect the freezing point of a hypothetical Martian solution .
We also wanted to see how the liquid phases formed and destabilized over the evolution of different solutions , " added Alfonso Davila , a co-author of the paper at NASA Ames Research Center , Moffett Field , Calif .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Germany confirmed its first three cases of swine flu on Wednesday , marking the arrival of the virus in the heart of continental Europe .
The Robert Koch Institute , a federal agency for infectious diseases , said it found swine flu in a man and a woman in their late 30s in Bavaria , and a 22 - year - old woman in Hamburg .
Authorities said all three of those infected with the new H1N1 virus had recently returned from Mexico .
Spain and Britain have both identified two cases of the virus each , but no infections have yet been confirmed in central or eastern Europe , according to latest reports .
Polish authorities said they were waiting for test results from two suspected cases .
German officials said the first man identified in Bavaria was from Mallersdorf , with the woman , 37 , from Kulmbach further north .
Doctors in Regensburg confirmed the infections .
Medical authorities are known to be investigating five other suspected incidences of swine flu in Germany .
These include a further Bavarian case , and another three in the state of North Rhine - Westphalia .
The fifth suspected case involves a married couple from the northern city of Braunschweig who had recently returned from New York .
The wife has already tested negative for the virus .
Pig futures prices in Germany fell slightly on Tuesday due to concerns over the spread of swine flu from Mexico .
The new H1N1 virus has been confirmed around the world but Mexico remains the only country with deaths -- 159 by the government ’s estimate -- and the epicenter of the outbreak .

I saw an interesting question on stack overflow wherein the questioner asks why everyone keeps telling him that he has to learn C++ to be a professional developer .
Although it is true that most of these discussions are just launching pads for religious wars and I ’m not alone in my assertion that your language of choice is largely irrelevant , I do agree with the perhaps controversial notion that every working programmer should be at least conversant , if not fluent in C ++.
Let me be entirely clear about this .
I am not saying that C++ has to be your primary language or that you need to be a C++ guru to work in this business .
However , it behooves you to be able to competently read and write basic code in this language .
That is , you should at the very least be able to implement the FizzBuzz program and the cliched example of a Zoo program to demonstrate polymorphism without lifting someone else ’s code .
Before you dismiss me as a platform snob , consider the following six reasons that you need to know C++
1 . You should learn C++ for the same reasons that people study dead languages like Latin .
The syntax and other memes in higher level languages were inspired by or directly stolen from C++.
This is blatantly obvious for Java , C# , and JavaScript .
Learning C++ is a quick way to grok the syntax for a several languages at once and better understand their origins .
2. Understanding the details that are abstracted away from you in other languages ( pointers , basic data structures , garbage collection , etc. ) will ultimately make you more adept at solving problems when the abstractions innevitably leak or the stalwart underlying technology does n’t live up to its stalwartitude .
Consider the real world example of anti-lock breaks , which allow you to maintain control of a car during an emergency stop .
ABS has a completely idiot proof interface – Jam foot on pedal– that works just whether or not you understand that it will electronically pump the breaks to prevent the wheels from locking .
However , during an attempt to thwart an impending moose collision it is certainly comforting to understand why the car is stopping in jerks instead of a smooth motion despite steady pressure on the pedal .
Also , this knowledge might have prevented my wife from listening to a shady mechanic who conned her into thinking that she had to pay his exorbitant rate to fix her ABS system since the truck was n’t safe to drive without it to another mechanic for a second opinion .
3 . Like it or not , C++ is the lingua franca of programming .
Some would argue for Java , or even JavaScript , which may appear true in much the same way that the ocean appears to contain water because of all the wet swimmers who frequent it .
It ’s best just to accept this , but if you need reinforcement all you need to know is that Software Jesus ( Joel Spolsky ) agrees with me * on this , case closed .
4. Programmers and programming books that need to address programmers who speak an unknown or different language often use C++ for the same reasons noted in point # 3 .
Learning this language will open access to more learning material and help you communicate with the programming community more easily .
5 . One day you are going to need sully yourself and interface directly to a C API from the lofty perch of your high level language .
In my experience a lot of tool developers avoid the hassle of maintaining separate COM , .NET , and Java API ’s by just providing a a C API that will appease all the peasants who are not as privileged as they to “ work in a real language . ”
6. C++ on your resume can often lead to Salary ++.
I ’ve found this is true even if the job does n’t require any C++ programming .
It is just respected as a more hardcore language and the credibility rubs off on those who use it .
That credibility makes you more valuable .
* Update :
As noted by a commenter ( BTW : Thanks for the correction ) , Joel did make a definite distinction that new programmers should be learning C and not necessarily C++.
Apologies for misstating his position .
While it is true that for just many of the points I made , you could easily substitute C for C++ and get the same bang for your buck , I contend that C++ is a stronger foundational language for the points detailed in 1,3 , and 4 .
Using a language that ca n’t talk about objects ( C ) to communicate with other programmers in an overwhelmingly OOP world is n’t gonna cut it .

Berries – Ingredients in Anti-Aging Skincare
UV Environmental stress and the natural aging process generate free radicals .
These are unstable oxygen molecules that are short of an electron .
Free radicals can be likened to molecular hammers that hack away at our skin cells until they are neutralized by an electron donor .
Scientists have discovered a compound known as matrix metalloprotease ( MMP ) , it plays a key role in the skin ’s response to damage by free radicals .
MMP ’s set off a biological chain reaction called an enzyme cascade , the reaction speeds up the breakdown and elimination of collagen .
Unless the activation of MMP ’s can be stopped , collagen is broken down and eliminated faster than your skin can produce it .
Wrinkles , fine lines and rough spot follow soon thereafter .
A recent study has found that ellagic acid , an antioxidant found in numerous fruits , vegetables and nuts , ( especially raspberries , strawberries , cranberries and pomegranates ) can protect the skin against UV damage by blocking the production of MMP in damaged skin cells and by reducing inflammation .
Consider toning your face with a homemade preparation of aloe vera and berry juice .
You can use an assortment of berries or simply squeeze the juice of one of the berries listed above , and mix with a teaspoon of aloe vera gel .
Alternatively , look for a readymade product that includes berries in its ingredient list .

Tactics play a vital role in the game of chess .
Tactics is everything in chess .
Chess , as you all know , is a fair game with no room for chance or luck whatsoever to either of the players .
The players ultimately decide the fate of their result in the game .
A slight lapse of concentration , a slight miscalculation or a little oversight is just sufficient to allow your opponent to say checkmate to you .
Tactics might just involve distracting the opponent ’s pieces , sacrificing pieces to achieve a broader goal , mating threats , checks , and all such other things .
Let me explain the role of tactics by way of an example where a literally losing position for the black pieces has not only been avoided , but the black went on to win the game in the next 3 - 4 moves .
This is the position after 38 moves , and white has to move next :
White to Move
Black to Move
A closer look at the position shows that White is in a stronger position with more possibilities for winning .
The Black king at g8 is vulnerable , in that if White rook at b7 gives a check from b8 , then black king has no option but to move to g7 .
One tactic here for white might be to arrest the movement of Black King to g7 , which would then result in a checkmate .
White ’s bishop at d2 can be moved to h6 for this purpose .
It is essential that a chess player visualizes at least 2 - 3 moves in advance and plans his moves taking into consideration all other possible alternatives , such that his goal or tactics succeeds .
Before jumping into the move straightaway , let us see what would be the possible response from black for this move .
Black , visualizing the threat of mate if no action is taken , might have no other alternative but to capture the white bishop at h6 using the Knight at g4 .
What will happen if Black Knight at g4 takes the bishop at h6 ?
One may also notice that the Black queen at e2 and black rook at c4 are in a single diagonal .
White might think of moving the bishop at g2 to f1 , which will result in a discovered check by Queen .
At the same time , the Black Queen can be captured at ease by White bishop making it simpler for White to say checkmate .
The vulnerability of Black ’s position and the advantages or possible moves for White , which is to move now , is depicted in the following diagram .
So , the White , considering all possible options , has taken the right decision of moving the bishop at d2 to h6 , harassing the Black King at g2 .
Now the position would be as follows :
Black is facing a potential checkmate now as the next move by White , moving the rook at b7 to b8 will be a checkmate .
Let us look at the position closely from the black ’s point of view .
What are the possible options available to Black to thwart the White ’s move .
One thing is he can consider moving the black bishop at f6 to e5 to thwart the White rook ’s move to b8 .
White may then move the bishop at g2 to f1as the black queen and black rook are in a single diagonal .
This move by white ’s bishop will also block the Black knight at g4 .
What might be the other possibility for Black now ?
The white King at h1 is also not very safe .
It is equally vulnerable as is the Black king in g8 .
One possible option for Black might be to threaten the White king with a check .
The Black knight at g4 is at a good position to threaten with a check by moving to f2 .
The response from White for that check from Black knight would be either to move the King to h2 or capture the Knight at f2 by Queen .
If the King is moved to h2 , then Black can move the bishop at f6 to e5 and the check would be the final nail in the coffin for white , leading to checkmate .
If the White queen captures the black knight at f2 , then Black rook at c4 can be moved to c1 for giving check at White king .
Now white has no other option but to use his bishop at h6 to capture the black rook at c1 .
By this move , Black has successfully thwarted the threat of mate from White and also is in a great position to capture the White queen placed at f2 .
This will be a great opportunity for black to win .
The game concluded as follows :
39 . Bh6 Nf2 +
40 . Qxf2 Rc1 +
And ,
White resigned the game conceding the defeat .
This is what tactics is all about .

The scarcity of water in California has reached astounding levels .
The state is looking to various means and resources to remedy this situation .
According to Scripps , aboutÂ Â 20 water agencies up and down the California coast are favoring desalination projects as a method to deal with drought .
“ People are worried about water supply , ” said Michael Carlin , assistant general manager of water at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission .
“ Desalination is for drought supply , for an emergency , and it augments existing supply — it ’s another tool in our toolbox . ”
Poseidon Resources , a Connecticut based water Â infrastructure development company , has recently gained approval from CaliforniaÂ state regulatorsÂ to build the Western Hemisphereâ€™s largest desalination plant in Carlsbad ( near San Diego ) .

The $ 300 million Carlsbad Desalination Project will have significant economic benefits for the region , including an estimated $ 170 million in spending during construction , 2,100 jobs created during construction and $ 37 million in annual spending throughout the region once the desalination plant is operational .
But desalination is a highly contested issue as many environmentalists regard it as a quick fix that can cause more harm in the long term , than good .
Â
The briny byproduct of desalination is typically dumped into the ocean and tends to sink to the bottom as a salty , oxygen deficient plume .
This can be detrimental to marine life and fisheries nearby .
Food & Water Watch has put together a list of reasons as to why communities should think twice before diving into desalination projects .

But he is expected to sign a classified order in coming weeks that will create the military cybercommand , officials said .
It is a recognition that the United States already has a growing number of computer weapons in its arsenal and must prepare strategies for their use  as a deterrent or alongside conventional weapons  in a wide variety of possible future conflicts .
The White House office will be run by a “ cyberczar , ” but because the position will not have direct access to the president , some experts said it was not high - level enough to end a series of bureaucratic wars that have broken out as billions of dollars have suddenly been allocated to protect against the computer threats .
The main dispute has been over whether the Pentagon or the National Security Agency should take the lead in preparing for and fighting cyberbattles .
Under one proposal still being debated , parts of the N.S.A. would be integrated into the military command so they could operate jointly .
Officials said that in addition to the unclassified strategy paper to be released by Mr. Obama on Friday , a classified set of presidential directives is expected to lay out the military ’s new responsibilities and how it coordinates its mission with that of the N.S.A. , where most of the expertise on digital warfare resides today .
The decision to create a cybercommand is a major step beyond the actions taken by the Bush administration , which authorized several computer - based attacks but never resolved the question of how the government would prepare for a new era of warfare fought over digital networks .
Cruise the Internet today and you can find the complete technical specifications of several different variants of Y - Wing ( “ The Y - wing ’s weapons are controlled by a Fabritech ANc - 2.7 tracking computer with a SI 5g7 “ Quickscan ” vector imaging system ” ) , despite the fact that no - one actually says the words “ Y - Wing ” in any of the films .
With fans feverishly mining the films for more information , the giant that is Lucasfilm and all of its many licensees have been quick to give the people what they wanted over the years .
For starters , they had to have names to put on all those obscure action figures ; you ’ll sell a lot of Han Solos , of course , but there ’s extra money to be made targeting the completionist collector who ca n’t rest until he ’s got his mitts on a ( pristine , unopened ) Ree -Yees or Bib Fortuna .
Then as the Star wars Expanded Universe ( EU ) grew larger and larger , a host of licensed content authors and creators ( most huge Star Wars fanboys themselves ) took what opportunities they could to authenticise their own works by somehow connecting them directly with the Holy Grail that was the films themselves , no matter how tenuously ; their brief might tell them that they were n’t allowed to write about Luke Skywalker in this particular short story or comic , but that did n’t mean that they were n’t allowed to create the entire life story of alien guy X in the background of the cantina scene in A New Hope who appeared for 12 frames and , thus , was once in the same room with Luke Skywalker .
Ahh , the reflected glory .
With these twin forces of demand and willing supply at work , there are not just few characters but few things that appear onscreen at anytime in the Star Wars films that do not have an officially approved name / explanation / biography recorded somewhere .
It is within these vast swathes of data that true Star Wars geekery lurks , loading up on truly superfluous information and arguing the merits of the Blastech DL - 44 ( Han Solo ’s gun ; illegal throughout the Empire ) versus the Bryar pistol ( Kyle Katarn ’s starter gun in the Dark Forces game ; a late Old Republic weapon highly valued by blaster aficionados .
Apparently . )
As something of a toe - dipping exercise into these murky waters , we look now at 10 non-speaking characters that pop up ( briefly ) in the films of the Original Trilogy – they may have no lines , but as we ’ll see , that does n’t stop them from often having a whole encyclopaedia ’s worth of past ( and sometimes future ) history assigned to their blink - and - you ’ll - miss - them selves .
After reading this you too will be able to put names to the faces ( or appendages ) and might stand a chance of impressing the next true Star Wars geek you meet at a party .
Well probably not a party ; but somewhere , anyway .

On Wednesday , Earth Day , members of the U.S. House were discussing climate change .
Lunatic fringe Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann , from Minnesota 's 6th , said that atmospheric carbon could n't possibly be bad for us , since it comes from " nature " .
Carbon dioxide , Mister Speaker , is a natural byproduct of nature .
Carbon dioxide is natural .
It occurs in Earth .
It is a part of the regular lifecycle of Earth .
In fact , life on planet Earth ca n’t even exist without carbon dioxide .
So necessary is it to human life , to animal life , to plant life , to the oceans , to the vegetation that ’s on the Earth , to the , to the fowl that — that flies in the air , we need to have carbon dioxide as part of the fundamental lifecycle of Earth .
Thankfully , our own Congressman Earl Blumenauer was available to state the obvious .
Along the way , he took " the gentlelady from Minnesota " to task for " making things up on the floor of the House . "

Two major outbreaks of garment workers ' fury have occurred this week .
On Sunday night ( May 10 ) at the Rupashi Sweater factory in Narayanganj ( a river port town in central Bangladesh and centre of jute and textiles industries ) bosses were attacked by a group of workers demanding their unpaid wages .
When they turned up for work on Monday morning , workers found themselves locked out of the factory .
The workers then marched to other factories - shouting slogans for higher wages - and brought out thousands of other workers .
( Some reports indicate that two groups of workers clashed at one factory - whether because they refused to join the demonstrators and / or because they were hurt when the factory was attacked is unclear .
Photos suggest the clash may have been between workers and security and management personnel of the factory attacked . )
The violence quickly spread - 15,000 workers came out on to the streets and around 14 factories were attacked and vandalised .
15 vehicles were damaged as two main inter-city highways were blocked for 4 hours ; the roads became a battleground between police and paramilitary forces ( including the recently mutinous Bangladeshi Rifles ) and enraged workers .
Huge numbers of security forces used teargas and baton charges to finally disperse the workers by 1 pm .
At Savar ( also in central Bangladesh , a center of textiles and agriculture ) garment workers used similar tactics .
The bosses had earlier promised payment of three months owed wages .
After failing to receive the arrears , on Monday afternoon hundreds of workers at the Doel Group factory first smashed some windows and office equipment ; they then walked off the job and barricaded the busy main highway for over an hour .
Police arrived ; " A witness said that the garment workers went berserk after police clubbed them . "
A furious battle began , with workers using sticks and bricks to repulse baton charges .
Police and paramilitaries resorted to tear gas and rubber bullets , finally clearing the area at 4 pm .
Workers trashed over 30 vehicles , including a police van .
50 people , including cops , were injured and one worker suffered a bullet injury .
These incidents are entirely typical of the increasing unrest in the garment industry .
Real wages have declined as inflation rises ; indicating how precarious and malnourished much of the workforce is , workers are now being given temporary food rations as an alternative to permanent wage increases .
Marilyn Musgrave is still taking her loss to Rep. Betsy Markey ( D - Colo . ) extremely hard .
After a tough loss in one of the most expensive elections in the country , the former congresswoman went underground for a while , not even thanking her campaign staff .
She now has wound up over at anti-abortion group the Susan B. Anthony List , hoping to “ get rid of the worst liberals in Congress . ”
She recently sent out a tersely worded , stunning four - page ( four - page ! ) missive reeking of bitterness , with underlined sentences , paragraphs in bold and even a postscript from the letterhead of “ Congressman Marilyn Musgrave ” announcing her latest campaign : the Votes Have Consequences grass - roots project that aims to “ expose pro-abortion politicians . ”
She mentions several times that people have spent a vast amount of money ( “ roughly $ 18 million ” ) to eject her from her seat .
She quotes the Bible : “ The truth shall set you free . ”
She then asks people to donate any denomination of money ( $ 25 to $ 5,000 ) so that they can “ spread the truth about [ liberals ’ ] destructive agendas , drag down their approval ratings , force them to publicly defend socialism , authoritarian gun-grabbing , gay marriage , infanticide and everything else they vote for in Washington , and , ultimately , on Nov. 2 , 2010 , we will take their jobs away from them . ”
She even sneaks in a dig at the RNC .
She adds in the letter that she wants to “ attack liberal candidates who deserve to be attacked and to defend conservatives when the Republican National Committee is nowhere to be found . ”
Plus :
“ In other words , we ’ll do to them what the most rapid and relentless left - wing groups did to me over the past six years , with one major difference :
We will tell the truth ! ”
It says that , in a few months , more details about who they ’re targeting will come to surface , but “ our focus will be on the real hypocrites ... like politicians like Harry Reid who call themselves ‘ pro- life ’ during the campaign season , then go back to voting pro-abortion in Washington . ”
SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser told Shenanigans : “ We join a newly emboldened pro-life grass - roots army who is encouraged and excited by Marilyn Musgrave ’s leadership .
She is helping lead the Susan B. Anthony List exactly where we need to be , by leveraging the pro-abortion left ’s own shrewd strategy against itself . ”

Democratic Socialist Perspective
May 5 , 2009 --
All supporters of democracy and social justice have reason to be concerned by the recent events in the republic of Nepal .
The military high command , backed by right - wing parties tied to the country ’s elite , has openly defied the authority of the elected civilian government , led by the Unified Communist Party of Nepal - Maoist ( UCPN -M ) .
In response , the government sought to remove army chief of staff General Katawal , via legal and constitutional means .
Katawal refused to accept his removal and the government ’s decision was illegally overturned by President Ram Baran Yadav from the conservative Nepalese Congress party , whose position under the interim constitution is largely ceremonial .
With their coalition partners in government refusing to support the UCPN -M , Nepal ’s prime minister and UCPN -M leader Prachanda announced on May 3 that the Maoists had no choice but to resign and leave government .
The removal of the Maoists from government is nothing less than a coup .
It reveals the real situation in Nepal — that despite its democratic mandate for change , the Maoist - led government is being prevented by the old elite from implementing such change .
The Maoists are working to mobilise their large base of support among the poor majority for street demonstrations against this coup .
The peace accords signed by various parties in 2006 , on the back of a mass pro-democracy uprising , ended a decade - long armed struggle between the monarch ’s army and the Maoist - led People ’s Liberation Army .
The accords allowed for the April 2008 constituent assembly elections in which — against expectations — the Maoists won the most seats , receiving over 1 million votes more than their nearest competitor .
Seeking the widest possible consensus , the Maoists established a broad coalition government .
However , the UCPN - M’s proposals for a peaceful and democratic pro-poor transformation of Nepal that were endorsed at the ballot box have been frustrated by opposition within the parliament , the state and even the coalition government .
It is taken for granted all around the world that if the military is above the elected government and can act as it wishes , there is no democracy .
The Nepalese Army is infamous for its human rights abuses , including murder , torture and rape .
It has also been responsible for coups against civilian governments , and the top ranks of the army recently admitted to planning a fresh coup against the current elected government !
The Maoists have simply been attempting to implement the peace accords , under which the PLA fighters could be integrated into the army to create a new , unified military .
The army chiefs have refused to do this and instead recruited thousands of new , non-Maoist fighters , in violation of the accords .
The right - wing elite know that if the peace agreements are implemented , the army may stop being a weapon they can use to prevent social progress .
In recent years , the Nepalese people , among the world ’s poorest , have achieved giant strides forward .
A centuries - old feudal monarchy has been overturned and a republic declared .
The Nepalese people have voted for a transformation of their nation to one based on equality and pro-people development that ends poverty .
There is nothing more terrifying to the ruling classes globally than the sight of a people winning power .
The right - wing forces in Nepal are counting on the support of foreign powers , especially the United States and India .
Nepal ’s poor majority need our solidarity .
All those who believe in the principles of democracy and social justice , who believe that people should not be condemned to backbreaking poverty simply because the powerful have carved the world up among themselves , need to support the people of Nepal and insist that :
the Nepalese people must be allowed to determine their future , foreign intervention must end ;
the peace accords must be upheld ; and
democracy must be respected and the people ’s will implemented .

Certainly , if you cant bring them to your network , bring your network to them .
" We know we need killer applications for our network , " said Clearwire co-chair Ben Wolff , " And we know we are n't the folks to build the best applications .
That 's not our core competency .
So we are encouraging third parties to take advantage of our network . "
It 's no secret that the " third parties " that are based in Silicon Valley are among the tech industry 's leaders , companies such as Google , Cisco , Intel , HP , and Adobe to name only a few .
The network will be available before the end of this summer , and will be rolled out commercially in 2010 .

Several responses to How to Ruin Your Ability to Release Software asked " How does the company mentioned in the final paragraph do it ? "
The failed release management strategy of the first company is common .
If that 's so obviously wrong , how can anyone else do it right ?
The secret is simple .
Projects with frequent software releases can release their software frequently because they release their software frequently .
I know that sounds flippant .
Before you write angry comments , let me digress for a moment .
Making the Impossible Possible
One of my favorite stories of last year is Booting Linux in Five Seconds .
I 'd interviewed Arjan van de Ven the month before on a related topic , and he let slip that he and Auke Kok had eliminated most of the cold boot time for GNU / Linux operating systems .
Other people had tried several approaches to reduce boot time .
Most seemed to believe that starting services in parallel was the right approach , but few systems cracked the minute mark .
Arjan and Auke took a different approach .
They set a goal : a five - second boot time .
They relentlessly set priorities and threw out everything that stood in the way .
The Linux kernel is endlessly configurable , but the configuration of any particular machine is reasonably static .
Why probe for new hardware on every boot ?
Throw it out .
Why recompile keyboard maps for every launch of X.org ?
Throw that out .
I do n't mean to trivialize the process .
They overcame some interesting technical challenges ( " How do you use available CPU and IO resources to their limit ? " ) .
Yet their approach was deceptively simple .
They removed everything that stood in the way of achieving their goals .
How to Release Software Frequently
The only realistic way I know of to release software frequently is to start to release software frequently .
You will probably fail the first few times you try .
If your release process is painful , it will continue to be painful until you identify and eliminate the causes of the pain .
First , your team needs to agree to make changes .
They may be radical and painful .
Without a collective agreement to try the new approach , you will likely fail .
Do n't bother trying without this .
( By " collective agreement " I mean that everyone involved in actively producing a release must agree .
There 's no reason you have to ship a new CD to customers every week or every month .
That may be a good thing , but project - only weekly releases are a good thing in and of themselves .
I 'd use them even if I worked on a shrinkwrapped application with an 18 month sales cycle . )
Second , you need to establish the duration of your release cycle ( See Iteration Planning ) .
I prefer weekly releases for full - time teams , but two weeks is fine and a month is workable .
The most important attribute of this process is a single , very subtle change in your mindset : tying the release date to the calendar , not to any particular feature .
Before you hit that comment box again , please take a moment to consider the implications , both good and bad .
Ready ?
Good .
By tying a release date to a calendar ( " We release a stable , usable version of our software every Wednesday morning at 10 am " ) , you have two options .
Either your software is usable and releasable every Wednesday morning at 10 am , or it is n't .
If you want to meet the commitment you 've made , you need to do something radically different .
Obviously one of those changes is to reduce the amount of time and work it takes to produce a release .
That must be a quick process .
It must be an automated and repeatable process .
It must not block on the knowledge or activity or presence of any one single person .
This is not easy to achieve , but you get a chance to improve it once a week , every week .
This will be painful .
It will improve over time .
( One of the best places to start is to improve the speed of your test suite . )
Done Means Done
The biggest change is that trunk must always be stable .
You can work on whatever features you like , as long as you keep the trunk of the project in a releasable state .
You must be relentless .
Part of this stability process is never merging features until they are completely and utterly finished .
The agile world calls this Done Done .
In contrast to my colleague 's project , Wednesday morning at 9 am is not the time to check in a feature that you just made compile and are pretty sure that QA wo n't find any bugs , at least you hope so .
If a feature is n't done -- verified usable as intended -- you can't merge it to the trunk .
It wo n't be part of this week 's release .
That 's not so bad , however .
There 's always next week 's release .
What You Can't Do
Of course , there are more implications .
The Iteration Planning link suggests that you need to identify week - sized units of progress and prioritize them relentlessly .
I agree , but that wo n't help much until you can release software frequently .
Note that there are several things you can't do anymore :
Hold feature freezes .
The release process is too frequent for that .
Good .
Keep your code Done Done instead .
Play games with your bug tracker .
Hold back releases more than a couple of hours .
If a release slips even by a couple of hours , something has gone wrong .
Identify it and figure out how to fix it , right away .
Segregate QA and development .
The days in which you can throw code over the wall and hope someone else will tell you if it 's Done Done are gone .
You can't afford to wait to find out .
Get feedback immediately !
Maintain long - lived branches in your SCM , hoping to land them eventually .
You do n't have time for the divergence from trunk .
Keep your branches small and short and your features small .
Is this realistic ?
I believe so .
We 've done it on Parrot for almost two and a half years now with volunteer labor .
We 're not perfect by any means , but we 're predictable and we 're improving .
None of this is out of reach of any decent team which wants to improve its processes .
It 's not easy , but it 's possible -- and I believe it 's better than every other alternative in software development .
While many workers around the world are worried about downsizing , lay - offs and how to protect their jobs , workers in Argentina have come up with their own solution to business closures – Occupy , Resist and Produce .

While many workers around the world are worried about downsizing , lay - offs and how to protect their jobs , workers in Argentina have come up with their own solution to business closures – Occupy , Resist and Produce .
Many factories , like the Zanon Ceramics plant , have been running without bosses for almost a decade .
In response to a financial crisis in 2001 that wrecked Argentina ’s economy , workers decided to occupy their workplaces and start up production without bosses in order to safe - guard their jobs .
Zanon Ceramics , now known as FASINPAT ( Factory without a boss ) , has re-defined the basis of production : without workers , bosses are unable to run businesses ; without bosses , workers can do it better .
As the largest recuperated factory in Argentina , and occupied since 2001 , the Zanon ceramics plant in the Patagonian province of Neuquén now employs 470 workers .
This month , the FASINPAT collective is a step closer in winning permanent control of the factory .
The provincial government presented a bill in the provincial legislature for the expropriation of the factory .
If this bill is passed , and it looks favorable , it would mean a solution to the workers ’ long standing legal woes .
Since the plant began production under worker control in 2002 , they have faced numerous eviction threats and other violent attacks .
The government has tried to evict them five times using police operatives .
On April 8 , 2003 , during the most recent eviction attempt , over 5,000 community members from Neuquén came out to defend the factory .
In a press release , the worker collective said that the legislature received the bill was a positive step .
“ The historic progress we made today was the result of a hard fight .
The collective struggle and mobilization of Worker Self - management , along with the workers in this country , community support and international recognition has made this possible . ”
In 2001 , Zanon ’s owners decided to close their doors and fire the workers without paying months of back pay or indemnity .
Leading up to the massive layoffs and the plant ’s closure , workers went on strike in 2000 .
The owner , Luis Zanon with over 75 million dollars in debt to public and private creditors , fired en masse most of the workers and closed the factory in 2001 — a bosses ’ lockout .
In October 2001 , workers declared the plant under worker control .
The workers camped outside the factory for four months , pamphleting and partially blocking a highway leading to the capital city Neuquén .
While the workers were camping outside the factory , a court ruled that the employees could sell off remaining stock .
After the stock ran out , on March 2 , 2002 , the workers ’ assembly voted to start up production without a boss .
For more than eight years , FASINPAT has created jobs , supported community projects and shown the world that we do n’t need bosses .
Luis Zanon´s debts of over $ 70 million are still outstanding , while many of the creditors want their money back , pushing for the eviction and foreclosure of the ceramics plant .
The current bill presented in the legislature would mean that the state would pay off 22 million pesos ( around $ 7 million ) to the creditors .
One of the main creditors is the World Bank – which gave a loan of 20 million dollars to Luis Zanon for the construction of the plant , which he never paid back .
The other major creditor is the Italian company SACMY that produces state of the art ceramics manufacturing machinery and is owed over $ 5 million .
Omar Villablanca , a worker at Zanon said that the workers are most concerned about providing job continuity – safeguarding the 470 jobs that the factory without a boss have created and maintained since 2001 .
He stressed that FASINPAT needs a formal long - term legal solution in order to survive as a competitive business in a faltering economy .
“ The state needs to make laws so that workers can work .
In eight years we have n’t asked the state for anything other than an expropriation law , ” said Jose Luis Paris , another worker from FASINPAT .
Economic Crisis Grips Argentina
Argentina is in a better position than other Latin American nations in the face of the deepening global crisis .
From 2003 to 2007 , Argentina enjoyed a high economic growth rate , between 8 and 9 percent .
However , with the global economy in recession the nation ’s growth has come to a halt , and it is expected that Argentina will see a drastic drop Gross Domestic Product in 2010 .
Many independent analysts expect that the global recession will affect Argentina ’s real economy , that ’s to say industry and employment rates will suffer from the crisis , rather than the financial sector which already took a major blow in 2001 .
Those who benefited from Argentina ’s economic recovery of course are now those who are using this crisis as an excuse to downsize and lay - off workers .
The current government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has bolstered that unemployment has gone done from the staggering numbers post - 2001 crisis .
Many of those jobs are subcontracted and underpaid .
Official unemployment statistics , which have been under fire for being conveniently inaccurate , report unemployment at 8 percent .
However , many independent analysts say that the actual rate is much higher .
Eduardo Lucita , economist from Economists of the Left said that analysts do n’t have exact numbers because many of the firings are of workers without formal contracts and ca n’t be tracked .
“ Argentina has already had a crisis in the financial sector in 2001 .
The current crisis is directly affecting Argentina ’s real economy .
Since October , there are more than 50,000 people who are now unemployed .
There have been mass firings , lay - offs and pay cuts . ”
Workers Paying for the Crisis
In the failing economy , the jobs at FASINPAT are more important than ever .
But the government seems to have all but forgotten that the recuperated enterprises and worker cooperatives provide nearly 20,000 jobs for Argentina , while the government has failed to provide a long - term legal solution to the workers without bosses or subsidies that standard businesses regularly have access to .
Another factor in the struggle at FASINPAT is the lack of subsidies for the cooperative .
Sales have dropped by 40 - 50 percent since 2008 due to a radical slow - down in the construction industry nationally .
“ Because of the drop in construction , we are n’t producing as much , ” says Paris .
In 2006 , the plant produced 400,000 square meters of ceramics per month , today that number has gone down to 150,000 square meters per month .
The cooperative has had to shut off some of the ovens and shorten production shifts .
On top of this drop ; the workers controlling the factory have had to face sky - rocketing energy prices .
The workers pay over 300,000 dollars a month for electricity and gas .
And for Paris , the workers should not have to pay more than other businesses do : “ Many industry leaders get government energy subsidies up to 70 percent .
We want to buy directly from the gas companies to lower our costs or receive subsidies that we are entitled to . ”
Many of the 200 worker controlled businesses and factories in Argentina are being affected by the crisis .
But unlike their capitalist counterparts , the worker cooperatives are taking any measure possible to avoid laying off workers , something which they are opposed to doing .
“ We are n’t like the capitalists .
You ca n’t throw workers out like they are lice , ” said Candido Gonzalez , a veteran worker from Chilavert worker occupied print factory in Buenos Aires , one of the first occupied plants after the 2001 crisis .
During the Argentina ’s financial crisis in 2001 , he occupied his workplace and fought until he and his fellow workers won legal recognition .
Now that business is slowing down , many assemblies at the worker occupied factories would rather accept collective pay cuts , than their fellow workers lose their jobs .
When Capitalism Fails – Occupy , Resist and Produce
Capitalism has taken a turn for the worse , spinning itself out of control into a downward spiral which many are characterizing as the second depression of the century .
And during this crisis , there are going to be winners and losers .
The winners ?
Most likely big business and banks receiving bailout plans .
The losers ?
The millions who are facing unemployment , dropping wages and inflation .
“ During a capitalist crisis , when the businessmen and governments are trying to unload all their responsibilities onto the workers of the world , Zanon under worker self - management , is a clear example of how workers can come out of this crisis , ” say the workers at FASINPAT .
Since late 2008 there have been several new factory takeovers in Argentina .
Many workers from the newly occupied factories say that their bosses saw the crisis as the perfect opportunity to clear their debts by closing up shop , fraudulently liquidating assets , firing workers and later re-start production under a new firm .
“ [ However ]
Many companies are still open because they are afraid of the recovered factory phenomenon ; we have to keep them scared , ” said Paris from Zanon .
In almost all of the newly recuperated factories , the workers suggest that the owners had no real reason to close up shop – meaning that the businesses had production demand .
I have heard workers on numerous occasions say that during the crisis , the bosses are taking advantage of the situation of a recession .
The worker controlled factories and businesses occupied after 2001 may not be by themselves a social revolution , but the example of worker self - management has helped many workers today facing the possibility of losing their jobs with the idea that they can occupy their workplace in order to defend their rights as laborers .
Nearly 10 factories have been occupied since 2008 .
This may be a sign that workers are confronting the global financial crisis with lessons and tools from previous worker occupied factories .
Strategically , the previous worker occupied factories have been fundamental in providing advice of all kinds , including legal , political , production and moral .
For many at the recuperated enterprises , the occupation of their workplace meant much more than safe - guarding their jobs , it also became part of a struggle for a world without exploitation .
“ The recuperated enterprises are working to change society .
We are changing the way of working , working without exploitation and show workers that we can function without bosses , ” says Jorge Suarez from Hotel BAUEN , an operating worker occupied hotel in down town Buenos Aires .
Argentina ’s worker factory takeovers reflect a strategy of workers defending their rights and taking hold of their own destiny .
Hard times require desperate measures – and one measure may be for workers to occupy , resist and produce .

( CNN ) -- Police hunting for a New Zealand couple who allegedly fled the country after a bank mistakenly paid them $ NZ10 million ( $ 6 million ) believe they traveled to Hong Kong .
The gas station owned by one of the duo has been closed since May 7 .
New Zealand authorities have sought help from Interpol in locating the couple who disappeared May 7 , two days after an employee error at Westpac bank paid them 1,000 times the amount they asked for .
TVNZ , a CNN television affiliate , named the couple as Leo Gao and his girlfriend Cara Young .
Gao owned a gas station in Rotorua , a lakeside tourist town famous for its hot water springs and bubbling mud pools .
Police said Friday that the couple were believed to have traveled to Hong Kong .
" Enquiries to locate those individuals are continuing through Interpol in Hong Kong and official channels in Beijing , " said Detective Senior Sergeant David Harvey .
Watch as ' millionaires ' go on the run »
Police were not confirming the identities of those involved but they were working with the family of one of the individuals named in the media , Harvey said .
The family were shocked at their name being associated with the case , he added .
TVNZ said the couple applied for an overdraft from Westpac worth up to NZ$ 10,000 .
However , on or about May 5 , the bank erroneously put NZ $ 10 million ( $ 6.1 million ) into their bank account .
What would you do in this situation ?
The next day , the gas station closed its doors .
And the day after , the couple went missing .
TVNZ said Westpac had confirmed that a customer had attempted to unlawfully transfer amounts totaling around NZ $ 6.7 million ( $ 4.1 million ) .
Nearly NZ$ 3 million ( $ 1.85 million ) had been recovered and the bank was continuing to vigorously pursue the outstanding amount , Westpac Media relations manager Craig Dowling told the station .
According to early reports , Monday ’s North Korea event certainly seems like a deliberate explosion in the right place .
However , it was too small to be a successful Hiroshima - class crude explosive device , by a factor of three or four .
The reported estimates of Richter magnitude spread from 4.5 - 5 , and the standard conversions to explosive yield suggest a yield of 2 - 6 kiloton - equivalents of TNT .
Most of the latest Richter magnitude estimates have come in the low half of the 4.5 - 5 range , so it seems likely that the yield was 4 kilotons or smaller .
According to early reports , Monday ’s North Korea event certainly seems like a deliberate explosion in the right place .
However , it was too small to be a successful Hiroshima - class crude explosive device , by a factor of three or four .
The reported estimates of Richter magnitude spread from 4.5 - 5 , and the standard conversions to explosive yield suggest a yield of 2 - 6 kiloton - equivalents of TNT .
Most of the latest Richter magnitude estimates have come in the low half of the 4.5 - 5 range , so it seems likely that the yield was 4 kilotons or smaller .
That ’s a lot of energy , much larger than the 2006 North Korean test , but it still falls far short of an expected 12 - 20 kiloton yield of a crude Hiroshima - style device .
For comparison ’s sake , the first nuclear tests of all other nations that are self - announced members of the nuclear club had larger yields than this latest North Korean test .
Because the expected Hiroshima - style explosion did n’t occur , there are four options as to what did happen during the test :
the device failed to detonate properly ;
the device was a higher - tech device designed for smaller yield with less fissile matter ( e.g. , missile warheads or briefcase bombs ) ;
the North Koreans faked a nuclear explosion with conventional explosives ;
or the North Koreans detonated a larger device in a large cavity to muffle its yield .
The first option is the most likely case given what is publicly known about North Korean diplomacy and technology .
It ’s important to realize that nuclear tests in the past 15 years have primarily been demonstrations of power and national will , rather than driven by engineering .
The two different kinds of simple bombs are uranium 235 - based and plutonium - based .
The United States used one bomb of each type on Japan in the closing months of World War II , with roughly similar explosive yields .
The technology for a uranium 235 bomb is so simple , relatively speaking , that such a device need not be tested .
To wit , the United States dropped the uranium 235 Hiroshima bomb without testing its design in a controlled detonation .
Conversely , building a plutonium - based bomb represents a technical challenge because the critical mass can blow apart in a split second before the detonation reaches max efficiency .
Once U.S. weapon designers confirmed the trickier detonation scheme of a plutonium device in the famous Trinity Test in 1945 , confidence in the simpler uranium 235 detonation design seemed justified .
The technology for making the raw material for each device differs .
Uranium 235 must be separated from the heavier isotope uranium 238 to make a bomb , so a country that buys or builds high - tech centrifuges is investing in those types of bombs .
The term “ enriched uranium ” refers to uranium metal with an increase of the 235 isotope that ’s sufficient to allow an explosive chain reaction to occur .
( Complete separation of the two isotopes is neither feasible nor necessary to create a weapon . )
Plutonium comes from nuclear reactor waste , many stockpiles of which North Korea possesses .
In other words , North Korea is attempting to make the trickier of the two devices .
When arms control experts estimate North Korea to have a nuclear stockpile of 6 - 8 weapons , they are converting the likely amount of reactor waste that the country has produced into plutonium bombs of the World War II - era design .
When the device is built correctly ( the earliest technology used a sphere with precisely timed explosions to press an array of small plutonium masses into one critical mass ) , the yield is 10 - 20 kilotons .
It ’s unlikely that North Korea has skipped this step and gone on to more sophisticated designs that involve other elements ( for instance , tritium ) to generate a smaller yield from a smaller plutonium mass .
China did n’t .
Its tests grew in size and sophistication in the 1980s and 1990s until Beijing induced seismic events that registered higher than 6 on the Richter scale .
Then they stopped .
Thus , I would rule out option number two .
Option number three also seems unlikely .
The 2006 test was never proven to be fake , and more largely , there ’s no reason for Pyonyang to fake a test if it could at least attempt a real nuclear detonation .
Nor has any world leader ever publicly called out North Korea for executing a failed or fake test in 2006 ; such a response probably would have pushed Pyongyang to attempt a second test much more quickly .
It ’s the same reason why the United States and Europe–despite seismic data to the contrary –did n’t call India ’s thermonuclear bluff in 1998 ; they wanted to reduce tensions , not raise them .
The last option–detonation in a cavity –makes no sense at all .
The common assumption behind the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is that countries would attempt to evade detection .
But in the twenty - first century , what good is a nuclear weapon if it ca n’t be used to openly check adversaries ?
Plus , a country does n’t even need a military useful device to do so .
With cable news , the ability to detonate something fissionable does the trick–at least in a political sense .
So my guess is that North Korea tried and failed to get a simple plutonium bomb to detonate correctly .
Make no mistake–an inefficient nuclear weapon is nothing to dismiss .
Even at the low end of its estimated yield ( 2 kilotons ) , the May 25 test released as much or more explosive energy than the largest conventional - explosive air raids during World War II .
But one should be mindful of the technical challenges North Korea still faces in carrying out the threats implied by its deliberate pairing of its explosive test with test missile launches .
READ & RUN ME FIRST Malware Removal Guide
Step 1 : Scanning for adware / junkware to remove later .
It was either a frightening confrontation or a misunderstanding , depending on who ’s talking .
State GOP aide Matt Milner dialed 911 because he said union organizers blocked his exit and demanded he erase a video recording of Democratic Sen.
Michael Bennet on Saturday afternoon following a townhall meeting sponsored by the AFL - CIO .
Mike Cerbo , executive director of Colorado AFL - CIO , said Milner came looking for trouble , but he was n’t forced to erase the tape or barred from leaving .
It ’s now a matter for the Adams County Sheriff ’s Office , where authorities Sunday confirmed that they received a complaint from Milner .
Police also confirmed his Saturday emergency call .
“ I feared for my safety .
Period , ” the 25 - year - old Milner said Sunday .
Neither Bennet nor his staff was present at the altercation , said both Milner and a representative for the senator .
Milner has been a familiar face at about a dozen official Bennet events .
The state Republican Party confirmed that it pays him to shadow and videotape the freshman senator in a practice known as “ tracking . ”
There was no reason to think Saturday ’s gathering at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ’ Local 68 union hall — billed as an “ everyone ’s welcome ” affair on the invitation — would vary from the typically uneventful routine .
And for several hours it did n’t , Milner said .
But Milner , with his tripod and video camera , garnered the attention of event organizers just as Bennet bid his adieu to hundreds of audience members , some of whom had grown passionate over politically tricky labor issues , such as the Employee Free Choice Act .
The Employee Free Choice
Act would make it easier for unions to organize by effectively eliminating secret - ballot elections and allowing workers to show union support by signing a form , a process known as card - check .
It ’s poised to be one of the most contentious votes of Bennet ’s first year , potentially affecting his 2010 campaign .
The 5 - foot - 6 - inch Milner found himself surrounded as the event wound down , he said .
“ This hulking guy comes flying at me , and he ’s yelling ‘ Who are you with ? ’
There ’s a flurry of F - words , ” Milner said .
“ They circled around me .
I ’d try to move , and they ’d move to block my path . ”
Cerbo , one of the five men who spoke to Milner after Bennet ’s speech , disputed that version of events Sunday .
He said the young interloper was aggressive and tried to provoke a confrontation , though he declined to say how .
“ He came in uninvited . . . .
I ’d call him a trespasser , ” Cerbo said .
“ He did n’t get the incident he wanted , so he ’s clearly lying about what happened . ”
By Cerbo ’s recollection , Milner offered to erase his tape because he had n’t been invited to the event .
Milner says he was barred from leaving until he agreed to erase the recording and that one of the men briefly took his camera to make sure it was .

Bloody clashes broke out in Tehran yesterday as Iran 's supreme leader said he would not yield to pressure over the disputed election .
The renewed confrontation took place in Baharestan Square , near parliament , where hundreds of protesters faced off against several thousand riot police and other security personnel .
Witnesses likened the scene to a ­war zone , with helicopters hovering overhead , many arrests and the police beating demonstrators .
One woman told CNN that hundreds of unidentified men armed with clubs had emerged from a mosque to confront the protesters .
" They beat a woman so savagely that she was drenched in blood and her husband fainted .
They were beating people like hell .
It was a massacre , " she said .
The opposition website Rooz Online carried what it said was an interview with a man the government had shipped in to Tehran to quell the demonstrations .
He said he was being paid 2 m rial ( £ 122 ) per day to assault protesters with a heavy wooden stave , and that other volunteers , most of them from far - flung provinces , were being kept in hostel accommodation , reportedly in east Tehran .
With the independent media banned from covering street protests , the reports could not be verified .
There were also unconfirmed reports tonight that Zahra Rahnavard , the wife of opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi , had been arrested .
Earlier in the day she had called on the authorities to release Iranians who had been detained .
In remarks posted on her husband 's website , Rahnavard said : " I regret the arrest of many politicians and people and want their immediate release .
It is my duty to continue legal protests to preserve Iranian rights . "
Rahnavard , who galvanised women voters by campaigning at Mousavi 's side before the election , said the government should not treat his supporters " as if martial law has been imposed in the streets " .
Meantime , the Foreign Office is investigating claims that Britons have been arrested in connection with the protests .
There were reports on Iranian state television that some British passport - holders had been detained following the unrest .
A spokesman for the Foreign Office said : " We are aware of the reports and we will be looking into them . "
The latest confrontations came as the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , whose authority has been challenged by massive grassroots protests , said on state television : " I had insisted and will insist on implementing the law on the election issue .
Neither the establishment nor the nation will yield to pressure at any cost . "
But one of the defeated presidential candidates , Mehdi Karroubi , stepped up his challenge to the regime , describing the government as illegitimate .
Rejecting the outcome of the 12 June vote , Karroubi – a reformist cleric and the most liberal of the presidential candidates – said on his website : " I do not accept the result and therefore consider as illegitimate the new government .
Because of the irregularities , the vote should be annulled . "
Iran 's guardian council has ruled out an annulment of the election , saying there were no major irregularities , although it admitted that more people had voted than were registered in 50 areas .
It was announced yesterday that Ahmadinejad would be sworn in by mid-August .
Iran has accused the US and Britain of stirring up trouble in post-election violence that has seen at least 17 people killed , although the toll is suspected to be higher .
Britain yesterday expelled two Iranian diplomats in a tit - for - tat response to the expulsion of two British diplomats accused by Tehran of being spies .
Iran 's foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , said his government was considering downgrading diplomatic relations with the UK .
Mottaki was asked about calls from members of Iran 's parliament to scale down Iranian representation in the UK , possibly withdrawing its ambassador .
" We are studying it , " he said , according to state television .
" There has been an absence of any hostile activity .
There has n't been another escalation , and there have n't been any more demos [ outside the Iranian embassy in London ] that we 're aware of , " he said .
However , Iran 's intelligence minister , Gholamhossein Mohsen - Ezhei , said that " a number people holding British passports had been arrested during the recent arrests , " according to Iranian state radio .
Mottaki had earlier claimed that there had been an increase in the number of visas issued to visitors from Britain in the immediate run-up to the election , although did not make clear if the visas were issued to journalists .
The US withdrew invitations to Iranian diplomats to attend the US independence day celebrations on 4 July , to protest at the crackdown .
On Tuesday , after a week of reticence , US president Barack Obama condemned for the first time the violence in Iran , saying : " The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats , beatings , and imprisonments of the last few days .
I strongly condemn these unjust actions , and I join with the American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost . "
" I do n't remember even meeting her , " Lepore tells Usmagazine.com .
Lepore adds that " it 's really bad for a Miss USA contestant not to believe in gay marriage .
As Miss USA , you have to get your hair and makeup done by gay people ... it 's bad karma ! "
Kidding aside , she said , " It 's stupid for her to be running for Miss USA to say that .
It 's a dumbbell remark .
If you 're Miss USA , you are supposed to be smart and that 's not a smart idea . "
Attention NoScript users · 2009-05-01 22:54 by Wladimir Palant
Recently I wrote about how not giving extension developers a good way to earn money might lead to very undesirable effects .
The recent events give an impression of the kind of effects we should expect here .
This is going to be about the popular NoScript extension which happens to make its money from ads .
And to make sure that somebody sees these ads it goes pretty far .
For example , it opens the changelog webpage ( full of ads of course ) on every single update of the extension , even though the NoScript FAQ claim that it happens only on major updates ( yes , if you dig into it you will find the preference to disable this behavior – but how many people do that ? ) .
And updates coming roughly each week ensure that this page is opened fairly often .
A problem is of course that NoScript will usually disable scripting and consequently also most advertising .
That problem is being worked around by putting NoScript ’s domains , Google AdSense and a few others on NoScript ’s default whitelist ( again , the overwhelming majority of users wo n’t go hunting for bogus entries in their whitelist ) .
Given that NoScript proudly calls itself a security extension this means putting users at risk — for example , a while ago I demonstrated how an XSS vulnerability on a NoScript domain can be used to run JavaScript from any website , despite NoScript .
This was countered by implementing anti-XSS measures rather than removing anything unnecessary from the whitelist .
You get an impression for the business model here .
Of course , this approach brings NoScript in conflict with another popular extension — Adblock Plus .
For years , NoScript has been using a trick to prevent Adblock Plus from working on its domains .
Fixing this issue was never particularly high on my list of priorities ( though I finally came around and fixed it after the recent events ) so at some point I suggested that EasyList should be extended by a filter to block ads specifically on NoScript ’s domains .
This finally happened two weeks ago .
What followed was a small war — the website would add various tricks to prevent Adblock Plus with EasyList from blocking ads , EasyList kept adjusting filters .
Then , a week ago a new NoScript version was released .
A few days later I noticed first bug reports — apparently , Adblock Plus “ glitches ” were observed with this NoScript version , especially around NoScript ’s domains ( but not only those ) .
When I investigated this issue I could n’t believe my eyes .
NoScript was extended by a piece of obfuscated (! ) code to specifically target Adblock Plus and disable parts of its functionality .
The issues caused by this manipulation were declared as “ compatibility issues ” in the NoScript forum , even now I still did n’t see any official admission of crippling Adblock Plus .
Clearly , NoScript is moving from the gray area of adware into dark black area of scareware , making money at user ’s expense at any cost .
Confronted with the facts and with the AMO policy NoScript author agreed to revert the changes .
However , he put a different “ solution ” in place — the new NoScript version released yesterday adds a “ filter subscription ” to Adblock Plus meant to whitelist NoScript ’s domains .
A note about this “ feature ” has been added to extension description on AMO ( I insisted ) , not without misrepresenting the cause of course .
Supposedly , this is because of a “ targeted attack from EasyList which broke functionality . ”
Which fails to mention that EasyList was just doing what it was created for ( block ads ) and the broken functionality is the result of attempts to avoid ads from being blocked ( originally the filters did n’t break anything ) .
So the real reason is not broken functionality , it is the ads on these sites .
Of course , adding a note to the description that almost nobody will read anyway was n’t the only change I wanted to see .
Adblock Plus allows other extensions to add filter subscriptions but that was n’t supposed to happen without user ’s consent .
In case of NoScript , asking the user whether this filter subscription should be added was clearly required .
But that would probably make too many people notice that something fishy is going on and decline .
Note also that this filter subscription cannot be removed ( will be re-added on next Firefox start ) , only disabled .
Also , it stays there even after NoScript is uninstalled .
Should I now make it harder for all extensions to integrate with Adblock Plus just because NoScript is misbehaving ?
I doubt that this will help much , any installed extension has the privileges to do anything and trying to stop it from misbehaving after installation is a lost cause .
While the current state of affairs ( NoScript ’s manipulation of Adblock Plus is visible to the user if he knows where to look , it is documented and even reversible ) is better than what we had before I still think that extensions manipulating other extensions to prevent them from doing their job is not where we want to be .
NoScript might be somewhat extreme but the “ business offer ” emails I occasionally see in my inbox make me think that we will see more of this .
Companies start to recognize the potential of Firefox extensions and push extension authors into monetizing their extensions by questionable means — at the expense of the users .
Update ( 2009-05-02 ) : Apparently , thanks to some pushing from AMO yet another NoScript version was released .
This one supposedly no longer adds a filter subscription to Adblock Plus and also removes the one added by the previous versions .
Also , a change to AMO policy is under discussion .
Big thanks to everybody who made that happen !
Update 2 ( 2009-05-04 ) : Sorry , I have to close the comments .
I made the effort of reading each single comment but that ’s getting too much for me .
Especially now it seems that most commenters come from other articles misrepresenting the whole issue and do n’t even bother to read my blog post .
Update 3 ( 2009-05-04 ) : NoScript author made an official statement on the events .
Commenting is closed for this article .
British pubs are closing at the rate of 39 a week , and we now have more supermarkets than pubs , which seems so disturbing that if I met anybody who welcomed the development I ’d be tempted to hit them .
The causes , I admit , are complex and probably irreversible .
They include the narrow margins the pub lessees are required to operate under by the pubcos ( we ’re already in hell , as you can tell ) ; the smoking ban ; the preference for eating out over drinking , and for wine over beer ; the cheapness of supermarket booze ; and the government ’s beer duty escalator , set last year to rise at 2 per cent above inflation annually until 2012 and unlikely to be revoked in the Budget in spite of increasing pressure from MPs .
Alistair Darling said the escalator would provide revenue to help the old and the poor – a provocative remark , given that these are the very people most likely to make use of the traditional British pub .
But I should have known from those periodic photographs of Tony Blair queasily sipping pints while supposedly bonding with his constituents in Sedgefield that the government I voted for would do nothing to help the Dog and Duck , and I do n’t believe Gordon Brown is any more of a pub man .
The beer duty escalator is , in reality , a capitu­lation to the health lobby , whose concerns over binge drinking are all too well founded .
But these binge drinkers are not pub goers in the sense that most British men – if not many New Labour ministers – have been for two centuries .
If someone cut up rough in the pubs of my young manhood , the place would fall silent , and he would be on the end of a dozen censorious stares .
If he slurred and stumbled when ordering a drink , then the landlord , whom he probably knew and liked , would gently advise him to go home .
But it would n’t come to that .
The old - style pub was full of professional drinkers , so to speak , and the ability to hold one ’s booze was highly prized .
Binge drinking comes from rootlessness in every sense .
Alcohol provides an escape from the anomie that is the defining condition of corporatised , globalised , urban Britain , and if it can be consumed in the depths of some pounding lager depot , then no limits apply .
A still faster way to oblivion is to buy cheap beer from the supermarkets , which use alcohol as a loss leader , and can readily absorb the beer duty .
It is now being argued , by the Campaign for Real Ale ( CAMRA ) among others , that the duty should be frozen on beer sold in pubs , as these are valuable community hubs .
But the government , in its priggish way , appears to want to make schools the hubs of communities .
Ministers are blind to the natural foci – post offices and pubs .
If , as a journalist , I am sent on an assignment to any British town , I go into a pub to take the temperature of the place .
I inveigle myself into a conversation with drinkers at the bar .
Note those terms “ drinkers ” and “ bar ” .
You ca n’t so readily talk to people eating at tables in pubs .
Food pubs are much more atomised places , lacking the correct pub dynamic .
Most decent British pubs are now driven to attract what one landlord I know wearily calls “ the grey brigade ” : genteel , retired folk , who will motor out to a pub for a pint and fish and chips for him , a tagliatelle with pesto and a white wine for her .
Having consumed this , they immediately go home , giving a staccato rhythm to pub life .
Most pubs now serve food , because the modern Briton , like the snail , moves about on his stomach .
But this is another defeat .
Pubs are meant to be about drinking , and the unwinding conversation that results .
The landlord in my favourite pub knows this , and will never leave condiments on the tables .
Instead , they are handed out with the food , to be taken away afterwards .
And no drinker is ever told , “ You ca n’t sit there .
It ’s reserved for a party of four who are coming to eat . ”
Readers , especially female readers , might detect a misogynistic note in this article .
I am on difficult ground here .
After all , the president of CAMRA is a woman .
But I liked the male orientation of pubs .
It was an antidote to married life , and I could appreciate that from the atmosphere of a pub even before I was married .
Pubs tended to be dark , a troglodytic refuge .
This was off - putting to women , but I like dark places .
I look much better in the dark , for one thing .
And given the high divorce rate , and the crisis of masculinity caused by the deindustrialisation of Britain , I would have thought we needed more rather than fewer places where men can socialise together .
But what do I know ?
I will be adrift in the largely publess Britain of the future .

A TIMELINE SURROUNDING SEPTEMBER 11TH - IF CIA AND THE GOVERNMENT WEREN'T INVOLVED IN THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS
WHAT WERE THEY DOING ?

[ Expanded and Revised Sept. 4 , 2002 - Evidence of Bush Administration Foreknowledge and complicity is now overwhelming .
Since our last revision July 11 , 2002 , 16 New Items ! ( noted in RED ) ]
Nov. 2 , 2001 , 12:00 PST -- On Oct. 31 the French daily Le Figaro dropped a bombshell .
While in a Dubai hospital receiving treatment for a chronic kidney infection last July , Osama bin Laden met with a top CIA official -- presumably the chief of station .
The meeting , held in bin Laden 's private suite , took place at the American hospital in Dubai at a time when he was a wanted fugitive for the bombings of two U.S. embassies and last year 's attack on the USS Cole .
Bin Laden was eligible for execution according to a 2000 intelligence finding issued by President Bill Clinton before leaving office in January .
Yet on July 14 , 2001 he was allowed to leave Dubai on a private jet , and there were no Navy fighters waiting to force him down .
In 1985 Oliver North -- the only member of the Reagan - Bush years who does n't appear to have a hand in the current war -- sent the Navy and commandos after terrorists on the cruise ship Achille Lauro .
In his 1991 autobiography " Under Fire , " while describing terrorist Abu Abbas North wrote , " I used to wonder : how many dead Americans will it take before we do something ? "
One could look at the number of Americans Osama bin Laden is alleged to have killed before Sept. 11 and ask the same question .
It gets worse , much worse .
A more complete timeline listing crucial events both before and after the Sept. 11 suicide attacks , which have been blamed on bin Laden , establishes CIA foreknowledge of them and strongly suggests that there was criminal complicity on the part of the U.S. government in their execution .
It also makes clear that the events that have taken place since Sept. 11 are based upon an agenda that has little to do with the attacks .
[ June 19 , 2002 ] --
As the revelations of Bush Administration foreknowledge have progressed from silence , to trickle , to cascade , the question has now changed from forcing the evidence into the open into one of forcing both the media and the people to avoid denying this information in the hopes that their desire for a sense of " normalcy " can be fulfilled .
As many of us have known for years , normalcy went out the window forever when the first plane hit the tower .
And what has been revealed will not be resolved with an expensive fact - finding commission , a few firing , or even an impeachment proceeding .
What is needed in America -- and in the global economic system -- is an overhaul , not a tune up .
1. 1991-1997 - Major U.S. oil companies including ExxonMobil , Texaco , Unocal , BP Amoco , Shell and Enron directly invest billions in cash bribing heads of state in Kazakhstan to secure equity rights in the huge oil reserves in these regions .
The oil companies further commit to future direct investments in Kazakhstan of $ 35 billion .
Not being willing to pay exorbitant prices to Russia to use Russian pipelines , the major oil companies have no way to recoup their investments .

Now , let 's go back to the Oct. 31 story by Le Figaro -- the one that has Osama bin Laden meeting with a CIA officer in Dubai in July 2001 .
The story says , " Throughout his stay in the hospital , Osama Bin Laden received visits from many family members [ There goes the story that he 's a black sheep ! -- MCR ] and Saudi Arabian Emirate personalities of status .
During this time the local representative of the CIA was seen by many people taking the elevator and going to bin Laden 's room .
" Several days later the CIA officer bragged to his friends about having visited the Saudi millionaire .
From authoritative sources , this CIA agent visited CIA headquarters on July 15 , the day after bin Laden 's departure for Quetta .
" According to various Arab diplomatic sources and French intelligence itself , precise information was communicated to the CIA concerning terrorist attacks aimed at American interests in the world , including its own territory .
" Extremely bothered , they [ American intelligence officers in a meeting with French intelligence officers ] requested from their French peers exact details about the Algerian activists [ connected to bin Laden through Dubai banking institutions ] , without explaining the exact nature of their inquiry .
When asked the question , What do you fear in the coming days ? ' the Americans responded with incomprehensible silence .
" On further investigation , the FBI discovered certain plans that had been put together between the CIA and its ' Islamic friends ' over the years .
The meeting in Dubai is , so it would seem , consistent with ' a certain American policy . ' "
Even though Le Figaro reported that it had confirmed with hospital staff that bin Laden had been there as reported , stories printed on Nov. 1 contained quotes from hospital staff that these reports were untrue .
On Nov. 1 , as reported by the Ananova press agency , the CIA flatly denied that any meeting between any CIA personnel and Osama bin Laden at any time .

DETROIT 
For all the drastic cuts and financial overhauls that are meant to secure a future for General Motors and Chrysler , their prospects in coming years will be determined more by the answer to a simple question : Can American drivers live without that new - car smell ?
In recent years Americans appeared to be hooked on it and took advantage of home equity loans , easy credit and cheap short - term lease deals to send new - car sales to levels of more than 17 million a year .
Now the market has collapsed by 46 percent to below 10 million , as people are making do with the cars they have , leaving the industry to debate  and worry  about what the new normal will be once the recession ends .
Some say the downturn is temporary and that sales will spring back in a few years .
Others believe Americans will rethink whether they need so many cars , particularly new ones .
In their first face - to - face meeting this week , President Obama and his Russian counterpart , Dmitry Medvedev , agreed that the two countries should get back to nuclear arms control .
That might seem retro , and not particularly relevant in the post cold - war age .
But the direction set by the two presidents is very much 21st - century .
And it 's hard to imagine a better way to " reset " this troubled relationship than to hit the weapons - negotiation button .
First , about the relationship , which both presidents diplomatically describe as " drifting . "
Russia would like to be seen as an equal partner with the US in managing the world 's problems .
Maybe someday this will be possible , but not while Moscow acts like a czarist imperialist , claiming a " sphere of influence " over its neighbors , relying on force and threats in places like Georgia .
Not while it unnerves Europe by turning off the energy tap in mid-winter .
Not while it clamps down on freedoms at home , and journalists , activists , and political opponents end up jailed , beaten , and even dead .
The nuclear arena , however , is one area where Moscow and Washington share stature .
It 's smart to converge on an issue where the two countries have equal footing .
As for relevance today , the act of Russia and the US negotiating nuclear arms reductions sets a positive example for nuclear - ambitious countries such as Iran and North Korea ( though one could also argue that reductions might motivate countries with smaller arsenals , such as China , to seek parity ) .
In recent years , Washington and Moscow have unilaterally withdrawn from security treaties : the US in 2001 , when it quit the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ; and Russia in 2007 , when it pulled out of the Conventional Forces in Europe agreement .
Both countries had their reasons , but it's hard to convince others to hold to pacts when you do n't do it yourself .
At the same time , it was encouraging to see Russia agree in a joint statement with the US that Iran must comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as well as the nuclear watchdog , the IAEA .
The world also shudders at the thought of freelance terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons .
With arms control , fewer nukes mean fewer possibilities of wayward nukes .
Specifically , the two presidents agreed to immediately begin negotiating a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( or START ) , which was signed in 1991 and expires at the end of this year .
START brought nuclear warheads down to 6,000 each .
The 2002 Treaty of Moscow followed up with cuts down to 1,700 to 2,200 by 2012 .
Officials from both sides suggested the renegotiation might reduce nuclear arsenals by a third , to 1,500 warheads each .
The US - Russian joint statement went beyond START , and called for international negotiations to end production of fissile material for nuclear weapons .
And , in a first , the statement said , " We committed our two countries to achieving a nuclear - free world . "
The Obama - Medvedev meeting was light on the personal and heavy on the technical .
That seems to match these two young , lawyerly presidents .
It puts the focus on shared interests , as opposed to shared democratic values .
Perhaps if these two countries can settle their differences over interests , they might someday begin to share values .
When we called the new iTunes tiered price scheme " Popular Songs Cost More Money " pricing , we had no idea how accurate that was :
It 's here , but I 've yet to find a single $ 0.69 track .
UPDATED .

Though it may have been naive , the general expectation was that the new $ 1.29 price point , which would cover new releases and perpetually popular songs , would be offset by $ 0.69 deals on , shall we say , less desirable music .
For every $ 1.29 suburb - conquering chart topper by Ne - Yo , we had assumed there would be a $ 0.69 track from , oh , I do n't know , Chumbawamba or something .
Not so !
In fact , I have n't yet found anything at the lower price point , and I have dredged the darkest depths .
Yanni ? $ 0.99 .
LFO ? $ 0.99 .

$ 0.99 .

I 'm probably looking in the wrong place here , but wherever these cheaper tracks are , they 're not anywhere where people are likely to download them .

Training Past 40
If you are approaching 40 years of age or beyond , you are probably starting to realize you can no longer train like you did in your twenties .?
I learned this lesson the hard way .?
At 36 , I tore both quadriceps in seven places .?
Thank God ?
the MRI revealed they were mainly fascia tears not requiring surgery .?
None - the - less , I had to walk with crutches for a week .
18 weeks later , I tore my right hamstring .?
At 38 , I had to have my triceps reattached .?
At 39 , I partially ( 20 % - 25 % ) tore my right pec , but opted not to get surgery .
After that last injury I finally threw in the towel .?
I thought my days of pushing my body with high intensity workouts were over .?
Although , all the areas had been injured in previous years , I still trained in fear because none of these injuries had any preceding symptoms .?
Consequently , my training ? took on ? a very slow tempo ? with insufficient loads .??
This type of training left me ?
feeling like shit , physically and mentally .?
Why train at all if I ca n’t train hard .?
Instead of training smart and doing what I should do for my body , I was too concerned with how I wanted to train .?
Almost to the day , a year after I tore my pec , I was so frustrated with my lack of progress , I decided something had to give .?
I ended up going back to the basics .?
I came to the realization I had to train myself as I would any other client .?
I had to concern myself with what my body could and needed to do .???
The first thing I did was give up exercises that caused me pain no matter how much I loved performing them .?
One of these , unfortunately , was the barbell squat .?
With 3 bulging disks it ’s not worth the pain or the risk .??
The second change I made was incorporating more functional exercises into my workouts .?
These mainly included unilateral exercises and a few stability exercises .?
Perhaps the biggest change I ’ve made is the way I approached my work sets .?
Since I am no longer competing , there is no need for me to walk that tight rope between training with 100 % intensity and injury .?
Do n’t get me wrong , I still perform my sets to failure , but will not train through pain .?
I also stopped doing any kind of cheating at the end of my set to push the limits .
In order to make gains one has to pushing the limits , but it has ?
to be wrangled in .?
For this to happen , the goals you set that govern drive must be adjusted to your current capabilities .?
I have reached a point where I take my time with my goals by practicing wisdom not ego .?
Through training smarter , I found a renewed vigor and enjoyment I had 20 years ago .
From the ' run Microsoft , infect Google ' files :
Google today updated its stable version of the Chrome browser to version 1.0.154.58 to fix a serious security issue .
The ' funny ' thing is the issue is triggered by Microsoft 's Internet Explorer ( IE ) browser .
The issue is very serious and according to Google could potentially enable something called universal cross -site scripting ( UXSS ) without a user having to do anything .
According to Google 's bug report on the issue :
When loaded in Internet Explorer , a specially crafted HTML page can launch Google Chrome with an arbitrary URI without requiring any user interaction .
That 's right friends , if you run into an evil page while running IE , you could force Chrome to open up any pages an attacker wants or even arbitrary JavaScript .
The flaw stems from a handling error that on the surface sounds very similar to one that Mozilla fixed back in 2007 with the 2.0.0.5 release .
How could this happen in 2009 to Chrome ?
Is it Google 's fault or Microsoft's ?
Organization Transplant Claims Another Victim
How a New CEO Affects the CIO
A few weeks ago I ran into a CIO I had n’t seen in a few months .
The last time I had seen him we talked about his job situation .
The CEO he worked for had just been replaced , and the CIO and the new CEO were butting heads .
This situation is pretty common and takes place all over the world .
A new CEO is brought in by the Board of Directors .
There ’s a reason — usually it ’s an attempt to take the company in a new direction or to pull the business out of a slump .
The new CEO knows that she only has a few months to make a difference .
That ’s because after the first six months the board will begin to have second thoughts and will give the new CEO a tighter leash .
Two Approaches for the New CEO
Put yourself in the position of the new CEO .
What do you do ?
There are a couple of basic approaches :
Problem - Solving : Figure out what ’s wrong , then fix it .
This is a logical approach to improving the business but it demands patience and steady nerves .
You ’re going to need to talk to key customers , key employees , and anyone you can find who can give you an impartial opinion .
The evidence will conflict .
There will be a lot of finger - pointing .
You will hear a lot of “ noise ” — negative comments about things that are working well and positive comments about things that are n’t working .
A high level of judgment will be required , but if you can gain focus on the key issues , then you ’ll be able to take clear , decisive action to solve problems quickly .
This approach is like diamond cutting ; it requires a lot of study and then nerves of steel when making the change .
Organization Transplant : Replace the old organization with a new one that ’s worked for you before .
This is a more brute force approach .
It does n’t require great intellect or very much study .
The concept is simple .
You ’ve run a similar organization before , and you have a list of people who have worked for you in the past .
When you ’re hired into a new CEO position you just bring in your own people for all of the major roles .
You superimpose your previous business culture on the new company .
You discard all of the top - level executives reporting to the old CEO and replace them with people from your list who have worked for you in the past .
They run the new company exactly like they ran the old company you both came from .
Which Approach is Better ?
I guess it depends on your point of view .
The Board of Directors want a change , and either approach will lead to a change .
The Organization Transplant approach will probably produce faster results if — and it ’s a big if — the new transplanted organization is actually appropriate for your business .
But there ’s a catch : the kind of organization that can be transplanted is usually bureaucratic and mechanical .
You can transplant a heart but not a soul , and an organization transplant tends to snuff out the cultural spark that may have existed in the company prior to the transplant .
On the other hand the Problem - Solving approach , when it ’s successful , is able to save the existing cultural spark in a company and focus that spark in a new direction .
Problem - Solving removes the things that were preventing the spark from growing , and fans the existing sparks into bright flames of growth and development .
So the choice of approach comes down to the question , “ Is there something in the company worth saving , or should we just overlay the company ’s culture with a new one ? ”
And if we choose the latter approach , what donor do we use for the transplant ?
What if this happens to you ?
Put yourself in the position of the existing CIO .
You get a new boss and you obviously want to make a good impression .
You also want to keep your job .
What do you do ?
Regardless of the approach your new CEO will take , you need to clearly communicate three messages to the new CEO :
You ’re on top of what ’s going on in your company .
You know the business inside and out , you understand the business processes that are being used throughout the company , and you know where the best opportunities are for improvement .
Make the new CEO believe that he would be a fool to bring in someone else for your job – you ’re just too valuable .
You ’re willing and eager to alter your IT strategy to fit the new CEO ’s interests .
You ’re not a problem for the new CEO – you ’re an asset .
You understand and acknowledge the weaknesses of your current processes , systems , and infrastructure .
You know why there are weaknesses ( e.g. , lack of budget emphasis ) , and you ’re eager to fix them .
You accept criticism as a way of identifying opportunities for improvement .
You ’re not someone who will fight progress – you ’ll be an ally in the battle .
What ’s the result ?
All you can do is your best , but you ’re not in control in a situation like this – the CEO is .
In the case of my friend the CIO , his Board of Directors chose the Organization Transplant approach .
He made a strong effort to communicate with the new CEO and help solve the problems facing the company , but it was n’t enough .
He ’s being replaced with someone from outside , as are many of his counterparts in other business organizations .
Will his company survive ?
We ’ll see .
But one thing ’s for certain : the company ’s soul will never be the same .
AMD has been seriously behind the curve in process reduction compared to Intel .
Even though they did manage to begin fabbing 45 nm parts , they still only have a fairly limited selection , comprising the quad - core Phenom II X4 800 and 900 series as well as the triple - core Phenom II X3 700 series .
That could change very soon , according to a recent report from DigiTimes , which claims AMD is planning to move all desktop CPU production over to the new process , starting in June with the dual - core Phenom II X2 500 series and the venerable Athlon II X2 200 chips .
New 45 nm parts in the quad - core Athlon II X4 600 series and triple - core Athlon II X3 400 series should follow in September .
The transition is expected to help AMD reduce manufacturing costs while making its processors more competitive from a price / performance standpoint .
In the shorter term , however , during the period between the end of 2Q and 3Q , the company is set to launch a plethora of new processors , which will reportedly include no less than ten low - power Phenom IIs and Athlon IIs as well as 95W quad - core Phenom IIs .
If correct , this would mean most of AMD 's upcoming offerings will launch just before Intel 's planned release of three quad - core Nehalem derivatives , codenamed Lynnfield , in the third quarter of 2009 with prices ranging from $ 196 to $ 562 in 1,000 - unit tray quantities .
The U.S. military 's premiere research agency is already trying to use math to predict human behavior and neuroscience to replicate a primate 's brain .
The next step : Lean on the study of energy and heat to create an entirely new theory for how intelligence actually works .
The idea behind Darpa ’s latest venture , called " Physical Intelligence ” ( PI ) is to prove , mathematically , that the human mind is nothing more than parts and energy .
In other words , all brain activities – reasoning , emoting , processing sights and smells – derive from physical mechanisms at work , acting according to the principles of " thermodynamics in open systems . ”
Thermodynamics is founded on the conversion of energy into work and heat within a system ( which could be anything from a test - tube solution to a planet ) .
The processes can be summed up in formalized equations and laws , which are then used to describe how systems react to changes in their surroundings .
Now , the military wants a new equation : one that explains the human mind as a thermodynamic system .
Once that ’s done , they ’re asking for “ abiotic , self - organizing electronic and chemical systems ” that display the PI principles .
More than just computers that think , Darpa wants to re-envision how thought works – and then design computers whose thought processes are governed by the same laws as our own .
Sounds spooky , but what Darpa suggests has been kicking around as branch of philosophy , called physicalism , since the early 20th century .
And researchers have already designed computers that can solve problems of complex physics .
What is a little freaky is what DARPA ’s new paradigm would mean for the distinction , or lack thereof , between humans and machines .
*“ If successful , the program would launch a revolution of understanding across many fields of human endeavor , demonstrate the first intelligence engineered from first principles , create new classes of electronic , computational , and chemical systems , and create tools to engineer intelligent systems that match the problem / environment in which they will exist . ” *
Even for Darpa , this is a wildly ambitious goal – one that may never be reached .
But if the human mind is nothing more than the sum of its parts , Darpa ’s new paradigm just might create computational intelligence that outdoes our own thermodynamic capabilities ... making your brain the equivalent of last year 's model .

It ’s hard to say when , exactly , 50 Cent crossed the line in his feud with the Miami rapper Rick Ross .
The more apt question might be : How many lines are there ?
He tracked down the mother of a Ross associate , DJ Khaled , at work , filming her sleeping on the job .
He taped himself taking the mother of one of Mr. Ross ’s children to buy a fur coat .
He acquired and posted to the Internet a pornographic video starring another of Mr. Ross ’s ex-girlfriends .
Rick
Ross must have seemed an especially easy mark  it had already been a tough few months for his fourth wall .
Before he was Rick Ross , the drug boss M.C. , he had been William Leonard Roberts , and last summer a photograph surfaced of him from the mid-1990s , graduating from a corrections officer academy .
He denied its authenticity  until The Smoking Gun got hold of his Florida Corrections Department personnel file , which included a certificate for perfect attendance .
The facts of Mr. Roberts ’s life were getting in the way of Mr. Ross ’s career .
To all this upheaval , Rick Ross  who , while he has been popular , has never quite been great  has replied , improbably , with art .
“ I see no reason to run to the dark , ” he said in a recent interview in the Manhattan offices of his label , Def Jam .
His songs aimed at 50 Cent have , hands down , been sharper and wittier than those of his rival .
And the just - released “ Deeper Than Rap ” ( Maybach Music / Slip N’ Slide / Def Jam ) , his third album , is unexpectedly fantastic , by far his best .

There was a dinner Wednesday and , according to the agenda , Thursday begins with a quick declaration of goals at 8 a.m. , then an 8:10 a.m. session labeled , " Fair Syndication Consortium / Attributor . "
It 's described as a " presentation on technology / service to track content on the Web and to extract payments from third - parties and ad networks that have appropriated newspaper content . "
Presumably , Google , Yahoo !
and any one of thousands of websites could , and should , get mentioned with scant reverence .
Perhaps the age of content theft is coming to an end .
That first session is followed by " Journalism Online : Presentation on proposed service to charge for access to newspaper content and to license that content that ( sic ) online aggregators " ( the assistance of at least one of the many copy editors sent packing by the attendees might have been sought ) .
That presentation would seem quite important , with many conflicting ideas floating about whether charging will work and how to even try .
The stark reality is that the industry will have to soon start demanding payment for at least some of its online handiwork .
There are various ways to go about it , and one size wo n't fit all .
During their days of print advertising plenty , the people in this room , or their predecessors , made the catastrophic , myopic decision to not charge .
They gave away their expensive efforts for free .
They by and large misjudged the significance of the internet .
It 's now safe to wager that most attendees , who were scheduled to include Michael Golden of the New York Times , Gary Pruitt of McClatchy and Tom Curley of the Associated Press , will be dragged into charging for at least some online content .
Cross one 's fingers that a dirty little industry secret , namely the qualitative decline of many papers ( the New York Times a notable exception ) amid rampant cost- cutting , does n't now give even long - loyal consumers legitimate pause about paying up .
Ultimately , many in attendance will start charging for some online content because they do n't know what else to do .
They will listen to a session titled , " Aggregating User Data : Collecting enhanced online newspaper user data across newspaper properties and mining that data to aggressively sell target content to specific audience segments across the network ( e.g. golf enthusiasts ) . "
Hey , perhaps an industry largely inept at creative marketing will corral Tiger Woods , or other cultural icons , as spokesmen .
They could do worse .
There will be a " discussion about content models " and , then , lunch .
The afternoon brings a session on the disastrous decline in classified advertising and , finally , talk of " Next steps " before most folks scoot to O'Hare and home .
I suspect some at this de facto summit were , at best , passable managers while times were flush but never really cut out to think on their feet .
There are a few leading executives who come from the considerably easier realms of television and radio , where they made lots of money and then got promoted to oversee the far more complicated organisms of newspapers at their multi-media corporations .

After weeks of suspense , the Federal Reserve revealed the results of its bank stress tests Thursday — as if they actually meant something .
The Fed claimed to have conducted a rigorous investigation of the nation ’s 19 biggest banks to determine which ones would need more capital in the event of further economic woes , like a spike in unemployment or a dip in home prices or GDP .
And according to Fed chairman Ben Bernanke , we should take “ considerable comfort ” in the results .
But do n’t be fooled by the drama :
All the stress tests did is hand the banks a free pass for further federal aid .
The tests were a meaningless exercise in numerous ways .
For starters , the results were predictable — the 10 banks that need more capital were obviously still struggling .
Nor was there a big mystery about how much capital they required :
There are rules that determine the amount of money banks should set aside to cover their risks , and had those rules been enforced , the institutions would n’t now be dependent on the public dime .
What makes the hype over the stress tests so galling is that the Fed should have been doing this kind of monitoring all along .
But the most farcical thing about the process is that after more than two months of intrigue and secrecy and tactical leaks , we still do n’t have an accurate picture of the weaknesses of the financial system .
In fact , the banks were allowed to participate in the design of the tests — for instance , by naming the price of the securities that they ca n’t get rid of .
Now , the government is using the results as rubber stamps for the flawed policy it has pursued since the crisis started .
Before the stress tests , banks received trillions of dollars through various federal channels .
Now , well , we have tests to confirm that we should keep doing the same thing .
Bernanke said as much to Congress on Tuesday : “ Bank holding companies will be required to develop comprehensive capital plans for establishing the required buffers … with the assurance that equity capital from the Treasury under the Capital Assistance Program will be available as needed . ”
Translation : Banks get to choose how to find more capital .
And if they fail to raise enough funds , the government will keep dumping money into mismanaged firms , in the hope that it will one day trickle down to the little people .
The banks that came up short in the stress - test sweepstakes have seen the biggest drops in their stock prices — and thus lost the most taxpayer money — since they got their first TARP injections last October .
( This list includes Citigroup , Bank of America , Wells Fargo , PNC Financial Services Group , SunTrust Banks , Fifth Third Bancorp , and Regions Financial Corp . )
If the TARP infusions plus the trillions in cheap loans provided by the Fed have n’t worked , another round of new capital probably wo n’t either .
Finally , despite Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner ’s declaration that the results are “ reassuring , ” the banks are likely in worse shape than the tests suggest .
Just because a bank avoided the capital penalty box does n’t mean it ’s healthy .
Some , like Goldman Sachs , are investment banks that converted to bank holding companies last fall in order to access federal money , and received a two - year grace period to standardize their books with other banks .
And some happen to enjoy a symbiotic relationship with the Fed , like JPMorgan Chase , whose last two takeovers ( of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual ) were government - funded .
JPMorgan
Chase ’s stock was one of the biggest losers after TARP began , yet its tests indicated that it has somehow taken care of its capital needs just fine .
Those banks that were ordered by the Fed to come up with more capital may also be shakier than Geithner would have us believe .
The two biggest problem banks , Citigroup and Bank of America , spent last week frantically trying to persuade the Fed that they did n’t need extra capital , although they both posted significant increases in losses from loans in their most recent quarterly results .
Bank of America ’s CEO Ken Lewis insisted , “ We absolutely do n’t think we need additional capital . ”
Guess what ?
His bank needs $ 33.9 billion , according to the government .
The glaring mismatch between the banks ’ rosy public statements and the Fed ’s ( gentle ) testing suggests a troubling reluctance to face hard facts about the real condition of the banking system .
Too many numbers are open to interpretation and debate , which usually means that things are worse than they seem .
It ’s time for the truth from the Fed , or the Treasury , or the White House .
We need a different approach that provides capital directly to consumer loans , in order to loosen up credit , provide relief for struggling citizens , and stabilize failing banks .
Instead , the government ’s solution is merely to do more of the same .
Which means that before very long , the same banks will be lining up at the public till , asking for more of our money .
From the headlines of the Wall Street Journal : “ Banks Aiming to Play Both Sides of Coin — Industry Lobbies FDIC to Let Some Buy Toxic Assets With Taypayer Aid From Own Loan Books ( subscription required , but Calculated Risk has an excerpt ) .
I thought the headline had to be a mistake until I read the article .
To recap : The Public - Private Investment Program provides subsidies to private investors to encourage them to buy legacy loans from banks .
The goal is to encourage buyers to bid more than they are currently willing to pay , and hopefully close the gap with the prices at which the banks are willing to sell .
Allowing banks to buy their own assets under the PPIP is a terrible idea .
In short , it allows a bank to sell half of its toxic loans to Treasury – at a price set by the bank .
I ’ll take this in steps .
Assume that a bank has a portfolio of loans on its books at $ 100 and that , when held to maturity , those loans will turn out to be worth $ 90 .
In the absence of any transaction , it will end up losing $ 10 .
First , imagine the bank is buying these loans from itself with no government support .
Let ’s say it decides to pay itself $ 80 .
Obviously this does nothing – no cash has changed hands , and the bank still has the toxic loans .
It might take a $ 20 “ loss ” today , but it will gain $ 10 by holding those loans to maturity , so its net loss is still $ 10 .
Second , imagine that the bank creates an investment fund where its own money is matched dollar - for - dollar by Treasury money .
If the fund buys the loans from the bank at $ 100 , then the fund will eventually lose $ 10 .
That loss will be split between the bank and Treasury , so now the bank ’s net loss is only $ 5 , because the other $ 5 of losses is absorbed by Treasury .
Conversely , if the fund pays less than $ 90 for the loans , the gains will be split with Treasury , so the bank ’s net loss will exceed $ 10 .
If it pays exactly $ 90 , then the bank is no better or worse off than before the transaction .
In other words , it ’s exactly the same as if half of the loans were sold to Treasury , with the bank holding onto the other half .
From the bank ’s perspective , it wants the price to be as high as possible .
Third , imagine that the equity in the investment fund is split evenly between the bank and Treasury , but it is leveraged up to six - to - one by a loan that has an FDIC guarantee .
This has the effect of capping the bank ’s downside if the loans do really badly .
The guarantee would n’t kick in if the loans end up being worth $ 90 , but let ’s say they end up being worth $ 70 .
Now if the fund pays $ 90 for the loans , that is about $ 6.50 of bank money , $ 6.50 of Treasury money , and $ 77 of FDIC - guaranteed loan .
So the bank loses $ 6.50 , Treasury loses $ 6.50 , and the FDIC loses $ 17 .
With no transaction , the bank would have lost $ 30 .
The third scenario is the PPIP .
So if banks are allowed to buy their own loans , they will have the incentive to overbid for those loans .
As long as the price they pay exceeds the eventual value of the loans , they will come out ahead , even without the loan guarantees .
This is bound to close the gap between buyers ’ bids and sellers ’ reservation prices – by ensuring that at least one buyer ( the bank ) will bid more than the reservation price set by the seller ( the bank ) .
And the way these investment funds are set up , the private equity partner – the bank – will be the one deciding how much to bid ; the whole point of these “ partnerships ” was to get the government out of the business of valuing assets .
In short , since the government does n’t have the expertise necessary to guard the henhouse , we ’ll let the fox do it .
Do you think this is so crazy it could n’t possibly be what the banking lobby is asking for ?
Consider this :
[ Norman R. ]
Nelson proposed to the FDIC that banks be allowed to control as much as half the capital in a buyers ’ group .
In some cases , he wrote , “ the selling bank should be able to participate as the only private - sector equity investor . ”
( Nelson is general counsel of the Clearing House Association , a trade group representing ten of the world ’s largest banks . )
The blather being spouted in support of this self - dealing is so blatantly disingenuous it makes you wonder if this is some sort of joke .
“ Banks may be more willing to accept a lower initial price if they and their shareholders have a meaningful opportunity to share in the upside , ” Norman R. Nelson . . . wrote in a letter to the FDIC last month .
Um , no .
Participating as buyers will only ensure that banks will be motivated to overpay .
If they think that the price is too low , they would prefer to just hold onto the asset – especially now that the stress tests have made clear that no bank will be forced to liquidate assets under pressure .
“ Bankers see it as a win- win , ” said Tanya Wheeless , chief executive of the Arizona Bankers Association , which has urged the FDIC to let banks buy their own assets through PPIP .
That ’s absolutely true – for them , that is .
Towne Bank of Arizona plans to sell some of its soured real - estate loans into PPIP and wants to profit from the program .
“ We think it would be attractive to our shareholders to be able to share in whatever profits there are from the venture , ” said CEO Patrick Patrick .
It seems like this proposal is too extreme for some people in the banking lobby to support ; neither Scott Talbott of the Financial Services Roundtable nor Edward Yingling of the American Bankers Association was quoted .
You would think that the government would slap down this idea in a second .
But here ’s the FDIC spokesman on the issue : “ It ’s an issue that ’s been raised and an issue we ’re aware will need specific guidelines . ”
Now , even if banks are n’t allowed to buy assets directly from themselves , there are still reasons to be worried .
If you think of the banking sector as one big entity , then it ’s obviously in the interests of that entity to buy assets from itself exactly as described above – only with Bank A buying from Bank B and Bank B buying from Bank A ( or more complicated permutations as required ) .
In other words , there is a massive incentive to collude .
Now , collusion is illegal .
So the question is whether the banks can get themselves into an equilibrium where they all overpay for each other ’s assets – thereby benefiting everyone – without actually conspiring to do so .
This is like when one airline raises prices and immediately every other airline follows suit – there ’s nothing illegal about it , even though the end result is the same as if they had colluded .
But let ’s not make it easy for them .
If this proposal has any chance of going anywhere , then Tim Geithner or Sheila Bair should come out and reject it right now .

Child 44 : A Review
Gadadammit , this book , she start so good .
After some chilling backstory about children starving to death in the Russian woods , in Tom Rob Smith 's " Child 44 " we enter the life of Soviet Secret Police - man Leo Demidov , war hero and poster - child for communist political hygiene and proletarian virtue .
Demidov is stupid , strong , and lucky -- a consummate survivor who is also " the best hunter in the world . "
He always gets his man .
His man is also always " decided " to be guilty , giving Demidov a rock - solid , hundred - percent conviction rate .
Demidov knows exactly how to torture suspects until he gets a confession , knows exactly how to kill subversives quickly before they can recant , and knows exactly how to hit the showers with the rest of the boys to talk Soviet Secret Police shop - talk in order to keep his record clean ( it is like regular shop - talk , only with more hollowed - out rubles for storing microfilm ) .
Demidov has personally killed hundreds of innocent men , women , and children .
He 's fingered thousands .
Also , he 's a meth addict .
Demidov seems like an unlikely candidate for a detective - hero , mainly because he has no deductive skills nor horse sense nor psychological guile nor gadgets nor morals nor sympathy .
He 's certainly no Porfiry Petrovich , having his sad little laughs while nailing down murderers left and right using only the Devil 's own intuition .
Demidov is more like a James Ellroy dick : it 's only an accident that he's on the right side of the law .
This is especially true in Stalinist Russia , where there are no sides , only a twisting labyrinth where the Man of Steel pursues dissidents like the Minotaur , rising out of nowhere to destroy lives just for the fun of it .
Demidov is no hero : instead , he is the bumbling soul of Russia , following the conduits of power and supposedly doing the right thing despite the prima facie EVIL ( hoo - hoo - hoo - ha - ha - ha ) of his orders and superiors .
In a totalitarian state , crime is n't doing what 's wrong .
Crime is doing anything that criminals do .
" Child 44 " begins as police procedural and slice - of - Stalinist - life , but the thrills come fast as Demidov gets in over his head on a case that can't be solved ( this time ) by rounding up all the local gays and sending them to Siberia .
But " Child 44 " is only a serial - killer - thriller - novel on the surface .
It is really about how hard it is to find a killer of innocents in a place where no one ever is .
One of the most fun things about this book is that all the standard cop drama shit is intact -- a supercop , in trouble with superiors , in trouble with a spouse , acting on a rogue hunch about a controversial crime , with a drug problem -- except that the cop in question is a professional thug for the worst , bloodiest dictatorship in human history .
He is a purger in " the " purges .
" You 're off the case , Demidov !
You 're being demoted to patrolman !
" " Ooo , that burns me good , Chief .
I 'll show you : I 'll bring in the biggest , most subversive gay German spy I can find .
I 'll torture him for DAYS .
I 'll plant so much evidence , so much evidence ... why ... he 'll be convicted of every crime we 've got !
" It really makes you think .
About cliches .
About authority .
About justice .
" Child 44 " begins with a confluence of two unrelated events that result in Demidov 's slow , plodding political fall and subsequent awakening : the murder of a young child is covered up by the secret police ( nothing new ) and then Leo is instructed to investigate his own wife , Raisa , for secret subversive spy activity .
I could tell you the plot of the book , but instead , I 'll simply tell you about the true story of Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo , also known as the Rostov Ripper .
Chikatilo was a chronic bed - wetter raised by his mom who told him that his older brother had been kidnapped and eaten by starving neighbors and whose father was branded a traitor for surrendering to Nazi soldiers during the Great Patriotic War .
Chikatilo could only become sexually aroused by killing women and children , which means that he only became sexually aroused 52 times in his life , which is not a high number if you think about it .
That 's a dry week for a college freshman , for instance .
After murdering folks for forty years , getting married , and raising two children of his own , Chikatilo was finally caught in the nineties .
From Wikipedia :
" On 6 November 1990 , Chikatilo killed and mutilated Sveta Korostik .
While leaving the crime scene , he was stopped by an undercover policeman who was patrolling the Leskhoz train station and saw Chikatilo approaching from the woods .
According to the policeman , he looked suspicious .
The only reason for someone to go into the woods at that time of year was to gather wild mushrooms ( a popular pastime in Russia ) .
However , Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest hiker .
He was wearing more formal attire .
Moreover , he had a nylon sports bag , which was not suitable for carrying mushrooms .
His clothing was dirty and he had what looked like smeared blood stains on his cheek and ear .
The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers .
Having no formal reason for arrest , Chikatilo was not held .
Had Chikatilo's bag been checked , he would have found the amputated breasts of Sveta Korostik .
" As a result of being stopped by the policeman , however , Chikatilo was tagged as a " person of interest . "
The Soviet police followed Chikatilo around and saw that he was always trying to give beer to young children .
They arrested him and got a confession .
In fact , they got 52 confessions .
From Wikipedia again : " The trial ended in July and sentencing was postponed until October 15 when he was found guilty of 52 of the 53 murders and sentenced to death for each offense .
Judge Leonid Akhobzyanov made the following speech : " Taking into consideration the monstrous crimes he committed , this court has no alternative but to impose the only sentence that he deserves .
I therefore sentence him to death . "
After hearing the sentence , the audience , made up of victim 's families , broke into applause .
When given a chance to speak , Chikatilo delivered a rambling speech , blaming the regime , certain political leaders , his impotence ( even removing his trousers at one point ) and defending himself by blaming his childhood experiences during the famine in Ukraine in the 1930s .
At one point he claimed that he had done a favor to society by cleansing it of " worthless people " .
Chikatilo was seen saying something as police removed him from his iron cage and led him away .
On January 4 , 1994 , Russian President Boris Yeltsin refused a last ditch appeal for clemency .
On February 14 , Chikatilo was taken to a soundproofed room in Novocherkassk prison and executed by a single gunshot behind the right ear .
" The point of " Child 44 " is that the only thing worse than a twisted , psychotic serial killer on the loose is a whole country with a pathological , paranoid , and genocidal agenda .
The best ( and most disturbing ) parts of this book are the parts where the Soviet system grinds down our heroes no matter what they do , causing them to become hard , flinty , and careless : why bother following the law if you are doomed anyway when arbitrary suspicion falls on your shoulders ?
" Child 44 " is a fun read , and it is supposedly the first part of a trilogy .
The sequel , " The Secret Speech , " is already out .
If you like lurid , grotesque , exploitative Soviet strife - porn , you 'll like these books .
As long as you understand that the real villain is not the " serial killer , " but the bigger and bolder antagonist known as " the State " ( the serial killer is only a henchman ) , it is easy to ignore some of the book 's more unfortunate narrative choices and to see " Child 44 " more as some kind of dopy allegory .
Otherwise , the book suffers from several decisions toward the end that result in an awful , contrived conclusion that seems cobbled together in order for the book to quickly become a smash - hit Hollywood movie .
I hate to make that claim because it is a serious criticism to raise against a piece of literature , but it feels true , nonetheless .
I hate to accuse this book of subversive , capitalist sympathies .
I hate to call this book a traitor to narrative .
I hate to name names .
I hate to point fingers .
But I have to tell you , I dug this book mightily until the final piece of the puzzle was revealed , and then finishing it was like chewing tree bark to keep from being hungry .
I 'm just warning you before you decide to pick this book up and get involved in its gripping , punchy narrative : " Child 44 " has one of the most implausible , silly finales I 've ever read .
I do n't want you to blame me later .
I do n't want you to write me furious letters , because we 're all friends here , and there are plenty of other reasons to read a piece of literature other than climax and resolution .
Why did n't somebody take Smith aside and say : " No , Tom .
You have to change this .
No one will believe your ending .
And then they wo n't believe the other stuff you wrote either .
About Stalin .
About the purges .
You have to write a believable lie if you want people to believe the terrible truth .
" Because like a child being gutted in the snow ... Like Tzarist Russia herself ... Like those who devoted their lives to the Communist cause , only to end up starving to death in one of Stalin 's gulags ... Gadadammit , this book , she end so bad .

While guest hosting Bill Bennett ’s radio show , RNC Chairman Michael Steele called the base of the party that he leads bigoted for rejected Mitt Romney in 2008 based on his Mormon faith .
When your own chairman calls you bigoted , Republicans , you have some real issues .
Here is the audio courtesy of Think Progress :
Steele was arguing with a caller who believed that the Republican Party was hijacked by the Democratic Party and the New York Times .
He said , Yeah , but let me ask you . ”
Ok , Jay , I ’m there with you .
But remember , it was the base that rejected Mitt because of his switch on pro-life , from pro-choice to pro-life .
It was the base that rejected Mitt because it had issues with Mormonism .
It was the base that rejected Mitch , Mitt , because they thought he was back and forth and waffling on those very economic issues you ’re talking about .
So , I mean , I hear what you ’re saying , but before we even got to a primary vote , the base had made very clear they had issues with Mitt because if they did n’t , he would have defeated John McCain in those primaries in which he lost . ”

Everyone knows that Michael Steele is correct .
Romney had no chance last year , and will only get the 2012 nomination if Republicans are looking for a sacrificial lamb to get steamrolled by Obama .
I ca n’t even begin to tell you the number of Republicans and even local party officials who privately mentioned to me they would not support a Mormon for the Republican nomination .
Mitt Romney was / is trying to win a nomination , so he pretended that this was n’t about his religion , but it was to some , but not all Republicans .
Not all Republicans are bigots , and some rejected Romney based on his habit of flip flopping on everything .
The most vicious Romney smears came from evangelical Republicans , who make up 60 % - 70 % of the Republican Party ’s primary base .
As far as Democrats hijacking the Republican primaries , that is insane .
I remember a certain fat drug addicted talk show host touting his Operation Chaos plan to get Republicans to cross over and support Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary , because they thought that she would be easier to defeat , but Steele is right on the money , when it comes to the base of his party .
What does it say about the current state of the GOP when , their own chairman calls them bigots who discriminated against a candidate on the basis of religion ?
The GOP has no national appeal , no diversity , except for the token at the top , and no policies , but hey , at least the white evangelicals are happy now , and their continued happiness will translate into Democratic victories at the polls .
Anybody who uses the Internet regularly basically do the same things each day – login into email accounts to check messages , read feeds , check social networking sites for replies and so on .
To aid us in these tasks we use bookmarks and stuff like speed dials , tools to auto fill forms , passwords managers to save our passwords and so on .
Now add to this growing arsenal of automation tool an important one that was missing for all these years – a macro recorder .
A macro recorder , if you heard the term for the first time , is a software that records user actions and plays it back at a later time .
The advantage of using a macro recorder is that it allows a user to perform repetitive tasks and often complex operations over and over again with minimum interaction .
A user just needs to record the sequence of events and then automatically make it perform the same sequence whenever he desires without raising a finger .
Cool , is n’t it ?
DejaClick is that amazing extension that brings a macro recorder to Firefox .
DejaClick installs a toolbar on the browser with buttons like record , play , open , save etc .
To create a macro first you have to power on the toolbar which remains turned off by default .
Open a new tab , click on the Record button , and proceed to open the site , login to your account or do whatever you wish to record .
During the recording a status bar will pop up at the bottom displaying information about the progress of the recording .
Once you are done , stop the recording and save the macro script on the hard disk .
Now whenever you wish to play the macro just load this script and hit the play button .
Alternatively , you can save the script as a bookmark making it even easier to execute the macro .

You can get a detailed result of the recorded script and after every time you execute it on a side panel .
Later you can make minor modification to the macro like altering the speed of execution , set a timeout duration and even simulate the pauses between each event as recorded .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia signed a landmark deal to supply nuclear fuel directly to U.S. companies on Tuesday , setting itself up to control 20 percent of the U.S. uranium market and extending its global reach in the nuclear sector .
At a ceremony in the Russian capital , U.S. electricity firms PG&E , Ameren Corp and Luminant signed deals to get more than $ 1 billion in uranium supplies from Russia ’s state nuclear fuel exporter Tenex between 2014 and 2020 .
“ This is a revolutionary breakthrough , ” Sergei Kiriyenko , the head of Russia ’s state atomic energy firm , Rosatom , which controls Tenex , told reporters .
Until last year , U.S. anti-dumping laws had only allowed Russia to sell the United States uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons .
These sales are carried out through U.S. uranium trader USEC Inc .
“ We have broken through the wall forbidding us to sell Russian fuel to the American market .
After the contracts signed today , we will start new contracts , ” a jubilant Kiriyenko said after drinking toasts of champagne with the Americans .
“ This is only the beginning . ”
Bruce Hamilton , the president of Fuelco , the intermediary set up by the three U.S. companies for the deal with Russia , said Tuesday ’s agreements open the door for Russia to directly take 20 percent of the U.S. uranium market between 2014 and 2020 .
“ The Russians do it all .
They mine it , they convert it and they enrich it , ” Hamilton told Reuters after the deals were signed .
“ And after 2020 , it ’s just wide open ( for Russia ) . ”
The Russian fuel would be used initially to provide power to 5 million U.S. homes in California , Texas and Missouri , he added .
NUCLEAR STORAGE IN THE U.S .
Russia , one of the world ’s biggest nuclear players , has long been seeking to expand its clout in the sector by moving into developed markets such as the United States , European Union and Japan .
Earlier this year , it signed deals to cooperate with Japan ’s Toshiba and Germany ’s Siemens , putting Russia in the center of a nuclear alliance stretching from Western Europe to East Asia .
Tuesday ’s deals extended its reach further into the United States , where Russia is now discussing access to nuclear infrastructure , such as uranium storage facilities , Kiriyenko said .
“ The directors of the U.S. energy companies discussed this with us .
For them it would be more convenient if these facilities were located right in the United States .
This is a logical step for us , ” Kiriyenko told reporters .
He added that these facilities would be jointly owned .
Hamilton declined to comment on this project .
U.S. anti-dumping laws were eased last year in a deal between Moscow and Washington to allow direct sales of uranium to other U.S. firms aside from USEC .
Analysts expect the increased access for Russian uranium to lead to lower prices in the United States .
The head of Tenex , which is also known as Techsnabexport , said his company expects to get as much as 25 percent of the U.S. uranium market through the deals signed on Tuesday .
“ I am confident other similar deals will follow , ” Tenex CEO Anatoly Grigoryev , who signed all the contracts on behalf of the Russian side , told reporters .

And then , if things did n't improve , they 'd deliver those presents -- in person -- and stay with their distant friends until times got better .
Wiessner believes that those networks did n't just allow tribes to survive .
She thinks it may account for how humans were able to move out of Africa into Eurasia and Australia so quickly , 45,000 years ago ... a move that researchers think transpired over a mere 5,000 years .
( Five thousand years may not sound very quick , but in the overall scheme of things , it was a pretty zippy pace . )
Much as explorers , mountain climbers , or advancing armies rely on supply trains and camps to support their forays into new territory , Wiessner believes the Africans relied on ties with an evolving string of communities behind them to enable their new explorations north and eastward .
So how does this relate to new social networking technology ?
Two ways .
First , Wiessner notes , the !
Kung are now far more limited in their ability to move around to survive hard times .
But she tells of how some of them figured out how to use a satellite phone to contact Wiessner in Utah to ask her to buy sneakers another westerner had promised them , and bring them with her on her next trip to Africa .
Wiessner points to the story as an example of how modern technology has helped an ancient people adapt an age - old concept to assist their survival in the modern world .
" By accessing this satellite phone and devising the complex strategy to get the shoes , they 'd extended the range of their support network from 200 to 15,000 kiometers , " she explains .
But Wiessner also points to Facebook as a modern - day version of those old !
Kung social networks .
" People who use it way it keeps memories of distant friends alive , and it sometimes brings long - lost relationships back home , " she says .
" The videos and snapshots that people post echo the exchange gifts of the ! Kung . "
And , she notes , " one constantly hears stories of people finding jobs and business opportunities through these sites . "
So on the one hand ... satellite phones , wireless technology , and internet social networking sites not only help us to survive hard times , but also can even help ancient tribes adapt to a changing modern world .
Terrific !
But on the other side of that same page in the Science section was an article headlined , " Texting May Be Taking a Toll . "
In this second article , Katie Hafner looks at the potential medical and developmental problems teens may suffer as a result of over - texting .
( Sending and receiving hundreds of texts a day is apparently not uncommon for many teenagers . )
Potential problems range from injured thumbs to decreased autonomy , sleep deprivation , and interference in a teenager 's ability to develop complex thoughts or figure out who they want to be .
But what intrigued me most was a teenager 's complaint that she was being scolded for being addicted to texting by a mother who was equally addicted to cell phone use .
" Teenagers , " the article notes , " still need their parents ' undivided attention . "
And cell phones -- on both ends -- get in the way .
So .
What do we make of that ?
Is all this technology helpful ?
Or hurtful ?
Answer : Yes .
In his book American Genesis , Thomas Hughes talks about technology expressing " long - held human values and aspirations " and being both a shaper of , and shaped by , values .
We clearly value social networks ; they may even have been the supply chain that enabled our species ' rapid expansion across the continents .
As a result , we create technology and systems to enhance those networks .
The trick , as in the tale of the sorcerer 's apprentice , is to keep the magic broom from getting out of control .
It 's not a new problem .
Technology often creates new problems , even as it solves old ones .
The advent of computerized flight management systems in airline cockpits , for example , was supposed to relieve the workload and improve safety .
While the new technology achieved that goal overall , having to program the systems created a new problem of pilots being " heads down and locked " -- or , concentrating on programming the computer to the detriment of overall safety awareness .
( see : American Airlines ' 1995 crash in Cali , Columbia ) .
As a result , new training and procedures had to be developed to counter the safety problems the new technology had unintentionally spawned .
Unfortunately , it 's harder to train humans how to use cell phones and internet - based social networks for all the advantages they offer without letting the technology get in the way of the very thing it was supposed to assist .
Balanced use is a challenge with any new technology , and we do n't always do such a terrific job of achieving it .
No easy answers to that one .
Just an interesting and ... ironically enough , unintended ... juxtaposition of both sides of a technological sword .

How to cook in a hot box ( and save energy )
When I heard about cooking in a hot box on Pia Taylor ’s Mother City Living blog last year , I knew straight away that I had to have one .
I ’m always looking for ways to reduce my energy usage , so a hot box seemed a perfect addition to my energy saving toolbox .
I did a bit of research into where to buy a hot box , and settled on buying a Salathiso hot box , because the sales of these particular hot boxes do n’t line the pockets of any business owner , but have brought hope and light into the lives of unemployed single mothers in Kayamandi ( Stellenbosch , South Africa ) by allowing them to generate a small income for themselves .
Salathiso hot boxes are simply two polystyrene - filled cushions in beautiful Shweshwe fabric that can be placed in a cardboard box for insulation , but I ’ve been using my hot box without the cardboard box and it works pretty well .
During winter I plan to use a cardboard box for extra insulation .
Here ’s how to use a hot box :
Once you ’ve brought your pot of food to the boil , remove it from the heat source and place it ( still in the pot ) in the bottom half of the hot box ( I put a folded piece of newspaper under the pot for extra insulation and to soak up spills should they happen ) .
Then fit the top cushion snugly on top .
You can now leave your food safely cooking away while you get on with your day .
I ’ve made a series of very successful dishes with my hot box over the past few months including stews , savoury mince and curries , and my absolute favourite thing to cook in the hot box is rice , because , for the first time in my life , now I too can cook rice perfectly .
It ’s been easy to adapt my usual recipes for use in the hot box , all you need to do is reduce the amount of cooking liquid ( because less is lost through evaporation in a hot box than on the stove ) , and leave the food to cook in the hot box for a longer period than you would do on the stove .
For example I ’ve found that 2 - 3 hours makes for perfect rice , while stew , soups and curries need between 6 and 12 hours for optimal results .
If you ’d prefer to get started with some tried and tested recipes , check out this link ( pdf ) .
In South Africa :
Salathiso hot boxes are available in Cape Town from Wendy Walton who is based in Diep River .
You can contact her at [ email protected ] or on 021 712 6424 ( please tell Wendy I sent you ) .
A hot box from Salathiso will set you back R140 , but if used often will save you far more than that in electricity in the long run .
( BTW these are still cheaper than other locally available hot boxes . )
In the UK & US :
Hot boxes ( or hay boxes as they ’re also known ) do n’t seem to be available for sale in the UK or US .
So how about making your own .

Apartments • Seattle , United States Architects : Pb Elemental Architecture
Area Area of this architecture project Area : 650 m²
Year Completion year of this architecture project Year : 2008
Text description provided by the architects .
The four unit project is a premier home placed in a small suburb of South Seattle called Beacon Hill .
Surrounded by older one story brick homes , the bold multi-family building rises up 3 levels and is topped off with a generous cedar roof deck .
Design begins on the entry floor , where residents are offered a sense of privacy stepping down a few stairs , behind a concrete wall to enter the homes .
Grass inserts line the 4 - stall parking area to reduce water run-off .
The home is bathed in concrete flooring and bamboo hardwoods .
Custom steel and concrete stairwell is an instant design focal point upon entry of each unit .
Design elements include seamless floor to ceiling windows and clerestory windows , a design scheme that is carried through out each level of the home .
The exterior facades reflect each other , making the 4 units one cohesive building .
The kitchen level is made even larger with extended dark cabinetry , that is floor to ceiling as well , marrying the living and dining areas .
A progressive master bath is left without a door and includes a double vanity sink , a walk in closet located inside , and no bathtub - but a deluxe shower with dual and above shower heads .
To mark the 80th birthday of the man behind the elusive particle , we 're holding a competition to rename the damned thing
I once asked a brilliant physicist at Manchester University what he thought of the name the media use for the Higgs boson , the mysterious particle that is regarded as the universal origin of mass .
That name , of course , is the God particle .
It is partly with thanks to names like " God particle " and spurious end - of - the - world scenarios that the Large Hadron Collider at Cern near Geneva got so much coverage when it was switched on last year .
And broke .
Cern is just one lab that is in the business of hunting for the particle .
The other is the Tevatron at Fermilab near Chicago .
That machine is the most powerful particle accelerator in the world ( that works ) .
But back to the physicist in Manchester .
He paused .
He sighed .
And then he said : " I really , really do n't like it .
It sends out all the wrong messages .
It overstates the case .
It makes us look arrogant .
It 's rubbish . "
He then added : " If you walked down the corridor here , poked your head into people 's offices and asked that question , you would likely be struck by flying books . "
Today it 's the 80th birthday of Peter Higgs , the Edinburgh - based physicist whose work pointed to the existence of the particle in the early 1960s .
In previous interviews , I 've asked him what he makes of the name , God particle .
He hates it .
He worries it might offend people who are religious , but I think he hates it for other reasons too .
When I 've written about the God particle here before , I 've suggested we might do well – or more accurately that physicists might do well – to think up another name for it .
So today , in honour of Peter Higgs entering the realm of the octogenarians , we 're launching a competition to rename the God particle .
Who said Friday can't be fun ?
Below I 've set out the best criteria I can find for how to come up with a good name for a new particle .
Depending on the number of entries , we 'll select the winner by : consulting physicists ; testing the entries on the humanities graduates who run the Guardian 's newsdesk , aka " The Gate Keepers " ; or by printing them out on a sheet of paper and asking the chef to throw a dart at it * .
The winner will receive a copy of Science : A Four Thousand Year History by Patricia Fara , and a surprise Higgs boson - themed gift .
But first , some history .
The line of progress is rarely straight and clear in physics , as Sheldon Glashow said in his Nobel lecture in 1979 .
Peter Higgs did not pluck the idea for what is officially called the Higgs boson out of thin air .
His work was influenced by several scientists , including the Nobel laureates Werner Heisenberg , Phil Anderson and Yoichiro Nambu .
Peter Higgs was n't the only one to come up with the idea either .
Two Belgian physicists , Francois Englert and Robert Brout , published very similar work a week or two earlier than Higgs .
And a third group , including Gerald Guralnik , Richard Hagen and Tom Kibble at Imperial College in London followed soon after .
The particle became known as the Higgs boson in 1972 after Ben Lee , a former head of theoretical physics at Fermilab , used the name to describe the idea .
Even
Higgs often distances himself from the name , referring to it as the " so - called Higgs boson " .
For physicists , the name seems to have stuck , but not for the media .
For the origins of the name so loved by journalists , we have to go back to Fermilab .
In the early 1990s , the former director of the lab , Leon Lederman , wrote a great book on particle physics that he called " The God particle " , which was to be the main target for an enormous but ultimately ill - fated machine called the Superconducting Supercollider .
In the book , he justifies the name by saying the particle is " so central to the state of physics today , so crucial to our understanding of the structure of matter , yet so elusive , that I have given it a nickname ... "
So that 's how we got to where we are today .
Physicists call it the Higgs boson , but it could easily be the B - E - H - G - H - K boson ( make an acronym out of that if you can ) .
And we in the media just can't stop ourselves calling it the God particle .
So , it 's time for another name , and Higgs ' birthday seems as good a day as any to start searching for one .
The best rules for naming new phenomena in physics I can find come courtesy of yet another very smart Fermilab physicist , Joe Lykken .
He has three simple rules :
1 ) Names should be serious and accurate
2 ) It is good to name things after people , but only if you can resist the pressure to hyphenate with two or three extra names
3 ) Names should be evocative and inspiring .
The Higgs boson scores well on 1 and 2 , but in my view fails miserably on 3 .
Equally , God particle fails spectacularly on 1 and 2 , but does rather better on 3 .
I 'm off to think up a name now .
Where 's Bill Watterson when you need him ?

Beating Phishers At Their Own Game
Description :
Is it OK to steal from a thief ?
To phish a phisher ?
This talk does just that !
In their Blackhat 2008 presentation titled " Bad Sushi : Beating Phishers at their own Game " , Nitesh Dhanjani and Billy Rios intrude into the shady world of phishing and phishers , and help us see under the hood .
They demonstrate how one can find the latest phishing sites online by using sites like PhishTank , which provide a almost live list of malicious sites sent in by users around the world .
Then , using one of these sites as a starting point , they break into a phishing site and look at the tools left behind by the phishers to collect usernames and passwords .
Interestingly , they uncover that most of the phishers actually are not very technically proficient at all , instead they seem to be relying on ready made tools made by others .
Also , even more intereatingly the authors of these tools seem to have backdoored them and are stealing from the phishers using them .
One funny example is that the tool emails every username and password the phisher steals from legitimate users back to its author .
Anyways , overall the presentation is amazing !
and provides a sneak peek into the world of phishing and the ecosystem of phishers .
A must watch video in my opinion ! < br>< br>

Know Thy Piano - 1
Knowledge that helps people play better .
by James Boyk
Thunk !
Almost a wonderful performance — except for cantabile and pianissimo ruined by the thunk !
thunk ! of the damper pedal hitting the top of its travel .
If the player had only known that piano design helps you pedal silently .
Experiment for yourself :
With pedal down , play and release a chord .
Slowly raise the pedal , stopping when the sound stops ; then notice how far the pedal still is from the top .
Alternatively , with pedal up , play repeated notes staccato .
Keep playing as you depress the pedal .
Note how far down you must go before the notes lengthen .
In other words , the pedal has " free play " at the top .
To change pedal cleanly , we need only bring the pedal into the " free play " region , not all the way up .
To practice silent changes , play a two - handed C chord with pedal .
Release the chord and hold the pedal .
Still holding , play an F# chord .
Now change the pedal silently , getting rid of every trace of the C chord .
Do the same thing again , but with a quicker change .
Finally , change at the very moment you play the F# chord .
A minute or two on this daily , and soon your ear wo n't tolerate thunks .
Here 's a tip :
If you use pedal at the beginning of a piece , put it down before starting .
That eliminates every noise from the first moment of the music .
The smoothness of the sound will delight you !

Stick Shtick
When you listen to someone else play , have you noticed how unclear the piano sounds when the lid is closed or only partly open ?
Putting the lid all the way up when you play — on " full stick " — frees overtones and other high - pitched parts of the sound , and keeps them from being trapped inside the instrument .
Your tone comes through better , and so do the beginnings of notes , the attacks , which are partly just the noises of hammers hitting strings .
Attacks are powerful enough to define notes and help shape phrases , yet so short - lived that they do n't make the sound louder .
But when they 're blunted by a closed lid , then we do play louder , attempting to maintain profile in our playing .
This makes for a thick sound which may cover other players .
Listen to someone else playing with lid down , then up .
I think you 'll find " up " more lucid , allowing softer playing to make its point .
Next , with piano silent , raise and lower the lid behind a solo instrument to hear how full stick helps the soloist , too .
In master classes , we 've done such experiments dozens of times , and " lid up " always wins hands - down .
Full stick is better for recording , too .
Taping a clarinet - piano recital , we noticed over the control - room speakers that the instruments sounded dead .
At intermission , we put the lid up , and they came alive ; and not just over the speakers :
The audience commented on the improvement , too .
To persuade ensemble partners to let you use full stick , ask someone they trust to judge the sound .
Be careful , because many people think full stick means loud .
To ensure that the " judge " hears reality instead of this preconception , have him or her listen with eyes shut — and do n't raise the lid until the eyes are closed .

Look Ma , No Pedal
She played beautifully , do n't you agree ?
But what heavy weather she made of those slow repeated notes !
Apparently she did n't want a pedaled sound in that passage .
Oh , I agree ; she was right ; but she seemed to think that avoiding gaps between repeated notes requires an ultra -smooth finger legato .
She 'd play more reliably , with less wasted energy , if she knew how easy it is to connect repeated notes even without pedal .
When you see her , suggest she play one note and let the key come up a bit , then try to repeat the note from that height .
If it works , she can try letting the key up less next time ; if not , let it up more .
Once she 's found the lowest height at which notes repeat reliably , she 'll notice on her own that at that height , the damper 's still off the string , so she can easily repeat without gaps .
What ?
What if different keys repeat at different heights ?
Then she needs a visit from the piano technician .
No one can acquire fine skills on a piano that 's out of adjustment !

The Genius of the Piano
You seemed impatient in the master class .
No , do n't worry ; you were n't rude to the guest teacher ; I was the only one who noticed .
It was was n't it ?
when he was talking about imitating the harpsichord in playing Bach ?
Hold on !
You 're preaching to the converted .
I agree ; if we play Bach on the piano , we should play him on the piano , not imitate the harpsichord .
I know you would n't ask too much of the textures .
Your ear would never let you rip the fabric .
It puzzles me , though , that people always talk about what the piano can do that the harpsichord cannot , but never the reverse : what the harpsichord can do that the piano cannot .
I mean , playing at an constant dynamic level .
You 're right , the piano can do it ; but not many pianists can !
Of course we should ideally have such control that we can play a line with any shape , even a constant one .
And sure , there are passages where nothing else will do , perhaps because energy building up in the rhythm has n't yet spilled into the dynamics , or the composer wants a sense of stasis .
I 'm just trying to describe the spirit , the genius , of our instrument .
On the harpsichord , a constant dynamic is automatic .
On the piano , it 's natural to shape the dynamics ; and a " high - profile " shape will make its point even if individual notes are a bit softer or louder than intended .
The profile makes the shape less susceptible to errors .
Yes , I know the harpsichord has its own difficulties !

Hammer & Anvil
A scientist who was an amateur pianist told her piano technician that the keys on her piano felt too heavy .
He measured the downweight ( the force needed to move the key down to the escapement point ) and pointed out that it was 50 grams , which he said was fine and even a bit on the light side .
" You need to strengthen your fingers ! " he told her indulgently .
The physicist gently said , " You could install an anvil instead of the hammer , and still balance it to 50 grams ; but it would take a lot more force to get it moving , and the key would feel incredibly heavy .
So it 's not just the downweight but also the moving mass that matters . "
The technician 's eyes lit up , and he said that must be why someone had told him that hammers needed to be shaved to the right weight before being installed .
He 'd never understood this ; had always figured that if they were balanced to the correct downweight , their individual weights on a scale did n't matter .
The physicist stared , but politely said nothing .
After a moment , she went on , " And what about friction ?
Even if downweight and mass are both OK , friction in the pivots will make it feel too heavy , wo n't it ? "
The technician agreed to this .
It 's surprising how many technicians do n't understand about moving mass .
Because this one did n't , he 's lost a customer but gained a colleague ; for the physicist is learning to become her own piano technician .

Singing and Screaming
Ultra -loud sound is a legitimate part of piano playing ; for instance in " Pictures at an Exhibition , " where the score says " with all your force . "
A recording engineer attended one of my performances ; and afterward , using his own jargon , said , " You had that piano in overload ! "
He was right , and Mussorgsky was right , too : that sound is needed .
But it took me years to learn that if I want a cantabile sound , a singing tone , I must avoid the loudest end of the dynamic range , even below that overload level .
Above a certain loudness , no amount of phrase - shaping or finger legato will make a cantabile .
Where 's the limit ?
Your ear will tell you .
It depends on the size of the piano : a bigger instrument can play louder and still sing sweetly .
And among instruments of a given size , it depends on the design .
It does n't depend on the room or the player ; but the use of the two ranges depends a lot on the player !

Continuing Delicately
You 're wondering why that melody has " bumps " even though you 're playing with care ?
Notice how some notes are longer than the rest ?
Look at how it moves mostly in 16th - notes but here and here it has dotted eighths .
If you listen carefully , you 'll notice that the bumps come on the first notes after the relatively long notes .
Play them just a touch softer and all will be well .
Sure , go ahead and try it now .
You agree that it works ?
I 'm glad .
Oh , why does it work ?
I think it 's because when notes come at a certain rate , we get used to the attack of each one coming at a certain point in the decay of the previous .
Along comes a longer note , and it decays further before the next attack , so that attack seems disproportionately loud .
The note after the long one needs to be played just a tiny bit softer .
Oh goodness , do n't feel bad about your ears .
Your ears are fine .
Few players hear such things analytically on their own .
Most of us get better ears just by learning a lot of things to listen for , like this one .
I can't remember now whether I figured this out on my own or first heard it thirty years ago from Lee Hambro .
Just keep listening as acutely as you can , that 's the important thing .
( A recorder speeds up the process . )
But just one note each time , mind !
Otherwise your listeners will hear a change of dynamic .

Living Softly
You liked the Schoenberg ?
Me , too .
Those Opus 19 pieces are hyper- romantic , like Brahms rhapsodies compacted : each bar holds a phrase worth of feeling and gesture .
Maybe that 's why the score is so dense with expression marks .
Did you like the fourth of the set ?
Very atmospheric , I agree .
And did you happen to noti ?
Yes , right hand loud , left hand soft .
It 's interesting that exactly .
The left hand comes through fine .
The right does n't cover it .
Other instrumentalists know this , of course .
String - quartet players know that if they shape their voices well , they 'll be heard even though they 're not the loudest .
And pianists must know it when they accompany .
No ?
You think so many accompanists are depressed because they do n't think they 're heard ?
Goodness , I hope you 're wrong about that .
But for some reason , solo pianists do forget that you can make layer upon layer and still have everything heard .
The crucial thingyes , as you say , the difficult thing is to give each of the voices its own integrity .
But really , even that is n't so difficult .
You begin by singing each voice .
Then sing each one while playing each other one , then each other pair .
If it 's a five - voice fugue , it 's a lot of work ; but at least you 're working on the music , not on what you do with your little finger .
( I know .
I should n't use such a dismissive phrase for piano technique .
Of course technique is important ! )

Home in the Range
Fascinating , yes , to hear two interpretations side by side .
But do n't you think each had something to learn from the other ?
Did you notice how she played the soprano melodies more convincingly , and he played the bass ones better ?
You agree ?
You think it 's simply that her right hand is more capable than her left , while for him it's the other way around ?
But you know , it 's rare for any pianist 's left hand to be more able than the right , even when the person 's left - handed like me .
You did n't know I was ?
Maybe that makes my point .
I imagine the difference was due to something else .
I think we identify unconsciously with lines that fall in our own voice ranges .
This just jumped out at me one time in a certain young man 's playing .
I suggested the idea to him , and he immediately played the soprano as well as he played the bass .
You 're right ; I was lucky that the suggestion alone was enough to cure the problem .
It was like one of those stories about how Freud cured someone famous of a neurosis with one insightful remark ; except of course that he was n't famous , and — yes , I know — I 'm not Freud .
Or those stories about Zen masters , except that I did n't have to break his arm for him to find enlightenment .
I wonder what someone could do if the suggestion alone was n't enough .
The question is how to get the player to identify with the lines as coming from him - or herself .
Perhaps taking lines that lie outside the singing range and transposing them into the range would help bring them " into the fold . "
And by the way , it happens with dynamics , too : people usually identify with a rather narrow range of dynamics .
When you hear ugly loud sounds , there 's a good chance that player identifies with " soft " ; and the reverse when you hear tentative soft playing .
Very few people can identify with the full ranges of pitch and dynamics .

Dot Means Go
" A dot is not a period . "
Well , I thought it was funny .
You do n't like simple - minded humor or bad puns , I know .
But they are unforgettable .
Yes , very useful in teaching ; dot 's true .
I saw you wince at the phony Russian accent , too .
" Period means stop .
Dot means go . "
Once he pointed it out , though , I heard how Arthur really was letting each dotted note interrupt the flow in that Mozart .
I agree ; it must be hard to keep your poise in that A - minor sonata .
And Arthur does play it beautifully .
Of course our teacher hears that !
But you must admit , it did get a lot better when he gave him that bow - and - arrow image .
The dotted note is the stretching of the bow ; the dot is the moment of release .
Then he asked , " After the release , how long does the arrow wait before beginning its flight ? "
That made it clear , no ?
Well , I do n't know if just aiming at the next downbeat will guarantee playing the right rhythm .
You can hit the downbeat at the right time even though you start too late after the dot .
That 's why I like the bow - and - arrow image .
Our teacher does n't care if he sounds simple - minded as long as he gets the idea across .
To me , that 's the opposite of simple - minded .

Play Thy Piano - 6
Knowledge that helps people play better .

I Get Rhythm
Boy , a performance like that makes you think the blues can say anything , does n't it ?
It makes you wonder about high art versus so - called low .
I could n't believe the pianist gave you a lesson right there .
I guess it was because the place was empty .
What 's that left - hand called ?
' Shuffle ' ?
How would you write it ; in triplet rhythm ?
I guess that 's about as close as we could notate .
But it 's so flexible .
Stable , but keeps moving forward .
I think it 's easier for me to get it by listening than if it were written down .
Somehow when a rhythm is written down , we 're at risk of playing it pedantically , do n't you feel ?
No ?
Well , your rhythm is probably better than mine .
Oh , that 's interesting !
You imagine written rhythms as approximations even in classical music ?
Your idea is that we should think of the written rhythm as only an approximation of what the composer had in mind ?
But what about ones that really are even , like -- I do n't know -- an Alberti - bass left hand .
Wait a minute .
I know what you 'll say : Maybe it is n't even , either .
Not metronomic .
Maybe it has a little " give " at ends of phrases or half - phrases .
Or at harmonically interesting places .
OK , I 'll try this idea of yours this week in practicing .
We 'll see at next week 's master - class what it does for me .
I wonder what our teacher will say !

What now ?
You have that new Beethoven in your hands kind - of , sort - of .
You 've worked out the technical problems k - o , s- o .
Yet practice is n't going anywhere .
You 've got the " What now ? " syndrome .
What you need is phrasewise memorization .
Play each phrase once with the score , then once without the score .
But perfectly , mind !
And not just notes , but timing , dynamics and articulation .
( When I say " one phrase , " I mean with a bit of overlap , so you cover the phrase - joins . )
That crescendo to a subito piano is so typical of Beethoven .
Can you make the crescendo sound as though it will continue through the downbeat , so the subito will be fully effective ?
And where does the crescendo " bloom " ?
( Almost every crescendo has a place where it " opens up . " )
And in that other phrase , can pedal help the right - hand legato without compromising the left - hand staccato ?
Unawares , you 're studying the score closer than ever , trying to hear Beethoven 's sound .
After a time , you play the phrase perfectly without the score .
STOP !
Do n't do it again .
Go on to the next phrase ; and keep on through the whole piece .
Depending on whether it's one of the easier Bagatelles or the Opus 111 , phrasewise memorization might take anything from a few minutes to days of work .
When you finish , you 've eliminated the " kind - of , sort - of " from your playing , and you hear all kinds of new musical connections and interpretive possibilities .
You can play the piece for others now , and get the understanding that comes no other way .
You can memorize it completely , confident that it holds no surprises .
Nothing lies between you and concert - level mastery now but the pure pleasure of deepening intimacy with the piece .

Atternpat
Sometimes the score has a repeating pattern which we practice one unit at a time .
We could represent the score as pattern pattern pattern pattern or perhaps patternpatternpatternpattern , and what we practice as pattern , pattern .
Often it 's a good idea to practice an overlapping group , so the joins get practiced too : patternpat , patternpat , or maybe patternpa , patternpa or simply patternp , patternp .
In addition , it 's often useful to turn things inside out and practice ternpat , ternpat , ternpat , or its overlapping version : atternpat , atternpat , atternpat
A gifted pianist I know tried this in the last movement of Opus 31 , No. 1 , where the left hand is in sextuplets in two alternating patterns .
She identified the 3 - 5 reach from G down to B ( end of one group to beginning of next ) as a problem ; but when she practiced atternpat instead of patternpa , so the reach came in the middle of the group , she immediately laughed and said , " Easy ! "

But Soft !
What Sound Breaks Yon Window ?
Remember the Old Man exhorting us to play pianissimo and " demonstrating " with playing that almost made the windows burst from their frames ?
Remember Robert raving about the woman with the " unforgettable pianissimo " ?
Well , when I heard for myself how hers dances in the mind and murmurs in the ear , I had to study with her ; so this is a first report .
Right away , she said I needed to learn Alexander Technique - - it 's not a piano technique but a general way of using your body efficiently -- and she sent me to a teacher for that .
Meanwhile , we began on fundamentals .
" You must identify with soft , " she said .
" Understand the goals of soft playing and take them as your own . "
I said I understood them better from hearing her play .
" A pretty compliment , " she said , witholding judgment with her indescribable old - lady 's smile .
Then we got to work !
She had me do an experiment :
With no " give " at your wrist , use arm to play three pianissimo notes in each of three ways : first with the eraser of a pencil held vertical in your snug fist ; then with the side of the hand , fingers together ; last , with index finger braced near its tip by your thumb .
I could play reliably in all these ways .
This showed that my problem was " give " in wrist or fingers when playing .
In other words , not inconsistent generation of power but inconsistent transmission .
She said to " stabilize " joints at the moment of playing by tightening " flexor " and " extensor " muscles at once .
( She made a point that we do this only at the moment of playing , and only to the minimum degree needed , which seemed obvious .
She seemed to be fighting a long - ago opponent over this .
Odd to think the opponent might be dead ! )
First I had to acquire strength in both sets of muscles ( my extensors were weak ! ) with this exercise :
Tip of left index finger on top of bent right - hand knuckle nearest fingertip .
Left thumb under tip of RH finger gently tries to open the joint .
Gently resist .
Hold five seconds .
Next , left thumb inside same joint , tip of left index finger on top of tip of right - hand finger .
Gently try to close finger ; gently resist .
Hold five seconds .
Do 12 RH joints ( not thumb ) , 12 LH , twice daily .
After three weeks , she began to teach me to associate loudness with the necessary amount of stabilizing force , which she calls " sta - force " ( " I hate jargon , my dear ; but I can't stop myself from shortening this phrase .
It sounds like something Democritus might practice with those marbles in his mouth ! " )
Play a chord fortissimo with one arm , noticing how much sta -force you instinctively use in wrist and fingers .
Play it pp with the same amount of sta-force .
It will play reliably !
Now see how little sta -force will still give reliable playing .
Daily experimentation teaches you to match ( 1 ) intended volume level to ( 2 ) playing force and ( 3 ) sta-force .
Something else I 'd never realized : After playing , you can almost " let go " of the note and it will stay down .
The sketch shows the force of finger on key , not the key position .
Practice reducing sta-force immediately to just the level needed to keep the key ( s ) down .
Finally , stabilizing behind the playing force is necessary , too ; be sure that your torso is not moving " in reaction , " as she says .
Oddly , you can subsume reaction movements into an overall torso movement carrying the phrase .
What startled me was how analytical she is , given the spirituality of her music - making .
I 'd always thought spirituality was enough ; it 's not .

Soft Playing Hints
I told you I was surprised at her being so analytical .
Actually , she 's sort of idealistic - opportunistic :
She says every activity can be useful to our art .
( The way she uses the words art and artist shows me how self - conscious I 've been about them . )
Just look at the range of what follows .
First , an unusual exercise :
Sitting away from the piano , imagine playing softly .
If this makes you tense , release the tension systematically .
Do this daily until you do n't get tense .
Then do the imagining while sitting at the piano with the instrument closed .
When you can do this first thing in the morning without getting tense , do it with the piano lid open ( but the keyboard still closed ) .
Next : keyboard open , hands in lap .
Then hands on keys but not playing .
Finally , when playing .
She points out , too , that there are two kinds of quietness : actual softness , and undisturbedness .
If playing a bit louder lets you play more calmly , do so !
What about disturbances from noises of fingers hitting keys , and keys hitting bottom ?
Press on front surfaces of several adjacent white keys to keep them from moving .
" Play " the keys with fingers of the other hand , and notice that you can do it quietly or noisily !
Get someone else to do it while you listen from far away .
Put a mike far away and make two recordings of a passage , one with lots of this noise and the other with as little as possible .
The quiet one will sound both softer and more legato !
And this :
In fast passages , play to the middle of the ‘ dip , ' like a harpsichordist .
Imagine you 're just tossing the hammers up toward the strings , or trying to avoid the noise of key hitting bottom .
And I should have realized on my own that if notes are to sound together , the softer ones ' keys must start moving earlier .
It 's obvious !
( You can make it easier to get the right dynamics by " biasing " the hand - - rotating it . )
She points out too that vertical motion of keys is what creates sound .
This I had realized ; but I had n't thought it through .
When it 's hard to reduce your finger velocity -- you 're moving too fast -- you can " use up " some of it by moving toward or away from the fallboard , leaving less for the vertical motion .
Your finger slides down a sloping hill instead of diving vertically into the key .
If a passage is intractable , try it in a different octave to be sure it is n't just a problem in that particular range of that particular piano .
Finally , if you play a note too softly , hold it an instant after the others release , so it will be heard .
Off to master class .
Next time , more about dynamics , including ( gasp ! ) fortissimo .

TUCSON - Pima County health officials say a 13 - year - old boy from Tucson has become the third person in Arizona to die with swine flu .
A spokeswoman says the teenager , a Tucson middle school student , died Friday of complications from the flu .
He had been hospitalized May 10 .
The Arizona Department of Health Services confirmed test results .
Spokeswoman Patti Woodcock says an older sibling is hospitalized with the virus , and other family members have recovered from the flu .
A Maricopa County woman was the first Arizonan to die with the flu virus about two weeks ago .
The second fatality was a 57 - year - old Pinal County woman who died last week .
Woodcock said health officials do not believe that other students at the boy 's school � which was not identified � had contracted the illness .
She said the county has confirmed 87 cases of swine flu , with ongoing monitoring of virus activity continuing .
As of Tuesday , Arizona had 406 confirmed cases of swine flu in 10 of the state 's 15 counties .
The state 's first case was identified on April 29 .
Canada is one of the few countries without a major banking crisis .
Weirdly , this was also true in 1930 .
I 've seen this list of the success factors for Canadian banks in several places .
I want to believe it , but . . .
.. it does n't seem to be as simple as " Canadian banks are more tightly - regulated " .
1 . We never had restrictions on interstate banking , so Canadian banks spread their assets and liabilities across Canada .
( So it does n't matter if a local housing market goes bust ) .
2 . We do n't have Glass - Steagal .
The investment banks joined the retail banks some years ago .
3 . We do n't have mortgage interest deductibility from taxes .
So paying down your mortgage is a tax - free investment .
So most people want to pay down their mortgages .
4. ( Except in Alberta ) , mortgages are fully recourse .
You can't just walk away from a negative equity home and hand the keys to the bank ; the bank will come after you for the difference .
I would n't describe those differences as " Canada is more regulated " .
But we do have higher capital requirements .
And mortgages over 80 % must be insured ( mostly by the government - owned CMHC ) .
I do n't find " they were more tightly regulated " a plausible explanation .
When you dig down , most of those explanations seem short on the actual regulations that accomplished this marvelous feat , or even an extraordinary risk management system , and long on glowering regulators putting the fear of God into snivelling bankers through sheer force of moral righteousness .
But more importantly , the banking crisis seems to be hitting almost every other country very hard even though they have very different bank regulators .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Corporate America is an easy punching bag in tough economic times , but it often does n’t deserve the demonization it receives .
That ’s the case with Chevron , which was attacked by “ 60 Minutes ” on Sunday for an ongoing lawsuit over old oil fields in Ecuador .
The CBS show wrongly took the side of the leftist , tinpot government of Ecuador against the 206,000 stockholders ( and , indirectly , millions of American pensioners ) who own shares of the American oil company .
In its inimitable hit - piece style , the “ news magazine ” portrayed Texaco , now part of Chevron , as a horrendous despoiler of Ecuador ’s Amazonian eco-system and of the health of its native peoples .
The story revolves around a lawsuit pursued for more than a decade by a group of U.S. plaintiffs ’ attorneys who allege that Texaco caused an ecological disaster over 20 years of pumping oil from Ecuadoran territory .
CBS severely played down , or ignored entirely , a host of key facts and important arguments by Chevron .
A straightforward look at the timeline tells the real tale .
Texaco was a 37.5 percent partner in an exploration venture with PetroEcuador , a company owned by the Ecuadoran government .
In 1992 , Texaco ’s part of the deal expired , with Petro - Ecuador assuming full ownership .
On Sept. 30 , 1998 , Ecuador ’s government signed “ final release ” papers certifying that Texaco had successfully completed environmental remediation at every one of its oil fields and waste pits .
Over the next eight years , Ecuador became politically unstable with a series of administrations reluctant to honor old contracts .
In 2006 , Ecuador elected anti-American leftist Rafael Correa as president .
That ’s when the fortunes of Chevron , which merged with Texaco in 2001 , drastically changed .
Retroactively applying a law passed in 1999 to Texaco ’s activities before 1992 , and ignoring the 1998 final - release agreement , Mr. Correa openly began backing the long - running lawsuit against the deep - pocketed oil giant .
President Correa is putting pressure on the lone , small - town judge who will decide the case , a man named Juan Nunez who operates from the third floor of a dilapidated shopping mall in Lago Agrio , which in 2001 had a population of 34,000 .
The original claim of $ 1.5 billion against Texaco has grown into a request for $ 27 billion in damages against Chevron .
This is all for oil drilling that Chevron says netted just $ 490 million in profit over 20 years .
It concerns oil fields that Texaco relinquished after 1992 , but that PetroEcuador - a notorious polluter - has operated since then .
If there now is significant environmental damage , which is a less - than - sure conclusion , the likelihood is that it was caused not by Texaco , which got a clean bill of health in 1998 , but by Ecuador ’s state - owned corporation that solely has managed the drilling for more than 16 years .
The trial will take place in a court system denounced as unreliable or corrupt by the United Nations , the International Bar Association and the U.S. State Department .
Forget the “ 60 Minutes ” angle against an alleged big , bad American polluter .
This looks like an Ecuadoran shakedown of millions of American small investors who have a stake in Chevron .
Now that is a story worth investigating .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - China ’s official foreign exchange manager is still buying record amounts of U.S. government bonds , in spite of Beijing ’s increasingly vocal fear of a dollar collapse , the Financial Times reported .
In a story on its website , the FT quoted Chinese and western officials in Beijing as saying China was caught in a “ dollar trap . ”
The newspaper said China had little choice but to keep pouring the bulk of its growing reserves into U.S. Treasuries , which remains the only market big enough and liquid enough to support its huge purchases .
The FT ’s story lent support to U.S. Treasury futures in Asian trading on Monday , analysts said .
“ The FT article probably helped boost the confidence of Treasuries holders who were anxious about potential selling by other players amid worries of a possible U.S. downgrade , ” said Yasutoshi Nagai , chief economist at Daiwa Securities SMBC .
Lead T - note futures were 3/32 lower from late U.S. trading on Friday at 119- 2.5/32 , but off a six - month low of 118- 30.5/32 hit earlier on Monday .
The dollar index , which measures the dollar ’s value against a basket of six major currencies , hit a five - month low late last week , hurt by concerns that U.S. government debt may lose its AAA rating .
China ’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( Safe ) has not fundamentally changed its strategy of allocating the bulk of its burgeoning foreign exchange reserves to U.S. Treasury securities , the FT quoted a western adviser familiar with Safe thinking as saying .
The FT quoted the adviser as saying Safe traders were “ very negative ” on sterling because of expectations of renewed weakness of the UK currency but Safe was neutral on the euro and bullish on the Australian dollar .

Marilyn Manson : Scary and shocking ?
" Do you want a fight ?
Do you want a fight with me ? "
I met Marilyn Manson less than two minutes ago .
I am supposed to be interviewing the dark prince of rock , the grotesque goth who , as legend has it , is vampire , zombie and demon rolled into one .
And it 's already the strangest interview ever .
I expected him to be a bit weird - but not like this .
I also expected the shock rocker to be highly articulate .
From other interviews I 've watched , I know he can be the intelligent voice of a troubled generation .
But today , it 's clear that Marilyn Manson is just troubled .
He is in a dingy radio studio at the BBC's Maida Vale complex , where he has just finished a shambolic radio session .
Our interview is four hours late .
Next door , a BBC Radio 3 choir is singing Karol Szymanowski's Stabat Mater .
I just hope he does n't stumble into their studio by mistake .
Inside , wearing a plain black hoodie and his usual morbid pallor , he 's in high spirits , joking with his band and the studio crew .
As we start , it becomes clear that he can't or does n't want to give coherent answers , except for those that end with comments about sex , violence or preferably both .
His preoccupation is such that I have heavily edited his comments to cut out large chunks that are lurid , graphic and frankly disturbing .
I 'm doing the interview with a colleague , Adrian from BBC 6 Music .
Manson starts by ripping the foam cover off the end of Adrian 's microphone , before being asked about his fans .
That 's what I do best , worst - me being Marilyn Manson , rock star , et cetera , that 's what I do
" My fans ?
There 's no fans because I was very hot in my room . "
Adrian tries again , to which Manson responds : " Ceiling fans or standalone ? "
There is a glint in his eye .
He 's toying with us , but his comments are also unnervingly lewd and random .
He carries straight on .
" Is that a cellphone ? " he says looking at my recording device .
It 's clearly not a cellphone .
" Can I call you ? "
He then makes the first offer of a fight , not delivered aggressively , but more as a polite , jovial invitation .
Adrian asks him about the Download festival , where Manson is playing this summer .
" You said load .
And down , " Manson interrupts , as if they 're the dirtiest words in the world .
I ask my first question , and try to change tack .
Can he remember the first time that he performed musically ?
His weird different - sized eyeballs peer out from under his hood .
" The first time I performed musically I threw up . "
When was that ?
" Last night .
But no , the first time , I had stage fright .
I was afraid of the stages and frightening and The Frighteners , which was a bad movie with , what 's his name , Michael J Fox .
" So I would say the last time I had what was the question ? "
Next , I try asking where he currently lives .
The answer is rambling , peppered with rude words and references to sexual violence .
He also starts making weird fluttery whistling noises half - way through .
Marilyn Manson is currently on a European tour
The answer finishes with : " Et cetera and so forth and so on and wow and [ more fluttering ] I like to speak in those kind of terms . "
It 's getting curiouser and curiouser .
So I ask about the film he 's supposedly working on , in which he is playing Alice in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll .
" I 'm playing him always in life , " he replies .
" I wrote a script about him because I read his diaries and it was about aphasia to the sky , the sky , left , right , and that 's me .
" So I almost quit music because I did n't want to do any more so I want to put it all into film .
Right now I 'm in love with film .
But filming myself .
And I 'm playing Marilyn Manson . "
What stage is the film at ?
Have you shot any of it ?
" No , I shot at someone .
But that was a firearm and it was not exactly legal .
But I was exonerated from the crime . "
I hope and pray that he 's joking and plough on .
After Adrian asks him about one of his heroes , Iggy Pop , I ask why he did n't quit music but decided to release a new album .
" It was me realising that that 's what I do best , " he says .
" That 's not always good , but that 's what I do best , worst .
Me being Marilyn Manson , rock star , et cetera , that 's what I do . "
So is the film ever going to I do n't have time to finish my question .
" You want a fight ?
A film ? " he interjects .
The film , I affirm .
" The film , " he repeats , before things degenerate again .
Manson manages to answer a question about Motley Crue a bit more coherently , then , thankfully , the interview is brought to a close in less than 10 minutes .
At the time , it was in parts surreal , awkward and amusing .
In hindsight , it seems a bit more disturbing .
Not scary though .
Just sad .
Marilyn Manson 's new album The High End of Low is out now .

People struggling to find jobs in the bad economy are turning to the military for a paycheck .
Recruiters say that they are seeing more people coming through their doors and that more recruits have college degrees , have been laid off or had once decided against a military career but are returning to the idea .
Although most recruits are still under age 25 , recruiters say many young Americans do n't qualify for service because of medical or legal issues .
So , laid - off workers and others help keep the ranks full .
" We 're seeing more professionals saying , ' Hey , I do n't want to lose my house , ' " said Sgt. Andrew Angarita , an Army recruiter in Phoenix .
A local Air Force recruiter has handled a laid - off car mechanic , a laid - off heating and air - conditioning technician and a student two years into a college fire - science course .
That student left school and enlisted when he realized cities would n't be hiring new firefighters until the economy improved .
The recession is " having an enormous impact on our recruiting , " said Cmdr. Joseph McInerney , Navy recruiting liaison to the chief of naval operations .
All branches of the service , including reserves , either met or surpassed their national recruiting goals last year , and the trend continued in the first months of this year .
The Department of Defense has missed its combined active - duty recruiting goals only three times since 1980 : in 1998 , 1999 and 2005 .
The individual branches of the service have had scattered off - years .
Recruitment numbers in Arizona have been increasing or holding steady .
The Army went from 1,732 in fiscal 2006 to 2,251 in 2008 .
The Air Force went from 599 to 589 in that same time and was at 522 at the end of May , with four months left in its recruiting year .
The Marine Corps increased from 1,000 to 1,080 , beating its combined goals for those years by 116 percent .
The Navy went from 880 in 2006 to 929 last year .
The influx of applicants has allowed the military to be more selective .
And it 's not like anyone who has completely run out of prospects can just walk into a recruiting office and get a job .
Maj .
Tom Hodge , commanding officer of the Marine recruiting station in Phoenix , said the struggling economy has a lot of people in the Valley hunting for new careers .
Hodge said that places the Marines in a " unique position " to increase their recruiting standards .
Curtis Gilroy , the Pentagon 's director of recruiting policy , says it 's difficult to fill the military 's recruiting needs by relying solely on its key category of people in their late teens to mid-20s .
Gilroy told Congress in March that a majority of 17 - to 24 - year - olds do n't qualify .
" It is an unfortunate fact that much of the contemporary youth population is currently ineligible to serve , " he said .
According to Gilroy 's estimates , about 35 percent do n't meet medical standards and many are overweight .
About 18 percent have drug or alcohol problems , 5 percent have criminal records and 6 percent have too many dependents .
About 9 percent fall into the lowest aptitude category , and 10 percent are in college .
That leaves about 15 percent of the target group for the military to pursue , or 25 percent including college students .
Eileen Lainez , a Department of Defense spokeswoman , said the only change in recruiting standards is an increase in allowable age from 35 to 42 in 2006 .
Military recruiting is a complicated process of finding enough people to fill all the jobs that need to be filled .
There is a battery of tests , both physical and mental , plus a background check .
When the screening is completed , applicants see a list of jobs they are qualified for .
There can be several months of waiting , depending on when particular jobs are available and when the military wants people to ship .
A new recruit earns about $ 33,700 a year if living off - base and receives a food and housing allowance , Lainez said .
There are also signing and re-enlistment bonuses and extra pay for specialist duty such as special forces .
Military personnel also receive medical coverage and money for education .
Lainez said that recruiting goals have been met during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , citing patriotism as a key factor .
That was the case for Mark Tice , 18 , a recent graduate of Thunderbird High School in Phoenix .
He ships out for training in October and will become a communications specialist .
" I basically had the blood of a soldier running through me , " he said .
Recruiters also say that the bad economy has persuaded some people to take a second look at the military career they may have considered before .
And people who have been in the military and left are looking at joining again , possibly in another service branch .
" A lot of people laid off are calling me .
A lot people who used to be in the military are calling me , " said Staff Sgt. Ernest Rock , an Air Force recruiter in Phoenix .
Question
I have a small bright spot and I dimmed the dot with JScreen Fix .
Is a followup with pressure solution an option or not ?
Jesse Community Answer
You should not use the pressure method until you 've tried using JScreen Fix on the pixels overnight , ( Turn the monitor around so it does n't keep you up if you use the monitor in your room . )
If the dots do n't dim any more , then put a small amount of pressure on the spot .
If it makes it worse , stop immediately as you may cause more damage if you continue .
If it helps , rub the pixels that are stuck for about five minutes with your finger , stop if it spreads .
If all works , than keep going and your pixels will be good .
BEIJING , May 8 ( Reuters ) - Refined fuel inventories held by China ’s top two oil firms fell 15 percent to below 12 million tonnes during April , while their fuel sales rose 5.2 percent , an industry official with access to the data told Reuters on Friday .
The fall in fuel stocks at Sinopec O386.HK and CNPC is the second monthly decline in a row , following nearly a year of rising inventories in the world 's second biggest oil - consuming nation .
The source said March ’s stockdraw was 6.1 percent , much less than a figure of 14.7 percent reported last month by the Beijing News , which cited industry figures .
The sudden fall was explained by some analysts as evidence of rising demand and by others as an indication of wholesalers stockpiling fuel .
Gasoline inventories held by state refiners CNPC and Sinopec fell 5.3 percent in April while diesel inventories dropped by a hefty 21.6 percent in the same period , the source said .
Sales of gasoline by the two oil majors rose 6.6 percent in April while diesel sales increased by 7.4 percent , said the source , who declined to be named .
The source also said that fuel production at the two oil majors rose 1.7 percent in April than March .

Propose to your girlfriend with technology and you ’re bound to get blogged .
There ’s no shame in that , though .
If the idea of Cupid were conceived in modern times , he ’d probably be sending messages through an RSS reader rather than shooting arrows with a bow , right ?
OK , probably not .
But even so , geeks have come a long way since they were mocked and despised a couple decades ago .
Now that we know nerdiness can lead to fame , power and riches , it ’s possible to be a geek and get the girl .
To prove the point , we ’ve rounded up a list of the geekiest , tech - inspired marriage proposals that were sweet enough to work .
They might even get a cold , dead heart like mine thumping a little .
Proposal 2.0
Michael Weiss - Malik , a Google employee , deserves a lot of credit for this one .
What better way to show the world your love than displaying it on Google Maps ?
Weiss - Malik got his buddies on the Street View team to give him a heads - up on the next time the Street View car was coming out to take pictures .
And when that day came , he was well - prepared , holding a banner that read " Proposal 2.0 : Marry me Leslie ! ! " ( see above )
After that , all he had to was lure Leslie into loading Google Maps and zooming in on the precise coordinates of his romantic stunt .
Now , that ’s clever .
i Propose with iPhone
We ’ve heard two stories of tech - savvy Casanovas using their iPhones to propose to their girlfriends .
Just this week Bryan Haggerty coded a custom iPhone application to send his girlfriend Jeannie Chou on a scavenger hunt throughout San Francisco .
The web app included a map containing location points , each one accompanied with a video providing clues on where to go next .
In the end , the map points connected to form a < 3 , and the final destination was the top of a hill in Dolores
Park , where Haggerty busted out the big question .
Tell us that is n’t cute .
And then there ’s Dan Deeble , who concocted a similar idea in
October 2008 .
He found an iPhone app called Scribular , which works with the handset ’s GPS and allows users to tag locations with notes .
Deeble put on his geeky - romantic thinking hat , and he came up with a creative way to use Scribular .
He drove around Sacramento , leaving notes for his partner Crystal Gardner at various locations .
He loaded Scribular on her iPhone , too , and had her friends calling her throughout the day , telling her to check the app .
Finally the two met at a restaurant , where Gardner checked Scribular one more time to see another note :
" Almost one year ago , I found you — and I found love … .
I ask if you will grant me the greatest privilege of my life and marry me .
Forever yours , Dan . "
Awwww .
Playing games with her heart
YouTube user TheRealPfhreak ’s proposal method was arduous , not to mention retro nerdy .
He hacked a ROM of the old Super Nintendo role - playing game Chrono Trigger while his girlfriend was playing through it .
Before tweaking some of the game ’s dialogue to ask her to marry him , he modded the game to recreate some of their favorite memories such as stargazing and dancing .
And he even added in her favorite song lyrics from The Princess Bride .
Whoever said nerdy computer scientists could n’t be romantic ?
Virtual diamonds
Game geek Bernie hacked his way into his lady ’s heart , too .
He modded his girlfriend Tammy ’s favorite game , Bejeweled , to work on a Nintendo DS .
Only , it was slightly different :
At some point the jewel pieces formed the shape of a diamond ring , which he used to pop out the question .
Looks like it took a lot of time , but it ’s safer than buying an actual ring , right ?
Just kidding
— he got her one of those , too .
May 9 , 2009  --
The release of the 2010 budget request has shed more light on some FBI surveillance programs the bureau is currently developing and testing .
While the FBI has been criticized at times for its slow reforms after the 9/11 attacks , which revealed the FBI did not have adequate computer resources , some of the new programs sound like something out of a high - tech cloak and dagger film .
The budget request shows that the FBI is currently developing a new " Advanced Electronic Surveillance " program which is being funded at $ 233.9 million for 2010 .
The program has 133 employees , 15 of whom are agents .
According to the budget documents released Thursday , the program , otherwise known as " Going Dark , " supports the FBI 's electronic surveillance intelligence collection and evidence gathering capabilities , as well as those of the greater Intelligence Community .
" The term ' Going Dark ' does not refer to a specific capability , but is a program name for the part of the FBI , Operational Technology Division 's ( OTD ) lawful interception program which is shared with other law enforcement agencies , " an FBI spokesman said .
" The term applies to the research and development of new tools , technical support and training initiatives . "
According to FBI officials , the program is designed to help the agency deal with changing technology and ways to intercept phone calls such as those used by VOIP ( Voice Over Internet Protocol ) phones or technology such as Skype .
The program is also conducting research on ways to conduct automated analysis to look for links between subjects of surveillance and other investigative suspects .
Asked about the program , Jim Dempsey with the Center for Democracy and Technology said , the " FBI has long been conducting research on new communications technologies .
They complain about the difficulty of intercepting new technologies -- especially when they want weaker legal standards or more money -- but I think they have done a very good job of keeping up . "
Like the National Security Agency , he continued , " their biggest challenge is not collection -- it is analysis -- they are drowning in data . "
Dempsey also said , " It is appropriate for the FBI to develop more and more powerful interception tools , but the privacy laws that are supposed to guide and limit the use of those tools have not kept pace . "
High - Tech Biometrics , Sharing Information with Interpol
Another high - tech program includes the development of the Biometric Technology Center , a joint Justice , FBI and DoD program .
Building the center will cost $ 97.6 million and will serve as a research and development center for biometric technology .
Last year , the FBI announced it would partner with the University of West Virginia to establish the center .
Eventually , the Biometric project will be a vast database of personal data including fingerprints , iris scans and DNA which the FBI calls the Next Generation Identification ( NGI ) .
The FBI has awarded the NGI contract to Lockheed Martin to update and maintain the database which is expected to come online in 2010 .
After being fully deployed the NGI contract could cost up to $ 1 billion .
DOJ 's budget request also mentions an INTERPOL program called Project Vennlig , which is a terrorist information sharing program run by the international anti-crime organization .
The Defense Department initiated the program to obtain criminal information about insurgents killed or captured in Iraq .
The DOJ budget request notes the program gathers information from insurgents ' cell phones and documents found in their possession :
" The purpose of the initiative is to obtain and integrate collected information for the use of INTERPOL member countries and U.S. law enforcement agencies in proactively targeting terrorism . "
If a source of electricity already widely used by some utilities  hydropower or nuclear power , for example  is deemed renewable , it allows utilities to meet the new renewable - energy requirements while doing little to add wind or solar power to the electrical grid .
House Republicans tried unsuccessfully last week to have nuclear energy included under the climate bill passed by the House committee .
Environmental groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists , Environment America and the Natural Resources Defense Council say they are frustrated by the increasing elasticity of the word “ renewable ” in legislators ’ hands .
“ Usually this is a very political process , and not driven in any way , shape or form by any strict scientific or ecological definition of renewables , ” said Nathanael Greene of the N.R.D.C .
But some of the industries that have claimed the renewable mantle argue that they deserve it .
“ A banana is renewable  you can grow them forever , ” said Bob Eisenbud , a vice president for government affairs at Waste Management , which receives about 10 percent of its annual revenues of $ 13.3 billion from waste and landfill energy generation .
“ A banana that goes into garbage and gets burned , ” he added , is “ a renewable resource and producing renewable energy . ”
But environmentalists argue that one of the goals of renewable energy is to cut back on the heat - trapping gases emitted from burning most things , whether fossil fuels or bananas .
When there is no fire , there are no emissions .
The waste - to - energy technology described by Mr. Eisenbud was not included in the original draft of the climate legislation that received House committee approval , but it was contained in the version that moved out of the committee , thanks to language inserted by Representative Baron P. Hill , Democrat of Indiana .
A new $ 227 million waste - to - energy plant was already planned in northern Indiana , outside his district .
On the Senate side , an effort to get the benefits of the renewable designation for advanced coal - burning technologies failed , however .
Senator Jeff Bingaman , Democrat of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate energy committee , said that if too many new technologies beyond core renewable sources like wind and solar were to be included , “ the whole purpose of the renewable electricity standard is defeated . ”
You have probably seen police roadblocks when you were out driving your car , and you may have even been stopped at one , but did you know that before the police are allowed to actually set up a roadblock they are first required to prepare written guidelines so that the officers conducting the roadblock do not violate motorists ’ rights by , for example , stopping motorists because of their race or ethnicity ?
In the case of State of Florida v. Jones , the Florida Supreme Court stated that " [ w ] ritten guidelines should cover in detail the procedures which field officers are to follow at the roadblock .
Ideally , these guidelines should set out with reasonable specificity procedures regarding the selection of vehicles , detention techniques , duty assignments , and the disposition of vehicles . "
According to the United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Texas , when the police stop someone and that stop " is not based on objective criteria , the risk of arbitrary and abusive police practices exceeds tolerable limits . "
Seven years after the Jones case was decided , the case of Campbell v. State of Florida arose .
In the Campbell case , the Jacksonville Florida Sheriff ’s Office set up a roadblock to check for traffic violations .
The only written instructions for implementing the roadblock stated merely , " Stop motorists on Mandarin Rd. for a traffic safety check .
Have a motorcycle [ with ] radar on each end of check to monitor speed . "
In addition to the written instructions , the officer in charge of the roadblock gave oral instructions to the officers who actually stopped the motorists .
One of the oral instructions was to stop every car passing through the roadblock .
Things did not , however , go exactly according to plan .
Several times during the five - hour roadblock , traffic backed up which created a safety concern .
In response , the officers on scene used their discretion on different occasions to simply waive some cars through the roadblock while continuing to stop and check others .
One of the motorists who was stopped was a man named Phillip Campbell .
When the police discovered that Campbell had a suspended driver ’s license , he was arrested and taken to the county jail where the police found cocaine and marijuana in one of his socks .
Campbell ’s lawyer later filed a motion to suppress requesting that the judge suppress the narcotics found in his sock because the roadblock violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution as well as the Jones decision .
Campbell ’s case eventually reached the Florida Supreme Court , and that Court ended up siding with Campbell finding that " the limited police directives used here do not limit police discretion and fall short of the discretion - limiting written set of uniform guidelines specifically required by us in [ the Jones case ] . "
The High Court continued on to say that " [ i ] n this country , the police are not vested with the general authority to set up ‘ routine ’ roadblocks at any time or place .
Rather , law enforcement was placed on notice by our holding in Jones that the stopping and detaining of a citizen is a serious matter that requires particularized advance planning and direction and strict compliance thereafter . "
If you were arrested in West Palm Beach , Palm Beach , St. Lucie County , Martin County , Palm Beach County , Broward County , or Miami - Dade County , and you think your rights were violated , call me , attorney Ron Chapman , at 561-832-4348 to discuss your case and see how I might be able to help you .

China increased its goal for wind power generation capacity by the year 2020 to as much as 100,000 megawatts , from the 30,000 megawatts that the Chinese government set 18 months ago , newspaper China Daily reported on Monday .
The total wind power generating capacity in China is currently 12,000 MW but the country which is growing at the fastest rate among all the economies in the world , wants to raise it to 20,000 MW by next year , the paper said .
China expects to have an annual wind power growth rate of 20 percent , according to Fang Junshi , head of the coal department of the National Energy Administration .
He spoke at a Coaltrans conference in Beijing , according to the paper .
China - the fourth largest producer of wind energy in the world , after the United States , Germany and Spain - is also aiming to have 40 percent of all its energy originate from renewable energy sources by 2050 .
China is powering ahead with no visible signs of slowing down , said Steve Sawyer of the Global Wind Energy Council , according to the newspaper .
If anything it is accelerating .
They intend to become the largest market in the world , very clearly , and they probably will unless things take off in the US again in the relatively near term .
China will become the biggest growth market for wind power generating capacity this year , ahead of the United States , the Global Wind Energy Council ( GWEC ) says , according to the report .
Last year , the United States was the largest wind growth market in terms of what was added and total MW installed , said Christine Real de Azua , assistant Director of Communications of the American Wind Energy Association in a phone call from the Windpower 2009 Conference & Exhibition in Chicago , Illinois today .
Real de Azua said the the AWEA was not ready to make a growth prediction for the U.S. in 2009 and beyond because it depends on the energy policies that will be implemented .
But she added that key points to determine future growth are how quickly and strongly a renewable energy standard is established .
The standard will determine the amount of energy that a utility is required to buy from an alternative energy source .
During the first quarter of 2009 , the U.S. wind energy industry installed 2,836 megawatts of new generating capacity , the AWEA reported on April .
The U.S. plans to produce 20 percent of the country 's electricity use from wind by the year 2030 .
This amount would require about 300,000 MW of wind power generation , according to a scenario of the Department of Energy detailed on the website 20 percentwind.org .
Yesterday I ate too much , and today I can still feel it .
I do n’t think I really enjoyed what I felt after we had our large pizza and the cheesecake dessert we brought back from our “ foraging ” trip later in the afternoon .
And this brings up an interesting topic — the idea of giving yourself a “ splurge day ” every week as part of your weight loss plan .
There are pros and cons to doing this .
Pros of having a splurge day
The basic idea is that if you are working on a diet plan as part of a weight loss effort , that you may sometimes find it easier to maintain your plan if it does n’t mean you ’ve got to give up your favorite foods for the rest of your life .
You like chocolate cake , you miss chocolate cake , you do n’t think you can possibly do without chocolate cake forever … so you tell yourself that you ’ll have it , if you can only hold out until Sunday .
There are some good scientific theories behind “ splurge days . ”
Limits of self - control .
Some psychological researchers suggest that there are limits to our abilities to deprive ourselves .
Their research suggests that self - control seems to operate like the batteries in your laptop or cell phone : eventually you need to recharge them .
The thinking is that if we try too hard to deprive ourselves or control our behavior in too many areas , or sacrifice for too long , we may actually weaken our ability to control ourselves .
So the theory goes that if once a week you splurge , it ’s like a much - needed rest period .

Avoids “ starvation mode . ”
This is based on the medical research suggesting that our bodies have built - in “ famine detector ” systems that react to prolonged caloric reduction by going into an energy - saving mode .
In other words , if you cut back your calories constantly , you find that you ’re less able to burn off fat .
The bod says “ no .
Un uh .
I need this fat . ”
So a day of splurging is a way of keeping the body ’s famine detection system off guard ….
so you can keep losing weight .
You eat a few extra cookies on Sunday and on Wednesday you may find you ’ve lost more weight than you would have if you ’d skipped the cookies .
( This only works occasionally , of course — cookies every day does n’t have the same effect . )
Cons of having a splurge day
How it feels .
Sometimes your splurges may just not feel all that good .
When you generally eat a lot of heavy foods , sugary foods or whatnot , you may feel less good than you might feel if you ate healthier instead of splurging .
And the more you are used to healthier eating , the more you ’ll notice the effects of your once - weekly splurge .
I think this was part of my feeling yesterday : despite looking forward to a pig - out meal and a great dessert , the fact is I did n’t feel all that great after I ate .
I used to eat like that daily ; now I seldom do .
So I felt stuffed and frankly , got kind of sick of eating the pizza and dessert we ’d bought .
Ick .

Health effects .
Being diabetic , I have to plan carefully and adjust my meds if I am to eat a lot of carbs or sweet desserts or the like .
High blood sugar means having that “ sleepy stupid ” feeling that other folks mainly associate with the after - Thanksgiving feast .
It ’s not healthy , though .
And even if your health is generally great , a pig - out meal stresses your bod anyway .

And even if your health is generally great , a pig - out meal stresses your bod anyway .
Psychology .
I mean , here we are , working not just to “ get thin ” for a few weeks , but trying to modify our general sense of ourselves .
Part of your sense of “ self ” is the stuff you do , the stuff you say , the stuff you think .
As Kurt Vonnegut once wrote , “ you are who you pretend to be . ”
So if I want to be a thin , healthy , athletic guy ( my mantra ) , what is that guy doing eating like that ?
What to do ?
I think the upshot of this is that like most weight - related issues , there are complex , one - size - fits - one answers here .
My current thinking , for me , works like this :
Having a splurge day is fine , but I ’ll try to have a balanced , more reasonable approach to it .
It ’s fine , for instance , to make that a “ splurge meal ” instead of a whole day .
A big brunch or nice dinner should suffice , instead of following an “ anything goes and eat like you ’ll never see food again ” strategy .
Even at that , using some portion control and picking healthier treats is generally better , though I wo n’t lose sleep over it if I am not “ perfect . ”
Trying to get some exercise on splurge day is probably a good idea .
It happened that I also was on my “ no gym ” day ( which is usually Sunday ) .
But a walk in the woods would have been good to have had .
Getting single - servings of things would be better than buying larger quantities .
Neither my wife nor I really want big slabs of pizza and slices of cheesecake during the week , but we bought a large pizza and a couple of cheesecake desserts that are now sitting in the fridge .
( Actually , we did n’t realize we ’d have as much left over as we do . )
It ’s hard not to eat that stuff later in the week , ya know ?
To say it 's a revisionist view of the second world war is understating it , but when Quentin Tarantino takes on Hitler and the Nazis , there is never any real doubt about who is going to win .
Tarantino today unveiled Inglourious Basterds at the Cannes film festival , starring Brad Pitt as the leader of a troop of Nazi- killing Jewish - American soldiers in occupied France .
Pitt admitted the film was " definitely outrageous " and recalled Tarantino 's visit to his French home last summer to pitch it .
" All I know is we talked about backstory and we talked about movies into the wee hours .
I got up the next morning and I saw five empty bottles of wine on the floor .
Five .
And something that resembled smoking apparatus , I do n't know what that was .
" Apparently I had agreed to do the movie and six weeks later I was in a uniform . "
Tarantino said he had wanted to create a character for Pitt for a long time .
" Artistically , me and Brad have been sniffing around each other for a while .
" The longing looks across the room , the little notes , ' I like you , do you like me . '
Pretty quickly into writing I realised this is the one for Brad and then I started getting nervous – ' shit , if he does n't do it , what the fuck am I going to do ? ' "
Tarantino wrote Inglourious Basterds for 10 years on and off and it was financed and filmed , by normal movie standards , remarkably quickly in order to be ready for this year 's festival .
It is a kind of spaghetti western - comedy - fairy tale where the characters revel in violence .
Asked if it was fair to call it a Jewish revenge fantasy , Tarantino said : " That would n't be how I would define it 100 % .
You could definitely say that and it works completely in that way .
That would n't be the section in the video store I would maybe put it in .
" People ask me , is it a fairy tale ?
Is it Jewish wish - fulfilment fantasy ?
There are aspects of that but to me , more than anything else , it is that my characters change the outcome of the war .
Now that did n't happen because my characters did n't exist , but if they had existed then the movie is plausible . "
The actor Eli Roth , who plays a baseball bat - swinging Basterd , was upfront about how he felt .
" Being Jewish , for me it 's like kosher porn .
It 's something that I have fantasised about since I was a very young child .
It was like I performed a sex scene when I beat that guy to death . "
The film is also about how cinema could have won the war and the main British character , played by Michael Fassbender , is a film critic turned soldier who is an expert on German cinema .
Perhaps predictably , there was generous applause from the audience of film journalists after its first screening today .
Tarantino won Cannes 's Palme d'Or for Pulp Fiction in 1994 and served as jury president five years ago .
" During this time on the Riviera , cinema is important ; even the things which are booed , it 's out of passion , it means something .
All the world 's film press are here and I value that .
I am not an American film - maker , I make movies for the planet Earth and Cannes is the place that represents that . "
One potential snag for Tarantino winning his second Palme d'Or , it was put to him , is the presence of Isabelle Huppert as jury president .
Huppert had been in talks to be in the film .
" I do n't think it will affect it at all , " said Tarantino .
" Nobody adores Isabelle Huppert more than myself .
" It just did n't work out because of scheduling and timing - wise and deal stuff .
There was no thing , no thing at all .
I do n't think twice about it because I adore her and she likes me and I 'm sure that we will eventually work together and I can't wait for that day to happen .
There 's no acrimony between us that I 'm aware of at all .
I 'm still her biggest fan and I hope one day to work with her . "
Mike Myers plays a cameo role as a British general briefing the Fassbender character on his mission .
Myers said : " I 'm the biggest Quentin Tarantino fan that you 'll find .
My parents were born in Liverpool and my father was in the Royal Engineers and my mother was in the Royal Air Force .
Those ladies who stand in front of big maps saying ' Jerry 's over Norfolk , scramble Biggin Hill ' , my mom was one of those people .
" World War II was talked about at the table .
So when I got a call saying , would you like to play a World War II general I did a jig , I was very happy and I 'm still very happy . "
Inglourious Basterds should delight Tarantino fans and irritate his detractors .
It may also annoy English teachers .
The title is borrowed from a little - known 1978 film called Inglorious Bastards by Enzo Castellari but Tarantino 's film is completely original , neither a remake or an adaptation .
" I 'm never going to explain the spelling , " said Tarantino .
" When you do an artistic flourish like that , to describe it , to explain it , to take the piss out of it would invalidate the whole stroke in the first place . "
A torsion oscillator shakes a sample of frozen helium back and forth like a washing machine agitator , and gives experimenters information about the state of the matter inside .
At temperatures near absolute zero some of the helium goes into a frictionless " supermatter " state and offers less resistance to being pushed back and forth .
The entire apparatus is about the diameter of a quarter .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
When helium is cooled to around 4 degrees above absolute zero , it turns liquid .
Make it a couple of degrees cooler , and it becomes a " superfluid " that flows without resistance from its container , just as electrons flow without resistance in a superconductor .
Now pressurize the helium to about 50 atmospheres until it solidifies , and then cool it a lot more to about two - tenths of a degree above absolute zero , and it becomes -- well , there 's a lot of argument about what it is .
Perhaps a supersolid , or a solid with some superfluid moving through it .
In fact , it may be a superglass , report J.C. Séamus Davis , the James Gilbert White Distinguished Professor in the Physical Sciences at Cornell and colleagues in the May 1 issue of the journal Science .
The researchers are cautious in their conclusions , not insisting that the material is a glass but presenting evidence to support that idea , which was proposed by theorists about two years ago .
( All this refers to helium - 4 , the common variety you see in balloons .
Helium - 3 , an isotope with two protons and only one neutron in its nucleus , has parallel but different properties .
Cornell researchers Robert Richardson , David Lee and Douglas Osheroff earned a Nobel Prize for discovering the superfluid state of helium - 3 . )
In a solid , as scientists define it , atoms bond to one another in an orderly crystal lattice .
In a liquid , the atoms freely move around .
A glass is really a liquid flowing so slowly that it appears to be solid .
Look out your window for a few hundred years , and you might notice it starting to sag .
Although the theory that frozen helium might be a supersolid has been around for years , the first evidence that it was at least a super - something was provided in a 2004 experiment by Moses Chan at Penn State .
Researchers there placed a tiny cylinder of frozen helium in a torsion oscillator , which rotates rapidly forward and back , like a washing machine agitator .
The resonant frequency of the oscillator -- the one it naturally settles into -- depends on the mass it 's trying to move around and back .
The researchers found that below a critical temperature , some of the mass of the helium seemed to disappear .
Imagine holding an egg upright in your hand and twisting your wrist back and forth .
There is n't much resistance because the inside is liquid and slides around .
Hard - boil the egg and you feel all of its mass pushing back .
Now suppose a hard - boiled egg decided not to push back : odd .
That wo n't happen with eggs , but it does happen with solid helium near absolute zero .
One way to explain this is in terms of the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle :
We can't know both the position and velocity of a particle with great precision ; the more we know about one , the less we know about the other .
Near absolute zero atoms are n't moving very fast , so their position becomes very loose .
The many atoms of helium overlap so much that they behave as a single atom -- a state of matter known as a Bose - Einstein condensate -- which is unaffected by anything around it and essentially frictionless .
Davis ' group used an apparatus similar to Chan's , but " heated " the sample to a range of temperatures from near absolute zero up to about 300 milliKelvins ( thousandths of a degree above absolute zero ) .
After each heating they watched how the resonant frequency of the oscillator changed over a period of many hours , essentially measuring how long it took for the material to " refreeze . "
What they found was consistent with a material that becomes more and more glass - like as the temperature increases , rather than something that responds like a crystalline solid .
Davis likens the effect to a glass - blowing demonstration .
At room temperature glass seems pretty solid .
At around 1,500 degrees Celsius it begins to melt and flow at speeds visible to humans .
As the temperature rises it flows more freely .
The dependence of these ultraslow flow properties on temperature can be used to distinguish a glass from a crystal , Davis explained .
He compares heating glass to heating a diamond , which remains an ordered crystal no matter how hot it gets , until it reaches its melting point ( 3550 degrees Celsius ) .
Below the melting point no slow changes would be seen over time after heating .
The second surprise was that only when the glasslike properties freeze out does the frictionless superflow signal discovered by Chan appear .
" This is interesting not just because it appears glass - like and not just because it shows the Chan signal but because it shows a relationship between the two , " Davis said .
" We think that when this glass freezes , the superfluid begins to move , and such a state could be called a superglass . "

BOISE , Idaho  Standing up for states ’ rights has not been easy this spring , even as many state lawmakers wince at the extended reach of the federal government .
With the recession sparing few corners of the country , the $ 787 billion federal stimulus package has weakened the resolve of states ’ rights activists in legislatures across the country .
“ They lay the bait out , and we come take it , ” said Monty Pearce , a Republican state senator who sponsored a sovereignty resolution that passed the Idaho Legislature .
“ Then we whine that we ’ve taken it . ”
Sure enough .
When legislatures convened this year , lawmakers in more than 30 states set out to send Washington a blunt message : back off .
Frustrated by federal policies like the bank bailout and rules allowing wolves to prowl the West , they drafted so - called sovereignty resolutions , aggressive interpretations of states ’ rights outlined in the Tenth Amendment .
Acting independently ( though sometimes cribbing a whereas or two from the Web ) , the lawmakers shared the same broad goal : to symbolically push back against Congress and the White House in a power struggle as old as the Republic .

As a self - taught web developer , I learned a lot of what I know by looking at other people ’s source code .
It ’s unfortunate that I ca n’t do this on my iPhone with mobile Safari , at least not by default .
That said , there are several methods you can use to view the source code of a site on your iPhone .
In - Browser Methods
In - browser solutions simply allow you to navigate to a specific page and type in the url you wish to see the code for .
I found two that worked well , one of which inspired the other :
Bookmarklets
Bookmarklets allow you to avoid a lot of unnecessary typing on your iPhone by letting you jump from any web page straight to its rendered source code .
Abe Fettig ’s view source bookmarklet
Dustin Caruso ’s view source bookmarklet
Native App Solutions
There will be times where you just want an app to do all the work for you .
If your in one of those moods , you could use one of the following native apps .
Source - View
Source View is a handy way to view a website ’s source code – just as you would with the “ view source ” command in a desktop web browser .
The source is presented in a easy to read font , and you can zoom and scroll in the display , just as you can in Safari .
View - Source
View Source enables you to view the source of web sites on your iPhone or iPod Touch , with the ability to set the browser type when getting the source and the functionality of emailing the source to anyone .
Command Line Method
If you want to view the source of an iPhone optimized website using something other than your iPhone , you may navigate to the site and get “ this page is viewable only on an iPhone ” or something similar .
Scott Barr discovered this when he tried to view the source of an iPhone specific RSS feed .
To work around this , he used the following methodwhich uses the curl command in terminal :

ELEVEN years ago , the UN pledged to win the war on drugs within a decade .
It has failed .

In his opening remarks , the head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime , Antonio Maria Costa , claimed “ measurable progress ” .
The drug problem has been “ contained ” , he said , and drug use has “ stabilised ” .
Costa ’s position flies in …

Appearing on CNN today , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was asked what has become a popular question , and a Democratic talking point , about his party : is Rush Limbaugh your leader ?
Schwarzenegger , a former Mr. Universe and a moderate , responded thusly : " I think that they say that Rush Limbaugh is the 800 lb. gorilla in the Republican Party , but I think that 's mean spirited to say that because I think he 's down to 650 lbs. , so I think one should be fair to him about this whole thing . "

Schwarzenegger went on to say that , " in all seriousness , " the GOP should expand its tent .

Barack Obama wants to burn Joe Q. Public alive -- and all because he wants to fix the immigration mess .
That was pretty much what Glenn Beck told his Fox News audience yesterday .
Actually , it was more blatant than that :
Beck : And President Obama apparently feeling like -- ah , I 'm pretty much done , not a lot more to do , you know ?
I got all those things done .
You know what ?
Why do n't I work on immigration reform ?
Later this year he hopes to create a path for the estimated 12 million illegal aliens here in America to become legal .
But yet , we have n't fixed the border and shut the water off !
What a sweet , sensitive guy he really is .
Here 's one thing I think the media is missing .
I do n't know about you , but when I saw that story last night , I did this :
Wha- ?
You 've gotta be kidding me !
Let me , let me just ask you a question .
Maybe I 'm alone , but I think it would just be faster if he just shot me in the head !
You know what I mean ?
How much more -- how much more can he disenfranchise all of us ?
We have Bill Schultz here , he 's from Red Eye .
And I 'm just going to demonstrate at least how I feel , all right ?
I feel , when I read this story last night , I do n't know about you -- let 's say Bill is the average American here , and I'm President Obama .
This is the way I feel .
I feel like President Obama is just saying , ' You know what , I 've got that $ 3.5 trillion budget here ...'
He then proceeds to douse Schultz with a clear liquid from a gas can ( he promises it 's actually water ) and then hold up a lit match in his general vicinity .
And then he wonders why people think he 's promoting a violent and paranoid right - wing worldview that is bereft of anything approaching reality .
Because of course , what Obama is planning is hardly anything like the " amensty " that Beck seems to believe is coming .
Regarding the border , for instance , the New York Times story that he read the night before stated this clearly :
In broad outlines , officials said , the Obama administration favors legislation that would bring illegal immigrants into the legal system by recognizing that they violated the law , and imposing fines and other penalties to fit the offense .
The legislation would seek to prevent future illegal immigration by strengthening border enforcement and cracking down on employers who hire illegal immigrants , while creating a national system for verifying the legal immigration status of new workers .
So , let 's see :
No amnesty , but a path to citizenship .
Border security a top priority .
An emphasis on stopping future illegal immigration .
And the problem here is ...?
Well , that of course would never stop Beck from shrieking hysterically and warning Americans that he 's about to set them all on fire .
And he concludes with a truly classic bit of naked dishonesty :
We did n't vote to lose the Republic !
We did n't vote for any of this stuff !
We voted for change !
You know what that change was ?
The change we wanted was an end to the games !
An end to the games ?
You mean , games like pretending now that you actually voted for Obama and change , instead of for McCain and more of the same ?
You mean , games like accusing the opposing the president of leading us into fascism ?
You mean , games like pretending that right - wingers '
Bizarro version of reality out there on Planet Wingnuttia is somehow rooted in anything other than paranoiac , authoritarian fantasy ?
Actually , Glenn is right :
He did n't vote for any of this stuff .
What he has n't seemed to figure out is that the people he did vote for lost .
And if he had his way , the majority of the country who voted for Obama would be the ones being disenfranchised .
And of course , that 's exactly the only thing that would ever make Glenn Beck happy .
No reasons were given for the detention of Sheikh Issa al - Nahyan Abu Dhabi prosecutors have detained a member of their own ruling family after a video was circulated apparently showing him torturing another man .
Public prosecutors say they also have begun criminal inquiries into Issa bin Zayed al - Nahyan 's actions on the tape .
The investigation is the first reported of a ruling family member in Abu Dhabi , capital of the United Arab Emirates .
Previously , Emirati officials had named Sheikh Issa as the man in the video but said the case was " resolved privately " .
" The Public Prosecution Office has officially launched a criminal investigation into the events depicted on video and detained Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al - Nahyan pending the outcome of this investigation , " the official news agency WAM reported on Monday .
" This is to ensure that all human rights obligations are met and enforced , that all national laws are applied equally and with transparency to all , " WAM said , quoting a statement by the Judicial Department .
On 30 April , after initially dismissing accusations about the video , the Abu Dhabi authorities condemned the torture depicted in the tape and called an inquiry into the case .
The latest statement , issued on Monday , did not give reasons behind the change in approach , or the circumstances of the sheikh 's detention .
Hospital treatment
The advocacy organisation Human Rights Watch described reports of the sheikh 's detention as reassuring , but called on the Emirates government to demonstrate complete transparency in the case .
Country profile : UAE " Secretive prosecutions will not deter further abuses , " said Human Rights Watch Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson .
The video shows Sheikh Issa repeatedly beating the man , Mohammed Shah Poor , a grain merchant of Afghan origin , and running him over with a car .
Several other men assist in the tape , including one in a uniform of the security forces .
The incident , said to have taken place in 2004 , came to light after US television network ABC broadcast clips of the tape , which was smuggled out of the UAE by a former business associate of Issa bin Zayed al - Nahyan .
Reports say the merchant had lost a consignment of grain belonging to Sheikh Issa worth $ 5,000 ( £ 3,300 ) .
He survived the abuse , but needed extensive hospital treatment .
In a letter to ABC News , the UAE authorities initially said a police investigation that cleared the sheikh had " correctly followed ... all rules , policies and procedures " set out by the Police department .
The UAE is a federation of seven wealthy emirates with substantial oil reserves and a large expatriate population .
Each emirate is run by a ruling family and citizens are granted few political rights .

Mosquito bites occur as small blisters or swollen red spots where mosquitoes suck blood from the human body .
These bites can be both painful and itchy .
It is important to take precautions against mosquitoes as they are carriers of various diseases like the West Nile disease .
Mostly female mosquitoes carry these viruses and they tend to bite more frequently as they need the blood for nutrition to breed .
Preventive Actions
Different preventive measures can be taken to avoid mosquito bites .
At night while sleeping you can opt for mosquito nets to keep mosquitoes away .
You can also use nets to cover your baby ’s pram or stroller while going for a walk .
One must be careful not to open the net too wide so as to allow mosquitoes to enter .
Also check for holes and tears in the net and if any mend them without delay as they can allow mosquitoes to enter inside the net .
Though nets are very safe it is not practically possible to always stay within the net to avoid mosquitoes .
Therefore one has to opt for other preventive measures especially outdoors as mosquitoes are attracted to foliage .
If you want to spend time gardening or mowing your lawn or your children want to play in the park , then you and your kids are bound to be bitten profusely if you have not taken any precaution .
A mosquito repellant cream or lotion is a good option at such times .
Such creams are safe on children and even infants above two months of age .
Mosquitoes are attracted to the smell of human breath and perspiration due to the presence of carbon dioxide and lactic acid .
You have to apply the cream on the exposed areas of the body as its smell will shield the human body odors and prevent mosquitoes from coming close .
Another option to avoid mosquito bites is to use mosquito sprays on the clothes that you wear for your outdoor activity .
You can also use some mosquito repellant spray in the bedroom for about 10 – 15 minutes before sleeping to drive mosquitoes away .
Most of the repellant creams and sprays contain DEET which is a safe chemical for application on human skin .
However , even though it is safe , many of us may still cringe at the idea of using chemicals on our skin or breathing in chemicals through sprays .
Nowadays , there are many mosquito creams and sprays available which are made of plant oils like lemongrass oil , citronella oil , castor oil , eucalyptus oil and the like .
These oils have a strong smell which naturally repels mosquitoes and other insects .
Using such natural creams and sprays is a safer option as there are no side effects like skin allergies and rashes associated with their use .
However , whenever you use any mosquito repellant cream on children you should apply it sparingly for the first time to see if there is any allergic reaction .
If there is none , you can continue to use it .
Incase you have had mosquito bites you should not scratch them in spite of the itchy sensation as that might lead to scars and marks on the skin .
Instead wash the area with soap and water immediately to reduce the itchiness and inflammation .
米 Hewlett - Packard（HP）は4月14日、同社の電 卓「 HP -35 Scientific Calculator 」がIEEE（電気電子技術者学会）から電気電子技術分野の歴史的偉業として「IEEEマイルストーン」に認定されたと発表した。
HP-35は1972年に発表された世界初の手持ちサイズの科学計算機。HPで初めてICとLEDを搭載した製品で、HP-35という名称はキーが35個あったことに由来する。基本的な四則演算（加減乗除）しかできなかった当時のほかの電卓とは違って、計算尺でできるすべての関数演算などが可能だった。HP-35の登場で、計算尺は廃れていったとHPは述べている。
HP-35の発売当時の価格は395ドルと高額だったが、予想を上回る需要があり、最初の1年で10万台以上売れたという。
「 HP-35はいつでもどこでも、ほぼ瞬時に正確な科学演算ができるようにしたことで、技術変化のペースを速め、エンジニアリングに革命を起こすのに貢献した」と2008年のIEEE会長ルイス・M・ターマン氏は述べている。

Two tiny kittens are slowly recovering after having paws cut off - believed to be by children using a knife or scissors .
The kittens survived their " horrendous " injuries , but are now facing major surgery to have a hind leg and part of a hip amputated .
The children , both aged under 10 , giggled when they left the kittens at a Wellington Cats Protection League foster home , saying that the kittens ' " feet fell off " .
But a vet 's verdict is that the feet were " traumatically removed " .
The children and their parents left the animal foster home without giving their names .
The committee member who runs the home has informed the SPCA , but a spokesperson says they cannot investigate without more information .
The eight week - old kittens are recovering well , but need to grow bigger before they have a hope of surviving the required surgery .
Both kittens are missing their left - hind foot .
A veterinarian 's notes say the leg of the smaller , black male " ends abruptly at the extreme distal tibia " the kitten 's ankle .
The slightly larger black - and - white male was cut across the top of his foot his leg " ends abruptly across the proximal metatarsals " .
The kittens were very quiet when the vet first saw them and the stumps were " swollen and inflamed " .
It was thought they might die from the trauma .
The volunteer who runs the home said for a long time her children could not bear to look at the kittens .
" [ The kittens ] do n't know they do n't have feet .
The cruellest thing is when you see it lying on its back and it's got its little stump and it 's trying to scratch its chin .
" They 're as friendly as - they try and climb up you and everything .
It 's horrible because you can feel the stumps on you ... you can feel the jagged bit at the end .
" The other day we just heard [ one of the kittens ] scream and it had stood on a piece of kitty litter and it had stuck into its little stump ... it got infected . "
The stumps have to be carefully bathed every day .
The woman , who declined to be named , said she had taken in more injured cats in the last three months than in the past nine years put together .
" I just can't believe there 's so many .
They 're all so horrendous , " she said .
" It just never seems to stop . "
Other recent cases include a kitten whose tail was chopped off by a child with scissors .
That kitten survived , but was deeply traumatised .

Princeton geoscientist Gerta Keller has new evidence to support her alternative theory that volcanoes , not meteorites , wiped out the dinosaurs .
Indeed , the evidence is so compelling that we might be dropping the whole " alternative " part .
Advertisement
Keller is one of several co-authors on a new paper in The Journal of the Geological Society of London that lays out the startling new evidence .
Previous studies of rock formations in India , Mexico , and the United States had first prompted Keller to conclude there was a discernible period between the massive meteorite impact that has been advanced as the killer of the dinosaurs , and their actual final extinction .
This extinction , which is known to have occurred 65 million years ago , marked one of the most drastic biological upheavals this planet has ever seen .
Signaling the end of the age of reptiles ( the Mesozoic Era ) and the beginning of the age of mammals ( the Cenozoic Era ) , this boundary between the Cretaceous ( abbreviated " K " ) and Tertiary ( " T " ) periods is known in scientific literature as the K - T Boundary .
The K - T Boundary can be observed geologically through the vastly different plant and animal species found on either side of the divide .
Advertisement
Another potential sign of the K - T Boundary is a thin layer of clay rich in iridium , an element found far more often in asteroids or comets than on Earth .
This connection to space strengthened the theory , put forth in the eighties , that an object from space was responsible for the mass extinction of 65 million years ago , even singling out the Chicxulub Crater in the northern Yucatan peninsula of Mexico .
But the new paper provides a wealth of new biotic evidence , or fossil remains of animals and plants , that throws a monkey wrench in this theory by demonstrating there was extensive continuity of species at periods before and after the established time of the asteroid impact .
Indeed , one key area of study was Chicxulub itself , where Keller and her students found Cretaceous period one - celled organisms in layers spatially above and thus chronologically after the Chicxulub impact .
Using the remains of these populations as a guide , Keller estimated Cretaceous organisms endured for some 300,000 years after the Chicxulub impact .

The picture is complicated by the fact that there were several traumatic geological events around 65 million years ago in the Mexico and Texas areas alone :
Over the years , Keller 's group has amassed evidence for as many as four major events widely separated in time in that area of Mexico as well as in Texas .
The oldest of the four events is the Chicxulub impact , seen by the fallout of glass beads .
The second is about 150,000 years later and seen in a layer of sandstone with Chicxulub impact glass beads that were transported from shallow shore areas into deep waters during a sea level fall and was commonly interpreted as a tsunami generated by the Chicxulub impact .
About 100,000 to 150,000 years later , the third event struck at the time of the K - T boundary with its iridium layer and mass extinction .
This event may represent a second large impact or massive volcanism .
The fourth event is possibly a smaller impact as evidenced by another iridium layer about 100,000 years after the mass extinction .
Advertisement
Proponents of the Chicxulub impact theory have argued the apparent 300,000 years separating the impact and the extinction at the K - T Boundary are a trick of geological disturbance , a result of tsunamis and earthquakes caused by the impact reshuffling sediments and making the geological record difficult to read .
Keller disputes this , saying her latest findings at the El Peñon in Mexico show no evidence of geological disturbance .
What her findings do show , however , is unprecedented species continuity from before and after the Chicxulub impact :
Also at El Peñon , the researchers found 52 species present in sediments below the impact layer and counted all 52 still present in the layer above it , indicating that the impact has not had the devasting biotic effect on species diversity as has been suggested .
" Not a single species went extinct as a result of the Chicxulub impact , " Keller said .
In contrast , she noted , at a nearby site known as La Sierrita where the K - T boundary , iridium anomaly and mass extinction are recorded , 31 out of 44 species disappeared from the fossil record at the K - T boundary .
Advertisement
So if an asteroid did n't kill the dinosaurs , what did ?
Keller suspects it might well be volcanoes :
Keller suggests that the massive volcanic eruptions at the Deccan Traps in India may be responsible for the extinction , releasing massive amounts of dust and gases that could have blocked sunlight , altered climate and caused acid rain .
The fact that the Chicxulub impact seems to have had no effect on biota , she said , despite its 6 - mile - in - diameter size , indicates that even large asteroid impacts may not be as deadly as imagined .
Advertisement
Keller readily admits there will never be consensus on the question of what caused the K - T extinction event , but she considers this an impractical benchmark anyway and not something worth waiting for as she prepares to investigate the Deccan Traps .
Instead , she will simply continue to build on the evidence she has already found , hoping to put together an ever more convincing picture of just what happened 65 million years ago .

Political reporter , BBC News
Just when you were beginning to think that Eurosceptics were all dyed - in - the - wool right - wingers , along comes Bob Crow .
NO2EU believes the EU is destroying workers ' rights
The RMT rail union chief is a bastion of the Old Left , now detached from the Labour Party , and he is hopping mad about the European Union , which he believes is destroying workers ' rights through its promotion of privatisation .
Speaking at the European election campaign launch of a new political alliance NO2EU - Yes to Democracy , on the steps of the Department of Health in Whitehall , he blames the EU for everything from threatening the jobs of workers in the NHS , through a new directive on breaking up monopolies , to attacking trade union collective bargaining and the right to strike .
The group wants British withdrawal from the EU , attacking its " completely undemocratic institutions " - the European Commission and the European Central Bank - and what it sees as the corrupt Brussels " gravy train " .
NO2EU was born out of the " British Jobs for British workers " protests at the Lindsey oil refinery and its aim is to provide working class voters and trade union members with a left wing alternative to the British National Party .
' Not being represented '
Mr Crow , who is the new party 's lead candidate in London , said that - unlike the BNP - he was " not against workers coming into the country " but he was against " two workers from different countries competing against each other on different rates of pay " .
" It is the system that is wrong , " he adds .
We are against the export of jobs and factories from the UK , but we also want unity
Dave Nellist , NO2EU candidate
He says his party 's executive committee fully backed the setting up of a new political party to take on Labour and the other major parties and he says he is comfortable with spending his members ' money on what is , by any measure , a huge political gamble .
" Our union believes our members are not being represented at the moment , " he argues .
If N02EU manage to get any MEPs elected , they say they will not take their Brussels wage or spend much time in the European Parliament .
Instead , they will man the barricades at picket lines across Europe , says Mr Crow , campaigning for workers ' rights .
" Our main role will be out there among working people , giving them our support and helping to save their industries from privatisation . "
' Clean hands '
The new group is an alliance of the RMT , the Socialist Party , the Communist Party , the Indian Workers ' Association and the Alliance for Green Socialism .
It is running a full slate of candidates on 4 June , including Dyal Singh Bagri , President of the Indian Workers Association , Solidarity 's Tommy Sheridan and trade union convenors from the Lindsey oil refinery and protests at the 2012 Olympics site .
The party 's lead candidate in the West Midlands is former Militant Labour MP Dave Nellist .
Asked what the difference was between NO2EU and the seemingly ever - growing list of parties competing for the Eurosceptic vote on 4 June , he says : " We are not barmy .
" We are against the export of jobs and factories from the UK , but we also want unity .
We do n't want to start a war with France or Italy . "
Mr Nellist , who says he only ever claimed an average factory worker 's wage when he was in Parliament , claims it can tap into public anger with mainstream politicians over the expenses scandal , saying : " We come into politics with clean hands . "

Oxford Reply
Oxford University 's reply to a recent inquiry about the status of Richard Dawkins :
“ The statutory Charles Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science has not as yet been filled , although it was established in 1995 by decree .
Since then Dr Dawkins , as he was then , was appointed to the Charles Simonyi Readership and subsequently had the title of Professor conferred in July 1996 . ”
Discussion on this is below , under " Oxford Reply discussion " .
Discussion
Andy , once again with feeling : the support for the claim that " according to OU , he 's the Professor of the Public Understanding of Science " is contained in the exact same source that you use as evidence that he is not the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science ..
That quote again in full ( mybolding ) :
“ The statutory Charles Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science has not as yet been filled , although it was established in 1995 by decree .
Since then Dr Dawkins , as he was then , was appointed to the Charles Simonyi Readership and subsequently had the title of Professor conferred in July 1996 . ”
You keep repeating the first part of this sentence - which does indeed confirm that Dawkins ' CV is incorrect and that he does not hold the statutory Charles Simonyi Professorship .
However for some reason you are ignoring the second part which confirms that OU did confer a professorial title onto Dawkins in July 1996 .
This professorial title was granted by the Distinctions Committee of the University - see the gazette notice confirming the details of the title here .
That notice clearly states that the full title of the professorship is " Professor of the Public Understanding of Science " and was awarded to Dawkins in the Biological Sciences Division .
The current University Calendar confirms that he still holds the title , along with the position of Charles Simonyi Reader .
If you accept that the first part of the FOI response is the official statement from OU on this matter then you must - by definition - accept the second part as official confirmation that OU granted Dawkins a professorial title in 1996 .
I am quite happy to admit that some of my earlier assertions in this talk page were wrong , and that the Simonyi endowment turns out to be a bit less cut and dried than I had supposed .
I think this article should indeed reflect that Dawkins CV is incorrect in some particulars , and that he does not hold the statutory Simonyi chair .
However all the evidence confirms that Dawkins does still hold a full and legitimate professorial position at the University of Oxford , and that his title is that of Charles Simonyi Reader , and Professor of the Public Understanding of Science .
Just like Oxford say it is .
Can the five distinct errors that I have listed earlier on this page please now be corrected ?
OurMike 14:19 , 21 November 2007 ( EST )
User : OurMike , in the spirit of Thanksgiving , I compliment you on your perseverance and attention to detail .
We are making progress despite all the insults that have been spewed against me by atheists and liberals who seem to think that whatever Richard Dawkins says must be true .
In fact , Richard Dawkins ' resume is not true .
It says that he holds a certain professorship , when in fact he does not .
Now that is settled , you want to address the statement by Oxford that Dawkins was granted a professorship in 1996 ( not 1995 ) , which was different from the Simonyi professorship .
But that raises as many questions as it answers .
By 1996 , Dawkins already had the post ( not a professorship ) paid by the Charles Simonyi gift .
Apparently this new professorship in 1996 was at no cost to the department that granted it , if in fact a bona fide department actually did confer it .
I have not seen any posting of the official letter by Dawkins reflecting this new , apparently cost - less professorship .
Was it a merely an honorary one ?
Was it truly the product of a customary peer review ?
I see evidence suggesting otherwise , and the fact that no one here can point to the appointment letter speaks volumes .
Moreover , even if that 1996 professorship was legitimate , it is not the Simonyi professorship claimed on Dawkins ' resume .
I see no credible evidence suggesting that Dawkins still holds the alleged 1996 professorship now .
-- Aschlafly 19:39 , 21 November 2007 ( EST ) Mr Aschfley .
Just to clarity your position .
Reading the above you now seem to be accepting that Professor Dawkins is a professor , but you are querying what type of professor he is and under what circumstance he became one .
Is that the case ?
If so , we are , as you say , making progress .-- British_cons ( talk ) 13:11 , 22 November 2007 ( EST )
Aschlafly ,
Yes that 's right .
Dawkins ' CV is incorrect - the Simonyi Professorship is different from the title that Dawkins does actually hold ( that of Charles Simonyi Reader ( 1995 ) and Professor for the Public Understanding of Science ( 1996 ) ) .
I first pointed this out over a month and a half ago .
I have no idea how Dawkins ' - or indeed any Oxford academic 's - position is funded , though I 'm not sure why you assume that it was without cost .
I 'm happy to debate University financing arcana , but it is not relevant to whether or not the title has been conferred .
The professorship was not " merely an honorary one " .
Oxford does not give honorary professorships , though it does give honorary degrees and honorary fellowships ( Dawkins has one of those too , by the way - according to the Calendar he is an honorary fellow of Balliol ) .
The professorship was granted by the Distinctions Committee , which has a very specific and documented process of peer review [ 1 ] .
There has been no evidence that Dawkins circumvented that process - do you have something that you have not yet shared with us ?
The professorship is still extant , as the University Calendar confirms ( incidentally , it also states that the professorship terminates in 2008 , when Dawkins reaches retirement age , at which point he will become Professor Emeritus in accordance with Oxford regulations [ 2 ] ) .
I think we can shortcut this debate with a very simple question : do you accept that the FOI response , the Oxford University Gazette , and the Oxford University Calendar are credible , legitimate sources on Dawkins ' status at the University ?
Just to remind you , the FOI response states that " Dawkins ... had the title of Professor conferred in July 1996 " ; the Gazette is " the authorised journal of record for the University of Oxford .
It provides information of ... Appointments to University posts , such as professorships , etc " [ 3 ] , and the Calendar is the official annual directory of the University 's faculty , produced by the University 's Public Affairs Directorate .
If you do accept these are legitimate sources then I 'm happy to - once again - list in detail the evidence from them that confirms Dawkins appointment , his faculty membership , and his continuing employment , and I hope that the errors in the article will then be corrected .
If you do n't accept they 're legitimate can you please explain why ?
OurMike 13:33 , 22 November 2007 ( EST )
User : OurMike , you claim that you pointed out the falsehood on Dawkins ' own resume " over a month and a half ago , " but I do n't see evidence of that at your link .
Instead , your link continued to insist wrongly that the entry here was in error , rather than the falsehood being on Dawkins ' resume .
Despite an abundance of evidence here that Dawkins ' leading credential is falsely represented on his resume , you continued to fail to admit it .
User : British_cons still wo n't admit it , nor will Dawkins ' atheistic supporters .
Obviously the grip of atheism prevents some people from accepting the truth .
The issue of what lesser honor was conferred on Dawkins in July 1996 , after he received his current Simonyi post , is a curiosity .
Whatever it was , it appears to me that ( a ) it was not a fully compensated professorship , ( b ) it was not a permanent faculty position in an academic department in which Dawkins now serves , ( c ) there was a general disclaimer raising doubts about which department approved the announced professorships , and thus ( d ) it did not satisfy the customary attributes of a professorship .
Again , I invite Dawkins to post his letter of this appointment , if it was even an appointment .
Note that his resume does not include any reference to this appointment or honor beginning in 1996 , though his resume includes many lesser honors .
-- Aschlafly 15:03 , 22 November 2007 ( EST )
Just so we get this clear , you now do accept that it was some form of professorship ?-- British_cons ( talk ) 15:26 , 22 November 2007 ( EST )
Aschlafly , Perhaps you did not scan down far enough .
The section where I suggested that Dawkin 's professorship was separate from the Simonyi endowment is dated 14:39 , 11 October 2007 .
It says " Mea culpa ... I ’m not now sure whether Dawkins did go through the election board stipulated in the act for the Simonyi endowment ...
The Professorial title would seem to be entirely at Oxford University ’s own instigation . "
I have admitted , several times now , that I was wrong earlier in these talk pages , and that Dawkins does not hold the statutory Simonyi chair , and that instead he has the title of Simonyi Reader , and Professor of the Public Understanding of Science .
If you recall , it was me that presented that evidence here , so I 'm not sure why you say I fail to admit it .
Why do you assert that Dawkins professorship is not fully compensated , and what relevance does this have over whether the title was awarded by Oxford ?
In what way does the disclaimer on the Distinction Committee 's page mean that it does not satisfy the customary attributes of a professorship ( and does this mean that you believe none of the professors listed in that notice hold proper professorial positions at Oxford ) ?
I have pointed to evidence from three impeccable sources from OU which confirm that Dawkins ( a ) holds the title , ( b ) is a member of both the Biological Sciences division and the Continuing Education Department , and ( c ) is still employed by the University .
Can you please confirm whether you are willing to accept the FOI response , the Gazette , and the Calendar as legitimate sources , and if not why not ?
OurMike 16:27 , 22 November 2007 ( EST )
User : OurMike , you wrote , " Perhaps you did not scan down far enough .

But there 's nothing to be " not sure about . "
The Oxford charter is crystal clear and it has been cited all along in the entry here , demonstrating that Dawkins received merely a " post " from the Simonyi grant , not a professorship .
On the one hand you said " mea culpa , " then a few words later you say that you 're not sure , despite the entry being crystal clear .
Then again and again and again you claimed the entry here is somehow false . [ 4 ]
I 'm not trying to rub it in , but am trying to understand what it is about atheism that makes people thinks its OK for Dawkins ' resume to contain this central falsehood about his credential .
For example , why are n't you criticizing Dawkins for this ????
Note how your ambivalence of this academic falsehood , which result in many employers firing someone in the U.S. , enables other atheists to continue to pretend that Dawkins ' resume is true , when it is not .
User : OurMike added , " If you recall , it was me that presented that evidence here , so I 'm not sure why you say I fail to admit it . "
The entry has contained the above link and direct evidence before you began claiming the entry was false , yet now you try to take credit for it !

OurMike 16:27 , 22 November 2007 ( EST )
" impeccable sources " ???
Not at all .
You provide no specific links for your three statements above , and they are not reflected as you state on Dawkins ' own resume .
The announcement by Oxford contained a prominent disclaimer suggesting that the department was not final , which raises doubt as to whether an academic department conducted customary peer review at all in this case .
We still do n't have a copy of his appointment to any professorship , which presumably Dawkins could easily post if it exists .
The claim of an appointment to a professorship ( not the Simonyi professorship ) is contrary to Dawkins ' own resume ( e.g. , note the dates ) , adding further reason to be skeptical .
But even those two issues were overcome , and they have not been , the appointment does not appear to me to be a customary professorship .
-- Aschlafly 18:56 , 22 November 2007 ( EST )
Here is the link to the Oxford University Gazette [ 5 ] .
The citation from the FOI response and the Oxford University Calendar were posted here .
I hope that helps .
Feebasfactor 19:12 , 22 November 2007 ( EST )
Aschlafly , while you are of course free to doubt whether Dawkins holds a " customary " professorship , the simple , verifiable fact is that Oxford University consider that he does .
Thanks Feebasfactor for pointing out - yet again - the references that confirm this .
Unless you have evidence that the University has lied about Dawkins ' appointment ( in their FOI response , in their official journal of record , and in their staff directory ) then this basic fact is incontrovertible .
OurMike 09:20 , 23 November 2007 ( EST )
No , User : OurMike , the evidence is contrary to your claims , which you cling to most likely for ideological reasons .
Nothing in Feebasfactor 's links suggests that " Dawkins holds a ' customary ' professorship . "
Dawkins ' resume claims he received a professorship in 1995 , while Feebasfactor 's link refers to 1996 and even then with a important disclaimer .
1996 was after Dawkins had already accepted a different " post " .
Whatever Dawkins may have received in 1996 , I have not seen any official recognition that he " holds " that position today as you claim .
Nor have I seen Dawkins post any official letter conferring a professorship upon him , despite the challenge to his claimed credentials .
-- Aschlafly 12:52 , 23 November 2007 ( EST )
Aschlafly , the Gazette and the FOI response explicitly state that Dawkins was awarded a professorship , in 1996 .
It ca n’t be clearer .
Oxford does not award professorial titles except via peer review or election to a statutory chair – so if he holds an Oxford professorship he is indeed a ‘ customary ’ professor .
I agree that Dawkins ’ CV is wrong , but you ca n’t on the one hand state that the CV is wrong ( which it is ) whilst simultaneously dismissing my evidence because it contradicts the CV !
You still have n’t answered my question : do you agree that the Gazette , the Calendar , and the FOI response are legitimate sources of information on Dawkins ’ status at Oxford ?
The Calendar is n’t published online , but I ’m sure your local library can arrange to have a copy delivered if you want to see the pages yourself , confirming Dawkins still holds the title .
Anyone with access to an interlibrary loans service can verify this very easily .
Bibliographic details are here : http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780199234141.
Alternatively you could contact Oxford University directly – you can file a legally binding FOI request by email here : http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/foi/.
It takes seconds .
However if you do n’t want to check the references yourself I can take a photo of the relevant pages from the Calendar when I ’m in the office next week and post a link to them here .
Would that satisfy ?
OurMike 09:35 , 24 November 2007 ( EST )
User : OurMike , I have complimented you on your diligence and perseverance , have n't I ?
But I just hope you 're not clinging to atheism here .
If so , you 'd be doing yourself a big favor by recognizing the falsehoods inherent in atheism ... and the resume of its leader .
Then you can move on the better for it .
Having acknowledged the falsehood on the Dawkins ' resume about holding the Simonyi professorship , and about the false 1995 date for the other alleged professorship , you press further in reliance on Oxford catalogs that , in turn , likely rely on the announcement here : [ 6 ] .
But what was that original announcement ?
It was this :
" The title of professor or reader has been conferred by the Distinctions Committee on the following .
Please note that in a small number of cases the precise academic subject area in which the title is held is still under discussion .
Any changes will be published separately when agreed .
...
Biological Sciences J.P. Armitage , MA , Fellow of St Hilda's : Professor of Biochemistry
D.A.P. Bundy , MA , Fellow of Linacre : Professor of Zoology
J. Burley , MA , Fellow of Green College : Professor of Forestry
I.W. Craig , MA , Fellow of St Catherine 's : Professor of Genetics
C.R. Dawkins , MA , D. Phil. , D.Sc. , Fellow of New College : Professor of the Public Understanding of Science "
I 'll concede that Dawkins was appointed as a " Fellow " , but we 've already agree that he was not appointed to the Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science .
I infer that the title for Dawkins above was " still under discussion " that was to be clarified and " published separately when agreed . "
But we 've found no subsequent publication , so we can infer that the hoped - for agreement for a professorship was never reached .
Ergo , I conclude that Dawkins never received the professorship .
Of course , if he did , then he can simply post the confirmatory letter .
As far as I can tell he has not and cannot do so .
-- Aschlafly 14:21 , 24 November 2007 ( EST )
Hi Andy , some comments : ( 1 ) The disclaimer said that the " subject area " was under discussion not the professorship .
You quoted it yourself Talk : Richard_Dawkins / Archive_4#Summary_of_Established_Evidence
" Please note that in a small number of cases the precise academic subject area in which the title is held is still under discussion .
Any changes will be published separately when agreed . "
It is talking about the subject area , and since you quoted it yourself , you know it .
Give evidence that the disclaimer has any bearing on the validity of the title of professor ?
( 2 ) The disclaimer was a general disclaimer , that could apply to any of the scientists mentioned in the announcement of the distinctions comittee .
Give evidence that the disclaimer refers to Dawkins and not to say I.W. Craig , Professor of Genetics or J. Burley , Professor of Forestry ?
I took a break for a month or longer , and it seems like that your tactic is still to keep asking for more evidence , while it is him how has to provide evidence .
After all , he is , or at least he was accusing Oxford University of fraud .
You said a month ago : " I do n't think the department referencing Dawkins in that link even had the authority to grant his professorship .
So I 'm confident that that is not worth the paper it was written on . "
Have you found any evidence for any of this in the meanwhile ?
Order 22:20 , 24 November 2007 ( EST )
User : Order , I just checked a subsequent year and the disclaimer cited is absent , [ 7 ] which is compelling evidence for me that the 1996 disclaimer applies to Dawkins .
I 've invited Dawkins here to provide his letter of appointment , and I hope he can , but I conclude that he cannot .
So , in response to your question , I find it clear that the disclaimer ( and lack of a subsequently published agreement ) reveals that the named department did not grant a true and customary professorship .
-- Aschlafly 22:35 , 24 November 2007 ( EST )
So probably it was probably Dawkins ' professorship for which " the precise academic subject area in which the title is held " was still under discussion ?
Considering the discrepencies we 've seen so far and curious circumstances surrounding this professorship , that does seem likely .
Feebasfactor 22:48 , 24 November 2007 ( EST )
(1) In what respect does the disclaimer have any bearing on a professorship being " customary " ?
Can you give evidence for your claim that an discussion on the subject area makes it impossible for professorship to be customary ?
( 2 ) You have cited the announcement regarding Dawkins yourself , and your own quote contains several names .
Do you have evidence that the disclaimer refers to Dawkins .
Pointing to a document that does n't contain either of the other , does n't prove your point .
Based on what evidence do you conclude that it the disclaimer referred to Dawkins , and not I.W. Craig .
Both do not appear on the announcement one year later .
What is your evidence ?
Order 22:55 , 24 November 2007 ( EST )
User : Order , Richard Dawkins has posted his resume and makes lots of money selling books based on his claimed credentials .
We 've already exposed one falsehood on his resume ( the claim of a Simonyi professorship ) and we have further exposed a conflict between the 1995 date for the other alleged professorship on his resume and the 1996 date provided by Oxford .
Even Dawkins ' defenders , such as User : OurMike , finaly admitted that the claim of a Simonyi professorship is false .
Now we 're working on a possible third falsehood relating to the disclaimer connected to his alleged appointment and a lack of the promised published agreement about that .
Dawkins , who is profiting from his claimed credentials , can surely post his letter of appointment if it exists .
Assuming the disclaimer applies to him , and there is no reason to think it applies to anyone else , then the lack of the promised published agreement suggests there was no agreement awarding even this professorship .
Seems to me it 's long overdue for you to direct your questions at him .
-- Aschlafly 23:24 , 24 November 2007 ( EST )
Not so fast .
I have n't seen any evidence that Dawkins is not the Simonyi professor of Public Understanding of Science .
All that I have seen is evidence that he was appointed to become the Professor of Public Understanding of Science .
Second , we have long ago established that this appointment happened in 1996 , and it was in particular OurMike who found and explained this here , here and here .
If anything you should complement him for his intellectual honesty , and not pretend you made this discovery yourself .
Back to the evidence that you fail to deliver .
An announcement by the distinctions committee in 1997 , that does n't mention Dawkins at all , is not evidence or proof for either of these claim : that the CV maliciously mentions the year 1995 as the start of the professorship rather than 1996 .
mentions the year 1995 as the start of the professorship rather than 1996 .
that the disclaimer has any relevance for legal status of the professorship which was granted in 1996 .
that the disclaimer refers to Dawkins appointment in 1996 .
claim that the distinction committee exceeded it authority by publishing the 1996 announcement .
The 1997 document that you linked does n't give any evidence for any of these .
And Freebasfactor , I might add , a discussion in 2007 on an American message board , is no evidence at all for the allegation that the 1996 appointment by the distinction committee of the University of Oxford was contended .
Order 01:28 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
I did n't mean to imply that our contending his professorship here somehow affected the appointment in 1996 ; I just meant that even today " the precise academic subject area in which the title is held " still seems hard to pin down .
Could anyone even explain exactly what he is the professor of , and in which department ?
You ca n't just have the title " Professor " conferred and be a professor of nothing .
Feebasfactor 11:26 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
The announcement by the distinctions comitttee is quite clear about it .
Under the header Biological Sciences , it says C.R. Dawkins , MA , D. Phil. , D.Sc. , Fellow of New College : Professor of the Public Understanding of Science .
Unless you find some evidence that this was overruled at a later stage , this is his title , subject area , and the department .
But I can already tell you that a discussion on this site is n't evidence for decisions that may or may not have been made by Oxford in 1996 .
Order 22:05 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
Aschlafly , I have to agree with Order .
The prefatory note on the Gazette notice , on which you place so much weight , makes it very clear that “ the title of professor or reader has been conferred . ”
Note the past tense in “ has ” , “ been ” , and “ conferred . ”
Whilst it is certainly interesting to note that the “ precise academic subject area ” of some of the c.180 professors and readers on the list were still under discussion at the time the notice was printed , it cannot be inferred that the actual distinction of ‘ professor ’ or ‘ reader ’ was in the balance for any of the listed acedemics .
I should also point out that your parsing of the second part of that prefatory note is wrong .
The key phrase “ Any changes will be published separately when agreed ” means that you will only see another Gazette notice if there are any changes .
As you have rightly pointed out , we have found no further notices regarding Dawkins on this matter , and therefore must assume there were no changes to the precise academic subject area of Richard Dawkins ’ professorship .
As I ’ve already pointed out to you , the above was verified by Oxford University this month , when – in response to a legally binding Freedom of Information request – they stated that “ Dawkins ... had the title of Professor conferred in July 1996 ” .
Can we all now agree on this point ?
OurMike 10:00 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
We have established that the falsity of Dawkins ' resume with respect to the Simonyi professorship itself , and now are addressing a claim that he is some other type of professor .
Dawkins ' own resume describes his position at New College as a " Professorial Fellow . "
While that may appear to be a full professorship , it is not .
In the Commonwealth system , a " Professorial Fellow " is like an honorary professor , and is not an " established " position : [ 8 ]
" The objective of this regulation is to make provision for certain matters relating to the conferment of titles on persons who are associated with the University in a substantial way but who are not employed in or appointed to established or recurrent positions within the University .
Scope :
Titles which may be conferred :
1. Honorary Professor
2. Professor Emeritus
3. Visiting Professor
4. Adjunct Professor
5. Adjunct Associate Professor
6. Adjunct Teaching Fellow / Adjunct Research Fellow
7. Professorial Fellow
8. Clinical Associate
9. Visiting Fellow
Defenders of Dawkins here cite a statement by a clerk at Oxford that " Dr Dawkins ... was appointed to the Charles Simonyi Readership and subsequently had the title of Professor conferred in July 1996 . "
Note carefully the distinction drawn by Oxford between being " appointed " and having something " conferred " .
That is the same distinction drawn above by the Commonwealth academic community between an honorary - type title and an established , peer - reviewed position .
Oxford 's statement just quoted confirms that Dawkins was not " appointed " to a peer - reviewed professorship .
Rather , merely an honorary - type title of " professorial fellow " was " conferred " upon him .
This helps explain why Dawkins has not posted any letter of appointment .
Users Order and OurMike , I hope you will view this information with an open mind and not continue to insist , for ideological reasons , that Dawkins was appointed to a peer - reviewed professorship .
-- Aschlafly 11:16 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
Aschlafly I ’m glad we ’ve now finally reached agreement that Dawkins was awarded the title of Professor from Oxford University .
We are making progress .
OurMike , you lost credibility with that comment .
I 'm sure anything you wrote afterwards is worth reading .
Sorry .-- Aschlafly 14:24 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
Aschlafly , then I retract that statement .
I had assumed that you had agreed the title had been awarded , and that we were now discussing the exact nature of the ' professorship ' .
I 'm basing this on your statement above " merely an honorary - type title of " professorial fellow " was " conferred " upon him . "
Apologies if I 've misrepresented your position .
OurMike 14:42 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
The Oxford clerk said that it had " conferred " a title , which is a term of art meaning something very different from " appoint " or " award " , as in " conferring an honorary degree . "
Also , as already discussed , Dawkins ' title was subject to a disclaimer that was never removed .
-- Aschlafly 16:48 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
Aschlafly , please see my response below regarding how Oxford University confers peer reviewed professorial titles .
As discussed above , the prefaratory note makes it clear that a title has been conferred .
OurMike 17:36 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
To clarify about the disclaimer - the full disclaimer read :
The title of professor or reader has been conferred by the Distinctions Committee on the following .
Please note that in a small number of cases the precise academic subject area in which the title is held is still under discussion .
Any changes will be published separately when agreed .
Once again it is not made clear what exactly Dawkins is the professor of ; however , this disclaimer only seems to contest the nature of Dawkins professorship , not the validity of the title .
Additionally , it identifies the Distinctions Committee as the authority " conferring " the title of professor , so we might question whether they have the authority to do so .
Feebasfactor 18:17 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
Feebasfactor , it is made perfectly clear what exactly Dawkins is the professor of : he is the ' Professor of the Public Understanding of Science ' as it explicitly states in the Gazette notice .
Whatever discussions may or may not have taken place subsequently regarding subject areas , there is no recorded change to this subject that anyone has been able to point to , and instead plenty of confirmatory evidence that Oxford continues to refer to Dawkins with this title - not least the University 's own Calendar .
OurMike 11:30 , 27 November 2007 ( EST )
But what academic department is that , anyway ?
Or is Dawkins just a professor at The Museum of Natural History ?
I acknowledge that he has had the title of professor conferred , and that his position is recognized as valid by Oxford University .
The disclaimer , as I explained , was not relevent to that particular point anyway .
Perhaps , with all the apparent contradictions in information , I was at some points too readily critical of Dawkins .
However , I 'm still not impressed with his " bought " professorship , neither with the dubious mistakes on his Curriculum Vitae - and of course , the issue of his professorship being properly peer - reviwed has yet to be resolved .
Feebasfactor 23:58 , 27 November 2007 ( EST )
Woah , hang on .
What " bought " professorship ?
Surely we 've now established that Dawkins does n't hold the endowed Simonyi professorship , but instead holds a professorship conferred by the Distinctions Committee - that 's not a " bought " professorship .
I 'm also not sure why you say the peer - review issue has yet to be resolved , as there is a detailed explanation of the peer review process that the Distinctions Committee went through in the 1995 exercise before awarding the title - see here [ 9 ] .
This is the same process that the majority of professors at Oxford will have gone through since Oxford switched to this distinctions system in 1995 .
As for academic department : the Gazette notes that at the time he was conferred his professorship he was in the Biological Sciences Division .
That division has since been reorganised as Mathematics and Life Sciences , and the 2007 / 8 Calendar still lists him as a professor in that division ( in the Zoology Department ) , as well as a professor in the Continuing Education department .
OurMike 08:51 , 28 November 2007 ( EST )
Do you have evidence that the disclaimer refers to Dawkins ?
Order 22:05 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
No , I suppose I do n't .
See my reply further up for why I think it likely does ; however , I can't find evidence to definitively confirm ( or deny ) this .
My explanation of the disclaimer stands , though .
Feebasfactor 22:59 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
You are entitled to you explanation , even without evidence , but it is just one possible and unsupported explanation .
To cover the alternative case , do you have any evidence showing that the disclaimer does not refer to any of the other nominations mentioned in the announcement of the distinction committee ?
Order 01:55 , 26 November 2007 ( EST )
Your quotation above re .
Professorial fellows is from the 1992 regulations of Swinburne University of Technology , Melbourne , not those of Oxford University .
At Oxford , any holder of a readership , or anyone on grade RCIV or above is eligible to also hold the title of ‘ Professorial Fellow ’ at the college with which they are associated [ 10 ] .
Note that this honorific is separate from the actual professorship , which is also why it is listed separately on Dawkins CV .
More substantively you highlight the point that the title was “ conferred ” rather than “ appointed ” .
This is absolutely correct , but it is not true to say that this means the title is ‘ honorary ’ or that it was not conferred after due peer review .
In 1995 the University - with has a large number of very senior academics but proporionately very few professorial chairs - moved to a system of awarding ‘ Titles of Distinction ’ – these are professorial ( or reader ) titles , awarded by the University after peer review , but without an accompanying change in duties or pay .
As the Vice Chancellor explained in his oration on the new process in October 1995 : “ The decision has been taken to change the University 's system of titles of distinction and to enable all those who are deemed , by peer review , to merit the title of Professor or Reader to assume it . ” [ 11 ]
Professorial and Reader titles are awarded after a long and diligent process of peer review .
The details of the 1995 process that Dawkins ’ followed is available here [ 12 ] , and includes review by Faculty Boards , submissions on quality of research , details of the extent and quality of contribution to teaching and administration , and a final review by the University ’s Distinctions Board ( composition of the 1995 Board that awarded Dawkins is here [ 13 ] ) .
In the section on the award of professorial titles the University states : “ (a ) The primary criterion is that research must be of outstanding quality , have led to a significant international reputation , and be comparable in distinction with that expected of a professor in other major research universities . ”
As I understand it this system of awarding professorships is much closer to the American system , though I 'm not an expert .
Save for the handful of statutory professors , all academics with the title of Professor at Oxford would have received it as a Title of Distinction rather than as an endowed chair .
OurMike 14:15 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
OurMike , thanks for your effort to find relevant documents - and they are relevant because they are from Oxford , from the 1995 and 1996 , and refer to the appointment of professors in contrast to most of the evidence presented by others in this forum - , lets not forget that it is Andy who should find some evidence .
Andy 's condescending remarks on clerks of Oxford University are not evidence that the distinctions committee exceeded its authority .
In a class conscious British context it could be interpreted as a display of snobbish attitude towards normal staff members , but lets face it , most of documents in organizations are written by staff , and then signed off by the authorized superior .
It is good to see that also Andy made some effort to find supporting evidence , but unfortunately neither the fact that a clerk of Oxford University may have written the announcement , nor the statutes of an Australian university have any relevance .
We are still looking for actual evidence for Andys allegation that the 1996 disclaimer has any relevance for Dawkins appointment , and that the distinction committee was n't authorized .
Do we have any evidence for this ?
Order 22:05 , 25 November 2007 ( EST )
Maybe there could be some information about Dawkins life
how he grew up , where he is from , how he came to be famous .
Dawkins first came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene Qwertguy 20:21 , 22 November 2007 ( EST )
Also I think a link to the debate between Mr Hitchens and Mr Mcgrath .

Order 08:54 , 26 November 2007 ( EST )
Has the discussion migrated up here ?
[ NB : This was posted before this discussion was moved from the top of the page to the bottom — PJR ]
I 'm not sure what the relevance of professorial fellowships is to the reply from Oxford , which clearly uses the term ' professor ' and not ' professorial fellow ' .
As Aschlafly has rightly remarked " Oxford University chooses its official words carefully and means what it says " .
A professorial title is distinct from a professorial fellowship , as Oxford 's statutes and regulations make very clear .
This is why academics - Dawkins included - list their fellowships separately from their professorial titles .
Regardless , if anyone really is interested the statutes from Oxford are available online .
Dawkins would have been entitled to a professorial fellowship as soon as he became a Reader in 1995 [ 15 ] .
It should also be noted that at Oxford the " conferment of titles " is the standard method by which Oxford grants professorships .
The titles are conferred after detailed process of peer review [ 16 ] .
The majority of Oxford professors will hold a ' conferred ' title - including , for example , Prof. Alister McGrath ( featured prominently in the Dawkins article ) who had his title conferred in 1999 [ 17 ] .
OurMike 08:15 , 26 November 2007 ( EST )
Well done Mr Shafley
I really think that we should give Mr Schlafly credit where it is due .
Conservative Christians are often stereotyped as being unable to change their opinions or accept new information even when it is obvious .
Mr Schlafly , contrary to the opinions of his detractors , has not fallen into this trap .
The objection that many people have to the article is the phrase :
The title " professor " is misleading , if not fraudulent , .
Mr Schafley , after reading only a couple of examples where Oxford specifically calls Professor Dawkins a " Professor " now says things like :
The statement by Oxford that Dawkins was granted a professorship in 1996 ( not 1995 ) , which was different from the Simonyi professorship . ”
And “ Apparently this new professorship in 1996 was at no cost to the department that granted it , if in fact a bona fide department actually did confer it . ”
And “ Moreover , even if that 1996 professorship was legitimate , it is not the Simonyi professorship claimed on Dawkins ' resume .
“ Finally Mr Shafley manages to admit , “ I 'll concede that Dawkins was appointed as a " Fellow " .
From this it is clear that Mr Schlafly now regards Professor Dawkins as not only some kind of Professor but is also one of its governors - although Mr Schfley still retains some doubts about the nature of the Professorship and the way it was awarded .
It ’s clear that Mr Schafly is making fantastic – though admittedly rather slow – progress ; and I really think that we should applaud his bravery and honesty in making these comments .
It takes a real man to admit when he is wrong , and this correspondence shows that he IS man enough to change his opinions when presented with facts .
He deserves the support and encouragement of all of us in his difficult journey .
He is an example of how even the most convinced of people can be persuaded to change their opinions through the provision of clear evidence and sound reasoning .
Well done Mr Schlafly !
With time and a little bit more effort you may yet be able to agree with all the evidence posted .

Clarification
Aschlafly , can I please ask for some clarification of your position , as I am getting confused by two seemingly contradictory assertions you 're making in this talk page .
On the one hand you seem to be accepting that Oxford University did confer the title of Professor on Dawkins in July 1996 ( I understand that you argue that a ' conferred ' title is only honorary ) , yet on the other hand much of the page is a discussion over the prefatory note in the Gazette announcement of the title , implying that you still dispute that a title was conferred at all .
These two points seem to me to be contradictory , but perhaps I 'm just misunderstanding your position .
Can I please ask you to clarify which of these two is your current position ?
OurMike 13:57 , 26 November 2007 ( EST )
My view is that Oxford " conferred " a " title " akin to an honorary degree and subject to the unusual disclaimer that deprives the title of meaning as a real " professor . "
The title was conferred in 1996 ( not 1995 ) , and I can find no specific confirmation of it on Dawkins 's own resume .
The clerk who responded to the inquiry with the quote blocked above appeared to be unaware of the unusual disclaimer , which was printed in a section above a list of names rather than identifying Dawkins specifically .
The bigger question has been resolved : the Oxford blocked quote confirms that Dawkins is not the Simonyi Professor , as that position " has not as yet been filled .
" -- Aschlafly 14:07 , 28 November 2007 ( EST )
Perhaps you 'll get to my comments below in a moment , but I have a few questions about this view .
There are over 100 professors and readers listed on that page .
Could you clarify whether you think that all of their titles have been deprived of meaning ?
Why do you think it 's " akin to an honorary degree " given the evidence to the contrary cited throughout this page ?
Does n't the disclaimer say that if there were a change to the " precise academic subject area " , it would be published ?
Reaganetics 14:44 , 28 November 2007 ( EST )
The disclaimer is unusual and has an obvious connection to Dawkins ' situation , and the disclaimer does not appear in a similar , later announcement of distinctions .
In fact , I think Dawkins has even claimed to change where he holds this title , just as the disclaimer warned .
So it is reasonable to conclude that the disclaimer applies to Dawkins ' degree , and it is also reasonable to expect an Oxford clerk not to notice it in responding to inquiries or publishing future notices .
As already pointed out ably by others here , saying that one has a professorship in a department to be determined later is as silly as calling oneself " president " of a country to be determined later .
It means the term is not being used in its customary sense .
And when that department or country is never later declared , then the title is particularly meaningless .
-- Aschlafly 15:34 , 28 November 2007 ( EST )
Except that the announcement did n't say that the department would be determined later .
It named a department quite clearly .
The disclaimer says that it might be changed , and that any changes would be announced .
As I noted below , the logic is clear : Unless there is a subsequent announcement , then the department ( not the degree ) is as listed in the original announcement .
If you have any evidence of a change , then please present it .
In addition , the subsequent declaration by Oxford shows that the term is being used in its normal sense .
Reaganetics 15:49 , 28 November 2007 ( EST )
In addition , we are still waiting for evidence that the disclaimer referred to Dawkins , and not to Craig , or one of the many others on the list .
And what is you evidence that the title was honorary ?
Order 18:43 , 28 November 2007 ( EST )
And the announcement did n't even say " department " .
It said " precise academic subject area " , which I take to mean the wording of the title ( the " of " part of the title - " ... of the Public Understanding of Science " , " ... of Development Economics " , " ... of Commonwealth Studies " , etc ) , rather than what department or faculty the professor is working in .
Regardless , the University * still * refers to Dawkins as the Professor for the Public Understanding of Science in its current Calendar ( and still lists him as a professor in the Zoology faculty ) .
Corrections to the Calendar are printed here .
No mention of Dawkins yet .
OurMike 11:40 , 29 November 2007 ( EST ) Oh , and Reaganetics is correct .
The wording - and Oxford is precise on its wording - is clear .
Unless there is a subsequent announcement then the " precise academic subject area " is as listed in the original announcement .
No evidence of a change has been presented .
OurMike 11:54 , 29 November 2007 ( EST )
In your zeal to rehabilitate your favorite atheist , all three of you above misread the disclaimer on the title .
Oxford 's disclaimer stated : " The title of professor or reader has been conferred by the Distinctions Committee on the following .
Please note that in a small number of cases the precise academic subject area in which the title is held is still under discussion .
Any changes will be published separately when agreed .
... "
That is clear that in certain cases -- most likely Dawkins ' -- the subject area for the title " is still under discussion . "
That language indicates that there was no agreement , and still is n't .
That 's not a real professorship .
One ca n't be a " Professor of fill - in - the - blank . " -- Aschlafly 19:14 , 29 November 2007 ( EST )
Could you give a source that confirms ( 1 ) that the disclaimer refers to Dawkin's , and ( 2 ) that the disclaimer has makes the professorship invalid .
It is more than a week ago since this was asked for the first time , maybe you have been able to find evidence to support these claims .
Order 19:48 , 29 November 2007 ( EST )
User : Order , it 's basic logic .
If I say that I 'll give you $ 5 but this is subject to my agreeing to give you $ 5 , and say no more , then I do n't owe you $ 5 .
Oxford said it conferred a title subject to an agreement to confer the title in a meaningful way , and said no more .
The title does not exist in a meaningful way .
-- Aschlafly 20:57 , 29 November 2007 ( EST )
You analogy is flawed , and you know it .
The analogy would be that I owe you $ 5 , to be paid in cash , unless we agree on a payment by credit card .
Anyway , this is sophistry , and regardless on how good your analogies will become , what you need is evidence that ( 1 ) and that the University considers disclaimer relevant , and ( 2 ) that the disclaimer refers to Dawkins .

As someone who knows a thing or two about logic , semantics and syntax , I like to ask you what my logical error is ?
The syntax of my analogy was much closer to the disclaimer than the syntax of your analogy .
I am more than willing to show you the corners of logic if you want .
Even though it is a diversion .
Your tactic is to steer away from your obligations to produce evidence .
Making up an analogy that does n't fit , and attempts to infuriate me with condescending remarks referring to depression , anxiety , despondency , etc are an obvious attempt to get out under your obligation to find evidence for your claims .

-- Aschlafly 23:10 , 29 November 2007 ( EST ) )
There is nothing to support the contention that it is " most likely " Dawkins 's area .
We know that it occurred in this year and not in other years , but there are plenty of other professors to whom it could apply .
Also , please indicate the part of the disclaimer that says that there " still is n't " agreement .
Let me ask the question this way : Suppose that , at the time of the announcement , there was still discussion about whether a professor should be in Department A or Department B .
The announcement is therefore made that a professor is appointed in Department A , subject to the disclaimer .
Ultimately , the professor and Oxford agree that the appointment will be in Department A , just as it appeared in the announcement .
Given the text of the disclaimer , specifically the claim that * changes * ( not confirmations ) will be published seperately , what would you expect to see from Oxford in this case ?
Reaganetics 14:30 , 30 November 2007 ( EST )
Andy , I do n't really understand how the disclaimer invalidates the title either .
Regardless of the precise subject area , the title of professor had already been conferred .
Why can it not have been conferred , while possible changes to the subject area are still under discussion ?
This is what I do n't understand .
I still do n't think Dawkins ' professorship is a customary professorship and probably less impressive than it is supposed to appear , but I do n't think the disclaimer proves anything in these regards .
Though I at first assumed it did , it might not even apply to Dawkins .
Surely , if this one disclaimer bore such weight as to potentially validate or invalidate the entire title - well , why would n't OU specify who it applied to ?
Though Dawkins credentials are far from transparent ( example - the contradictions on his CV ) , I think there are too many assumptions to be made in pursuit of this argument .
Feebasfactor 23:12 , 29 November 2007 ( EST )
Feebasfactor , when an honor is subject to an agreement to be determined and announced , and the agreement is never determined and announced , then the honor is void .
If you wo n't accept the logic of that , all I can do is recommend that you take logic more seriously than you are .
I mean that earnestly .
Logic will improve your life , not falsehoods .
-- Aschlafly 23:18 , 29 November 2007 ( EST )
If you could provide evidence that the conferment was subject to the agreement on the subject you might have case , but the disclaimer does n't include any provision of this kind .
If you can find evidence that such a provision exists , give it .
Furthermore , even if such a provision would exist , you would have to provide evidence that it did apply to Dawkins , and not Craig .
If you have it give it .
Order 01:25 , 30 November 2007 ( EST )
As Order has noted , the disclaimer does not say what you claim it says .
It does NOT say " This honor is subject to determination and announcement . "
It does NOT say " These people have the title of professor , and the area of specialization is subject to determination and announcement "
It says " These people have received the title of professor .
This is the area .
If it changes , we will announce it . "
The use of the word " If " is key .
As I explained below , the logic is simple :
1 . If the area changes , then it will be announced .
( If A , then B. ) 2 .
It was not announced .
( Not B. ) 3 .
Therefore , it is not true that the area changed .
( Therefore , not A , by application of modus tollens to 1 and 2 ) .
If you think I have made an error here , please say exactly what you think it is .
Reaganetics 14:23 , 30 November 2007 ( EST )
The disclaimer , which applies to honors including Dawkins ' , says : " Please note that in a small number of cases the precise academic subject area in which the title is held is still under discussion .
Any changes will be published separately when agreed . ... "
The " still under discussion " indicates that there was not yet a definitive agreement , nor was such agreement published since .
Moreover , while I think Dawkins now claims he holds the title in part in the " Department of Continuing Education , " I have not seen publication of such agreement . [ 18 ]
Have you ?-- Aschlafly 18:24 , 30 November 2007 ( EST )
I 'm afraid that you did n't answer my request , so let me be more specific in case I was unclear .
I laid out three statements above and analyzed them using utterly elementary logic .
If you think any of those three statements is incorrect , please specify which one and provide ( and justify , of course ! ) a correction .
I have a simple question -- even simpler than the basic logical argument I presented above -- and I am curious to see if you will answer .
The disclaimer said that " any changes will be published . "
If there were no changes to a professor 's precise academic subject area , what do you think Oxford would do ?
Also , I would appreciate it if you would respond to the specific changes I suggested at the bottom of the article .
Some of them do not concern this specific issue .
Reaganetics 19:54 , 30 November 2007 ( EST )
Seconded
I would like to second the call for clarification ; I 'm broadly confused about the current position , and I do n't think it matches well with what 's on the main Dawkins page .
Here is what I think I understand from the evidence above .
I intend this as a tentative summary rather than a definitive statement of the truth , and I 'm certainly willing to entertain corrections .
According to Oxford itself , Richard Dawkins received the title of professor from the Distinctions Committee in 1996 ( as shown here : [ 19 ] .
The specific title is " Professor of the Public Understanding of Science " under the heading " Biological Sciences . "
The announcement says that " in a small number of cases the precise academic subject area in which the title is held is still under discussion .
Any changes will be published separately when agreed . "
There is no direct evidence that this disclaimer applies to Dawkins specifically , but even if it did , it would concern the " precise academic subject area , " not the title itself .
Moreover , nobody has posted any evidence of changes to Dawkins 's " precise academic subject area . "
I reason as follows :
If there is a change , then it will be published separately .
It has not been published separately , and therefore , by modus tollens , there has been no change .
Accordingly , Dawkins is a Professor of the Public Understanding of Science .
Dawkins is not , however , the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science .
According ( again ) to Oxford itself , nobody holds that position ; the " statutory ...
Professorship ... has not as yet been filled . "
If I understand Oxford 's reply correctly , Dawkins is the Charles Simonyi Reader and Professor of the Public Understanding of Science .
( I am not certain , however , if one can be both a reader and a professor at the same time -- I thought that professor was a higher title than reader and thus superseded it , but I do n't have any evidence to support this at the moment .
An alternative is that he holds the Charles Simonyi Chair as well as a Professor of the Public Understanding of Science , but is not the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science . )
There is perhaps understandable confusion about this point :
One of the Simonyi pages has as its title " The Current Simonyi Professor : Richard Dawkins . " [ 20 ] .
Obviously it 's Oxford 's determination that is binding , not Simonyi's ( even though the Simonyi page is hosted at Oxford ) , but it 's interesting nonetheless .
Again according to Oxford itself , Dawkins received the title of Professor of the Public Understanding of Science in 1996 , not 1995 .
That raises the question of what he was in 1995 .
The Oxford statement clearly states that in 1995 , he was the Charles Simonyi Reader .
According to the regulations of Oxford , cited here [ 21 ] .
a reader is qualified to hold the title of Professorial Fellow ( but does not hold it automatically , if I understand correctly ) .
If Dawkins went through this process , then in 1995 he would have been Professorial Fellow and Charles Simonyi Reader .
There is some debate about the honorary nature of Dawkins 's professorial fellowship .
The claim is that a " Professorial Fellow is like an honorary professor , " and the evidence cited is from Swinburne University in Australia .
I have seen no specific evidence to show that Oxford follows Swinburne 's policies , or that Swinburne follows Oxford's .
In any event , the titles listed from Swinburne are not all honorary ( adjunct and visiting professors are not honorary , for example ) .
So even if Swinburne 's policies are relevant , it 's not clear that they treat a " professorial fellowship " as " honorary - type . "
Nor is it clear that the titles are temporary ( " professor emeritus " is not temporary , for instance ) .
In any event , both the titles of " Reader " and " Professor " are clearly based on merit and peer review at Oxford ( see here : [ 22 ] ) .
Nobody disputes that Dawkins has held the title of " Reader , " and therefore it is clear that he has held a peer - reviewed academic position .
If he does hold the title of " Professor , " and I think it 's clear from Oxford 's statement that he does , then that is a peer - reviewed title as well .
There is also some debate about his position at the Museum of Natural History .
From the above evidence , it seems clear that Oxford did grant Dawkins the title of professor .
Dawkins has written the following : " I made a special request that , like several other tenured faculty members of the Department of Zoology , my professorship should be administered through the Museum of Natural History ... all of whose senior Curators are tenured members of the faculty of Oxford University , holding joint appointments with Departments such as Zoology and Geology . " [ 23 ]
If this is true , and it would be nice to have independent confirmation of it , then it seems clear that his position at the Museum does not preclude his holding a professorship at Oxford .
If this summary is correct , then the following changes should ( I think ) be made .
Given the dispute over these issues , I have not made them and am instead waiting for discussion .
The special terms of this gift allowed Richard Dawkins to bypass the peer review promotion process customarily required before receiving the title of " professor " .
This sentence should be stricken as incorrect .
In other words , the gift establishes an endowment for future professors , but is held initially as a " post " by Dawkins who was apparently never subjected to the full peer review election process specified in the endowment .
Strike everything after " Dawkins " as incorrect .
when in fact Dawkins ' position is at the Museum of Natural History , an institution merely owned by the University of Oxford .
Strike as incorrect , or else note that confirmation is required .
The title " professor " is misleading , if not fraudulent , as the position donated for his benefit does not satisfy the Merriam - Webster definition of " professor " : " a faculty member of the highest academic rank at an institution of higher education . "
Strike as incorrect and possibly libellous .
Richard Dawkins admitted to several key facts above , Specify which .
If we are accusing a man of error or dishonesty , we must be precise in our accusations .
However , Dawkins was silent on the central characterization above that his online resume is misleading in stating that he is a professor of Oxford University rather than holding a position donated for his benefit which is called a professorship at a museum .
Strike as incorrect .
He was not silent on the issue and he is a professor at Oxford .
As noted above , I am happy to entertain debate on these issues .
Reaganetics 13:49 , 28 November 2007 ( EST )
I have a few other questions to add to the above .
The article seems to draw a distinction between a " post " and a " professorship . "
Given that a professorship is a kind of post , what is the relevance of this distinction , especially given the evidence that Dawkins does hold a professorship ?
Michael W. DeLashmutt of the University of Glasgow described the " post " as being a " Chair " , not a professorship ...
Same as previous .
In addition , a chair may be a kind of professorship , so this utility of this distinction is not obvious .
Leading universities do not permit the " buying " of a professorship for someone .
No references are provided , and this seems untrue or irrelevant given the above evidence .
As of October 5 , 2007 , the Oxford University 's Zoology Department lists the status of Richard Dawkins status as " other " rather than as " academic " . [ 11 ]
The link no longer works and its relevance is unclear anyway .
I suggest removing it .
Reaganetics 13:57 , 28 November 2007 ( EST )
With respect to the Swinburne regulations , I 'd like to add , that the quoted section refers to persons not employed by Swinburne .
At Swinburne academic promotions for persons employed by the University are covered by the HR regulations [ 24 ] .
A level E position at Australian University is equivalent to a full professor .
Of course any of the Swinburne regulations are irrelevant , since it is not Oxford .

Errors in the article
“ in fact Dawkins ' position is at the Museum of Natural History , an institution merely owned by the University of Oxford . ” Incorrect .
Dawkins is based in both the Zoology Department and the Continuing Education Departments at Oxford .
Dawkins ' " position " is the source of his paycheck , and the statement is correct as to his " position " .
Whatever honorary , unusual , disclaimed or non-salaried titles Dawkins ' may also hold is a different ( and uninteresting ) matter .
-- Aschlafly 11:18 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
Aschlafly , Dawkins ' position ' is in the Zoology and Continuing Education Departments , as has been pointed out repeatedly , and confirmed by Oxford University in both their Calendar and their FOI response .
OurMike 11:33 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
As I explained , the " position " obviously refers to the source of his paycheck , and that is the Simonyi gift .
-- Aschlafly 12:01 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
Indeed .
And as I explained , that “ position ” is based in the Zoology and Continuing Education Departments .
See [ 25 ] where the General Board of the Faculties confirms this appointment from 1995 until the retiring age , and its location in the Biology and the Continuing Education faculties .
OurMike 13:42 , 2 January 2008 ( EST )
“ The title " professor " is misleading , if not fraudulent , as the position donated for his benefit does not satisfy the Merriam - Webster definition of " professor " : " a faculty member of the highest academic rank at an institution of higher education . "
Incorrect .
The Charles Simonyi Readership may not qualify as a professorship ( though it is of roughly equal rank to an Associate or Full professor in the US ) , however Oxford have confirmed that Dawkins subsequently had the title of Professor conferred in 1996 .
They also confirmed he is a member of both the Zoology and the Continuing Education Departments .
He is therefore a faculty member of the highest academic rank at an institution of higher education , and meets both the Merriam - Webster and the Oxford University definition of “ professor ” .
Dawkins calls himself the " Charles Simonyi Professor , " [ 26 ] and it has already been amply demonstrated here ( and even admitted by yourself below ) that such title is false and thereby misleading .
-- Aschlafly 11:18 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
Then it needs to be clarified in the article that it is the Charles Simonyi Professorship title that is misleading .
As it stands the article implies - wrongly - that Dawkins does not hold the title of Professor .
It has already been amply demonstrated here that he does .
OurMike 11:33 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
No , Dawkins ' resume claims he became " professor " in 1995 , and so Dawkins himself may not be referring to unusual and perhaps honorary titles given to him 1996 .-- Aschlafly 12:01 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
Dawkins resume does , and it ’s wrong .
My point is that Oxford University refers to him as a professor from 1996 , so he does indeed hold the title .
The article should clarify that Dawkins statement is wrong , but that he does still hold a professorial title from Oxford .
OurMike 13:42 , 2 January 2008 ( EST )
“ his online resume is misleading in stating that he is a professor of Oxford University rather than holding a position donated for his benefit which is called a professorship at a museum . ”
Incorrect .
While Dawkins ’ resume is misleading in stating that he is the Charles Simonyi Professor , Dawkins does legitimately hold the title of Professor of the Public Understanding of Science , which was properly conferred by the University in 1996 after peer review .
No , we 've discussed this at length and the 1996 title was limited by an extraordinary disclaimer suggesting to me a lack of customary peer review .
Moreover , the 1996 title appears to me to have been merely a non-paying , or quasi- honorary , professorship .
-- Aschlafly 11:18 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
Aschlafly , yet you provide not one iota of evidence for this assertion , and not one iota of evidence that counters the very explicit and unambiguous assertion from Oxford University that the 1996 title was NOT limited by the prefaratory note , did NOT undergo any changes , and was awarded PROPERLY ( e.g. via peer review ) .
There really is absolutely no basis for your repeated assertions that the 1996 title is in some way questionable .
OurMike 11:33 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
I am not aware of Oxford explaining its disclaimer or stating that the title was the basis of full peer review .
All the evidence that I see is to the contrary .
-- Aschlafly 12:01 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
Aschlafly , we have discussed at some length already the FOI response from Oxford in which they stated “ the title of Professor was properly conferred on Dr Dawkins in the first recognition of distinction exercise in 1996 ...
No changes were made to the academic subject area of this title .
Had any changes been made ( which they were not ) they would not have invalidated the holding of the title of Professor ...
Professor Dawkins still legitimately holds the title of Professor . ”
In addition I ’ve pointed you to the detailed peer review process used in the recognition of distinction exercises , so I do n’t know why you are now claiming you have seen no evidence .
Can you please provide your evidence that Oxford are wrong in their response to the FOI request ?
OurMike 13:42 , 2 January 2008 ( EST )
The bottom line is that I see no basis for changing this entry .
If , however , you wish to suggest an unbiased change that fully admits the falsehoods in the professorship claim as well as the unusual and questionable nature of the 1996 title , then we 'd certainly consider it .
However , I strongly suggest compliance with our rules here before posting further .
-- Aschlafly 11:18 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
My suggestion would be to simply replace the entire first section with the following : " Richard Dawkins is currently the Charles Simonyi Reader and Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University .
Dawkins claims on his CV that he is the Charles Simonyi Professor - a statutory professorial position at Oxford .
In fact he does not hold the statutory professorship , rather he holds a standard ' Title of Distinction ' , which is the more common method by which Oxford confers professorial status onto its academics . "
OurMike 11:33 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
Your replacement is completely unacceptable because it downplays the nature of the position and the misleading claim on Dawkins ' resume .
For 25 years Dawkins taught at Oxford without being promoted to a professorship and then a " post " was purchased for him by a wealthy supporter .
That 's not a real professorship in any real sense of the word .
I 'm moving on to other issues and suggest you do some helpful edits to other entries here before wasting more time on this .
-- Aschlafly 12:01 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
I ’m not sure what the relevance of the 25 years is to the genuineness of his professorial title - according to Conservapedia C.S. Lewis was at Oxford for 29 years before becoming a professor .
Does this disqualify Lewis ?
In any case Dawkins ’ readership ‘ post ’ is NOT the professorship .
I thought that point had already been cleared up many weeks ago .
The professorship was separate .
It was not “ bought ” by a wealthy donor , it was awarded by the University , in a Recognition of Distinction exercise , carried out in 1996 .
The vast majority of professorships conferred by Oxford since 1996 have been through identical annual , peer - reviewed exercises .
If you do not agree that such titles are “ real ” professorships then you are saying that the vast majority of ‘ professors ’ listed in Oxford University ’s calendar ( including , for example , Alister McGrath , quoted approvingly in the article ) are not in fact real professors .
Would you like me to start making helpful edits on the McGrath page , pointing out his misleading and potentially fraudulent title ?
OurMike 13:42 , 2 January 2008 ( EST )
Further Freedom of Information response from Oxford University
Aschlafly ,
I see that the article has not been updated , and that there have been no further discussions on this page for some time .
I ’m assuming then , that you still stick by your assertions on this and previous talk pages that the title of Professor was not properly conferred on Dawkins in 1996 .
As I understand it , your argument is that the prefaratory note on the Gazette notice ( “ in a small number of cases the precise academic subject area in which the title is held is still under discussion .
Any changes will be published separately when agreed ” [ 27 ] ) likely refers to Dawkins , and that because no further notices were published the title was not conferred .
You stated earlier : “ all three of you above misread the disclaimer on the title ...[ it ] is clear that in certain cases -- most likely Dawkins ' -- the subject area for the title " is still under discussion . "
That language indicates that there was no agreement , and still is n't .
That 's not a real professorship .
One ca n't be a " Professor of fill - in - the - blank . " ” and later “ Oxford said it conferred a title subject to an agreement to confer the title in a meaningful way , and said no more .
The title does not exist in a meaningful way . ”
In order to resolve this point I have filed a second Freedom of Information request with Oxford University , directing them specifically to the Gazette notice and its prefaratory note , and asking them whether this means the title was not properly conferred on Dawkins ; whether there were any changes to his academic subject area ; whether Dawkins currently holds the title ; and if he does , which academic departments he is currently associated with .
A Freedom of Information request – as I ’ve noted before – is binding on institutes of higher education in the UK as a result of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 [ 28 ] , and the University is legally obliged to provide accurate and truthful information [ 29 ] .
Oxford ’s official response on 11th December was as follows :
Thank you for your request for the above information .
a .
I confirm that the title of Professor was properly conferred on Dr Dawkins in the first recognition of distinction exercise in 1996 .
b.
No changes were made to the academic subject area of this title .
Had any changes been made ( which they were not ) they would not have invalidated the holding of the title of Professor .
c. Professor Dawkins still legitimately holds the title of Professor .
He is associated with the Departments of Zoology and Continuing Education .
Happy to provide a copy of the email if you wish .
Given the above there can now be no doubt that Dawkins does legitimately hold , from Oxford University , the peer reviewed [ 30 ] title of Professor of the Public Understanding of Science [ 31 ] , and that this was conferred in 1996 .
I think therefore that Reagentics suggestions for changes to the article should be carried out .
OurMike 13:20 , 12 December 2007 ( EST )
( removed silly rant [ 32 ] )
OurMike , I appreciate your diligence on this , and I do not have any ax to grind here .
But I also do not see any errors in the entry , and the responses to your FOIA request are simply too general to be helpful .
Did the unusual disclaimer on the announcement apply to Dawkins ' position ?
I 'm confident it did .
Given that the Simonyi award came first , was Dawkins subjected to real peer review ?
I doubt it .
But if yes , what was that peer review process ?
Rather than providing substantive answers , the clerk at Oxford is simply repeating what is in its literature , and we 've already identified issues with that .
-- Aschlafly 13:41 , 12 December 2007 ( EST )
Aschlafly , let me address your points in turn : 1 . The errors in the article ( and suggestions for changes ) have been pointed out in considerable detail by Reaganetics in this section of the talk page .
2 . Oxford ’s formal response was extremely precise .
It unambiguously confirms that Dawkins had the title of Professor conferred in 1996 , that the title was conferred properly , and that he still holds that title .
3 . Oxford 's reply confirms that the prefaratory note - whoever it may refer to - is not relevant to whether the title was properly conferred - " Had any changes been made ( which they were not ) they would not have invalidated the holding of the title of Professor . "
4 . The Simonyi award gave Dawkins the position of Reader in 1995 , as we have already established .
The title of Professor of the Public Understanding of Science is separate and distinct .
Oxford University ’s Calendar makes it clear that he holds both titles , referring to him as the ‘ Charles Simonyi Reader and Professor for the Public Understanding of Science ’ .
5 . Why do you doubt that Dawkins was subjected to real peer review ?
Oxford confirmed that the title was conferred “ properly ” , and Oxford ’s regulations are clear on what process must be followed for the proper conferment of a title .
This includes peer review – you can see the details in the link I provided above , but here it is again : [ 33 ] .
6 . What “ issues ” have we identified with Oxford University ’s literature ?
Are you now asserting that the University does not itself know if it has awarded a title to its own members of staff ?
If Oxford University is itself not qualified to respond to the question of who holds the title of Professor at Oxford University , then who is ?
OurMike 14:25 , 12 December 2007 ( EST )
OurMike , I do n't want to this run in circles again and consume your time and mine .
I 'll be succinct in responding :
1 . I glanced at his alleged " errors " and found little more claims that a statement was not relevant .
That 's for readers to decide .
I see no " errors " .
Quote something specific for me if you can .
2 . The clerk did not address the disclaimer , and whether real peer review occurred .
3 . The generic , boilerplate response is not helpful .
4 . The Simonyi position is a " post " , not a professorship as has been stated on Dawkins ' resume .
5 . Dawkins received the post first and the professorship , if given at all , appears to me to have been honorary rather than the result of a bona fide peer review .
6 . The clerk appears merely to be repeating the incomplete information that Oxford has already provided , without explaining the disclaimer and the other aspects of this issue .
7 . How about this : quote Dawkins ' resume very specifically in your question to Oxford , and ask them to explain it in a satisfactory manner .
-- Aschlafly 18:25 , 12 December 2007 ( EST )
Aschlafly , Very well .
Specific errors listed above .
Oxford University ’s Information Officer ( responsible for coordinating all FOI responses ) did address the prefaratory note , when they stated categorically that “ no changes were made to the academic subject area of this title .
Had any changes been made ( which they were not ) they would not have invalidated the holding of the title of Professor . ”
I specifically pointed them to the prefaratory note , and they were legally obliged to provide full disclosure in their response .
Their answer can not be clearer .
Oxford also addressed whether real peer review had occurred when they stated that the professorship had been awarded “ properly ” .
However it may appear to you , Oxford ’s regulations are absolutely clear that such titles are only awarded after a process of peer review both by faculty or inter-faculty boards and by the senior Distinctions Committee itself ( headed by the University ’s Vice Chancellor ) .
You have provided no evidence that Dawkins somehow sidestepped the peer review process for this title .
You argue that Oxford are “ merely ... repeating the incomplete information that Oxford has already provided ” yet that information has been complete and consistent from the start .
The Calendar , the Gazette , and their FOI responses all agree that Dawkins was awarded a Readership from the Simonyi endowment [ 34 ] , and subsequently had the title of Professor conferred in 1996 [ 35 ] .
He now holds the title of Charles Simonyi Reader , and Professor of the Public Understanding of Science , and is a member of both the Zoology and Continuing Education Departments .
Dawkins ’ resume is wrong , and Oxford have already made that clear – he does not hold the statutory Simonyi professorship , and he became a professor in 1996 not 1995 .
Dawkins ’ CV is not in any case their responsibility .
However Oxford are , by definition , the ultimate authority on whether or not the title of Professor of the Public Understanding of Science was properly conferred by them in 1996 , and they have repeatedly confirmed that it was .

The God Delusion
Has anyone here actually read this book from cover to cover ?
Ajkgordon 16:46 , 16 December 2007 ( EST )
How many atheists do you think have read most of the Bible ?
-- Aschlafly 17:01 , 16 December 2007 ( EST )
Almost all the atheists I know have read most if not all the Bible .
But I 'm not sure what that has to do with my question above .
Ajkgordon 17:11 , 16 December 2007 ( EST )
Really ???
That would surprise me .
I do n't think that is true about the teenage and college - student atheists .
-- Aschlafly 18:24 , 16 December 2007 ( EST )
Actually I should qualify that .
Almost all the people I know to be atheists have read most if not all the Bible .
I know lots of people many of whose religious beliefs or lack of I have not the faintest clue .
So I may know lots of atheists who have not read the Bible .
I certainly know lots of Muslims , Jews and Buddists who probably have n't read the Bible .
But I still know a lot of people who I know to be atheists and who have definitely read it .
And certainly almost all teenagers and college students I know have read it too - that 's what you get when you send your children to Catholic school :)
But that still does n't answer my original question .
Anyone ?
Ajkgordon 07:46 , 17 December 2007 ( EST )
I can't answer the question because I do n't know if anyone here has read it !
I have n't , although I 'd like to if I had time , but I have quite a few things more important than that to spend my time on .
I do know someone who 's read it , a young Christian trainee palaeontologist , who says that it strengthened his faith — seeing how weak the arguments against Christianity are !
It would n't surprise me at all that a lot of atheists have read the Bible .
But I would n't be asking that question .
The God Delusion purports to be an argument against God .
The Bible is not an argument for God ; it presumes that God exists .
A better question is how many atheists have read a good apologetic for the Bible ( or for creationism ) .
As a creationist living in a largely - secular society , I read and hear lots of pro-evolutionary comment and argument , whether that be on nature documentaries , other TV shows , radio ( including the ABC's Science Show ) , newspapers , science magazines , etc .
Of course I also read plenty of creationist material .
But how many anti-creationists or atheists have read more than an absolute minimum of creationist material ?
Very few , in my experience , and I 've asked quite a few .
They generally avoid answering .
Philip J. Rayment 08:09 , 17 December 2007 ( EST )
But how do you know the arguments are weak if you have n't read it ?
Or is that a comment from your palaeontologist friend ?
I have n't read it either ( yet ) but I 'm interested in people 's views if they have read it especially if they criticise it .
I 'm also interested in similar books but from the other side , i.e. robust argument for a diety ( not McGrath ) .
Yes , I 'm not sure what the Bible has to do with anything !
Ajkgordon 08:15 , 17 December 2007 ( EST )
That was a comment from my friend .
Somebody who is going to argue against the Bible should have read it , but my point is that they should also have read defences of it .
Are you interested in published critiques of it ?
Here 's one .
Philip J. Rayment 08:31 , 17 December 2007 ( EST )
I presume you do n't subscribe to the Muslim faith .
Should you have read the Koran ? ;)
Thanks but I 'm not looking for a critique - they 're ten a penny .
I 'm looking for a book or books that logically demonstrate why a God must exist - in isolation from Dawkin 's The God Delusion or similar books from Harris or Hitchens .
Ajkgordon 08:46 , 17 December 2007 ( EST )
I have n't read the Koran , but I would if I was going to do much arguing against it .
Because I have n't , I do n't .
Arguments for God ?
There 's a brief argument ( part of one chapter ) here .
Philip J. Rayment 08:56 , 17 December 2007 ( EST ) Hmmmm ... a little weak , Philip .
There are plenty of atheists who do n't argue against the Bible - they just do n't believe in God .
But you would still argue that they should read the Bible because in effect they are arguing against it .
The same could be said for your disbelief in Islam or Buddism or Hinduism .
( I 'm just playing Devil 's Advocate , btw :)
Thanks for the link .
TBH , with all the quoting from the Bible it does n't look quite what I 'm after .
Saying that the Bible says that God exists is a bit too circular for my purposes , i.e. to find a standalone counterpoint to The God Delusion before reading it .
Ajkgordon 09:09 , 17 December 2007 ( EST )
No , I would not argue that they should read the Bible " because in effect they are arguing against it " .
I think they should read it because it 's true and that they should become Christians , but that 's an entirely different argument .
You are putting words in my mouth then criticising me for being inconsistent based on those fictional words .
You clearly did n't look at the link I gave you very well , because ( a ) it does n't have circular arguments ( you 've jumped to conclusions there ; you might as well say that someone should n't read the Origin of Species to find out the reasons for evolution because it says that evolution exists ! ) and ( b ) you clearly did n't see the appendix to that chapter , " Non-Biblical evidence for the Creator God of the Bible " .
Philip J. Rayment 09:16 , 17 December 2007 ( EST )
Alright , calm down , mate .
I should have phrased it better perhaps by saying " would n't you ? " at the end .
But the point is you still believe that atheists are wrong partly because they have n't read the Bible .
No matter .
Yes , I did n't read your link fully ( I 'm at work and do n't have time ) - I only skimmed it .
But it does have five Biblical references is the first three short paragraphs .
Yes , I saw there is a section on non-Biblical evidence .
But I notice that it seems to be refuting an old universe , evolution , etc. rather than simply arguing the case for God .
That 's perilously close to God - Of - The - Gaps .
But thanks , I will read it properly .
Ajkgordon 09:29 , 17 December 2007 ( EST )
I believe atheists are wrong because they believe that no god exists , when He actually does exist .
So what that it has biblical references ?
If you are going to find out about God , surely the Bible is one of the primary sources ?
The arguments are not god - of - the - gaps arguments , but positive arguments from what is known .
Philip J. Rayment 18:03 , 17 December 2007 ( EST )
<----
I do n't particularly want to find out about God , ( at least not for the purposes of this exercise ) .
I want to find out about the arguments for the existence of God in contrast to Dawkins ' book which presents the arguments for the non-existence of God .
The excerpt you pointed me to does n't do it , I 'm afraid .
While it was very kind of you to present me with the material , I find an argument for the existence of God relying primarily on what are essentially " Look , it says so in the Bible " statements not especially convincing .
I 'm also aware of the traditional arguments such as the ontological , moral , cosmological , and anthropic ones - arguments that stand or fall by themselves without recourse to the Bible .
What I 'm after , I suppose , is a foil to Dawkins ' book that could offer a decent logical counterpoint to someone who 's never contemplated matters of religion or God .
Someone suffering deep amnesia or one of those lost children growing up in the jungle by himself .
In that case , references to the Bible would be meaningless .
And McGrath 's work is simply a rebuttal of Dawkins , so again , not what I 'm looking for .
Do you see what I mean ?
Ajkgordon 09:48 , 18 December 2007 ( EST )
I see what you mean up to a point , but ...
I understand the distinction between finding out about God and finding arguments for His existence .
My point was that a book that tells you about God is highly likely to provide evidence for his existence .
I still maintain , however , that calling them '" Look , it says so in the Bible " statements ' is a mischaracterisation .
What you are essentially doing is asking for arguments for God 's existence yet arbitrarily excluding some of those arguments because they refer to the Bible .
You are excluding arguments that refer to the Bible .
You are apparently excluding some arguments that do not refer to the Bible .
That does n't really leave much room for anything else , unless perhaps you are looking for specific answers to Dawkins ' specific arguments , but if that 's what you wanted I figure you would have clearly said so .
Why would the Bible be meaningless to someone suffering amnesia , etc . ?
Taking that line of thinking to it 's logical conclusion could exclude any encyclopedia , any ancient document , any newspaper , book , or magazine , etc .
If the person is that ignorant , you simply have to explain some of these things .
So why not explain what the Bible is also ?
Philip J. Rayment 02:32 , 19 December 2007 ( EST ) <----
But anyway , this gets us even further from my original question .
Has anyone here read Dawkins ' book in its entirety ?
Ajkgordon 09:48 , 18 December 2007 ( EST )
I 've read it , but I somehow doubt your question was guided at me .-- British_cons ( talk ) 14:17 , 18 December 2007 ( EST )
You 'll do :)
What did you think ?
Was it hysterical as has been suggested ?
Was it sarcastic ( I can guess that it was ) ?
Does it produce good arguments for the non-existence of God or is it simply a sneery put - down to the rise of fundamentalism ?
Was it simply preaching to the converted or could it " raise consciousness " among believers ?
Can you recommend an opposing book that argues for the existence of God on its own merit without simply rebutting Dawkins or quoting the Bible ?
Thanks .
Ajkgordon 16:09 , 18 December 2007 ( EST )
Three books made me an atheist Brief history of time , Koran and the christian Bible .
— The preceding unsigned comment was added by JBuscombe ( talk )
Was it hysterical ?
I did n't think so .
I thought it was well argued .
Was it sarcastic ?
In places , most certainly .
Does it produce good arguments for the non-existence of God or is it simply a sneery put - down to the rise of fundamentalism ?
That 's really a value judgment .
Actually Dawkins does n't say in the book that God does n't exist - he only points out that his existence is wildly improbable .
He does however take some time disposing of the " proofs " of God 's existence .
Was it simply preaching to the converted or could it " raise consciousness " among believers ?
He explicitly states that his objective was consciousness raising .
I think it would work for both audiences .
Can you recommend an opposing book that argues for the existence of God on its own merit without simply rebutting Dawkins or quoting the Bible ?
Sorry , can't think of one .
Hope you get other responses for others who have read the book .-- British_cons ( talk ) 16:10 , 19 December 2007 ( EST ) Ta. Ajkgordon 08:11 , 20 December 2007 ( EST )
Unlocking
Aschlafly , any chance of you unlocking this article any time soon so that the errors can be corrected ?
OurMike 10:42 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
OurMike , I 've been extremely patient with your comments and rule violations here .
Your last 33 edits have been talk , talk , talk , which may hold the all - time record .
Usually such rule violators are blocked much earlier than that .
The entry here has no identified errors .
Conservapedia exists to tell the truth and will not compromise its purpose to mollify those made uncomfortable by it .
The entry tells the truth .
I suggest you comply with our rules and improve the encyclopedia here before wasting more time on your discomfort with the insights in this particular entry .
Godspeed for the New Year .-- Aschlafly 10:47 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
Aschlafly , I identified three very specific errors in the article here and made a list of them eariler in this talk page - see Talk : Richard_Dawkins #Errors_in_the_article .
You asked me to do this earlier in our discussion but then failed to respond to them .
I have taken considerable pains to try to alert you to the factual errors in this article , and provide you with clear and unambiguous evidence which would improve the glaring inaccuracy in this entry .
Unfortunately I 'm unable to make any improvements to this particular article due to it being locked .
OurMike 10:57 , 1 January 2008 ( EST ) ... actually , it is unlocked ...
-- JakeC 11:04 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
Good lord , so it is .
My mistake .
OurMike 11:05 , 1 January 2008 ( EST )
Reversion explained
Order 's second edit introduced a redundancy ; his first was imprecise .
-- Aschlafly 21:22 , 3 January 2008 ( EST )
First , it is a particular museum of natural history .
Not sure if the future entry Museum of Natural History will be specifically the Oxford museum , or an entry on any museum of natural history .
In the latter case it should n't be capitalized .
Either way , the Oxford musea ( Pittrivers and Natural History ) are part of the university , not owned by it .
Oxford has a structure that is different from most other universities in the world ( with an exception of Cambridge , maybe ) .
Second , what is imprecise about " endowed position " ?
Order 21:37 , 3 January 2008 ( EST )
Reversion unexplained
Were you intending to do me the courtesy of explaining your reversion of my edit ?
-- GDewey 16:58 , 4 January 2008 ( EST )
Your changes added at least one error , deleted information , and changed numerous things .
I do n't have time to explain all the flaws now .
For starters , you claimed he became a professor after spending 2 years at Berkeley !-- Aschlafly 17:28 , 4 January 2008 ( EST )
I 'll take that as a no , shall I ? -- GDewey 20:09 , 4 January 2008 ( EST ) P.S.
You are , of course , entirely wrong .
My edit was correct .
I can only assume that the real reason that you " do n't have time to explain all the flaws " is because there were n't any .
-- GDewey 17:09 , 6 January 2008 ( EST )
Tidy up
This article needs a tidy up .
It seems to me rather messy and does n't have a particularly logical flow .
I wo n't comment on the potentially slanderous and inaccurate claims of the " misleading " and " fraudulent " aspects of Dawkins ' professorship - the arguments for deletion of that particular part of this article have been raked over many times and the author(s ) of those remarks are unlikely to be swayed .
I suggest , however , that it is structured better and I suggest the following .
Intro : status as populariser of science , champion of Darwinism , confrontational anti-theist .
Early life , education , early career .
Major books and other works and the controversy they have created .
However , the article should describe what the books are about rather than simply listing criticisms of them .
Criticisms of Dawkins ' opinions and work from religious apologists .
Criticisms of Dawkins ' opinions and work from other scientists .
Most of the content would stay but just be re-ordered and re-worded where necessary .
It would make the article much more readable .
Ajkgordon 11:20 , 7 January 2008 ( EST )
Oh , and pictures of his critics all over the place are distracting and not especially helpful .
Ajkgordon 12:43 , 7 January 2008 ( EST )
Your reorganization would introduce placement bias by pushing criticisms out of view for most readers .
Often you see that on Wikipedia , where the misleading stuff goes first and the truth is pushed way , way down and out of sight until the end .
-- Aschlafly 12:58 , 7 January 2008 ( EST )
Not at all .
The intro itself should cover the major controversies and criticisms as , certainly from this site 's perspective , they form much of his defining characteristics .
Then more controversy in the second section after the intro , ( I can't see there would be any controversy of his early life , education and early career but that section would be and is pretty short ) , and further controversy in the remaining sections I listed .
No , the article could remain as critical of Dawkins as it is now but would become much more readable .
Ajkgordon 13:05 , 7 January 2008 ( EST )
To Clarify This Whole Mess
As there still seems to be some questionmark , in some people 's minds , over the legitimacy of Richard Dawkins ' professorship ' , this seems to indicate that Oxford University considers the post of the Charles Simonyi Chair in the Public Understanding of Science a ' professorship ' , and that Richard Dawkins holds it .
Now , unless someone here is basically saying they are more qualified than Oxford University itself as to what does or does not constitute a ' professorship ' , then that seems to be the end of the matter , and the article should be corrected , unless this site wants to leave itself open to accusations of the same kind of bias and ineptitude it accuses Wikipedia of .
Zmidponk 22:05 , 25 January 2008 ( EST )
Oxford University might think he 's a professor , but does Merriam - Webster ?
Feebasfactor 22:27 , 25 January 2008 ( EST )
If you read the archives of this talk page you will see that Merriam - Webster does indeed think that Dawkins is a professor .
-- GDewey 22:32 , 25 January 2008 ( EST )
Yes , I wrote to Merriam - Webster and they replied specifically stating they consider him to fulfil their definition of Professor .
But when I posted that here the response was " How would Merriam - Webster know ? " -- British_cons ( talk ) 13:54 , 26 January 2008 ( EST )
Ah , but what about the disclaimer on this page ?
It could apply to Dawkins , could it not ?
Feebasfactor 22:47 , 25 January 2008 ( EST )
Again , there has been previous discussion .
The simple answer , however , is that even if the disclaimer does apply , it only relates to " ... the precise academic subject area in which the title is held ... " .
It does not indicate that any individual referred to as " professor " ( or whatever other title ) might lose that title .
The fact that the libelous portion of the article has remained ( notwithstanding edits made by me and others ) is a stain on the reputation of this site .
-- GDewey 22:55 , 25 January 2008 ( EST )
It is undeniable , however , that there is no direct documentation confirming Dawkins ever passed through the peer review process required for professorship ; that can only be inferred from other documents under the a priori assumption he is a truly legitimate professor .
Feebasfactor 23:02 , 25 January 2008 ( EST )
No direct documentation ?
You know that ?
For crying out loud , Oxford says that he is a professor .
If you have some proof to the contrary please post it .
Put us all out of our misery .
-- GDewey 23:16 , 25 January 2008 ( EST )
Given that the distinction committee gave him the title , we have to assume that he holds the title legally .
Unless you have proof that someone exceeded its authority , Feebas .
Do you have such evidence ?
Order 08:57 , 26 January 2008 ( EST )
None .
But Please do n't shoot the messenger .
Feebasfactor 17:09 , 26 January 2008 ( EST )
Just because he has made himself look foolish does n't mean that you have to also .
-- GDewey 17:19 , 26 January 2008 ( EST )
Well , it was an interesting exercise in playing Devil 's Andy 's Advocate , and it nicely showed just how hilariously senseless the long - term discussion up to this point has been .
Here 's the thing :
On CP , Andy alone decides what truth is and what counts as evidence .
And Andy decided that no matter what Oxford or M - W say , Dawkins is not a real professor .
You can compare this to the Gun Control discussions .
Or to the discussion about JKR ( Main Page talk ) .
Or the discussion about drugs .
Or the Pulitzer Prize .
It 's the same issue over and over again .
No matter how much evidence you find , no matter how completely you blast Andy's " arguments " out of the water , no matter how much you question his made - up " obvious " statistics , no matter how much you dispute his " indisputable " conclusions , you can't prevent Andy from pushing his agenda .
Period .
This article is lost .
Andy has spoken .
Give it up already .
Go on , edit something else ... and pray that Andy does n't decide to " improve " the article you worked on .
Or even better , go to Wikipedia .
They do n't have night - time editing restrictions " rights " , they do n't have image upload restrictions " rights " , and nobody threatens to ban you just because you did n't fulfill some completely arbitrary ( and ever - changing ) productivity ratio .
-- Jenkins 18:12 , 26 January 2008 ( EST )
Jenkins , I see that you violated our 90/10 rule against talk , talk , talk , and I also see that you 've been blocked , so I wo n't belabor the point .
Yes , those more interested in talk than substance should go elsewhere .
Maybe Wikipedia welcomes endless talk .
We want substance here .-- Aschlafly 20:50 , 28 January 2008 ( EST )
In that case , YOU provide ' substance ' that backs up YOUR assertation that Dawkins is NOT a professor .
Merriam - Webster , the very people quoted as defining ' professor ' in a way that Dawkins does not fit , flatly disagrees with you .
Oxford University flatly disagrees with you .
In sh
Ambergris is often smoothed by the ocean ( Image : ambergris.co.nz )
Leon Wright and his wife took home a 14.75 kg lump of ambergris , found in the innards of sperm whales and used in perfumes after it has been vomited up .
Sought after because of its rarity , ambergris can float on the ocean for years before washing ashore .
Worth up to $ 20 a gram , Mr Wright 's find on a South Australian beach could net his family US $ 295,000 ( £ 165,300 ) .
At first , Mr Wright and his wife Loralee left the strange lump on the beach where it was found .
However , two weeks later the couple returned to Streaky Bay and found it still lying there .
Floating gold
Curious , Mrs Wright persuaded her husband to take it home .
AMBERGRIS FACTS
Found in warm water oceans around the world Bile secreted by sperm whales as a digestion aid Solidifies and floats on water , sometimes for years Used in perfumes , medicines , flavourings Banned in US under endangered species legislation
" I immediately decided it was ambergris - it could n't be anything else , " Mr Jury told Australia 's ABC radio .
Mythologised for thousands of years , ambergris has been referred to as " floating gold " by scientists and scavengers who long for a windfall amid the surf .
Expelled from the abdomen of the giant sperm whale , often while hundreds of kilometres away from land , ambergris is a natural excrement thought to be used by the whale as a digestion aid .
The hard beaks of giant squid , a main source of food for the whale , have often been found inside lumps of ambergris .
Initially , ambergris is a soft , foul - smelling waste matter that floats on the ocean .
But years of exposure to the sun and the salt water of the ocean transform the waste into a smooth , exotic lump of compact rock that boasts a waxy feel and a sweet , alluring smell .
" It 's quite remarkable when you think about it , because when the whale throws this out , it 's discarded material that they can't digest , " Mr Jury explained .
" [ But ] after 10 years , it 's considered clean and all you 're getting then is the wonderful musky , very sweet perfume , which I 've got to say is ultra smooth - it 's unbelievable . "
