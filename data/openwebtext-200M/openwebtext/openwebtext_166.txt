Yesterday , Mr Canfora , who was among the nine students wounded on that day , demanded a new investigation into the shootings at Kent State in Ohio , saying it was time to settle conclusively what led the contingent of National Guard troops to open fire on unarmed student protesters .
" There has been a 37 - year cover - up at Kent State .
The commanding officers have long denied there was a verbal command to fire .
They put the blame on the triggermen , " Mr Canfora told the Guardian .
He said he wants the FBI to use new technology to analyse the recording .
He also said he planned to post an audio clip of the recording on two websites .
Mr Canfora , who was 21 years old at the time of the shootings , was barely 60 metres away from the Guards when they opened fire .
He was shot in the wrist .
" They stopped , turned , raised the weapons , began to shoot and continued to shoot for 13 seconds , " he said .
" It was like a firing squad . "
His life was transformed by the events that day .
One of his friends was among the dead , and he has devoted much of his time over the last 37 years trying to bring the Ohio National Guard and the federal authorities to account for the killings .
The Guard has always claimed that no order was given to open fire , and there is speculation that the students were cut down after one of the troops panicked , triggering a volley of gunfire .
Although eight guardsmen were indicted , no one was ever prosecuted , and the episode exposed the deep disdain of the Nixon administration for dissenters .
The families of the 13 killed and wounded pursued a civil suit against the state governor and the National Guard , which was eventually settled out of court .
The materials from that civil suit were eventually stored in the archives at Yale University , where Mr Canfora recently rediscovered a 30 - minute recording of the protest .
The recording was made by a fellow student , Terry Strubbe , who placed an old - fashioned reel - to - reel tape recorder on the window sill of his dorm room , which overlooked the protests .
Mr Strubbe , who has declined to speak to reporters , still has the original recording in a bank safety deposit box .
However , a spokesman for Mr Strubbe , Joseph Bendo , told the Guardian yesterday he was unsure whether there were sounds of an order to open fire on the original recording .
" It was never heard on our version of the tape , but maybe nobody ever listened .
It 's unusual that nobody has heard it before in 37 years .
Other people have heard this tape in the past , and maybe they were n't listening for it , " he said .
But the power of America 's memories of that day are undeniable .
Nearly two generations after the shootings at Kent State , it now seems unthinkable that the National Guard could ever use live ammunition against students .
The events of that day were relived endlessly in shocking images of teenagers crouching over the corpses of their fellow students in the US heartland .
They also led to protests which radiated across the country , shutting down hundreds of college campuses , and forcing Richard Nixon to decamp Washington for Camp David .

Philosophy
On Love of Wisdom from Truth & Reality
..
My purpose therefore is , to try if I can discover what those principles are , which have introduced all that doubtfulness and uncertainty , those absurdities and contradictions into the several sects of philosophy ; insomuch that the wisest men have thought our ignorance incurable , conceiving it to arise from the natural dullness and limitation of our faculties .
( George Berkeley )
Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge : it is those who know little ,
not those who know much , who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science .
( Charles Darwin , Introduction to The Descent of Man , 1871 )
Introduction : The Problems of Philosophy
I have re-written this philosophy essay a number of times , trying to make it as short , simple and engaging as possible , while also explaining some fundamental truths about physical reality .
I hope it entertains you while also making you more aware of this importance of philosophy .
Of understanding the truth about our existence in the universe ( physical reality ) as the necessary foundations for wisdom in our thoughts and actions .
I believe our future survival depends upon this .
As David Hume wrote ( so elegantly ! ) ;
Accuracy is , in every case , advantageous to beauty , and just reasoning to delicate sentiment .
In vain would we exalt the one by depreciating the other .
...
And though the philosopher may live remote from business , the genius of philosophy , if carefully cultivated by several , must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society , and bestow a similar correctness on every art and calling .
The politician will acquire greater foresight and subtlety , in the subdividing and balancing of power ; the lawyer more method and finer principles in his reasoning ; and the general more regularity in his discipline , and more caution in his plans and operations .
( David Hume , 1737 )
Geoff Haselhurst
PS - I have recently written a letter to academic philosophers that anyone who enjoys philosophy will find very interesting !
And we have a great collection of philosophy quotes that I encourage everyone to read ( and think about ! )
" The historian of science may be tempted to exclaim that when paradigms change , the world itself changes with them . "
( T. S. Kuhn , The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , 1962 )
" The task is not so much to see what no one yet has seen , but to think what no body yet has thought about that which everyone sees .
...
But life is short , and truth works far and lives long : let us speak the truth . "
( Arthur Schopenhauer , 1818 )
Philosophy : On Truth and Reality
Summary :
The central problem of philosophy is most clearly explained by David Hume , the problem of causation and necessary connection .
If we do n't know how the many things we commonly experience are connected together then we do not know the source of truth .
At a fundamental level ( physics ) this problem of causal connection applies to how discrete and separate matter particles interact with one another across the universe ( space and time ) .
The solution is obvious .
Do n't describe an interconnected reality in terms of discrete and separate matter particles !
The obvious way to describe reality is the most simple way , that only one thing , space , exists , and matter is formed from waves in space .
i.e.
We simplify the metaphysical foundations of physics and philosophy from the motion of matter particles in space and time , to the wave motion of space that causes matter and time .
i.e. From a metaphysics of space and time to a metaphysics of space and motion .
It then becomes obvious that an electron is a spherical standing wave in space .
The wave center causes the particle effect , the spherical in and out waves interact with all other matter in the universe - which then solves this most profound problem of causation and necessary connexion .
This really is simple and obvious - the essay below explains this , and if you find it hard to picture a spherical standing wave then have a look at the Wave Diagrams page .
The Importance of Philosophy / Truth as the Source of Wisdom
Since philosophy is the art which teaches us how to live , and since children need to learn it as much as we do at other ages , why do we not instruct them in it ? ...
Oddly , things have now reached such a state that even among men of intelligence philosophy means something fantastical and vain , without value or usefulness , both in opinion and practice .
( Michel de Montaigne )
I realise that philosophy in our postmodern world is seen as something fanciful and vain , just a lot of ' philosophical ' nonsense that is irrelevant to daily life .
And as the Montaigne quote above shows , this has been the case for centuries .
Yet philosophy is simply the study of truth as the necessary foundation for acting wisely .
e.g .
It is unwise to dive into a pool of water unless we know the truth about its depth .
Likewise when we drive at night we use our headlights so that we know the truth about where the road leads .
The point is obvious - that knowing the truth about things is central to acting wisely and preventing harm - and this applies to everything we do on a daily basis .
The Failure of Philosophy to Know Truth and Reality
( The cure follows ! )
Given this importance of knowing the truth you would expect that philosophy is the most important subject for humanity to understand - yet clearly this is not the case .
Why ?
Because over the past 2,500 years since philosophy was first formalised no one has been able to work out the absolute truth about things - which requires true knowledge of reality .
We just have people 's opinions which invariable lead to conflict , confusion and harm .
So how can we work out what physical reality is , as the source of truth and wisdom ?
To begin we need to remove incorrect ideas that are leading us astray .
This then leads us to the correct foundations for describing reality as the source of absolute truth .
I will start with a nice experiment that you will hopefully relate to !
The Death of the Idealist Philosopher
Esse est percipi ( To be is to be perceived ) .
...
All the choir of heaven and furniture of earth - in a word , all those bodies which compose the frame of the world - have not any subsistence without a mind .
( George Berkeley )
Idealist philosophy believes that the mind exists , and that our sense of the external world ( physical reality ) is simply a construction of the mind .
Given that all our knowledge is in fact a creation of the mind ( imagination ) it has been difficult to refute this - to get from our ideas of things to the real thing in itself ( see Kant ) .
The experiment .
Imagine an idealist philosopher in an airplane at 30,000 feet .
A ten second timer is activated that will eject the ' philosopher ' from the plane .
They are wearing a parachute , but it is not fastened .
They must decide if they wish to fasten themselves to the parachute or not .
This eliminates idealist philosophers / philosophy - they either fasten the parachute and thus acknowledge the truth of physical reality - or they do not and fall to their death !
This argument is a bit mischievous , but it does make two important points - that the physical laws of Nature apply equally to humans as they do to all other matter - and while it is easy to be an idealist when writing essays , we should always apply these ideas to physical reality ( the ultimate determiner of truth ! ) .
The absolute argument against idealism is Darwinian evolution .
It is necessary that the physical reality of the earth and sun existed prior to our evolution , thus prior to our mind 's evolution .
There are many common traits of the human mind which confirm that we evolved as animals on the surface of the earth .
E.g .
We sleep , get hungry , seek pleasure , avoid pain , love others and lust for sexual reproduction .
Idealism does not explain this - evolving as sexually reproducing animals on the surface of the earth does .
Thus matter is a priori to mind .
Popper 's comments on idealism are pretty spot on ;
Denying realism amounts to megalomania ( the most widespread occupational disease of the professional philosopher ) .
( Karl Popper , 1975 )
The End of Postmodern Philosophy
( Logical Positivism , Cultural Constructs , Relativism )
Postmodern philosophy assumes that there is a physical reality but it is impossible for us to know it with our limited minds .
It is basically a position of skeptical doubt and uncertainty .
As Ernst Mach wrote ;
A piece of knowledge is never false or true - but only more or less biologically and evolutionary useful .
All dogmatic creeds are approximations : these approximations form a humus from which better approximations grow .
( Ernst Mach )
While this all sounds reasonable on the surface , with closer examinations we see that it leads us to the dogma of postmodernism that ' The only absolute truth is that there are no absolute truths ' .
i.e.
True knowledge of reality is impossible - we can only imagine things that do not exist , we cannot imagine things that really do exist !
( Which is odd when you think about it . )
Thus we see that the postmodern idea of no absolute truths is actually a contradiction , as Aristotle wrote 2,350 years ago ;
Finally , if nothing can be truly asserted , even the following claim would be false , the claim that there is no true assertion .
( Aristotle )
I recently read a philosophy joke that summarizes this problem of postmodern philosophy very well !
The First Law of Philosophy
For every philosopher , there exists an equal and opposite philosopher .
The Second Law of Philosophy
They 're both wrong .
While I admit this does make me smile , the truth is that this confusion and contradiction in philosophy ( that all is opinion ! ) does great damage to what is in fact a most beautiful and important subject .
This is not trivial as the problems of philosophy always manifest as problems for Humanity , and this largely explains why our modern world suffers such profound problems ( the destruction of Nature and resultant change in the Earth 's climate and ability to produce clean air , water , and food - which are clearly necessary for our future survival ) .
Again it is worth quoting Karl Popper .
In my opinion , the greatest scandal of philosophy is that , while all around us the world of nature perishes - and not the world of nature alone - philosophers continue to talk , sometimes cleverly and sometimes not , about the question of whether this world exists .
They get involved in scholasticism , in linguistic puzzles such as , for example , whether or not there are differences between ' being ' and ' existing ' .
( Popper , 1975 )
To summarise .
The central problem of postmodern Philosophy is to connect our incomplete senses of the world with the real world of what exists ( Kant 's thing in itself ) .
The problem is that we do not see the causal connection between things , only the effects which are representations of the mind and thus deceptive .
As David Hume elegantly explains ;
It must certainly be allowed , that nature has kept us at a great distance from all her secrets , and has afforded us only the knowledge of a few superficial qualities of objects ; while she conceals from us those powers and principles on which the influence of those objects entirely depends .
...
When we look about us towards external objects , and consider the operation of causes , we are never able , in a single instance , to discover any power or necessary connexion ; any quality , which binds the effect to the cause , and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other .
... experience only teaches us , how one event constantly follows another ; without instructing us in the secret connexion , which binds them together , and renders them inseparable .
( David Hume , 1737 )
See Hume 's Problem of Causation & Necessary Connection
So if we go back to our poor idealist philosopher free falling through space - we see the effects of this causal connection between the philosopher and the earth ( the philosopher falls with an accelerating velocity ) , but we do not see the causal / necessary connection .
We just give it a name , gravity , and then forget about it ( though I am sure the falling philosopher is starting to take gravity more seriously - the necessary connection between their body and the earth ! )
What is Truth ?
On Necessary Connection and Causation
We now need to make one important clarification about truth - which will then lead us to our solution .
One billion years ago the earth orbited the sun - thus there was a necessary connection between the earth and sun .
Yet at that time , before our human evolution , there were no truths .
Just physical reality abiding by its laws .
This is very important to realise , as libraries full of books have been written about truth - yet it is really just a concept that we make up ( humans like to create things ! ) .
In reality there is just necessary connection - this is the source of truth .
So for any statement you can always analyse it in terms of necessary connection .
Here are two simple examples of logical and empirical ' truths ' that found science .
Logical Truth :
We can create necessary connections through definitions / principles , e.g. 1+1 = 2 and 1+1+1= 3 thus 1+2 = 3 is true because of the necessary connections we created .
This relates to the axiomatic foundations of mathematics and principles in theoretical physics which are necessary foundations to deduce things from .
Logical truths are a priori ( necessary , certain and universal - anyone would deduce the same results ) .
Empirical Truth : " The current time on my computer is 5.30 am " is true if there is a necessary connection between my eyes and the light emitted from my computer showing this time .
Empirical truths are a posteriori ( uncertain , dependent on senses which can deceive us ) .
Summary :
To know the truth about things we need to know how they are necessarily connected .
Thus to know the truth about physical reality we need to know how matter exists and moves about in space in a necessarily connected way .
If we knew this then we would find that deductions from our theory of reality ( logical truths ) would match knowledge from our senses / experiments ( empirical truths ) .
The Problem of Induction
All arguments concerning existence are founded on the relation of cause and effect ; that our knowledge of that relation is derived entirely from experience ; and all our experimental conclusions proceed upon the supposition that the future will be conformable to the past .
....
Without the influence of custom , we should be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses .
( David Hume , 1737 )
Popper 's problem of induction is no different than Hume 's problem of causation and necessary connection - they are the same problem because ' necessary connection ' is the central problem of knowledge which applies to all the sciences - physics , philosophy , metaphysics , theology .
Popper claims that we can never prove something is true , we can only show that it is false .
So we could drop 10,000 idealist philosophers out of the plane , one after another , yet we could never be certain that the next one would fall to their death .
To do so we have to assume the future is like the past - and this is uncertain .
This is the current state of science / physics , which is founded on induction from empirical facts ( uncertain ) rather than logical deduction from principles which correctly describe reality ( certain ) .
What most people do not realise though , is that this uncertainty is only the case while you do not know the necessary connection between cause and effect ( postmodernism assumes this is a permanent limitation of science , thus we can never know reality / absolute truths ) .
As Hume and Popper wrote ;
Were the power or energy of any cause discoverable by the mind , we could foresee the effect , even without experience ; and might , at first , pronounce with certainty concerning it , by mere dint of thought and reasoning .
...
Now it seems evident that , if this conclusion were formed by reason , it would be as perfect at first , and upon one instance , as after ever so long a course of experience .
( David Hume , 1737 )
Hume is saying that once we know the causal connection between things , we could deduce with certainty the effects , and they would always match the effects we in fact see , i.e. logical truths = empirical truths .
And Popper acknowledged the truth of this .
( It seems though that postmodern philosophy has forgotten this fact in their haste to say that we cannot know the absolute truth about physical reality ) .
There could easily be a little quarrel about the question which is the deeper problem ; Hume 's Problem of Causation , or what I have called the Problem of Induction .
One could argue that if the problem of causation were positively solved - if we could show the existence of a necessary link between cause and effect - the problem of induction would also be solved , and positively .
Thus one might say , the problem of causation is the deeper problem .
( Karl Popper , 1975 )
For example , we know that electrical charges repel one another , yet we have no ' ultimate explanation ' of how they do it , even if we accept Maxwell 's theory .
We do not have any general theory of causality ( at any rate not since the breakdown of Descartes ' theory that all causality is push ) .
( Popper , 1975 )
This confusion is clearly evident in modern Physics , e.g. the particle / wave duality of both light and matter , the big bang origin of the universe from no space and time .
However , we can now show that this confusion is simply due to errors in the foundations of physics relating to the discrete and separate particle conception of matter .
i.e.
If you try to explain reality in terms of many things ( like many separate ' particles ' moving around in space and time ) then you still lack knowledge of how they are necessarily interconnected ( so they add ' fields ' or more ' particles ' to connect them - but it is a naive way to solve the problem and it clearly cannot work ) .
The Solution
True Knowledge of Reality ( Necessary Connection ) as the Source of Truth / Wisdom
The solution is to describe reality in terms of only one thing existing , as this will then explain the causal / necessary connection between the many things we experience .
As Aristotle and Leibniz wrote ;
( Aristotle , 340BC )
The first philosophy ( Metaphysics ) is universal and is exclusively concerned with primary substance .
...
And here we will have the science to study that which is just as that which is , both in its essence and in the properties which , just as a thing that is , it has .
...
That among entities there must be some cause which moves and combines things .
...
There must then be a principle of such a kind that its substance is activity .
( Gottfried Leibniz , 1646 - 1716 ) Reality cannot be found except in One single source , because of the interconnection of all things with one another .
... I do not conceive of any reality at all as without genuine unity .
... I maintain also that substances , whether material or immaterial , cannot be conceived in their bare essence without any activity , activity being of the essence of substance in general .
The solution is actually very simple and obvious once known ( which is why philosophy is also known as the discovery of the obvious - because humans are blind to the obvious , as history shows ) .
We simply had to ask one obvious question about science ( Occam 's razor )
What is the most simple science theory of reality ?
( It is a significant fact that there is not another page on the internet that considers what the most simple science theory of reality is - which is strange given Occam 's Razor / principle of simplicity is fundamental to science . )
With a little thought you will realise this is the same as asking what is the necessary connection between things - as there must be one thing that causes and connects the many things - and this is necessarily the most simple solution .
Of profound importance is the fact that there is only one solution ( which is deduced ) .
The Wave Structure of Matter in Space - where Space exists with the properties of a wave medium and matter is formed from spherical standing waves in space .
Note :
We have a page of wave diagrams that will help you visualise the spherical standing wave structure of matter ( WSM ) in space .
Basically , we only see the high wave amplitude wave - center and have been deluded into thinking matter was made of tiny little ' particles ' .
A very naive conception in hindsight - and quantum physics was telling us all along that waves were central to light and matter interactions !
From this foundation you can then show without any opinions that the theory works , i.e. it correctly deduces fundamentals of modern physics .
See : Quantum Physics , Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity , Cosmology .
And as Popper also wrote ;
If a theory corresponds to the facts but does not cohere with some earlier knowledge , then this earlier knowledge should be discarded .
( Popper , 1975 )
The Solution to Immanuel Kant's Synthetic a priori Knowledge
Immanuel Kant is the most famous metaphysicist of western philosophy , and there is no doubt that his ' Critique of Pure Reason ' is the most comprehensive analysis of Metaphysics since Aristotle 's pioneering work which founded this subject .
Thus no essay on philosophy would be complete without an explanation of Kant ' synthetic a priori knowledge .
The solution is simple and obvious once known .
Kant made one small and yet fundamental mistake .
And this error led to the belief that we could never know reality ( the thing in itself ) , only our ideas of reality which were necessarily incomplete .
Kant is correct that Space is a priori , or first necessary for us to have senses ( which are a posteriori ) .
Natural science ( physics ) contains in itself synthetical judgments a priori , as principles .
...
Space then is a necessary representation a priori , which serves for the foundation of all external intuitions .
( Immanuel Kant , Critique of Pure Reason , 1781 )
His error is to assume that Time is also a priori or necessary for us to sense the motion of matter ' particles ' in Space .
He writes ;
There are two pure forms of sensible intuition , as principles of knowledge a priori , namely space and time .
( Kant , 1781 )
And from this he concludes that because Space and Time cannot be united , they must both be merely ideas .
His error can be found in the following quote where he writes ;
... even that of motion , which unites in itself both elements ( Space and Time ) , presuppose something empirical .
Motion , for example , presupposes the perception of something movable .
But space considered in itself contains nothing movable ; consequently motion must be something which is found in space only through experience - in other words , is an empirical datum .
( Kant , 1781 )
Please read this quote several times , for it contains an error that has had profound repercussions for humanity .
The error ?
That ' space considered in itself contains nothing movable ' .
And this error then leads Kant to conclude that ;
.. in respect to the form of appearances , much may be said a priori , whilst of the thing in itself , which may lie at the foundation of these appearances , it is impossible to say anything .
( Kant , 1781 )
The solution to Kant 's error is to realise that the exact opposite is true , that Space considered in itself contains wave motions , i.e .
Space physically exists as a substance with the properties of a wave medium and contains wave motions that form matter and cause the effect of time .
Kant 's error is understandable in hindsight , because he followed Newton , and was conditioned into thinking that motion applied to matter ' particles ' in space and time .
Thus ' empty space ' had no ' particles ' - so motion could not exist in ' empty space ' .
Once we replace the particle conception of matter in space and time with the wave structure of matter in space then we can easily see the error and how it is solved .
Thus the two pure forms of sensible intuition , as principles of knowledge a priori , are namely Space and ( wave ) Motion .
We must place in this a priori concept of Space the correct meaning - that Space is a wave - medium and contains within it a second thing , wave motions of space that form matter ( i.e. synthetic a priori knowledge - we must correctly define the properties of space which is a creative act , a synthesis of space and its wave motions that form matter ) .
Conclusion
In ending , we now know why our Idealist philosophers fell to their death .
Because matter is a structure of the universe , necessarily interconnected to all other matter around us by the spherical wave motions of Space that cause the ' particle ' effect of matter at the wave center .
Further study of physics then shows us that one property of space is that the waves travel more slowly where there is more matter waves ( equivalent to higher energy density of space in Einstein 's general relativity ) .
This causes the philosopher 's wave center ' particles ' to re-position towards the earth ( and this same causal connection of waves causes light to curve past the sun ) .
So now you know what gravity really is - because you know what physical reality is and thus how material things are necessarily connected in Space by their spherical in and out waves .

I hope that you enjoy browsing around !
And I really hope you will think about this - it seems self evidently true to me , thus the most important knowledge that we shall ever discover .
To finally understand what we really are as humans ( amazingly large wave structures of the universe ) as the true foundation for thinking and acting wisely in a world that is now in great need of wisdom from truth and reality .
Sincerely ,
Geoff Haselhurst
A human being is part of the whole called by us universe , a part limited in time and space .
We experience ourselves , our thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest .
A kind of optical delusion of consciousness .
This delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us .
Our task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty .
...
The true value of a human being is determined primarily by the measure and the sense in which they have obtained liberation from the self .
...
We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to survive .
( Albert Einstein )
The notion that all these fragments is separately existent is evidently an illusion , and this illusion cannot do other than lead to endless conflict and confusion .
Indeed , the attempt to live according to the notion that the fragments are really separate is , in essence , what has led to the growing series of extremely urgent crises that is confronting us today .
Thus , as is now well known , this way of life has brought about pollution , destruction of the balance of nature , over - population , world - wide economic and political disorder and the creation of an overall environment that is neither physically nor mentally healthy for most of the people who live in it .
Individually there has developed a widespread feeling of helplessness and despair , in the face of what seems to be an overwhelming mass of disparate social forces , going beyond the control and even the comprehension of the human beings who are caught up in it .
( David Bohm , Wholeness and the Implicate Order , 1980 )
Help Humanity
" You must be the change you wish to see in the world . "
( Mohandas Gandhi )
" When forced to summarize the general theory of relativity in one sentence : Time and space and gravitation have no separate existence from matter .
...
Physical objects are not in space , but these objects are spatially extended .
In this way the concept ' empty space ' loses its meaning .
...
The particle can only appear as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high .
...
The free , unhampered exchange of ideas and scientific conclusions is necessary for the sound development of science , as it is in all spheres of cultural life .
...
We must not conceal from ourselves that no improvement in the present depressing situation is possible without a severe struggle ; for the handful of those who are really determined to do something is minute in comparison with the mass of the lukewarm and the misguided .
...
Humanity is going to need a substantially new way of thinking if it is to survive ! " ( Albert Einstein )
Our world is in great trouble due to human behaviour founded on myths and customs that are causing the destruction of Nature and climate change .
We can now deduce the most simple science theory of reality - the wave structure of matter in space .
By understanding how we and everything around us are interconnected in Space we can then deduce solutions to the fundamental problems of human knowledge in physics , philosophy , metaphysics , theology , education , health , evolution and ecology , politics and society .
This is the profound new way of thinking that Einstein realised , that we exist as spatially extended structures of the universe - the discrete and separate body an illusion .
This simply confirms the intuitions of the ancient philosophers and mystics .
Given the current censorship in physics / philosophy of science journals ( based on the standard model of particle physics / big bang cosmology ) the internet is the best hope for getting new knowledge known to the world .
But that depends on you , the people who care about science and society , realise the importance of truth and reality .

There has been pressure on Gen Musharraf to resign his army post
Musharraf 's choices
Gen Musharraf will resign from the powerful post after the presidential elections , said Mushahid Hussain Sayed , the PML 's secretary general .
He is seeking re-election by parliament before its term expires in mid-October .
Pakistan 's Supreme Court meanwhile is debating his right to remain army chief if he stands for president again .
There has been no confirmation from Gen Musharraf himself about his intentions .
The country 's largest political party , Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People 's Party , has been holding negotiations about a possible power - sharing deal in which they have demanded that he step down from his military role .
Petitions
" We expect that after his re-election process next month , God willing , Gen Musharraf would take his oath of office as a civilian president before November 15 , " said Mr Sayed .
There has been growing opposition to Gen Musharraf 's contention that he is constitutionally allowed to be both president and head of the army at the same time .
KEY DATES 23 Aug : Supreme Court says exiled ex-PM Nawaz Sharif can return 10 Sep : Mr Sharif arrested and deported to Saudi Arabia on his return to Pakistan 11 Sep : Lawyers for Mr Sharif challenge his deportation in the Supreme Court 15 Sep - 15 Oct : Timeframe Gen Musharraf has set for his re-election as president by parliament 18 Oct : Date ex-PM Benazir Bhutto has set for her homecoming 15 November : Parliament expires and general election must be held
The Supreme Court is hearing six petitions seeking to disqualify Gen Musharraf as a presidential candidate .
The petitions have been filed by , among others , Pakistan 's largest Islamic party Jamaat - e - Islami , former cricketer - turned politician Imran Khan and an association of lawyers .
The six petitions also oppose Gen Musharraf 's plan to seek re-election by the outgoing parliament and provincial elections , saying there should be general elections first .
Gen Musharraf 's apparent promise to step down as army chief is not the first time he has made the claim .
In 2002 , he promised members of Pakistan 's Islamic parties that he would resign as head of the army by 2004 in return for their support for a constitutional amendment legitimising his 1999 military takeover .
The opposition believed that that the verbal promise was also enshrined in the amendment , an issue disputed by Gen Musharraf 's advisers .
But instead of keeping that promise , he succeeded in getting parliament to pass an act with a simple majority giving him a one - time exemption to stay on in office until November 2007 .
Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto announced on Friday that she intends to return to Pakistan from exile on 18 October to contest parliamentary elections , which must be held by mid-January .
She was said to have been in negotiations with Gen Musharraf over a deal that would allow her a third term as prime minister in exchange for her support for his plan to be re-elected president .
Judge Wants Libby to Head to Prison , Despite Pending Appeal Judge says no delay for Libby prison time ; Libby 's team seeking emergency stay .
June 14 , 2007  --
A federal judge ruled that Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff should report to prison within the next 45 to 60 days , despite a pending appeal of his conviction .
Judge Reggie Walton said I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby is " not a danger to the community , " but that there is also " not a likelihood it [ his conviction ] will be overturned . "
Libby 's lawyers are expected to file an emergency appeal of Walton 's ruling within the next few days .
The Federal Bureau of Prisons will review Libby 's file and designate a time and place for him to report and begin serving his sentence .
Walton ordered Libby to serve 30 months in prison and pay $ 250,000 in fines last week but had postponed a determination of the start date of Libby 's sentence to allow the defense and prosecution teams time to prepare their respective arguments .
A federal jury found Libby guilty March 6 on charges saying he'd lied to the FBI and a grand jury , and obstructed justice in the investigation into the leak of the identity Valerie Plame , a former covert CIA operative .
Trial Judge Threatened
At the top of the hearing , Walton said he had received hate mail and phone calls since the sentencing .
" Unfortunately , I received a number of angry and meanspirited letters and phone calls … wishing bad things on me and my family , " Walton said .
Walton said he discarded the letters but then , given the volume , decided to keep them in case anyone acted on the threats .
The judge said the harassment would not influence his decision .
Defense Attacks Federal Prosecutor 's Authority
Walton heard from the defense and prosecution for 30 minutes each before the lunch recess .
Libby appeared more tense than he had during much of the trial , at times tapping his fingers on the table .
Defense attorney Larry Robins argued that Patrick Fitzgerald , who was named as the special prosecutor in the CIA Leak investigation , lacked proper authority to bring the case against Libby .
Robins argued that the Justice Department gave Fitzgerald more authority than he should have been granted in his role .
Fitzgerald " was expressly exempted from … following DOJ policy and procedure , " Robins said .
The official at the Justice Department who granted Fitzgerald the authority to investigate the case served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the same New York district as Fitzgerald in the early 1990s .
" He was given the freedom … no special counsel has ever been given , " Robins said .
" When someone does n't have a supervisor … given the widest swath … sometimes things go wrong , " Robins argued .
Classified Information
Additionally , Robins argued that Fitzgerald had overstepped the Classified Information Procedures
Act , which notes that only the attorney general or the deputy attorney general can declassify certain information , such as that contained in some documents submitted into evidence in Libby 's case — specifically , CIA , White House and State Department memos .
" He thinks he is the attorney general , " Robins said of Fitzgerald .
But Judge Walton pointed out that some of the objections mentioned by Robins were never raised during the trial .
Fitzgerald Fires Back
Fitzgerald argued that he did have the proper authority and that Judge Walton had considered the CIPA requests .
" That was transparent , " the prosecutor said .
Fitzgerald argued that the CIPA process may not be appropriately raised after the trial " to say gotcha . "
Addressing questions on whether he had authority to bring the case against Libby , Fitzgerald said , " I was appointed to investigate violations of law … Any crimes related to the disclosure " of the name of Valerie Plame , the former undercover CIA operative who 's identity became public in 2003 .
Appeal Prospects Slim ?
In documents filed with the court Tuesday , special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald urged Walton to send the former White House aide to prison promptly .
A judge has discretion to allow a defendant , whose conviction stands a good chance of being overturned , to remain free during the appeals process .
Fitzgerald argued it was unlikely the conviction would be overturned .
But Libby 's legal team said its client should stay out of prison through the appeal .
Past Precedent
In a motion filed Wednesday , Libby 's team also argued that former Bush administration official David Safavian , who was convicted last year as part of the scandal involving former lobbyist Jack Abramoff , was given the same allowance .
" Mr. Libby has met his burden and is entitled to release pending appeal .
As noted in our motion , David Safavian , who was convicted of obstruction and false statements , was recently held to be entitled to release pending appeal by a court in this district , " the motion noted .
Safavian was the chief of staff at the General Services Administration .
Spotty Memory ?
The defense team 's argument stemmed from the basis of its appeal -- attorneys say Judge Walton did not allow the testimony of a memory expert during the trial , and that certain exhibits and statements made by NBC News anchor Tim Russert , the prosecution 's key witness , were not presented to the jury .
Libby attorney Ted Wells insisted after the March conviction that his client is " totally innocent ; " the defense team maintained that Libby had a spotty memory , and should not have been convicted because of it .
White House Pardon Ahead ?
After last week 's sentencing , Cheney had warm words for his former aide , calling him a man of " the highest intellect , judgment and personal integrity " in a statement released after the hearing .
In a nod to the pending appeal , Cheney continued , " Speaking as friends , we hope that our system will return a final result consistent with what we know of this fine man . "
Cheney 's office issued an identical statement Thursday .
There has been speculation that the president could pardon the former aide to the vice president , but after Libby 's conviction , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino called talk of a pardon " wildly hypothetical . "
After Thursday 's ruling , Perino said , " Scooter Libby still has the right to appeal , and therefore the president will continue not to intervene in the judicial process .
The president feels terribly for Scooter , his wife and their young children , and all that they 're going through . "

The bullet has been traced to the Japanese military
Jin Guangying , 77 , came under fire in September 1943 as she was delivering lunch to her father , a soldier stationed in eastern Jiangsu province .
She could not afford a thorough examination , but her family recently borrowed money as her health worsened .
An X - ray revealed a 3 - cm - long bullet thought to be of Japanese origin .
When she suffered from the headaches , she would sometimes babble words we could hardly understand , foaming at the mouth
Wang Zhengping
Mrs Jin was a 13 - year - old girl when she was shot in the head in Xinyi County , Jiangsu , during a gunfight between Chinese and Japanese soldiers .
She was one of the few survivors .
She recovered after three months , but went on to experience repeated headaches .
" When she suffered from the headaches , she would sometimes babble words we could hardly understand , foaming at the mouth , and sometimes she pounded her head with her fist , " Mrs Jin 's daughter told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua .
Doctors removed the rusty bullet after a four - hour operation .
" It 's a miracle .
The operation was not that difficult , but it 's unbelievable that Mrs Jin was able to survive for such a long time with a bullet in her head , " said Zhou Hong , the head of surgery at the hospital where she was treated .
Military experts in Nanjing said the bullet could only have come from firearms made in Japan .
The hospital refunded the cost of Mrs Jin 's operation after the bullet was deemed a " piece of heritage " , said her daughter .
But the family is planning to seek compensation and a public apology from the Japanese government .

Facebook defines breastfeeding as obscene
( This post has been updated )
First Southwest airlines and now Facebook .
Nicole has already written a very eloquent post about how Facebook is problematic , and now it seems Facebook is jumping on the morality train .
Jezebel.com reports :
Facebook has began taking down pictures of women breastfeeding their children and in some cases , even banning users for putting the photos up in the first place .
The claim is that such imagery is “ obscene content . ”
Breastfeeding is considered “ obscene ? ” The Lactivists ( an activist group that fights for the right to breastfeed in public ) is fighting Facebook on the decision .
They ’re also questioning the logic of removing the photos ( and banning users ) by citing the fact that there ’s no nipple exposure in the pics .
Facebook ’s response ?
“ Photos containing an exposed breast do violate our Terms and are removed . ”
The Lactivists are encouraging people to to join their new Facebook group “ Hey , Facebook , breastfeeding is not obscene ! ” , which currently has over 7000 members .
I ’ve really wanted to blog about the politics of breastfeeding in public ever since some pictures of Maggie Gyllenhaal breastfeeding while having coffee with friends made the rounds .
The photos ( which were often tagged as NSFW ) sparked a pretty active online debate about whether or not it was “ appropriate ” for her to engage in such behaviour , especially if she knew people photograph her often .
While most people seemed supportive of the act , calling it natural , others likened it to going to the bathroom on a city street .
From what I understand breastfeeding has to happen every couple of hours , so if doing it in public is obscene , mothers would never leave the house .
Interestingly enough , there ’s a piece published today announcing that Maggie G “ has posed in handcuffs and sexy lingerie for a new underwear campaign , ” which , no doubt , will not be deemed as obscene as her breastfeeding .
( Not that I think it ’s obscene , I ’m just saying . )
The reason the debate is interesting from a feminist perspective is because of how we , culturally , view , well , boobs .
Facebook has deemed boobs obscene in general , even if they ’re being used for their “ intended purpose . ”
( I really ca n’t see how feeding a baby qualifies as obscene content . )
And if they ’re being used for their intended purpose in public ( especially by a celebrity ) a debate errupts about what is appropriate .
I ’m curious to find out what readers think aout Facebook ’s decision , and the public display of breastfeeding in general .
UPDATE : The Lactivists organized demonstrations in 30 states to protest Applebee Restaurant ’s decision not to allow breastfeeding .
Check out the comments section of Feministing .
com ’s post to get an idea of what I mean when I say this is a highly debated issue : a woman ’s right to breastfeed her child comfortably vs. a restaurant patron ’s right to eat a meal without having to see it .

When Osaka resident Kana Yamaguchi's neighbors cut the grass in a nearby field , a number of fleeing insects sought refuge in her flower bed .
Among them was an odd pair of grasshopper - like bugs -- one pink , one white .
Osaka Museum of Natural History entomologist Itaru Kanazawa identifies them as the larvae of Euconocephalus thunbergi ( " kubikirigisu " in Japanese ) , a close relative of the katydid .
While he says it is normal for these insects to change between green and brown to match their surroundings , pink and white are considered abnormal .
Speculation is that the pink is an extreme variation of the brown coloration , and the white specimen is believed to be an albino , though nobody will know for sure until it becomes an adult .
Regardless , says Kanazawa , " It is quite rare to find three different colors at the same time . "

Even George Orwell would be shocked .
He described the sinister machinations of a totalitarian police state in his novel , 1984 , and laid bare the danger of eroding our basic civil liberties , including the right to freedom of speech and the right to privacy .
Although he famously coined the phrase ' Big Brother is watching you ' , even Orwell cannot have foreseen just how prescient those words would prove to be .
Today , in Tony Blair 's Britain - which I naively voted into power ten years ago - we have witnessed a breath - taking erosion of civil liberties .
The truth is we are fast becoming an Orwellian state , our every movement watched , our behaviour monitored , and our freedoms curtailed .
Between May 1997 and August 2006 , New Labour created 3,023 new criminal offences - taking in everything from a law against Polish potatoes ( the Polish Potatoes Order 2004 ) to one which made the creation of a nuclear explosion in Britain officially illegal .
Then there has been the incredible number of CCTV cameras - a total of 4.2 million , more than in the rest of Europe put together .
And , yesterday , we learnt that the Government has agreed to let the EU have automatic access to databases of DNA ( containing samples of people 's hair , sperm or fingernails ) in order to help track down criminals , even though many thousands of those on record are totally innocent
How did all this happen ?
Who allowed it ?
To try to answer these questions , I have made a film , Talking Liberties , about the attack on our freedoms .
I uncovered a disturbing roll call of ancient basic rights which have been systematically destroyed in the self - serving climate of fear this government has perpetuated since the 9/11 attack .
First there was the Act which banned the age - old right of protest within half - a- mile of Parliament without special police authorisation .
And who can forget Walter Wolfgang , the pensioner who was dragged out of the Labour Party Conference for daring to heckle the Home Secretary ?
He was detained under the Terrorism Act 2000 , which gives the police unprecedented stop and search powers .
In 2005 alone , this law was used to stop 35,000 people - none of whom was a terrorist .
But this is only the thin end of the wedge - our civil liberties , enshrined in British law since the Magna Carta , are being whittled away .
There has been an unprecedented shift of power away from the individual towards the state - but now this power is being used not to defeat terrorism , but to keep tabs on ordinary citizens .
As well as a raft of repressive anti-terror legislation , there are the more insidious infringements of our freedom and privacy .
We will soon see the introduction of the vast National Identity Register , linking all databases such as the DNA database to which the EU will soon have access .
The tentacles of these networks will intertwine until they form a vast state surveillance mechanism , which can track every detail of your life : what books you borrowed from the library as a student , your sexual health , your DNA profile , your spending and your whereabouts at any given moment in time .
Ministers are even creating a children 's database , which will record truancy , diet , and medical history .
And , of course , ID cards will be issued in 2009 - to be used every time we carry out routine tasks such as visiting the dentist .
Soon , biometric data - your iris scan , fingerprints and DNA , will help to identify you further .
And , all the time , there are those CCTV cameras - 20 per cent of the global total , even though Britain only has 0.2 per cent of the world 's population .
New Labour has an absolute obsession with these devices .
Soon , more sophisticated cameras will be able to recognise your face and the information matched to one of the national databases .
All cars will eventually be fitted with a GPS chip , officially to simplify road tax payments but they will also allow government agencies to track every vehicle in the country .
There are , of course , more alarming implications to being constantly monitored - as Orwell understood .
Soon , we will be living in an open - air prison .
Some may ask : why does all this matter ?
The answer is that to surrender our identity and privacy so comprehensively is to give up something we will never get back .
Although New Labour says its mania for data - gathering is all part of its plan to protect us , there 's no guarantee that future governments ( who will be inheriting a nationwide surveillance machine and the National Identity Register ) wo n't use it to more malign ends .
Totalitarian regimes have , after all , always collected information on their citizens .
Hitler pioneered the use of ID cards as a means of repression .
The Belgians left Rwanda with a bloody legacy by implementing an ID card system which divided the population into Hutu and Tutsi .
When the 1994 genocide began , these cards proved a device for horrific ethnic cleansing , with one million people dying in 100 days .
The Stasi secret police in Soviet East Germany kept millions of files in order to keep track of everyone in the country .
Of course these examples are the extremes - but basic liberties such as privacy and free speech have been hard - won over centuries and history shows that we should not allow them to be brushed aside .
This shift away from individual freedom towards state power has happened slowly , and almost without us noticing .
Like so many others , I was proud to put a cross against the box next to New Labour in 1997 as a first - time voter .
But now I have become shocked at the vast swathe of new laws which had been introduced , most of them in response to terrorism .
We are told that this is all for the good - these laws , and the surveillance cameras and ID cards will stop terrorists .
Is that the case ?
Sadly not .
The London bombers carried ID and were observed on CCTV - of course it did not stop them committing their terrible crime .
Intelligence experts say that most information leading to genuine breakthroughs come from informants , not through random tracking or surveillance of the general population .
In any case , liberty and security are n't balanced on some delicate equilibrium , as John Reid , the Home Secretary , and Tony Blair would have us believe .
History has shown us that it is precisely when you undermine people 's basic rights that they mobilise towards radical groups .
After all , one of the greatest recruiters for the IRA in Northern Ireland was the policy of internment , under which people were imprisoned without trial .
Have we learnt nothing from our past ?
Stop and search laws applied to Britain 's Muslim communities will simply polarise those groups .
Instead , we need them to help us protect the country from terrorism .
It 's not all doom and gloom , of course - as I hope my film reflects .
The sheer absurdity of the bewildering array of idiotic new laws has given us an abundance of bizarre and hilarious situations for our documentary .
But behind this dark comedy is something much more disturbing .
Faced with the threat of terrorism , the Government has told us that we must lay down our freedoms for our lives .
Perhaps it has forgotten the millions of people from past generations who have laid down their lives for our freedom .
I think we owe it to those people to turn this tide .
Many wax poetic on the virtues of Lisp , and I would say for good reason : it was a language and philosophy that was ( and is ) far ahead of its time in principle and oftentimes in practice .
But I have to cede the following : the foundations of Common Lisp are becoming somewhat ancient and there are many places that have more modern roots where I would have it borrow heavily to assist in creating my programming nirvana .
In talking with yet another friend from Berkeley ( and the author of sudo random ) we had discussed some of these things and I decided it was worth enumerating some of them and pointing to ongoing work that implements those fragments or something close to it .
The reason this post is titled in such a sober way is because the Lisp I envision is probably many lifetimes of work to accomplish , and as such , I can not see myself accomplishing everything on my own .
Granted , I still have a lot of life ahead of me yet , but that only makes the equation all the more depressing .
Implementation could probably span many PhD theses and industrial man-decades .
As such , I can only hope that it ’s the Lisp that more or less exists before The End Of My Lifetime .
I would be glad to one day say that I contributed in some or large part to any one piece of it .
This whole post smacks of the “ sufficiently smart compiler ” daydreaming , so turn away if you must .
Alternatively , you can sit back , enjoy , and nit - pick at the details of compiler theory and implementation , some ( or many ) of which I ’m sure have been overlooked by me .
Finally , this is not by any means a list of things that current implementations do not have , just things that I feel would seem most valuable .
Some are not even necessarily technical challenges so much as social and design ones .
I view this hypothetical Lisp as not only some new features , but a set of idioms that I more programmers generally agree on .
“ The Zen of Python ” is an excellent example of this .
There are definitely some lisp - idioms , but they have become somewhat antiquated and are hard to enumerate in some part because of the baroque and aging Common Lisp specification .
The hardest idiom to get around is fearlessness and ease of metaprogramming , which in part is great , but also can make standardization difficult socially as it assists in making herding Lisp programmers difficult .
Herding lisp programmers is about as tough as herding cats armed with machine guns .
However , I think Lisp ’s guiding intentions have lied in flexibility .
Common Lisp , for its time , was the kitchen sink .
It still is , in large part , but may benefit from new idioms and a fresh slate , as well as deeper and more integrated compiler support for some of the features mentioned below .
1. The Compiler is your Friend .
Leaders in this area : SLIME and its Swank component
Honorable Mentions : DrScheme , IPython
Nowadays modern IDEs seem to do everything up to the semantic analysis step in compilation to give you advanced searching and refactoring capabilities .
Oftentimes a lot of compiler work is reimplemented to support the features of the given IDE at hand , and much work is duplicated , sometimes to the point of implementing a whole compiler , as in Eclipse .
SLIME and Swank have a twist on this that I like : Swank is responsible for asking the compiler implementation itself ( in my case SBCL ) for information on various symbols , their source location , documentation , and so on .
It communicates all this information through a socket to a frontend , which comprises the rest of SLIME .
In doing so it gains the authoritative answer to queries about the program because the compiler of choice itself is delivering its opinion on the matter , even as it runs .
This allows for an accurate way to track down references that may be created dynamically by asking the figurative question “ What would the compiler do ? ” .
From this SLIME gains extremely powerful auto-completion facilities that are robust to techniques are either unavailable in other programming cultures or , if used , would defeat the programmer ’s completeness of assessment of the program .
Lisp is the only runtime / language I know of where I can eval a string and still be able to access the resulting , say , function definition and documentation strings with full auto - completion and hinting in my editing environment .
Were Lisp more popular , I would bet Swank - compatibility and feature - richness would be a defining feature for Lisp implementations , and frontends using Swank would be prolific .
The socket interface was definitely the way to go here .
2. Networked & Concurrent Programming
Leaders in this area : Erlang
Honorable mentions : Termite & Gambit , Rhino , SISC , Parallel Python , Stackless Python , and many others .
Sun Microsystems , despite its beleaguered business , had at least one thing very , very right : “ The network is the computer . ”
The ability to talk on multiple computers on a network is increasingly important in our era , and making it convenient can lead to extraordinarily powerful , robust applications .
Erlang definitely leads the pack in this area : an industrial strength , reasonably efficient compiler that can do I/ O pumping using efficient kernel - assisted event polling as well as automatically distributing computation across multiple processors .
It also can support sending of most higher - order objects – such as closures – across the network parts of messages , as well as a powerful pattern - matching syntax that allows for relatively easy handling of binary ( and other ) protocols .
With processors increasing the number of cores and computers continually falling in price the ability to ( mostly ) correctly use multiple machines and multiple processors on each machine will become a dominant influence for writing programs that require high performance .
Erlang has been demonstrated to be excellent at managing network I/ O switching and handling , which is not surprising considering that is its main application as a tool .
It could , however , stand to improve upon sequential execution performance : let ’s just say I wo n’t be rewriting my numeric codes in Erlang just yet , despite the potential for mass distribution of computation .
I also miss some of my amenities I ’ve gotten used to in Lisp , but Erlang excels in its area for sure and has many lessons to teach .
3. First Class Environments
Leaders in this area : T , MIT - Scheme — mostly academia
Honorable Mentions : Python , Common Lisp
First class environments are the beginning and end of many problems , but I feel that having this facility would be useful for debugging and implementing creative namespacing and many other important features .
Opaque environments can sometimes still be handled with mostly reasonable performance , but as far as I know nice , transparent environments — i.e. , things that look like property or assoc lists straight out of the SICP — are just an absolute killer for performance and make compiler optimizations nigh near impossible .
But that ’s OK … because there ’s nothing more annoying that shying away from using thunks or currying when these techniques are the most simple and expressive solution because you are afraid that it will become a chore to poke at the environment to debug these anonymous function instances later .
By contrast , “ locals ( ) ” in Python , for example , can be a godsend for special tasks and quick debugging , even if it only returns the local ( and generally most useful ) environment .
First class environments also help in “ fixing ” tricky issues that crop up and are cause for Scheme ’s motivation for hygienic macros , famous for being hellishly picky to get right ( Lisp - 2 fans always seem to harp on this point , although what I ’m suggesting may be something more like dynamic - lisp - N ) .
I still feel that the quasiquote , despite its sometimes - ugliness , is the right primitive model to follow .
And , in fact , since there seem to be hygienic macro packages build on top of the primitive variants , one could get those almost for free .
Perhaps hygienic macros could also be idiomatic , I know not .
In conclusion , the goal is to break down some of the final barriers between code and data and allow for some interesting if unorthodox transformations and redefinitions at run-time and compile - time .
It ’s also important to have this functionality if one wants to dynamically redistribute computations across machines or perform run-time metaprogramming , which may be a great way to introduce new compiler features that can be toggled on and off .
4. An External Native - Code Generator
Leaders in this area : LLVM , JVM
Honorable Mentions : Parrot ( if only because of relative vaporwareness ) , Mono , C– , Bit - C
More important than the individual merits of any of these specific VMs is that they are maintained separately by Other People™ .
It is high time to stop re-inventing architecture - specific code generators and local optimizers over and over .
With the JVM catching up or passing up language - specific native code generators ( it ’s now more or less tied with OCaml on the Alioth compiler shootout with Java and doing well with Scala ) and LLVM recently showing on - par and sometimes better performance than vanilla versions of GCC for some C code , I am buoyed with hope that one can generate relatively high - level ( or at least architecture - independent - ish ) bytecode and still get respectable or even good performance .
JIT , ironically enough , may be more well suited to the lispy world than the Java one ( although its instrumental in the Java world for sure ) considering that it ’s pretty common to go in and rebind definitions in Lisp while a system is running .
One might argue that changing declaim / proclaim statements and evaluating code is in fact better than JIT , and I could see there being a case for that , but it just seems that lots of work is being poured into run-time code generators that could be leveraged .
One interesting idea is compiling to Bit - C , which has support for low - level manipulations and type - verification , yet also is a lisp .
5. Optionally Exposed Type Inference and Static Typing
Leaders in this area : Epigram , Qi , Haskell , the ML family
Honorable Mentions : CMUCL and descendant SBCL
Inferred static typing and type inference is all the rage these days , with claims for increased program execution and correctness .
And I ’m all for that , and Qi is an excellent example of the ability to do considerable amount with standard Common Lisp facilities .
Qi has the extremely sensible goal of remaining in Common Lisp , and thus ensuring that it has measurable chance of having traction in my lifetime .
Although I ’m not sure that the interface to typing I would expose is necessarily ( or necessarily not ) Qi’s , but I do want my compiler to tell me what it thinks about various tokens littered throughout my code , allowing my editor to do things like red-flagging unsafe operations and type disagreements or have a mode to show expensive dynamic operations or inferred types when I ’m seeking optimization .
Ultimately , not all of my code will fit neatly into the pure - functional paradigm and may be better served by the occasional side - effect or global state , and I would like type rigor to extend as far as possible , but not become a burden .
Sometimes I just want a heterogeneous hash table of elements without any baggage .
I think it makes sense to rigorously type nuggets of code , but the Lisp in question should not be fascist about maintaining ‘ perfect ’ consistency throughout an entire program .
Epigram and Qi have this model exactly right : pay as you go .
Flexibilty when you need it , but not to the point where it is fascist .
In the future , it ’d be nice to see some efficiency benefits from compiler - awareness of carefully statically typed nuggets of code that otherwise would not be possible , such as eliminating some bounds checking .
Finally , CMUCL and SBCL already do quite a bit of type - inference , it ’s just not exposed to the user so nicely in SLIME except through warnings blown out of stdout .
Even then , they can be very useful .
Ideally I could simply ask SLIME to access the type of a given symbol and ( CMU|SB ) CL could tell me what it thinks .
6. Pattern Matching
Leaders in this area : Many .
MLs , Haskell , Erlang , lisp macros for Scheme and CL .
This is an amenity that should become standard part of the lisper ’s idiom for convenience if nothing else .
It ’s just that there are a number of pattern matchers and none of them that I am aware of has become the idiomatic one .
7. Continuations and Dynamic - Wind
Leaders in this area : Scheme , almost exclusively , and an implementation : STALIN
Scheme is probably the canonical continuation and dynamic - wind implementation .
Implementation is subtle and performance impacts can be significant , but give pleasant generality to schemers when designing new control constructs .
Combined with first - class environments one could do quite a few interesting things , such as save the entire program state as an environment - continuation pair .
Unfortunately , implementation is incredibly painful .
Yet , it has been done , and with a pay - as - you - go model it may not need to hurt most code ’s performance very much ( few people ought to be writing code riddled with continuations ) .
See the STALIN compiler , which does all sorts of rather insane things , along with the insane compilation time .
It ’s mostly intended for numerical codes , though .
8. Pretty and easy ( but optional ) Laziness
Leaders in this area : Haskell , Python , Ruby , Common Lisp Iterate package , many others
Honorable Mentions : Anything with closures , Screamer .
Scheme for call / cc allowing even more strange general flow control .
I like Python ’s yield operator that transforms a normal function into a lazy one that is expressed as an iterator .
In particular , I like to avoid , when possible , specifying representation formats for a sequence or set of things when they are n’t strictly necessary .
With continuations one can get very nice looking implementations of generator - type functions although this may have an undesirable performance impact .
As such , most languages that have laziness or generators implement special restricted - case behavior to get good performance , and that should probably sit pretty high up on the optimization list for this Lisp .
9. Convenient and Pervasive Tail Recursion
Leaders in this area : Erlang , Scheme
Honorable mentions : anything with tail recursion elimination and optional arguments
I like using tail recursion to express loops , as I find them more flexible , easier to debug , and understandable than loops and mutation .
Combined with pattern matching it ’s fiendishly convenient at times and can in some circumstances greatly assist a compiler if assignments go unused .
I do n’t meant to say this should be the only means , but I would like to see it be idiomatic and terse to write .
The Scheme named - let and Erlang ’s pattern matching both assist this process .
One of the main priorities that is key is making it easy to hide the extra arguments often required in a tail - recursive function to hold state from the outside world , and Scheme ’s named - let , I think , handles this rather beautifully for common cases .
WASHINGTON , Aug. 23 — The Bush administration has confirmed for the first time that American telecommunications companies played a crucial role in the National Security Agency ’s domestic eavesdropping program after asserting for more than a year that any role played by them was a “ state secret . ”
The acknowledgment was in an unusual interview that Mike McConnell , the director of national intelligence , gave last week to The El Paso Times in which he disclosed details on classified intelligence issues that the administration has long insisted would harm national security if discussed publicly .
Mr. McConnell made the remarks apparently in an effort to bolster support for the broadened wiretapping authority that Congress approved this month , even as Democrats are threatening to rework the legislation because they say it gives the executive branch too much power .
It is vital , he said , for Congress to give retroactive legal immunity to the companies that assisted in the program to help prevent them from facing bankruptcy because of lawsuits over it .
“ Under the president ’s program , the terrorist surveillance program , the private sector had assisted us , because if you ’re going to get access , you ’ve got to have a partner , ” Mr. McConnell said in the interview , a transcript of which was posted by The El Paso Times on Wednesday .

Search results will be highlighted in the Note editor in a future release .
Selecting a note in the tree will show only the search results in that tree branch , letting you drill down to a subset of results .
Click on the Home icon goes back to showing all search results .
In a similar way , Filters can be used along with Search to home in on specific notes .
For example you could show only search results with a green title or a certain icon .
Being independant
Every combination of View Group ( Notes , Archive , Trash ) , Sort Type ( Title , My Order , Date Updated , … ) and List View Tab keeps its own set of Filters and Hoisting properties .
This flexibility lets you have independant and specific sets of Notes displayed for each of these combinations .
When these change a notification is displayed summarizing what ’s on view .
Streamlined user interface
We ’ve simplified and relabeled various user interface components in this release .
Click / tap on the Filters button now toggles filters off / on and the dropdown arrow opens the filters menu .
Changing any Filter setting now activates it ’s filter and turns Filtering on .
The New Note button is also more prominent .
The Sort Order button and menu have also been changed .
The button text and icon indicates the current sort order , which can be changed using the direction button on the right .
We ’ve removed the sort direction buttons from the menu itself , which were confusing .
That ’s all for now
This release adds important new functionality , addresses a range of issues which were n’t working quite right and improves overall usability .
Next steps include major updates and added functionality to the Note editor along with work on the server to finish the multi-device synchronization .
This builds on the current multi-tab synchronization currently in place .

The latest Rejuvenation Research is available online , and as I said in this week 's Longevity Meme Newsletter :
While we 're out there fighting the good fight , remember that some segments of the biomedical research community are very willing to sign their names to the defeat of aging - and are publishing in a well - regarded , influential journal .
I 've pointed out a couple of the more interesting papers as they came up in PubMed over the past few weeks , but here is one of the others - an important paper with an overly intimidating title .
If you 're feeling weak of constitution you might want to skip to the explanation , but this is really just a case of some science having a language and style all of its own .
Allotopic mRNA Localization to the Mitochondrial Surface Rescues Respiratory Chain Defects in Fibroblasts Harboring Mitochondrial DNA Mutations Affecting Complex I or V Subunits
The possibility of synthesizing mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) - coded proteins in the cytosolic compartment , called allotopic expression , provides an attractive option for genetic treatment of human diseases caused by mutations of the corresponding genes .
However , it is now appreciated that the high hydrophobicity of proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome represents a strong limitation on their mitochondrial import when translated in the cytosol .
Recently , we optimized the allotopic expression of a recoded ATP6 gene in human cells , by forcing its mRNA to localize to the mitochondrial surface .
In this study , we show that this approach leads to a long - lasting and complete rescue of mitochondrial dysfunction of fibroblasts harboring the neurogenic muscle weakness , ataxia and retinitis Pigmentosa T8993G ATP6 mutation or the Leber hereditary optic neuropathy G11778A ND4 mutation .
What is this all about , and why is it relevant and interesting ?
Let 's start with the mechanics : mitochondria are the powerplants of your cells , evolved from bacteria that brought their own DNA to the party .
Some of your DNA is in the cell nucleus , and some is in the mitochondria .
These researchers are taking genes normally found in the mitochondrial DNA and putting them into the cellular nucleus , to do their jobs there .
This engineering feat is called allotopic expression .
The job of a gene is , in essence , to act as the instruction set for the production of proteins , the components of cellular machinery .
A core problem in moving the factory from the mitochondria to the nucleus is that these proteins would then have to struggle their way back to the mitochondria where they are needed ; this has been a challenge for a variety of reasons .
These researchers have demonstrated a way to overcome that challenge for at least a subset of mitochondrial genes - via what might be viewed as a rather clever hack to the programming of the cell - and thus can repair dysfunctional mitochondria that results from damage to those genes and a local absence of vital proteins .
So what 's the big deal about that for those of us interested in healthy life extension ?
Well , evidence presently supports ongoing , accumulated damage to mitochondrial DNA as one contribution to age - related degeneration .
All aging is damage , and this form of damage appears important , the root cause of free - radical propagation throughout the body .
The engineering approach to dealing with this damage - and thus repairing or halting its contribution to aging - seems to have at least two viable paths forward at the present time :
Replace all damaged mitochondrial DNA with fresh , undamaged DNA , such as via protofection
Copy all the important mitochondrial genes into the nucleus , thus making damage in the mitochondria irrelevant
The second path would make damage irrelevant because the necessary proteins will be generated in the well - protected nucleus even if the mitochondrial genes are no longer functional .
This is the path favored by biomedical gerontologist Aubrey de Grey and proposed in the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence .
de
Grey suggested a different clever hack to move the proteins produced by these genes to where they need to be , but the overall scheme is much the same at the high level .
That is why this paper is interesting and important : it provides more concrete validation for allotopic expression as a means for eliminating one important contribution to the aging process .
Technorati tags : biotechnology , life extension , SENS
It turns out that a good portion of all those Windows crashes over the years are not caused by the operating system itself , but by buggy device drivers – low - level pieces of code that allow the operating system to communicate with external devices like the computer 's keyboard , hard drive , screens and network cards .
Because device drivers run deep within the operating system , they are hard to write and hard to debug .
And when they fail , they can take down the whole computer .
" If they go bad , the whole OS can go bad , " says Tom Ball , a scientist at Microsoft Research .
But in a little - noticed project percolating in Redmond , the world 's biggest single producer of software bugs is pushing the envelope on an anti-bug technology that promises to make the Windows operating system a whole lot more reliable , and may eventually raise the bar for dependable software throughout the industry .
Microsoft has developed a tool called the Static Driver Verifier , or SDV , that uses " model checking " to analyze the source code for Windows device drivers and see if the code that the programmer wrote matches a mathematical model of what a Windows device driver should actually do .
If the driver does n't match the model , the SDV warns that the driver might contain a bug .
It 's a deceptively simple - sounding breakthrough that encapsulates some remarkable software engineering theory .
When Bill Gates announced that the technology was under development at the 2002 Windows Engineering Conference , he called it " the holy grail of computer science " – a description that does not overstate the tool 's significance .
" Now in some very key areas – for example , driver verification – we 're building tools that can do actual proof about the software and how it works in order to guarantee the reliability , " said Gates .
Three years later , the technology has moved from Microsoft Research , where it was developed as part of a project called Slam , and into developers ' hands .
And while the SDV can't prove if a program will execute correctly , it can find many errors that previously snuck through the development process and went on to vex customers .
" It finds bugs via static analysis ( compile - time analysis ) of the code rather than run-time analysis , " says Ball , who led the Slam project with Sriram Rajamani .
A typical driver can be checked in a few minutes , but some complex drivers can take as long as 20 minutes to analyze .
" Most of the bugs it finds are real , but because it is a static analysis , it can report false bugs . "
Drivers are usually written by hardware makers – companies that invariably have less experience writing code than Microsoft .
Because drivers have a limited set of operations that they perform – such as moving a packet from a computer 's ethernet card to the machine 's memory – they are amenable to formal analysis , says George Avrunin , a professor at the University of Massachusetts who is familiar with Slam .
" A lot of the problems with drivers seem to have to do with things like whether the right interrupts are masked before a certain operation , etc. , and this kind of checking can detect errors of that sort , " Avrunin says .
" Moreover , although the driver code can be quite complicated , the basic structure of what it 's doing is usually fairly simple – and there 's no concurrency – so it 's possible to do this kind of automated abstraction . "
Despite its success with device drivers , model checking is n't a panacea , and in any event , the technique can't work for complicated programs like Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat , because it 's too hard to create a formal specification of what these programs should actually be doing .
Instead , for large - scale applications , some experts are turning to special program checkers that scan source code looking for common mistakes .
Prexis from Ounce Labs is one such automated code analyzer .
" We do n't just look for bugs , " says Jack Danahy , the company 's founder and CTO .
Instead , Prexis looks for design errors that lead to security problems – for example , a program that sends sensitive information over a network without first encrypting that information .
Automated tools are especially useful when companies outsource programming to outside vendors , says Danahy : " Most of the security risks that people face are not just bugs – they 're decisions that programmers made . "
What programs like Prexis do is find the code that those decisions produced and bring it to the attention of managers and quality - assurance professionals .
These reports are much easier to audit than the code itself .
And if the reports can be audited , there is a chance – however small – that the programmers might actually be forced to fix their bugs before customers are bitten .
“ How I learned to stop worrying and love the separation of accidental and actual complexity in programs . ”
What ’s worth more ?
The macro facilities or the provably linear - time chasability of code identifiers and the like ?
All I know is : I have never read a satisfactory answer to the dilemma , merely a boatload of silent assumptions that the expressive power must be better … somehow .

Inherent Difficulty
Implementation
or , Reinier Zwitserloot said something interesting I ’m a simple man , and what matters to me is the amount of time it takes me to design code , to write code , to debug code , to understand the code that others have written , and to write code that others will understand .
The one factor that has risen above all others for these tasks is the signal to noise ratio in code .
This idea has been far , far better explained as the difference between “ accidental ” and “ inherent ” ( or “ actual ” ) difficulty in programming .
Pick up the source code for a program and three highlighter markers , one green , one yellow , and one red .
Go through the source .
If you do n’t understand what something does , mark it in red .
If you understand it , but it has everything to do with the accidental difficulty of the implementation and nothing to do with the inherent difficulty of the problem , mark it in yellow .
And finally , if something seems to express the problem and its solution fairly directly in an manner you understand , mark it in green .
What could be simpler ?
We want more green , less yellow , and absolutely no red in our programs .
We ca n’t escape the yellow marker : if we like ( I only say if we like ) Ruby on Rails , we like the fact that our code has lots of green , because it ’s written in a DSL aimed at CRUD applications on the web .
But if we look inside Rails , we see lots of stuff that is yellow or — horribly for us —red .
The yellow under the covers makes the green in our code possible .
( I dare say that this was once the philosophy behind enterprisey stuff like SOAP and J2EE .
Somebody , somewhere felt that these frameworks could help programmers write stuff that focused on the task at hand and left the accidental difficulties , the “ gory details ” as they were , to the framework . )
This is the principle behind structured programming and every programming language where we can build our own abstractions .
It ’s not that we eliminate the yellow .
Rather , we shift it away from the green so that there 's one nice place where everything is green : we say that this is our solution , this is our idea .
And there 's this other mass of yellow that makes the green work , we say this is our infrastructure , this is the hardest working code in show business .
The opposite of this is where the green and yellow is all mixed up .
This is why Design Patterns are a sign of weakness , not of strength .
With a pattern , you have yellow code intermingled with your green code .
You may be so used to it you think you do n’t see the yellow , but nevertheless your Visitor or your Singleton or your Adapter is there taking up space and diluting your ideas .
At a finer level , this is why iteration — especially when we maintain our own index variables — is weaker code than mapping and folding .
Yellow code likeis sprayed all over our problem logic .
When the green is all in once place , we can look at it and verify it and think about it with ourhat on .
And by segregating all of the yellow code into its own place , we can look at it and verify it and think about it with our Accidental Difficulty orhat on .
Further to that , my experience is that our green code sometimes changes in really fundamental ways .
Requirements change , our understanding changes , and we must make drastic changes to the fundamental logic behind our programs .
When the green is in one place , you change it and — cross your fingers — you ’re done .
The yellow code is as obstinate and coupled and messy as ever , but you do n’t touch it .
When your code is intermingles , the slightest change to your program logic breaks all of your infrastructure and patterns in unpredictable ways .
Coupling in yellow code is bad , but coupling yellow code to green code is hideous .
That 's the appeal of Domain - Specific Languages and Metaprogramming .
When done right , there 's no less implementation or accidentally difficult code , but it ’s sharply separated from the code that solves the inherent difficulties of our problem .
I ’m very comfortable with the idea that some languages enable more green and less yellow through sheer economy of expression .
But I ’m also comfortable with the idea that other languages may offer more green and less yellow or more separation of green and yellow through different mechanisms .
If two programs do much the same thing and one is smaller than the other , I ’m not going to jump right up and say that the former is necessarily better or that the former ’s language / framework / libraries are necessarily better .
At the moment , I want to look at them both and start colouring .
If the longer program has more green code , or has it all in one place , or if the shorter program is marred by red …
I ’m inclined to say the short one is n’t the best we can do .
So … if expressiveness is measured by economy of expression , I do n’t think it is always better .
And should we pursue economy at the expense of separating the solution to inherent and accidental difficulties , I think we make our code less worse , not better .
The aircraft skidded off the runway after landing in heavy rain and exploded into flames .
It was carrying 123 passengers - most of them foreigners - and seven crew .
About 40 people escaped the burning wreckage and were taken to hospital .
Flight OG 269 , operated by airline One - Two - Go , had flown to Phuket from the Thai capital , Bangkok .
More than 80 bodies have been recovered and are now lying in a makeshift morgue at Phuket airport .
I saw passengers engulfed in fire as I stepped over them on the way out of the plane
Survivor
Survivors flee burning plane High price for cheap flights ?
A French tourist aboard a plane behind the one that crashed told AFP news agency she saw the accident happen .
" When the plane landed it caught fire , " she said .
" We could see the fire coming out of it . "
Survivors crawled out of the wreckage through thick smoke , many of them badly burned .
Passenger Parinwit Chusaeng told Thai TV : " I saw passengers engulfed in fire as I stepped over them on the way out of the plane .
" I was afraid that the airplane was going to explode , so I ran away . "
Aborted landing ?
Phuket Deputy Governor Worapot Ratthaseema said 42 people had been taken to hospital .
Five are said to be in critical condition .
Those injured included nationals from Australia , Britain , France , Iran , Ireland , Italy , the Netherlands , and Sweden .
At least 70 of the passengers were foreigners , officials said .
Both the pilot and co-pilot of the McDonnell Douglas MD - 82 are among those who escaped .
Survivors say the pilot circled the area hoping for the weather to clear before making his final disastrous approach .
The flight was approaching the airport when the pilot asked to abort the landing , an aviation official told Thai television .
" The control tower allowed it but the aircraft fell to the runway and the body broke , " he said .
One - Two - Go is one of Thailand 's first budget airlines .
It was set up in December 2003 as a subsidiary of Orient Thai Airways , and services domestic routes .
This is Thailand 's deadliest aviation accident since December 1998 , when 101 people were killed after a Thai Airways crashed on landing near another southern resort .
Mold In The White House Speaking of Phillip K. Dick ...
When it was released in 2002 , Minority Report was interpreted by some as an indictment of George Bush 's doctrine of preemption , which allowed the US to detain persons and attack nations on mere suspicions .
In anticipation of the film , I bought The Minority Report and Other Classic Stories , and was surprised to find that the titular story was not alone in predicting the foibles of the Bush administration .
In fact , the story immediately preceding The Minority Report was so eerily reminiscent that I kept waiting for Cheney to stroll into the scene .
The Mold of Yancy , despite the title , has nothing to do with fungi .
Terran agent Taverner is dispatched to Callisto to investigate the political situation when computer analysis shows the Callistian society inching toward totalitarianism .
Upon arrival , Taverner initially believes that the political assessment is incorrect , as he can find no overt signs of repression .
Then he learns of John Edward Yancy .
Every evening
Yancy takes to the airwaves , treating the Callistotes to charming little homilies and sage advice in his short , televised spots .
" A kind of home - spun philosopher , " one person describes him .
" Totally ordinary man ... A sort of talking almanac .
Pithy sayings on every topic .
Wise old saws : how to cure a chest cold .
What the trouble is back on Terra . "
Though supposedly unaffiliated with the government or the church , Yancy is admired by most inhabitants of the moon with an ardor that borders on reverence .
Taverner does a little poking around , and , upon reviewing the tapes of Yancy 's broadcasts , discovers something interesting : despite all his talking , Yancy almost never says anything :
Yancy had definite opinions on everything ... or mere they so definite ?
A strange suspicion was growing in [ Taverner ] .
On some topics , yes .
On minor issues , Yancy had exact rules , specific maxims drawn from mankind 's rich storehouse of folklore .
But major philosophical and political issues were something else again .
Getting out one of the many tapes listed under War , Taverner ran it through at random . " ... I 'm against war , " Yancy pronounced angrily ... " [ But ] I feel a planet must be strong .
We must not surrender ourselves meekly ... weakness invites attack and fosters aggression .
By being weak we promote war .
We must gird ourselves and protect those we love .
With all my heart and soul I 'm against useless wars ; but I say again , as I 've said many times before , a man must come forward and fight a just war .
He must not shrink from his responsibility .
War is a terrible thing .
But sometimes we must ... "
As he restored the tape , Taverner wondered just what the hell Yancy had said .
What were his views on war ?
They took up a hundred separate reels of tape ;
Yancy was always ready to hold forth on such vital and grandiose subjects as War , the Planet , God , Taxation .
But did he say anything ?
A cold chill crawled up Taverner 's spine .
On specific - and trivial - items there were absolute opinions : dogs are better than cats , grapefruit is too sour without a dash of sugar , it 's good to get up early in the morning , too much drinking is bad .
But on big topics ... an empty vacuum , filled with the vacant roll of high - sounding phrases .
A public that agreed with Yancy on war and taxes and God and planet agreed with absolutely nothing .
And with everything .
Taverner suspects that Yancy is more than just a freelance philosopher .
" Nobody [ is ] as harmless and vapid as John Edward Yancy , " he think , and delves deeper into the mystery .
Sure enough , an inside source named Sipling soon gives him the straight dope :
Yancy is completely computer generated , a fictitious figurehead created by the authorities .
" By authorities , you mean the governing council ? "
Sipling laughed sharply .
" I mean the trading syndicates that own this moon : lock , stock , and barrel . "
Why would the big corporations go through the trouble to foisting a charismatic but shallow leader on the people ?
Well , it seems that they want to start to war with a distant land , in the hopes of acquiring the other 's resources .
" To start a war they have to get the public lined up , " Sipling continues .
" Actually , the people here have nothing to gain .
A war would wipe out all the small operators - it would concentrate power in fewer hands - and they 're few enough already .
To get the eighty million people here behind the war , they need an indifferent , sheep - like public .
And they 're getting that . "

Um !
Here 's a quotation from another Yancy speech : " I realize how lucky we are to be alive , and to have ... the fine cities and houses , all the things God has given us to enjoy .
But we 've got to be careful .
We 've got to make sure we do n't lose these things .
There are forces that could weaken us .
Everything we 've built up for our loved ones , for our children , could be taken away from us overnight .
We must learn to be vigilant .
We must protect our liberties , our possessions , our way of life .
If we become divided , and fall to bickering among each other , we will be easy prey for our enemies . "
Psyche !
That text was actually taken from Psyche !
That text was actually taken from Bush 's speech on Monday Well , no , that quotation really did come from The Mold of Yancy .
But come on : you thought that was Bush for a second , there , did n't you ?
" I 've come to see the essential key to the Yancy character , " says Sipling near the end of the story .
" The key to the new type of person we 're growing , here .
It 's simple .
It 's the element that makes that person malleable enough to be led around .
All Yancy 's beliefs are insipid .
The key is thinness .
Every part of his ideology is diluted : nothing excessive .
We 've come as close as possible to no beliefs . . . you 've noticed that .
Wherever possible we 've cancelled attitudes out , left the person apolitical .
Without a viewpoint . "
" Sure , " Taverner agreed .
" But with the illusion of a viewpoint . "
" All aspects of personality have to be controlled ; we want the total person .
So a specific attitude has to exist for each concrete question .
In every respect , our rule is : Yancy believes the least troublesome possibility .
The most shallow .
The most simple , effortless view , the view that fails to go deep enough to stir any real thought . "
When Taverner and Sipling set out to undermine the Yancy project , and they do so by injecting some complexity into his speeches .
" What if Yancy sat down in the evening with his wife and grandson , and played a nice lively six - hour game of When Taverner and Sipling set out to undermine the Yancy project , and they do so by injecting some complexity into his speeches .
" What if Yancy sat down in the evening with his wife and grandson , and played a nice lively six - hour game of Kriegspiel ? "
Sipling says , as they plan their sabotage .
" Suppose his favorite books - instead of being western gun-toting anachronisms - were Greek tragedy ?
Suppose his favorite piece of music was Bach 's Art of the Fugue , not My Old Kentucky Home ? "
In related news , Bush was seen reading Albert Camus '
The Stranger a few weeks ago , and recently spoke of the Iraq war as " straining the psyche of our country . "
Maybe we 've got a Sipling in the White House , at long last .

Raise your hand if you know how to validate an email address .
For those of you with your hand in the air , put it down quickly before someone sees you .
It ’s an odd sight to see someone sitting alone at the keyboard raising his or her hand .
I was speaking metaphorically .
Before yesterday I would have raised my hand ( metaphorically ) as well .
I needed to validate an email address on the server .
Something I ’ve done a hundred thousand times ( seriously , I counted ) using a handy dandy regular expression in my personal library .
This time , for some reason , I decided to take a look at my underlying assumptions .
I had never actually read ( or even skimmed ) the RFC for an email address .
I simply based my implementation on my preconceived assumptions about what makes a valid email address .
You know what they say about assuming .
What I found out was surprising .
Nearly 100 % of regular expressions on the web purporting to validate an email address are too strict .
It turns out that the local part of an email address , the part before the @ sign , allows a lot more characters than you ’d expect .
According to section 2.3.10 of RFC 2821 which defines SMTP , the part before the @ sign is called the local part ( the part after being the host domain ) and it is only intended to be interpreted by the receiving host …
Consequently , and due to a long history of problems when intermediate hosts have attempted to optimize transport by modifying them , the local - part MUST be interpreted and assigned semantics only by the host specified in the domain part of the address .
Section section 3.4.1 of RFC 2822 goes into more detail about the specification of an email address ( emphasis mine ) .
An addr-spec is a specific Internet identifier that contains a locally interpreted string followed by the at - sign character ( “ @ ” , ASCII value 64 ) followed by an Internet domain .
The locally interpreted string is either a quoted - string or a dot - atom .
A dot - atom is a dot delimited series of atoms .
An atom is defined in section 3.2.4 as a series of alphanumeric characters and may include the following characters ( all the ones you need to swear in a comic strip ) …
! $ & * - = \^ ` | ~ # % ‘ + / ? _ { }
Not only that , but it ’s also valid ( though not recommended and very uncommon ) to have quoted local parts which allow pretty much any character .
Quoting can be done via the backslash character ( what is commonly known as escaping ) or via surrounding the local part in double quotes .
RFC 3696 , Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names , was written by the author of the SMTP protocol ( RFC 2821 ) as a human readable guide to SMTP .
In section 3 , he gives some examples of valid email addresses .
These are all valid email addresses !

Note : Gotta love the author for using my favorite example person , Joe Blow .
Quick , run these through your favorite email validation method .
Do they all pass ?
For fun , I decided to try and write a regular expression ( yes , I know I now have two problems .
Thanks . ) that would validate all of these .
Here ’s what I came up with .
( The part in bold is the local part .
I am not worrying about checking my assumptions for the domain part for now . )
^( ?!\. ) ( " ( [ ^" \r\\ ] |\ \ [ " \r\\ ] ) * "
|( [ - a - z0 - 9 ! # $ %&'*+/=?^_`{ |}~ ] |( ? @ [ a -z0 - 9 ] [ \w\ . -] *[ a - z0 - 9 ] \.[ a - z ] [ a - z\ . ] *[ a - z ] $
Note that this expression assumes case insensitivity options are turned on ( RegexOptions .
IgnoreCase for .NET ) .
Yeah , that ’s a pretty ugly expression .
I wrote a unit test to demonstrate all the cases this test covers .
Each row below is an email address and whether it should be valid or not .
[ RowTest ] [ Row ( @ " NotAnEmail " , false ) ] [ Row ( @ " @NotAnEmail " , false ) ] [ Row ( @ " " " test\\blah ""@example.com " , true ) ] [ Row ( @ " " " test\blah ""@example.com " , false ) ] [ Row ( " \" test\\\rblah \ " @example.com " , true ) ] [ Row ( " \" test\rblah \" @example.com " , false ) ] [ Row ( @ " " " test \ " " blah ""@example.com " , true ) ] [ Row ( @ " " " test " " blah ""@example.com " , false ) ] [ Row ( @ " customer/department@example.com " , true ) ] [ Row ( @ " $ A12345@example.com " , true ) ] [ Row ( @ " !def!xyz%abc@example.com " , true ) ] [ Row ( @ " _Yosemite.Sam@example.com " , true ) ] [ Row ( @ " ~@example.com " , true ) ] [ Row ( @ ".wooly@example.com " , false ) ] [ Row ( @ "wo..oly@example.com " , false ) ] [ Row ( @ " pootietang.@example.com " , false ) ] [ Row ( @ ".@example.com " , false ) ] [ Row ( @ " " " Austin@Powers ""@example.com " , true ) ] [ Row ( @ " Ima.Fool@example.com " , true ) ] [ Row ( @ " " " Ima.

IgnoreCase ) ; Assert .
AreEqual ( expected , regex .
IsMatch ( email ) , " Problem with ' " + email + " '.

Before you call me a completely anal nitpicky numnut ( you might be right , but wait anyways ) , I do n’t think this level of detail in email validation is absolutely necessary .
Most email providers have stricter rules than are required for email addresses .
For example , Yahoo requires that an email start with a letter .
There seems to be a standard stricter set of rules most email providers follow , but as far as I can tell it is undocumented .
I think I ’ll sign up for an email address like phil.h\@\@ck@haacked.com and start bitching at sites that require emails but do n’t let me create an account with this new email address .
Ooooooh I ’m such a troublemaker .
The lesson here is that it is healthy to challenge your preconceptions and assumptions once in a while and to never let me near an RFC .
UPDATES : Corrected some mistakes I made in reading the RFC .
See !
Even after reading the RFC I still do n’t know what the hell I ’m doing !
Just goes to show that programmers can’t read .
I updated the post to point to RFC 822 as well .

The media black - out on the scandal involving DC Madam Deborah Jeane Palfrey is surprising in light of the lack of lawsuits being leveled at the Wayne Madsen Report website .
Instead of Dick Cheney and the recently resigned Randall Tobias filing libel and slander lawsuits against the site , we see only their silence .
Moreover , the Wayne Madsen site has been continually expanding on this story - making this either the scoop of the century , or the biggest fairy tale in DC history .
Consider this : WMR is now reporting specifically who at ABC News ' 20/20 became fully aware of not only Cheney 's use of the escort service , but dozens more " high profile " names - culled from the phone records only since 2002 ( the escort services full records go back to 1994 ) .
ABC 's crack team was reportedly gagged by their bosses after concerned calls from the White House .
This would be amazing if true , yet no White House denial has been forthcoming as of this writing ...
WMR also reports that the DC Madam first came under DOJ scrutiny after US Attorney Thomas DiBiagio got a crooked cop Ed Norris ( a pal of NYC Police Commish Bernard Kerik ) to squeal on the escort service in May 2004 , admitting the service had received illicit payouts from official police funds .
Less then a year after Norris was hired as State Superintendent by Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich , another US Attorney , Johnathan Luna , who had also investigated Norris and Kerik back in NY turned up murdered in December of 2003 .
Luna at the time was working under DiBagio on the DC Madam case , finding Ehrlich and lobbyist Jack Abramoff were DC Madam clients .
Then , DiBiagio became the first U.S. Attorney fired by the Justice Department after Bush 's re-election in 2004 .
Vastly underreported , DiBagio's probe had linked Republican governor Ehrlich to Bob Ney , Tom DeLay , Duke Cunningham and others but the investigation died when he was fired .
It was n't until Palfrey attempted to leave the country and sell her house that interest in the DC Madam was revived .
A warrant eventually seized her assets .
WMR reports that one DC law firm representing Saudi clients turned up on the phone list and that another patron on the list was a client of the law firm of Bracewell & Giuliani .
Though Madsen can be a little quick to speculate , he stands by his claim , purportedly confirmed by three different sources , that Cheney 's beltway phone number appeared in the records numerous time when he was CEO of Halliburton .
No major media has picked up the story , though David Letterman mentioned it in a recent monologue , quipping that Cheney paid the hooker $ 2 billion dollars .
Washington
Post did cover an aspect of the story but omitted any mention of Cheney .
As white supremacist publishes home addresses of civil rights leaders , FBI mum Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday September 27 , 2007

The white supremacist who posted the home addresses of five members of the so - called " Jena 6 " on a website says he also plans to reveal the personal information of Rev. Jesse Jackson .
He has already posted what he claims are addresses for Rev. Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III on his blog , which also carries the Jena addresses .
" I know where Sharpton lives , " Bill White , head of the American National Socialist Workers Party , said in a phone interview late Sunday night .
" Jesse Jackson , too . "
On his blog , which is part of Google 's Blogger network , White published four separate addresses for Sharpton , including a listing that purported to be the home of the reverend 's mother .
An Atlanta address and phone number were listed for Mr. King .
King , Sharpton and Jackson have all been vocal supporters of six black teenagers charged last year with beating a white teenager at a high school in Jena , Louisiana .
Prior to the incident , the school had been the site of mounting racial tensions , including the hanging of nooses from a tree on campus .
Sharpton tells Raw : FBI efforts are n't being taken seriously " That addresses for my residencies and offices are now publicly listed on the web page of the Neo - Nazi group that continues to list the addresses of the Jena Six and their families is outrageous , " said Rev. Sharpton in an email statement on Tuesday to RAW STORY .
Sharpton added that the new development " shows they are now tagging leaders that have come to the aid of the Jena Six . "
" This illustrates why FBI efforts are n't taken seriously , " he continued , referring to a recent announcement from the FBI that it was launching a probe into White 's website .
" We are in Washington , DC , today asking for intervention by the federal government because this is tantamount to mocking them .
It also jeopardizes me and those that travel with me . "
Agent Sheila Thorne , of the FBI 's New Orleans field office , said in an email Thursday that " the FBI and our Law Enforcement Partners are aware of allegations that various threats have been made against those involved in the Jena Six case and their families . "
" Threats are taken seriously , " she said , but would not comment further citing ongoing investigations .
Following up on a story from the the Associated Press , which reported it had been unable to contact the extremist leader for comment regarding his publication of the Jena teens ' addresses , RAW STORY reached White by telephone at his Roanoke home late Sunday night .
During the call ,
White stopped short of directly calling for violence against the three civil rights activists , saying only that it was important that those angered by the leaders ' support for the Jena students " knew where to find them . "
" I 'm just going to put the information up there so people can tell them how they feel , " he said , adding that he had just spoken with members of his " Illinois unit " about " going outside of Jesse Jackson 's house . "
White was far less cautious in discussing his posting last week of address and phone information for the five teenagers charged with beating 17 - year - old fellow student Justin Barker .
" If they 're acquitted , " White said of the black teens , " they should be murdered .
Hang them in the public square . "
" If the legal system should fail , " he continued , " then clearly there would be no law against murder , and it should be legal to go and lynch them . "
Civil rights expert :
White may be a ' pig , ' but probably broke no laws
As incendiary as White 's tactics and comments may be , the Southern Poverty Law Center 's Mark Potok says it 's unlikely authorities have much of a case .
" White understands the First Amendment pretty well .
He 's a pig , but I think it 's pretty clear that what he 's done is legal , " Potok said , although he was quick to point out he is not a lawyer .
Potok , a civil rights expert who edits the Center 's Intelligence Report , which tracks hate groups across the country , says he doubts
White 's most recent postings -- or his comments to Raw Story -- meet the standard required for charging White with a federal crime .
" Typically , the courts have found that there needs to be a direct incitement to act .
One piece of it is an ' excited atmosphere , " he continued , explaining that White would likely have to be on the scene in Jena promoting a specific violent act in order to be in violation .
" Basically there has to be a real immediacy to criminal incitements , " Potok said , adding that his own personal information has been posted by White multiple times .
" I can say ' all police officers ought to be killed ' and that is absolutely protected .
There 's nothing to do ; it 's unfortunate . "
White first showed up on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2003 , when the then 26 - year - old was profiled in a compendium of budding extremists called " 40 to Watch . "
" These people need more than an investigation .
They need protection , " Rev. Jesse Jackson told the Associated Press about the Jena 6 and their families on Sunday , saying he would " be in touch " with US Attorney General nominee Michael Mukasey .
The AP also reported that the aunt of one of the Jena students charged , Bryant Purvis , had received calls at the number posted on White 's site , including one incident where a caller " used the N - word to her young son . "
" Public attacks on private citizens done out of ignorance and hatred is appalling , and anyone who stoops to such unspeakable persecution will be investigated and subject to the full penalty of law , " Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco said in a statement .
White ran a ' skiptrace ' on Jena teens Asked how he'd tracked down the Jena address information , White explained it was a matter of some high - tech detective work .
" I ran a skiptrace on it , " he said , referring to a term used by private investigators about the process of uncovering an individual 's location .
" I used software .
It 's only a town of 3,000 people ... I ran their names , did a little cross- referencing , did a few phone calls and found out where all of them live . "
White 's main website was down briefly Sunday when web host Randy Armbrecht pulled the plug following unspecified email threats .
" Randy was threatened ... he tried to hide from the publicity , " White told RAW STORY .
The site has been given a temporary home on the internet server of white nationalist and radio host Hal Turner , who says at his site that " a media firestorm and FBI investigation seem to have stifled Bill White 's free speech . "
White 's blog has apparently been found to be in violation of Blogger 's terms of service prohibiting violent or hateful content , but the site has still been intermittently accessible over the past few days .
As to the legality of his actions , White is confident he has little to fear from law enforcement .
" They 'd have to prove that I was on my way to Jena to lynch somebody , " he said , noting that he was worth " more than a little bit of money " and had retained the services of four lawyers .
" The FBI investigates me every two or three months .
Everybody is always shocked they do n't come and arrest me . "

Should some civilian order you to initiate a nuclear attack on Iran , you are duty - bound to refuse that order

An Open Letter to the New Generation of Military Officers Serving and Protecting Our Nation
By Dr. Robert M. Bowman , Lt. Col. , USAF , ret. , National Commander , The Patriots
Dear Comrades in Arms ,
You are facing challenges in 2007 that we of previous generations never dreamed of .
I ’m just an old fighter pilot ( 101 combat missions in Vietnam , F - 4 Phantom , Phu Cat , 1969 - 1970 ) who ’s now a disabled veteran with terminal cancer from Agent Orange .
Our mailing list ( over 22,000 ) includes veterans from all branches of the service , all political parties , and all parts of the political spectrum .
We are Republicans and Democrats , Greens and Libertarians , Constitutionists and Reformers , and a good many Independents .
What unites us is our desire for a government that ( 1 ) follows the Constitution , ( 2 ) honors the truth , and ( 3 ) serves the people .
We see our government going down the wrong path , all too often ignoring military advice , and heading us toward great danger .
And we look to you who still serve as the best hope for protecting our nation from disaster .
We see the current Iraq War as having been unnecessary , entered into under false pretenses , and horribly mismanaged by the civilian authorities .
Thousands of our brave troops have been needlessly sacrificed in a futile attempt at occupation of a hostile land .
Many more thousands have suffered wounds which will change their lives forever .
Tens of thousands have severe psychological problems because of what they have seen and what they have done .
Potentially hundreds of thousands could be poisoned by depleted uranium , with symptoms appearing years later , just as happened to us exposed to Agent Orange .
The military services are depleted and demoralized .
The VA system is under - funded and overwhelmed .
The National Guard and Reserves have been subjected to tour after tour , disrupting lives for even the lucky ones who return intact .
Jobs have been lost , marriages have been destroyed , homes have been foreclosed , and children have been estranged .
And for what ?
We have lost allies , made new enemies , and created thousands of new terrorists , further endangering the American people .
But you know all this .
I ’m sure you also see the enormous danger in a possible attack on Iran , possibly with nuclear weapons .
Such an event , seriously contemplated by the Cheney faction of the Bush administration , would make enemies of Russia and China and turn us into the number one rogue nation on earth .
The effect on our long - term national security would be devastating .
Some of us had hoped that the new Democratic Congress would end the occupation of Iraq and take firm steps to prevent an attack on Iran , perhaps by impeaching Bush and Cheney .
These hopes have been dashed .
The lily - livered Democrats have caved in , turning their backs on those few ( like Congressman Jack Murtha ) who understand the situation .
Many of us have personally walked the halls of Congress , to no avail .
This is where you come in .
We know that many of you share our concern and our determination to protect our republic from an arrogant , out - of - control , imperial presidency and a compliant , namby - pamby Congress ( both of which are unduly influenced by the oil companies and other big- money interests ) .
We know that you ( like us ) would n’t have pursued a military career unless you were idealistic and devoted to our nation and its people .
( None of us do it for the pay and working conditions ! )
But we also recognize that you may not see how you can influence these events .
We in the military have always had a historic subservience to civilian authority .
Perhaps I can help with whatever wisdom I ’ve gathered from age ( I retired in 1978 , so I am ancient indeed ) .
Our oath of office is to “ protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic . ”
Might I suggest that this includes a rogue president and vice - president ?
Certainly we are bound to carry out the legal orders of our superiors .
But the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) which binds all of us enshrines the Nuremberg Principles which this country established after World War II ( which you are too young to remember ) .
One of those Nuremberg Principles says that we in the military have not only the right , but also the DUTY to refuse an illegal order .
It was on this basis that we executed Nazi officers who were “ only carrying out their orders . ”
The Constitution which we are sworn to uphold says that treaties entered into by the United States are the “ highest law of the land , ” equivalent to the Constitution itself .
Accordingly , we in the military are sworn to uphold treaty law , including the United Nations charter and the Geneva Convention .
Based on the above , I contend that should some civilian order you to initiate a nuclear attack on Iran ( for example ) , you are duty - bound to refuse that order .
I might also suggest that you should consider whether the circumstances demand that you arrest whoever gave the order as a war criminal .
I know for a fact that in recent history ( once under Nixon and once under Reagan ) , the military nuclear chain of command in the White House discussed these things and were prepared to refuse an order to “ nuke Russia . ”
In effect they took the ( non-existent ) “ button ” out of the hands of the President ..
We were thus never quite as close to World War III as many feared , no matter how irrational any president might have become .
They determined that the proper response to any such order was , “ Why , sir ? ” Unless there was ( in their words ) a “ damn good answer , ” nothing was going to happen .
I suggest that if you in this generation have not had such a discussion , perhaps it is time you do .
In hindsight , it ’s too bad such a discussion did not take place prior to the preemptive “ shock and awe ” attack on Baghdad .
Many of us at the time spoke out vehemently that such an attack would be an impeachable offense , a war crime against the people of Iraq , and treason against the United States of America .
But our voices were drowned out and never reached the ears of the generals in 2003 .
I now regret that I never sent a letter such as this at that time , but depended on the corporate media to carry my message .
I must not make that mistake again .
Also in hindsight , President Bush could be court - martialed for abuse of power as Commander - in - Chief .
Vice President Cheney could probably be court - martialed for his performance as Acting Commander - in - Chief in the White House bunker the morning of September 11 , 2001 .
We in the U.S. military would never consider a military coup , removing an elected president and installing one of our own .
But following our oath of office , obeying the Nuremberg Principles , and preventing a rogue president from committing a war crime is not a military coup .
If it requires the detention of executive branch officials , we will not impose a military dictatorship .
We will let the Constitutional succession take place .
This is what we are sworn to .
This is protecting the Constitution , our highest obligation .
In 2007 , this is what is meant by “ Duty , Honor , Country . ”
Thank you all for your service to this nation .
May God bless America , and sustain us in this difficult time .
And thanks for listening to the musings of an old junior officer .
Respectfully ,
Robert M. Bowman , PhD , Lt. Col. , USAF , ret .

zuzara.comの各サービスはロリポップのサーバで運営されています。日頃の感謝を込めて月額263円のサービスを「ホリデープログラミング」する上でいかに使い倒しているか紹介したいと思います。
安い
ムームードメインで独自ドメインの.comを買っても初年度約5000円の投資のみ。これは、ものすごいコストパフォーマンスだと思う。
サブドメイ ン
バーチャルホストと思われる設定をWeb上の管理画面から行え、サブドメインが無制限に作れる。（ドキュメントに明記されていない模様だが制限はあるかもしれない）各サービスごとに絶対パスが/になってくれるので管理がちょっと楽。
PHP +MySQL
2009年6月現在はPHP5を選択できるようになった。今から使うのであれば自動的に5になる。バージョンは5.2.6。コンパイルオプションは以下。curlやopensslが使えるようになった。5から登場のPDOやjsonも使える。
'./configure ' '-- prefix=/usr/local/php5 ' '-- sysconfdir=/usr/local/php5/etc ' '--with-config-file-path=/usr/local/php5/lib ' '-- disable - debug ' '-- enable- bcmath=yes ' '-- enable - debug=no ' '-- enable - discard - path ' '-- enable - dom ' '-- enable-exif ' '-- enable-force-cgi-redirect ' '-- enable - ftp ' '-- enable-gd-native-ttf ' '-- enable-magic-quotes=yes ' '-- enable - mbregex ' '-- enable - mbstring ' '-- enable - safe- mode ' '-- enable- simplexml ' '-- enable - soap ' '-- enable - sockets ' '-- enable-sqlite-utf8 ' '-- enable-zend-multibyte ' '-- with-curl ' '-- with-bz2 ' '-- with-gettext=/usr/local ' '-- with-iconv ' '-- with-iconv-dir=/usr/local/include ' '-- with-gd ' '-- with-jpeg-dir=/usr/local ' '-- with-png-dir=/usr/local ' '-- with-freetype-dir=/usr/local ' '-- with-ttf ' '-- with-zlib=/usr ' '-- with-zlib-dir=/usr ' '-- with - ttf ' '-- with-openssl ' '-- with-mcrypt=/usr/local ' '-- with-xsl=/usr/local ' '-- with-xmlrpc ' '-- with-mysql=/usr ' '-- with-pcre-dir=/usr ' '-- with-pear=/usr/local/php5/php ' '-- with-pdo-mysql=/usr ' '-- with-pdo-pgsql=/usr ' '-- with - pdo-sqlite ' '-- with-pgsql=/usr ' '-- with- sqlite '
PHPは2006年7月現在4.3.11でコンパイルオプションは以下。gdが動くので特に困ったことはない。
'./configure ' '-- enable - ftp ' '-- with-mysql ' '-- with - gd ' '-- with - ttf ' '-- with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs ' '-- enable - track - vars ' '-- enable - trans - sid ' '-- enable-zend-multibyte ' '-- enable - mbstring ' '-- enable - mbregex ' '-- enable-mbstr-enc- trans ' '-- enable-memory - limit ' '-- enable - sockets ' '-- with-jpeg-dir=/usr ' '-- with-png-dir=/usr ' '-- with-freetype-dir=/usr ' '-- with-zlib-dir=/usr ' '-- enable - exif ' '-- with-dom=/usr/local ' '-- with-dom-xslt ' '-- enable-xslt ' '-- with-xslt-sablot '
MySQL3.23.49はphpMyAdminで管理。データベースは1つしか作れない。
*.so
PHP5 での動作は未確認。特に必要ないだろう。
PHP4環境ではdlで拡張できてしまう。php-jsonやADOdb辺りが便利。コンパイルは別の環境で行ってsoファイルをアップロードすれば使える。
ローカルに開発環境は必要
ロリポップはFTPしか使えないので開発環境はローカルにないと不便。FTPは昔からFFFTP。
自分は先日無料になっ たVirtualPC2004上のWhiteBoxLinuxでSambaを動かしてWindowsのgvimで編集している。なおVirtualPCはCentOS4などいくつかのOSがインストールできないので要注意。（動作確認したOS一覧が表になったページがあったが失念⇒コメントで教えていただきました：What Works and What Does n’t in Microsoft Virtual PC 2004 ）
他にもVMwareやcoLinuxも無料で使える。
追記 ：
最近は Mac 使いなのでそのまま apache +mysql+php 環境が整う 。Windows なら VMware を使うところ 。
PEAR
PHP のPEAR はデフォルトではあまり充実していないので自分でPEARのサイトからダウンロードして解凍、必要なファイルをアップロードする必要がある。一番使っているのがCache_Lite。
Cache_Liteのベースになるコード。
<? php require_once ' Cache / Lite.php ' ; $ cacheOptions = array ( ' cacheDir ' => ' tmp / ' , ' lifeTime ' => 3600 , // seconds ) ; $ cache Id = $url ; $ objCache = new Cache_Lite ( $cacheOptions ) ; if ( $ cache = $ objCache - > get ( $ cacheId ) ) { $ buf = $ cache ; } else { $ buf = file_get_contents ( $url ) ; $ objCache - > save ( $buf , $ cacheId ) ; } ?>
参考：
ブラウザか らPEARをインストールする
cron
cronは使えない。どうしても必要な時は別のcronが使えるサーバからping（HTTPでアクセスするだけ）して代用。
. htaccess
PHP5環境では.htaccessやini_setで設定を変えられない。ロリポップのユーザ画面から設定できる項目は以下に載っている。PHP4のときに設定できた項目のため、という雰囲気だが display_errors の設定ができないのが痛い。（2009年6月現在ロリポップに問い合わせ中 => 要望として受け入れられた模様）
php.iniの設定が古めなので必須。
php_flag register_globals
Off php_value error_reporting 2047 php_flag display_errors
Off php_flag log_errors
On php_value error_log ログへのパ ス
見られたくないディレクトリ用 。PukiWiki参照。
Order allow , deny Deny from all
mod_rewriteも動く。2.0っぽいきれいなURLを実現。Zend_Framework参照。
RewriteEngine on RewriteRule !\.( html|txt|js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css ) $ index.php
404ページはロリポのページなので設定しておいた方が無難。
ErrorDocument 404 /notfound.php
ErrorDocument 403 /notfound.php
MySQLのコネクション数の制限が厳しい
共有サーバだけあって若干重い。MySQLのToo many connectionsエラーが比較的目に付く。PEARのCache_Liteなどでキャッシュする必要がある。
静的なページなら1日2万PVぐらいは平気。ただ、PVが増えるとHDDの容量が（おそらくはapacheのログで）すぐいっぱいになってしまうので月額+105円で500MBまで増やす必要が出てくるかも。
ちなみに容量を一度増やすと減らせないので( 月額料金はずっと増えたまま)要注意。
追記 ：
2009年6月29日から月額は同じで容量が1GBに増える。また、契約更新時に増量プランから元に戻せるそうだ。
アクセス解析は別サービスの方がよさげ
管理画面からanalogの解析結果を見れるが、GoogleAnalyticsの方が断然いい。一応、apacheの生ログもホスト名ごと、日別にダウンロードできる。リアルタイムではなく、半日ほどずれて昨日のログがダウンロードできる、という具合。
というわけでおすすめです、ロリポップ。
Republican mayor of San Diego flips to support gay marriage David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday September 20 , 2007
Print This Email This The Republican mayor of San Diego , Jerry Sanders , announced in a highly emotional speech on Wednesday that he had decided not to veto a council resolution that would have reversed California 's ban on same sex unions .
" My opinions on this issue have evolved significantly , " he stated " as I think the opinions of millions of Americans from all walks of life have . "
Sanders , who was police chief before becoming mayor , had originally intended to veto the resolution in order to remain consistent with his campaign promises and with the sentiment of most of his supporters , and he changed his mind only at the last minute .
" The arrival of the resolution to sign or veto in my office late last night , " said Sanders , choking up with emotion , " forced me to reflect and search my soul for the right thing to do .
I 've decided to lead with my heart ... and to take a stand on behalf of equality and social justice . "
" I just could not bring myself to tell an entire group of people in our community they were less important , less worthy , or less deserving of the rights and responsibilities of marriage , " Sanders continued .
" The concept of a separate but equal institution is not something I can support . "
" I have close family members and friends who are a member of the gay and lesbian community .
Those folks include my daughter Lisa as well as members of my personal staff , " said Sanders , nearly breaking down in tears .
" In the end , I could n't look any of them in the face and tell them that their relationship , their very lives were any less meaningful than the marriage I share with my wife . "
The following video is from CNN's Newsroom , broadcast on September 19 .
A scarce commodity
The problem with writing in games is that we point out when it 's terrible , but we do n't praise it enough when it 's good .
Consider Half - Life 2 .
Half - Life 2 : the writing
helped as much as the graphics
In the beginning of the game , you 're just another desperate citizen pushed through processing before entering the city .
People around you are muttering , and if this is your first time playing , you 'll likely amazed by the graphics and the Source engine .
It 's beautiful .
Then the megascreen on the building pops up and Dr. Breen appears to explain why the aliens have taken away our ability to reproduce .
The quality of the writing makes it worth quoting at length :
Let me read a letter I recently received .
" Dear Dr. Breen .
Why has the Combine seen fit to suppress our reproductive cycle ?
Sincerely , A Concerned Citizen . "
Thank you for writing , Concerned .
Of course your question touches on one of the basic biological impulses , with all its associated hopes and fears for the future of the species .
I also detect some unspoken questions .
Do our benefactors really know what 's best for us ?
What gives them the right to make this kind of decision for mankind ?
Will they ever deactivate the suppression field and let us breed again ?
Allow me to address the anxieties underlying your concerns , rather than try to answer every possible question you might have left unvoiced .
First , let us consider the fact that for the first time ever , as a species , immortality is in our reach .
This simple fact has far - reaching implications .
It requires radical rethinking and revision of our genetic imperatives .
It also requires planning and forethought that run in direct opposition to our neural pre-sets .
I find it helpful at times like these to remind myself that our true enemy is Instinct .
Instinct was our mother when we were an infant species .
Instinct coddled us and kept us safe in those hardscrabble years when we hardened our sticks and cooked our first meals above a meager fire and started at the shadows that leapt upon the cavern 's walls .
But inseparable from Instinct is its dark twin , Superstition .
Instinct is inextricably bound to unreasoning impulses , and today we clearly see its true nature .
Instinct has just become aware of its irrelevance , and like a cornered beast , it will not go down without a bloody fight .
Instinct would inflict a fatal injury on our species .
Instinct creates its own oppressors , and bids us rise up against them .
Instinct tells us that the unknown is a threat , rather than an opportunity .
Instinct slyly and covertly compels us away from change and progress .
Instinct , therefore , must be expunged .
It must be fought tooth and nail , beginning with the basest of human urges :
The urge to reproduce .
We should thank our benefactors for giving us respite from this overpowering force .
They have thrown a switch and exorcised our demons in a single stroke .
They have given us the strength we never could have summoned to overcome this compulsion .
They have given us purpose .
They have turned our eyes toward the stars .
Let me assure you that the suppressing field will be shut off on the day that we have mastered ourselves ... the day we can prove we no longer need it .
And that day of transformation , I have it on good authority , is close at hand .
This scene sent chills down my spine .
The human race has become a collection of cattle , shoved into the ghettos to be controlled and handled .
It was a terrifying portrait of lost humanity ; we did n't even have the ability to create new life .
That chill I felt was n't created by the graphics : the writing did it .
Half - Life 2 is loaded with powerful moments like this , and the writing worked with the technology to make the game a modern classic .
Bad writing could have turned the same game into a B - novel of the ripest variety .
But the very success of the game points up the weakness of game writing in general , and it begs the question : why do n't we have more examples of scenes like this ?
What , exactly , is the problem ?
This week , we 'll take a look at the problem .
Next week , we 'll talk to someone who 's part of the solution : Susan O'Connor , writer on titles like Gears of War and Bioshock .
TMZ has obtained a copy of the official birth certificate of the elusive Suri Cruise , daughter of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes .
The document , filed with the Los Angeles County Register - Recorder / County Clerk , was filed May 8 , 2006 .
( Click on document to download )
There are several interesting items of note :
First , St. John 's Hospital has a policy of filing birth certificates within 10 days of birth .
In this case , Suri was born on April 18 but the certificate was not filed until May 8 , 20 days later .
An official from the hospital told TMZ that the delay occurred because they needed a signature from the parents or a representative of the parents certifying birth , and that person did not come in until May 4 .
The person who signed is labeled " friend . "
The signature is not legible .
Also , the " Attendant or Certifier " who signed the certificate -- Anne Heffernan , RNC -- was not in the delivery room and did not see the baby .
But a hospital rep tells TMZ that Heffernan is authorized to sign when the doctor is not available .
A hospital rep said " normally the doctor signs " but it is n't a requirement .
Oliver Hill ( centre ) was part of a legal team that won key cases
He fought a series of lawsuits for racial equality , culminating in the 1954 Supreme Court ruling that school segregation was unconstitutional .
That decision set in motion fundamental changes in American society .
Mr Hill , who remained active in civil rights causes , said he only went to law school so he could fight segregation .
He graduated from Howard University in Washington in 1933 , winning his first civil rights case seven years later - gaining equal pay for black teachers in Norfolk , Virginia .
He went on to win a succession of cases , including on voting rights , jury employment rights and access to school buses for black Americans .
He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999
But he secured his place in history as part of the legal team fighting the landmark Brown v Board of Education case in 1954 .
The Supreme Court 's decision dismantled the legal basis for racial segregation in schools , so acting as a catalyst for the modern civil rights movement .
During his work in the 1940s and 1950s , Mr Hill and his family received so many death threats from white segregationists that he would not allow his son to answer the telephone .
Although blind and confined to a wheelchair in recent years , Mr Hill remained involved in civil rights causes .
In 1999 , he received the country 's highest award , the Presidential Medal of Freedom .

Uncovering the Veil Nebula
The NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope has photographed three magnificent sections of the Veil Nebula - the shattered remains of a supernova that exploded some 5 - 10,000 years ago .
The new Hubble images provide beautiful views of the delicate , wispy structure resulting from this cosmic explosion .
Although we do n't usually think about it , the stars twinkling in the night sky do n't shine forever .
How long a star lives depends on how big and heavy it is .
The bigger the star , the shorter its life .
When a star significantly heavier than our Sun runs out of fuel , it collapses and blows itself apart in a catastrophic supernova explosion .
A supernova releases so much light that it can outshine a whole galaxy of stars put together .
The exploding star sweeps out a huge bubble in its surroundings , fringed with actual stellar debris along with material swept up by the blast wave .
This glowing , brightly - coloured shell of gas forms a nebula that astronomers call a ' supernova remnant ' .
Such a remnant can remain visible long after the initial explosion fades away .
A series of three new images taken with the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope reveals magnificent sections of one of the most spectacular supernova remnants in the sky - the Veil Nebula .
The entire shell spans about 3 degrees , corresponding to about 6 full moons .
The small regions captured in the new Hubble images provide stunning close - ups of the Veil .
Fascinating smoke - like wisps of gas are all that remain visible of what was once a Milky Way star .
Scientists estimate that the supernova explosion occurred some 5 - 10,000 years ago and could have been witnessed and recorded by ancient civilizations .
These would have seen a star increase in brightness to roughly the brightness of the crescent Moon .
The intertwined rope - like filaments of gas in the Veil Nebula result from the enormous amounts of energy released as the fast - moving debris from the explosion ploughs into its surroundings and creates shock fronts .
These shocks , driven by debris moving at 600,000 kilometres per hour , heat the gas to millions of degrees .
It is the subsequent cooling of this material that produces the brilliantly coloured glows .
Like the larger scale ground - based observations , the high - resolution Hubble images display two characteristic features : sharp filaments and diffuse emission .
These correspond to two different viewing geometries : sharp filaments correspond to an edge - on view of a shock front , and diffuse emission corresponds to a face - on view of it .
The Hubble images of the Veil Nebula are striking examples of how processes that take place hundreds of light - years away can sometimes resemble effects we see around us in our daily life .
The structures have similarities to the patterns formed by the interplay of light and shadow on the bottom of a swimming pool , rising smoke or ragged cirrus clouds .
Why are astronomers interested in studying supernovae and their remnants ?
Supernovae are extremely important for understanding our own Milky Way .
Although only a few stars per century in our Galaxy will end their lives in this spectacular way , these explosions are responsible for making all chemical elements heavier than iron in the Universe .
Many elements , such as copper , mercury , gold , iodine and lead that we see around us here on Earth today were forged in these violent events billions of years ago .
The expanding shells of supernova remnants were mixed with other material in the Milky Way and became the raw material for new generations of stars and planets .
The chemical elements that constitute the Earth , the planets and animals we see around us - and as a matter of fact our very selves - were built deep inside ancient stars and in the supernova explosions that result in the nebula we are seeing here .
The green in the grass and the red of our blood are indeed the colours of stardust .
The Veil Nebula is a prototypical middle - aged supernova remnant , and is an ideal laboratory for studying the physics of supernova remnants : it is fairly nearby , has a large angular size and has a relatively small amount of foreground extinction .
Also known as Cygnus Loop , the Veil Nebula is located in the constellation of Cygnus , the Swan .
It is about 1,500 light - years away from Earth .
One of the most remarkable parts of the remnant is the so - called Witch 's Broom Nebula ( seen to the right in the overview image ) .
The bright blue star - dubbed 52 Cygni and unrelated to the supernova explosion - can be observed with the naked eye on a clear summer 's night .
The Hubble images were taken with Hubble 's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 ( WFPC2 ) .
The colour is produced by composite of three different images .
The different colours indicate emission from different kinds of atoms excited by the shock : blue shows oxygen , green shows sulphur , and red shows hydrogen .

Two people are sitting in a room together : an experimenter and a subject .
The experimenter gets up and closes the door , and the room becomes quieter .
The subject is likely to believe that the experimenter 's purpose in closing the door was to make the room quieter .
This is an example of correspondent inference theory .
People tend to infer the motives – and also the disposition – of someone who performs an action based on the effects of his actions , and not on external or situational factors .
If you see someone violently hitting someone else , you assume it 's because he wanted to – and is a violent person – and not because he 's play - acting .
If you read about someone getting into a car accident , you assume it 's because he 's a bad driver and not because he was simply unlucky .
And – more importantly for this column – if you read about a terrorist , you assume that terrorism is his ultimate goal .
It 's not always this easy , of course .
If someone chooses to move to Seattle instead of New York , is it because of the climate , the culture or his career ?
Edward Jones and Keith Davis , who advanced this theory in the 1960s and 1970s , proposed a theory of " correspondence " to describe the extent to which this effect predominates .
When an action has a high correspondence , people tend to infer the motives of the person directly from the action : e.g. , hitting someone violently .
When the action has a low correspondence , people tend to not to make the assumption : e.g. , moving to Seattle .
Like most cognitive biases , correspondent inference theory makes evolutionary sense .
In a world of simple actions and base motivations , it 's a good rule of thumb that allows a creature to rapidly infer the motivations of another creature .
( He 's attacking me because he wants to kill me . )
Even in sentient and social creatures like humans , it makes a lot of sense most of the time .
If you see someone violently hitting someone else , it 's reasonable to assume that he 's a violent person .
Cognitive biases are n’t bad ; they ’re sensible rules of thumb .
But like all cognitive biases , correspondent inference theory fails sometimes .
And one place it fails pretty spectacularly is in our response to terrorism .
Because terrorism often results in the horrific deaths of innocents , we mistakenly infer that the horrific deaths of innocents is the primary motivation of the terrorist , and not the means to a different end .
I found this interesting analysis in a paper by Max Abrams in International Security .
" Why Terrorism Does Not Work " ( . PDF ) analyzes the political motivations of 28 terrorist groups : the complete list of " foreign terrorist organizations " designated by the U.S. Department of State since 2001 .
He lists 42 policy objectives of those groups , and found that they only achieved them 7 percent of the time .
According to the data , terrorism is more likely to work if 1 ) the terrorists attack military targets more often than civilian ones , and 2 ) if they have minimalist goals like evicting a foreign power from their country or winning control of a piece of territory , rather than maximalist objectives like establishing a new political system in the country or annihilating another nation .
But even so , terrorism is a pretty ineffective means of influencing policy .
There 's a lot to quibble about in Abrams ' methodology , but he seems to be erring on the side of crediting terrorist groups with success .
( Hezbollah 's objectives of expelling both peacekeepers and Israel out of Lebanon counts as a success , but so does the " limited success " by the Tamil Tigers of establishing a Tamil state . )
Still , he provides good data to support what was until recently common knowledge : Terrorism does n't work .
This is all interesting stuff , and I recommend that you read the paper for yourself .
But to me , the most insightful part is when Abrams uses correspondent inference theory to explain why terrorist groups that primarily attack civilians do not achieve their policy goals , even if they are minimalist .
Abrams writes :
The theory posited here is that terrorist groups that target civilians are unable to coerce policy change because terrorism has an extremely high correspondence .
Countries believe that their civilian populations are attacked not because the terrorist group is protesting unfavorable external conditions such as territorial occupation or poverty .
Rather , target countries infer the short - term consequences of terrorism – the deaths of innocent civilians , mass fear , loss of confidence in the government to offer protection , economic contraction , and the inevitable erosion of civil liberties – ( are ) the objects of the terrorist groups .
In short , target countries view the negative consequences of terrorist attacks on their societies and political systems as evidence that the terrorists want them destroyed .
Target countries are understandably skeptical that making concessions will placate terrorist groups believed to be motivated by these maximalist objectives .
In other words , terrorism does n't work , because it makes people less likely to acquiesce to the terrorists ' demands , no matter how limited they might be .
The reaction to terrorism has an effect completely opposite to what the terrorists want ; people simply do n't believe those limited demands are the actual demands .
This theory explains , with a clarity I have never seen before , why so many people make the bizarre claim that al Qaeda terrorism – or Islamic terrorism in general – is " different " : that while other terrorist groups might have policy objectives , al Qaeda 's primary motivation is to kill us all .
This is something we have heard from President Bush again and again – Abrams has a page of examples in the paper – and is a rhetorical staple in the debate .
( You can see a lot of it in the comments to this previous essay . )
In fact , Bin Laden 's policy objectives have been surprisingly consistent .
Abrams lists four ; here are six from former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer 's book Imperial Hubris :
End U.S. support of Israel Force American troops out of the Middle East , particularly Saudi Arabia End the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan and ( subsequently ) Iraq End U.S. support of other countries ' anti-Muslim policies End U.S. pressure on Arab oil companies to keep prices low End U.S. support for " illegitimate " ( i.e. moderate ) Arab governments , like Pakistan
Although Bin Laden has complained that Americans have completely misunderstood the reason behind the 9/11 attacks , correspondent inference theory postulates that he 's not going to convince people .
Terrorism , and 9/11 in particular , has such a high correspondence that people use the effects of the attacks to infer the terrorists ' motives .
In other words , since Bin Laden caused the death of a couple of thousand people in the 9/11 attacks , people assume that must have been his actual goal , and he 's just giving lip service to what he claims are his goals .
Even Bin Laden 's actual objectives are ignored as people focus on the deaths , the destruction and the economic impact .
Perversely , Bush ’s misinterpretation of terrorists ' motives actually helps prevent them from achieving their goals .
None of this is meant to either excuse or justify terrorism .
In fact , it does the exact opposite , by demonstrating why terrorism does n't work as a tool of persuasion and policy change .
But we ’re more effective at fighting terrorism if we understand that it is a means to an end and not an end in itself ; it requires us to understand the true motivations of the terrorists and not just their particular tactics .
And the more our own cognitive biases cloud that understanding , the more we mischaracterize the threat and make bad security trade - offs .

How Security Companies Sucker Us With Lemons
Everyone that is learning how to do magic tricks would love to WOW their audience right ?
Well the best way to do that is by doing great tricks while putting on an entertaining performance at the same time .
Let me tell you how to do this one cool little card trick I know .
Take out two decks of cards and get a member of your audience to take one of the decks in their hands .
While you have the other deck , tell your volunteer … “ do everything that I do ” .
You want the spectator to do exactly what you do ( shuffle , mix and cut ) .
Honestly , it does n’t really matter what you get them to do because this part is done purely for entertainment purposes .
Acting and distracting are very important to a magician .
Now , exchange decks with your volunteer and say that the reason you are doing this is to show everyone that you are not tampering with the cards .
Shuffle your new deck a few times again but this time take a peek at the bottom card of your deck once you are done shuffling .
Now memorize this card ( do n’t let anyone see you do this .
This is the secret behind the trick ) .
Use your imagination to help you come up with a way that will allow you to take a peek without anyone noticing .
Once you memorize the bottom card , you are ready to go to the next step .
Put your deck on the table in front of you .
Now cut the deck and place the top half on the right side .
Take the top card from the pile on your left and ask your volunteer to remember it .
( you do n’t have to know what this card is , all you need to know is that bottom card that you memorized from before ) .
You do n’t need to see your volunteers card , and make sure neither your volunteer or the audience sees your card .
Take your volunteers card and place it on top of the pile on the right .
Now take the left pile and put it on top of the right pile .
The card that you memorized is now on top of your volunteers card .
Cut the deck one more time .
Now you will tell your volunteer to look through their deck for the card that they had picked and hold it face down .
Tell everyone that you are going to do the same thing .
Look through the deck for the card that you memorized .
The card underneath it is your volunteers card .
( If by chance the card that you memorized happens to be at the very bottom of the deck , your volunteers card will be the top card )
With both your card and your volunteers card face down , do something like counting to three to build suspense .
Then flip the cards over and show everyone that you picked the same card as your volunteer !
Now I know that this may be too basic for some of you , but for beginners , it ’s a good start .
So go practice it until you have it down perfect and then go show your friends that you know how to do magic tricks .
Activity measured in the anterior cingular cortex and the insula predict three seconds in advance whether we will perceive laser stimulation as more or less painful .
© ULg-CRC
The human brain anticipates our perception of the outside world .
For example , it is capable of predicting if we are going to perceive tactile stimulation of weak intensity or , on the contrary , if a more intense stimulation will be perceived more or less painfully .
If people can make these observations empirically , a team of researchers at the Coma Science Group of University of Liege ( Cyclotron Research Centre ) and Neurology Department at the University Hospital of Liege ( Belgium ) is today demonstrating it scientifically through measuring the spontaneous activity of the brain and the relationships between the different cerebral regions involved
In a study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , the team of scientists led by Dr Mélanie Boly and Dr Steven Laureys shows that the spontaneous activity measured in certain parts of the brain have a direct influence over our conscious perception and our perception of the intensity of pain .
‘ Our brain is never really at rest , but science does not have a good understanding of how the spontaneous and continuous activity of our neurons influences our perception of the world .
Our study contributes to lifting a corner of the veil over these mechanisms ’ , the researchers state .
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and laser stimulation of the skin ’s nervous structures ( stimulation in a thousandth of a second ) , the researchers brought to light the regions more specifically involved in this spontaneous brain activity .
Thus , the awareness of self and of our internal world is increasingly connected to the activity in a network that includes the precuneus and posterior cingular cortex and the temporoparietal junction .
However , awareness of our external world is linked to the activity measured in the thalamus and the frontoparietal lateral cortical zones .
As regards the anterior cingular cortex and the insular cortex , they predict whether the laser stimulation will be perceived as more or less painful .
These results improve our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in human consciousness and allow for a better understanding of why we are at times more " sensitive " to pain than we are at other times .
" Awareness has two components : awakening , on the one hand , and awareness of the environment ( the external world ) of self ( the internal world ) , on the other .
We knew the regions involved in awakening .
With this study , we will demonstrate now that awareness of our internal and external world has different neuronal correlates and how they interact " , the ULg researchers conclude .

US Troops Leave Wounded Aussie To Die In Iraq Posted by Pile ( 8059 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Mean People ]
An Australian private security operator was left for dead by American forces after he was seriously wounded during an ambush in southern Iraq .
The US refused to provide a helicopter to evacuate the wounded man after being told he was Australian , News Limited reports .
The Queensland man , who suffered severe leg and abdominal injuries , was delivered to Basra air base by a British road convoy more than seven hours after the attack .
The June 25 attack near the town of Al Zubair , 15 km southwest of Basra , was carried out by at least six gunmen and involved roadside bombs , small arms fire , and rocket - propelled grenades .
Two Toyota Landcruisers were destroyed in the attack .
Three of the man 's Iraqi colleagues , including an Iraqi interpreter , died in the attack .
The security operator underwent surgery at a British military hospital and was later evacuated out of Iraq .
He remains in the region in a serious but stable condition .

An Iraqi who was a key source of intelligence for MI5 has given the first ever full insider 's account of being seized by the CIA and bundled on to an illegal ' torture flight ' under the programme known as extraordinary rendition .
In a remarkable interview for The Observer , British resident Bisher al - Rawi has told how he was betrayed by the security service despite having helped keep track of Abu Qatada , the Muslim cleric accused of being Osama bin Laden 's ' ambassador in Europe ' .
He was abducted and stripped naked by US agents , clad in nappies , a tracksuit and shackles , blindfolded and forced to wear ear mufflers , then strapped to a stretcher on board a plane bound for a CIA ' black site ' jail near Kabul in Afghanistan .
He was taken on to the jail at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba before being released last March and returned to Britain after four years ' detention without charge .
He was thrown into the CIA 's ' Dark Prison , ' deprived of all light 24 hours a day in temperatures so low that ice formed on his food and water .
He was taken to Guantanamo in March 2003 and released after being cleared of any involvement in terrorism by a tribunal .
A report by Parliament 's intelligence and security committee last week disclosed that , although the Americans warned MI5 it planned to render al - Rawi in advance , in breach of international law , the British did not intervene on the grounds he did not have a UK passport .
The government claimed he was the responsibility of Iraq , which he fled as a teenager when his father was tortured by Saddam Hussein 's regime .

You were the well - muscled guy who joined our bowling group , a friend of that guy Ted ( sorry , I do n't remember your name ) , who bowled for a bit , taking off early .
I do n't blame you for hitting on our friend .
I get it , she 's cute .
But really , dude , flirting is a lot like fishing .
You cast out your bait in one spot a few times , and if you do n't get a nibble , you know that spot is n't working and move on .
You do n't keep trying .
It does n't matter how attracted you are to a girl , if she 's not into you , you 're wasting your time and energy , and likely just annoying her in the process .
I understand your confusion to an extent .
After all , if I had to judge , I 'd say there are probably lots of girls who flirt with you and find you cute .
You have decent features and a body you evidently put some work into .
But not every girl will be into you .
Some are married , some have a boyfriend , and some just do n't consider you their type .
Think about it -- if a fat , hairy woman who looked like a bulldog was following you around , trying to get with you , would you care how much she tried ?
Would any amount of flirting , cajoling , or attempted bribery with dinner or drinks change your mind ?
Of course not .
But you still did n't stop .
This is n't persistence on your part , it 's stupidity .
It does n't matter how many times you try .
You 're not going to get a no 200 times , only to have her spontaneously changer her mind on attempt number 201 .
If anything , your persistence serves as an annoyance , and lessens any chance you might have had .
I watched you crash and burn over and over again with amusement .
And keep in mind that the music was so loud that conversation was only possible very close with highly raised voices .
Your body language was that obvious , as was her frustration with you .
And for the record , she happens to not be into guys at all .
So you have no chance there .
She did n't want to say it because many people get uncomfortable with that -- there are a lot of bigots and idiots out there , and Arizona is still a largely conservative state .
But no matter what a girl 's orientation , if she 's not receptive to your flirting and is n't in to you within the first hour or so of interaction , she 's not going to be .
EVER .
Get it through your head , dude .
There are lots and lots of women out there in this world .
All you have to do is look around anywhere and you 'll realize how many beautiful women reside here , and many of them are pretty cool to boot .
So in the future , use a little intelligence when you flirt .
If you had , you might have noticed that the cute blond the next lane over was checking you out the entire night .
Now , granted , who knows what kind of girl she was , and whether she would have been anything more than a quick piece of casual fun ( my instincts , which are pretty good in this category , tell me no ) .
But flirting is about interacting with someone in a fun way , and whether or not it leads to something ( or whether you decide to / not to take it further ) would n't you have rather flirted with a girl who would have flirted back , instead of just making an ass out of yourself with a girl who clearly had absolutely no interest whatsoever ?
Guys , take heed -- if a girl does n't flirt back , it 's time to move on .
Get a clue , instead of branding yourself as an annoying jerk in her ( and her friend 's ) eyes .
A reader writes :
I 've just finished Graham Greene 's " Our Man in Havana " ( a marvelous summer read ) , and was struck by the relevance of one of the dialogs to your blog 's threads on torture .
The dialog is between the English protagonist , Wormold , and the Cuban military torturer , Capt .
Segura , over a game of checkers :
 Did you torture him ? ’
Captain Segura laughed .
 No .
He does n’t belong to the torturable class . ’
 I did n’t know there were class - distinctions in torture . ’
 Dear Mr Wormold , surely you realize there are people who expect to be tortured and others who would be outraged by the idea .
One never tortures except by a kind of mutual agreement . ’
 There ’s torture and torture .
When they broke up Dr Hasselbacher ’s laboratory they were torturing … ?’
 One can never tell what amateurs may do .
The police had no concern in that .
Dr Hasselbacher does not belong to the torturable class . ’
 Who does ? ’
 The poor in my own country , in any Latin American country .
The poor of Central Europe and the Orient .
Of course in your welfare states you have no poor , so you are untorturable .
In Cuba the police can deal as harshly as they like with émigrés from Latin America and the Baltic States , but not with visitors from your country or Scandinavia .
It is an instinctive matter on both sides .
Catholics are more torturable than Protestants , just as they are more criminal .
You see , I was right to make that king , and now I shall huff you for the last time . ’
 You always win , do n’t you ?
That ’s an interesting theory of yours . ’
 One reason why the West hates the great Communist states is that they do n’t recognize class - distinctions .
Sometimes they torture the wrong people .
So too of course did Hitler and shocked the world .
Nobody cares what goes on in our prisons , or in the prisons of Lisbon and Caracas , but Hitler was too promiscuous .
It was rather as though in your country a chauffeur had slept with a peeress . ’
 We ’re not shocked by that any longer . ’
 It is a great danger for everyone when what is shocking changes . ’
I think perhaps the masses in the US are not currently outraged by the Bush administration 's torture policy because they are torturing those of " the torturable class " - i.e. Arabs , Afghans , and other non-whites .
When they begin sending nice white boys off to be held without trial and tortured , perhaps there will finally be a real outcry .
What an odd thing to have to hope for .

Yet no one seems to notice , or care .
I feel like a guy spouting off about the emperor 's new clothes , except this emperor 's problem is that his wardrobe does n't fit .

So if you own a car , chances are you are buying gas .
Maybe a little , maybe a lot .
Either way we can vote with out dollars and try and choose the companies that hurt us ( and the planet ) the least .
This rewards these companies for trying to do good , and punished the other companies that fail to give a care .
The Sierra Club has compiles a lovely little list of who sucks and who does n’t in the oil industry .
With over 400 million ( !!!) gallons of gas purchased every single day it becomes clear that a concerted effort from consumers can very quickly change the way in which these companies operate .
These companies are among the largest and most powerful enterprises on the planet .
The complexity of their organization and activities , the vastness of their reach , and the huge number of variables involved make objective ranking difficult .
That said , it is possible to lump them into three general categories , as Sierra editorial interns Robynne Boyd and Sarah Ives do below : the “ bottom of the barrel ” ( ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips ) , the “ middle of the barrel ” ( Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron , Valero Energy Corporation , and Citgo ) , and the “ top of the barrel ” ( BP and Sunoco ) .
But you do n’t have to take our word for it :

Here is a little taste of the worst and the best .
The worst Exxon
Black Marks
ExxonMobil has received numerous fines and penalties from the EPA for its environmental violations .
International human - rights and environmental organizations from Amnesty International to Greenpeace have called for boycotts in response to the company ’s stance on climate change and its troubling human - rights history :
It ’s been more than 17 years since the disastrous Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska , and ExxonMobil still refuses to pay punitive damages .
Although the company has given $ 2.2 billion to help clean up Prince William Sound , many organizations say that amount is far too little to address lingering environmental problems .
In the past decade , ExxonMobil has also been responsible for hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil spilled in Nigeria and New York .
In 2001 , Sierra reported that ExxonMobil ’s pipeline project from Chad to the coast of Cameroon cuts through indigenous communities ’ rainforest homes .
Last January , the project generated new controversy when Chad ’s government diverted money generated from petroleum revenue away from poverty - relief and social programs .
In 2002 , the Political Economy Research Institute rated ExxonMobil the sixth - worst polluter in the United States based on EPA emissions data .
In 2005 , the EPA levied an $ 8.7 million civil penalty on ExxonMobil for its nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in Illinois , Louisiana , and Montana .
According to the EPA , these pollutants can increase the risk of childhood asthma and cause other environmental and health damages .
In addition to the penalty , the company will have to spend $ 9.6 million on environmental programs in communities near the refineries .
That same year , ExxonMobil emitted nearly 150 million metric tons of greenhouse gases .
A 2005 report by Jantzi Research ranked ExxonMobil below average for its social and environmental practices .
ExxonMobil has long maintained a close relationship with the Indonesian military , infamous for its human - rights abuses .
According to Amnesty International , Indonesian soldiers guarding the company ’s buildings have tortured and killed civilians .
Despite protests from millions of U.S. citizens , ExxonMobil still seeks to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
The Best Sunoco
Black Marks
In 2000 , a Sunoco pipeline spilled almost 200,000 gallons of oil into the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge near Philadelphia .
In 2005 , Sunoco reached a settlement with the EPA and agreed to pay a $ 2.7 million fine .
In 2005 , Sunoco paid more than $ 8 million in fines and penalties , which included two violations of the Pennsylvania Title V permit emission cap from 2001 to 2004 at the Marcus Hook Refinery , and a disagreement over Sunoco ’s compliance with the Reasonably Available Control Technology regulations .
The RACT process determines and requires the use of available control mechanisms to reduce or limit air emissions .
So as you can see its kind of a tossup .
Do you go with the REALLY evil company , or with the one that is just kind of evil .
You know the Devil , or maybe just a lesser imp .
Read the Full article for an eye opening look at the oil industry .
All good things come to an end eventually – even your college days of unlimited , high - bandwidth internet access , all - you - can - eat cafeteria food and cushy , part - time library jobs .
But what to do about it ?
Considering that much of what you learn now will be obsolete by the time you graduate , it 's tough to know what courses will best prepare you for the life of a working stiff .
But do n't despair :
Pick wisely and you 'll be well - positioned for work life by the time you graduate .
Here are some of the fastest - growing jobs and how you can prepare yourself for them by graduation day .
Ophthalmologist
Seemingly overnight , ophthalmology has become one of the most popular specialties for medical students .
Why ?
Quality of life .
It 's a medical field where you can set up practice on your own and control your own hours .
And let 's be real , how many ophthalmological emergencies will there be in a given year ?
Preparation : Work your tail off in college .
Ace the most competitive pre-med courses and get yourself into a top medical school .
When it comes to getting opthamology fellowships , you 're competing against students from all medical schools , so yours had better be good .
In the list of top 10 fastest growing professions from the Bureau of Labor , five of them involve serving baby boomers as they grow old .
( As if the world has not been serving baby boomers since the day they were born . )
Here are some of the top 10 : Home health aide , medical assistant , physician 's assistant and dental assistant .
These are the types of jobs that pay decently and but do n't seep into the rest of your life .
Preparation : Meditation .
Because what else will get you through the boredom , monotony and complaining that comes with this sort of job – to say nothing of people dying on you ?
Seriously , meditation has been shown to decrease stress levels at work , and many colleges teach courses on it .
One warning : Job burnout does not come from long hours , it comes from not being able to have an impact at work , according to Ayala Pines , author of Career Burnout : Causes and Cures .
The fastest job burnout is in burn units because nurses can't alleviate pain .
Thus , it 's not hard to imagine that providing medical assistance to the terminally ill might be a rapid ticket to disenchantment and burnout .
IT Project Manager
Companies pay a lower hourly rate when they farm IT projects out to India ( or Ecuador or Uzbekistan ) , but they 'll take a big financial hit if the project gets messed up .
That 's why project management is so critical .
" I only send out to India the work that I 'm sure I could do myself , just not as cheaply , " says Cory Miller , who builds websites for businesses .
Dozens of horror stories detail web development gone bad because of literal translation in India of unclear directions from the United States .
IT jobs where you do n't have any contact with people will mostly be sent overseas , but the jobs that involve cross - department negotiation and project management will become even more important – and will remain in the United States .
Preparation : A computer science degree is helpful .
But the degree does n't mean you can project manage across corporate ( and national ) borders .
The business team and the technical team never got along when they were sitting next to each other in the United States so you will need the negotiating skills of a United Nations delegate to make these relationships work overseas .
Take a negotiating course if you can , get good grades in computer science courses , and force yourself to go to parties often so you learn to interact with people .
Blogger
Journalists can no longer build a career by hiding behind a masthead .
The internet has made hardcore news a commodity .
The way to stand out – and have a sustainable career as a journalist – is to have a strong opinion and a strong voice .
A blog showcases you as someone who can make sense of news in a unique way .
Preparation : Spend less time on coursework , because unless you 're going to graduate school , your grades do n't matter .
And you do n't need to go to grad school to be a journalist .
This route will leave more time for you to start blogging in college and jump into the work world with a strong following already established ( plus a public record that you can write and report the news ) .
Solo Practitioner Lawyer
The idea of working hard to pay your dues as a lawyer is outdated .
The Wall Street Journal says the latest law firm trend is " de-equitization , " which is a fancy word for kicking a partner in the pants and throwing him or her out the door .
Since there is no longer a safe ladder to climb in big law firms , people will stop climbing and set up shop on their own .
Warning : Lawyers are the most unhappy of all professionals , according to the Colorado Law Journal .
But people who work for themselves are among the most satisfied workers , according to Dartmouth economist Daniel Blanchflower ( .pdf ) .
Add the two together for a more balanced work life .
Preparation : Success as a lawyer is increasingly about client relations rather than providing Alan Dershowitz - style genius legal representation .
Take some marketing courses in college since that 's what you 'll be spending time on once you hang out your shingle .
Entrepreneur
Corporate life is still set up for you to pay your dues , and then earn a huge salary for working long hours .
But who wants that ?
In fact , the Harvard Business Review reports that baby boomers are the only ones who like working corporate jobs that require more than 60 hours a week .
Why pay dues for a job you do n't want anyway ?
Start your own business instead .
Preparation : Start doing it in college .
The best way to learn how to be an entrepreneur is to be one .
Even if you fail the first time ( or two or three ) , you 'll be learning .
And graduate early if you can .
More than half the college students today take more than five years to graduate , according to Bill Copin , author of the book , 25 Ways to Make College Pay Off .
But , he says , " There is almost never downside to graduating early , " and each extra semester just adds to your debt – which limits the type of work you can afford to take on when you graduate .
None of the Above
No idea what you want to do ?
Play on an athletic team .
People who play sports do much better in their work life than people who do n't , according to James Shulman , author of The Game of Life : College Sports and Educational Values .
Playing sports promotes all sorts of factors that lead to success after college :
Self - discipline , focus , competitive spirit and , of course , a good - looking body , which in itself could give you a 15 percent boost in salary , according to some research .
And if all this sounds like too much to think about :
You 're right .
Psychologist Daniel Gilbert found that people are incredibly terrible at guessing what they 'll like ahead of time .
In fact , our poor predictive abilities have been key to our survival during evolution , and we will never overcome them now .
So instead , just try a lot of things , in college and after college .
And cut yourself some slack .
One of the most irrelevant decisions you 'll make after college is what to do for your first job .
People in college today will have more than eight jobs , on average , before they are 32 .
Surely one of those will be a winner .
After lung and stomach cancer , liver cancer is the third largest cause of cancer deaths in the world .
A new study on the relationship between coffee drinking and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) confirmed that there is an inverse association between coffee consumption and HCC .
At least eleven studies conducted in southern Europe and Japan have examined the relationship between coffee drinking and the risk of primary liver cancer .
The current study , led by Francesca Bravi of the Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri in Milan , Italy , was a meta - analysis of published studies on HCC that included how much coffee patients had consumed .
Researchers combined all published data to obtain an overall quantitative estimate of the association between coffee consumption and HCC .
The results showed a 41 percent reduction of HCC risk among coffee drinkers compared to those who never drank coffee .
“ Moreover , the apparent favorable effect of coffee drinking was found both in studies from southern Europe , where coffee is widely consumed , and from Japan , where coffee consumption is less frequent , and in subjects with chronic liver diseases , ” the researchers state .
They point out that animal and laboratory studies have indicated that certain compounds found in coffee may act as blocking agents by reacting with enzymes involved in carcinogenic detoxification .
Other components , including caffeine , have been shown to have favorable effects on liver enzymes .
Coffee has also been related to a reduced risk of liver diseases and cirrhosis , which can lead to liver cancer .
“ Despite the consistency of these results , it is difficult to derive a causal inference on the basis of the observational studies alone , ” the authors note .
It may be that patients with digestive tract diseases , including liver disorders , naturally reduce their coffee consumption , even though avoidance of coffee is not routinely recommended .
Also , they note that the assessment of coffee intake was based on patients ’ self - reporting , although recall of coffee drinking has been shown to be accurate .
The fact that the inverse relationship between coffee drinking and HCC was shown in both southern Europe and Japan suggests a lack of bias in these studies .
Allowance for other confounding factors , such as hepatitis B and C , cirrhosis , social class indicators , alcohol use and smoking , also suggests that such factors did not influence the results .
“ In conclusion , the results from this meta - analysis provide quantitative evidence of an inverse relation between coffee drinking and liver cancer , ” the authors state .
“ The interpretation of this association remains , however , unclear and the consequent inference on causality and worldwide public health implications is still open for discussion . ”

After four model students were gunned down in a playground , outrage spread : if the brightest and best are not safe , then who is ?
Paul Harris in New York reports on the killings that have galvanised a community
Newark is a 25 - minute train ride across the Hudson River from the skyscrapers of Manhattan .
But its tough streets , scarred by violence and drugs , feel a world away .
Now , after a brutal multiple murder in a school playground , Newark is at the centre of a bout of national soul - searching about life in urban America and the violence that marks so much of the experience of inner-city black youth .
The crime has caused shock across the nation not because the victims were involved in a tit - for - tat piece of ghetto violence , but because they were not .
They were four young black Americans who had done everything right to grow up unscathed by Newark 's social problems .
Beating the odds , they had emerged with clean records , bright futures and university degrees ahead of them .
But even they could not succeed .
That fact has added to a growing sense of crisis in black America .
The deaths came in the same week as a Justice Department report revealed that half of all murder victims in America are black , yet black people make up just 13 per cent of the population .
It followed the brutal murder of black newspaper editor Chauncey Bailey , gunned down in broad daylight in San Francisco , who was known for his investigative work .
Many are now calling for a national effort to combat violence and poverty in black America .
' It is a social epidemic and it is going to take a multiple - front war of effort to confront this issue , ' said Marc Morial , president of civil rights group the National Urban League .
' Unless that happens we are on a slope going down . '
But for now the focus remains on the tragedy in Newark where it seems even the brightest and best of black America cannot avoid falling prey to the plague of street violence .
The four victims - two male , two female - were all ' good kids ' who had stayed out of trouble .
Yet on 4 August they were shot , execution - style in the head , in the innocent surroundings of a school playground .
Only one survived , a bullet still lodged in her face .
The reaction to the murders has been a mixture of disbelief and outrage , even in Newark , which has long been a byword for urban blight and a sky - high murder rate .
The city 's fortunes have been in a rut since it was scarred by race riots in 1967 which saw 26 people killed and ended with massive white flight .
Though it is trying to reinvent itself , the latest deaths have raised questions about how much has changed .
' We can't live like this any more .
Hopefully , it 's a watershed moment in the city , ' said Garry McCarthy , its police director .
The four friends - Terrance Aerial , 19 , Natasha Aerial , his 19 - year - old sister , Dashon Harvey , 20 , and Iofemi Hightower , 20 - had gathered in the playground of Mount Vernon High School in a middle - class Newark suburb on a Saturday night .
As they played music at around 11.30 pm a group of men approached them .
What happened next is not clear but it is certain that the four knew they were in trouble .
They sent each other text messages in their last minutes .
One hurriedly typed a poignant last message that simply said : ' Let 's get out of here . '
It was too late .
Natasha Aerial was shot first , collapsing from a bullet to the face near a set of sports benches .
The other three were then marched behind a low wall , forced to kneel down and shot in turn .
The sheer pointlessness of the deaths is shocking .
All four were models of hard work and good results .
Three were students at Delaware State University and another had applied to go .
They worked to raise extra cash ; none had a police record ; three played in a student marching band and one even guided prospective students around Delaware as an ambassador for the university .
All of that is gone now .
' It 's wrong .
They had a goal , they had a purpose , they had destination in life , ' said Renee Tucker , mother of Natasha and Terrance Aerial .
But amid the grief some have sought to draw a wider message .
James
Harvey , father of Dashon , has spoken movingly of the need for parents in the inner city to look at how they are raising their children .
' It 's on the parents .
When you raise your kids up you teach them right from wrong ... innocent people are dying , needlessly , unnecessarily and for what ? ' he said .
' I blame the parents of America . '
That is a sentiment shared in the streets of Ivy Hill Park , the suburb where the deaths occurred .
The area is one of Newark 's middle - class success stories .
Its lawns are clipped , its houses sturdy and its crime rate relatively low .
Now its streets are swarming with police cars , stop - and - search operations and almost every tree bears a poster offering a reward for information .
' Stop the killings in Newark now ! ' blares one sign which has sprouted , mushroom - like , into almost every front garden .
Residents appear united in grief and anger .
A little memorial has grown up at the playground spot where the four were gunned down .
It is covered in flowers , balloons and candles .
A pile of empty buckets marks the area where work crews had to scrub the blood away from the concrete .
It is a scene too common in Newark where police investigations usually hit a wall of silence .
In fact Newark , along with several other East Coast cities such as Baltimore and Philadelphia , has been the centre of a notorious ' stop snitching ' campaign .
Often led by rap artists and linked to drug dealers , the movement has warned local black communities not to talk to the police .
But this time is different .
' People are rightfully outraged .
That 's not a sentiment I 've always felt , ' said McCarthy .
The result has been a lightning - quick investigation .
Already three men are under arrest .
One is Jose Carranza , 28 , an illegal immigrant from Peru who was already out on bail on sexual assault charges .
A key part of the case is information from the sole survivor .
Natasha Aerial has been helping police from her hospital bed , including looking through pictures of suspects .
She is under constant armed guard to protect her from the witness intimidation attacks that have been a hallmark of the stop snitching movement .
Unlike many violent crimes in Newark at least these murders look as though they will be solved .
Not that that will be any consolation .
The killings have been a disaster for Newark and for its new mayor , Cory Booker .
Booker is also one of the country 's best - known rising black politicians .
In the era of Barack Obama , the popular young mayor is seen as a dynamic role model for black politicians .
When he first joined the city council he won plaudits for a 10 - day hunger strike living in a tent outside a drug - ridden building to highlight the crime problem .
He also spent five months living in a trailer home that he would park on street corners known for drug dealing .
He became hugely popular and the subject of an Oscar - nominated documentary .
He finally won election to the mayor 's office last year .
Typically , he has taken a high - profile stance over the killings .
He spoke about the crime to a huge crowd at a local baseball game and was present when Carranza was brought in for interrogation .
He also visited Natasha Aerial in her hospital bed .
' We will either rise as a community or fall apart .
Our city is stronger than these challenges .
We will come together , ' he said .
There are signs that is happening .
Incredibly it seems that these murders have succeeded where 40 years of politics have failed .
Newark , at last , is showing signs of forcefully tackling its problems .
Booker unveiled a tough local gun law last week .
It could eventually include setting up special ' gun courts ' to deal specifically with gun crimes .
A new $ 3 m ( £ 1.5 m ) network of surveillance cameras and gunshot detectors is planned , partly funded by a flood of donations from Newark 's citizens .
Even more significant have been the actions of ordinary people .
Some young black men , dressed in gang clothes , have signed pledges to put down their weapons .
A local anti-violence group called Stop Shootin ' is selling its T - shirts and badges as fast as they can make them .
Police tip - off lines have been flooded with calls .
Local clergy have formed a new youth mentoring programme and more than $ 150,000 has been raised for the victims ' families .
There is still a long way to go .
Speaking after one press conference , Booker emotionally vented his frustrations .
' I 'm very angry right now , ' he said .
' We were on our way towards having one of our best summers in years . '
That statement alone shows how bad things have been .
So far this year , there have been 64 murders in the city .
Seventeen people have been killed since 12 June .
In Newark , a ' good summer ' is a relative concept .
The New York Times has published an article regarding a highly controversial group on Facebook .
The group denounces Islam and as of this posting has 760 members .
The groups states the following :
The Quran contains many lies and threats .
Islam is false , no god exists , and someone should say that loud and clear .
Heaven and hell are fables , prayer is a waste of time , and angels and jinn are obviously mythology .
This is not a group against Muslims .
They have it bad enough .
If you doubt that go to Palestine .
If you hate Muslims or are here to harrass them or promote your religion , go away .
Muslims can be and usually are peaceful and respectful .
There is now a number of other groups that have been created in protest of Facebook ’s decision to allow this group to remain .
One of the groups has over 58,000 members .
This is by no means the first politically or religiously controversial group on Facebook but it is now getting significant coverage .
The group is set up in support of atheism .
According to the New York Times article , Facebook temporarily deleted the group creator ’s account but has since reinstated it .
The members that are petitioning the group are threatening to leave Facebook permanently .
While that may not have a significant impact on Facebook ’s growth , it is a large statement .
What do you think ?
Should Facebook delete the group ?

It was the most astonishing anthropological find of a generation - a diminutive new species of human that apparently shared the planet with us until 13,000 years ago .
But the discovery of the fossilised " Hobbit " , as she quickly became known , has provoked a long - running and sometimes acrimonious debate among scientists : was she really one of a race of mini-humans or was she merely one of us , but with a brain - shrinking disease ?
Now scientists have analysed fossilised wrist bones that were part of the original discovery in 2003 but had not been looked at in detail .
They say they prove the Hobbit really was a distinct and previously unknown type of human , and not just an abnormally small member of our own species .
That analysis has revealed significant differences between the bones and human or Neanderthal equivalents .
At the same time there are crucial similarities with older species of human and living apes such as chimps and gorillas .
The researchers say this puts paid to the idea that Homo floresiensis could be a " normal " human being with a brain - shrinking disease called microcephaly or some form of dwarfism .
The Hobbit was remarkable because of where it was found and when it was supposed to have lived .
Its existence alongside modern humans 13,000 years ago is more than 15,000 years after the Neanderthals died out and more than 140,000 years after modern humans evolved in Africa .
" What we are beginning to realise is that our recent evolutionary history is much more diverse than we realised , " said Matthew Tocheri of the Smithsonian Institution , lead author on the paper in Science that describes the wrist bone analysis .
" It 's a little shot to our over - inflated modern human egos . "
For some though that interpretation is just too incredible .
Robert Martin at the Field Museum of Chicago argued in a paper last year that the Hobbit 's grapefruit - sized brain was simply too small compared with its body to be a scaled - down human species .
He also said that tools found with the fossils were too advanced to have come from a creature with such a small brain .
Meanwhile , Robert Eckhardt at Pennsylvania State University argued last year that Flores , the Indonesian island on which the Hobbit was found , was too small to support a population of hunter gatherers without immigration from other islands .
That would mean it was not genetically isolated and so could not have evolved into a separate species .
He criticised other researchers ' willingness to get caught up in the hype and sniped that , " critical faculties were suspended on the part of many people " .
Even the bones themselves have not escaped the intellectual tug of war .
Almost as soon as H floresiensis hit the public consciousness in 2004 , they were taken - some say borrowed , some say " hijacked " - by a researcher who was not involved in the original find .
But proponents of the separate species hypothesis say that evidence is stacking up in their favour .
" I think slowly but surely the facts are coming out , " said Dr Tocheri .
His own analysis shows that the wrist bones of H floresiensis are not like ours or Neanderthals ' .
" Even if you are not trained as an anatomist , I think it is clear that the bones look very similar to what we see in living chimps and gorillas today , as well as earlier hominin fossils like Australopithecus - or Lucy , " he said , " The wrist evidence is definitely a smoking gun ...
I would say that it is proof that it is not a modern human - microcephalic , normal or otherwise . "
Crucially , the shape of the wrist forms very early in a baby 's development in the womb , in the first three months .
Genetic problems leading to small brains or dwarfism tend to hit later or after birth .
" It would be extraordinary if a pathology could revert three wrist bones to this morphology , " said Chris Stringer , an expert on human evolution at the Natural History Museum .
" To have three bones which show this complex of features really does add to the case that this is a distinct and very peculiar human - like creature . "
He is open to the possibility that it might yet turn out to be a small - brained human , but he thinks the tide is turning in favour of it representing a much more primitive and distinct species .
" There is a lot at stake .
One group of people are going to be 100 % wrong in what they have said , which is a situation that is rare in science , " he said .
" It will be a fascinating test case for science .
Will the people who turn out to be wrong hold their position to the bitter end regardless of the evidence that accumulates ? "
" As good scientists , we should all be pleased to have new data , even when it proves us wrong , but also being human beings it does n't always work that way .
We have human flaws like everyone else , " added Prof Stringer .
Critics of the separate species explanation , however , show no sign of conceding .
" If the evidence provided by the wrist bones is so important , why was it not part of the original description and diagnosis of the new species ? " said Dr Eckhardt .
" The answer is that the wrist bone evidence is not important in and of itself , but rather as a last ditch effort to save the supposed new species by finding some new " unique " feature . "
" This is an exercise in the presentation of misleading ideas in an obfuscatory manner .
In that sense , then , their paper is far from a model of how science should be done . "
Body of evidence
September 2003 ' Hobbit ' discovered by Indonesian and Australian team on the island of Flores , in Indonesia .
It is also called Ebu , after a local legend about a small waddling creature with a big appetite .
October 2004
The findings of a skull and partial skeleton are published in Nature .
The team classify the metre high creature as a new species , Homo floresiensis
February 2005
A computer generated model of the skull suggests it did not have an abnormal brain .
October 2005 Australian scientists announce the discovery of more bones including another jaw bone .
These confirm the creature 's diminutive size , but the haul does not include a skull .
May 2006
Researchers claim the Hobbit 's brain is far too small to be microcephalic .
August 2006
Another study claims that Flores is too small to have supported a population without immigration from other islands - so they could not have evolved in isolation .

Q From Lewis Rosenbaum :
The phrase smart as paint is said by Long John Silver to Jim Hawkins in Treasure Island .
Any ideas as to the source of the expression ?
A It appears a couple of times in R L Stevenson ’s book , the first time as : “ Now , Hawkins , you do me justice with the cap ’n .
You ’re a lad , you are , but you ’re as smart as paint .
I see that when you first come in . ”
It was only one of many versions that have been invented from the 1850s onwards , among them fresh as paint , snug as paint , clever as paint , pretty as paint , and handsome as paint .
They ’re all similes that draw on some special quality of paint , but smart as paint punningly combines two senses of smart — the idea of new paint being bright and fresh in appearance and that of a person who is quick - witted and intelligent .
It seems to have been Stevenson ’s own invention .
At least , I ca n’t find an earlier example .
It started to be used by others in the second decade of the twentieth century , presumably based on its appearance in Treasure Island .
But it was n’t always a pun ; sometimes only the first part of the sense was meant .
For example , this appears in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ’s A Visit to Three Fronts , dated 1916 : “ His charming blue uniform , his facings , his brown gaiters , boots and belts are always just as smart as paint . ”
TEHRAN — When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was first elected president , he said Iran had more important issues to worry about than how women dress .
He even called for allowing women into soccer games , a revolutionary idea for revolutionary Iran .
Today , Iran is experiencing the most severe crackdown on social behavior and dress in years , and women are often barred from smoking in public , let alone attending a stadium event .
Since his inauguration two years ago , Mr. Ahmadinejad has grabbed headlines around the world , and in Iran , for outrageous statements that often have no more likelihood of being put into practice than his plan for women to attend soccer games .
He has generated controversy in New York in recent days by asking to visit ground zero — a request that was denied — and his scheduled appearance at Columbia University has drawn protests .
But it is because of his provocative remarks , like denying the Holocaust and calling for Israel to be wiped off the map , that the United States and Europe have never known quite how to handle him .
In demonizing Mr. Ahmadinejad , the West has served him well , elevating his status at home and in the region at a time when he is increasingly isolated politically because of his go - it - alone style and ineffective economic policies , according to Iranian politicians , officials and political experts .
September 2007 Django sprint
We held a Django sprint on Friday , Sept. 14 , 2007 , with contributors from all over the world .
Many sprinters kept working over the weekend as well .
For a summary , see James Bennett 's ​ Django sprint wrap report .
The rest of this page contains the original sprint introduction .
What is a sprint ?
Basically , a Django sprint is an excuse for people to focus their undivided attention , for a set time frame , on improving Django .
It 's a focused , scheduled effort to fix bugs , add new features and improve documentation .
Anybody , anywhere around the world , can participate and contribute .
( See the " How to contribute " section below for details . )
Most contributors will be at their own homes / schools / workplaces , but a number of people will gather together in person for camaraderie , improved communication and the other benefits of face - to - face interaction .
If you 've never contributed to Django before , this is the perfect chance for you to chip in .
How to contribute
It 's easy : Pick something to work on and do it .
All sorts of tasks are available , from hard - core hacking to improving documentation to fixing small bugs .
Of course , with more than 100 people around the world signed up to help , good communication is essential .
We 're currently planning the best way to manage contributions .
Have a look at the SprintIdeas page if you would like some ideas about what to work on .

Concentrated chemicals derived from green tea dramatically boosted production of a group of key detoxification enzymes in people with low levels of these beneficial proteins , according to researchers at Arizona Cancer Center .
These findings , published in the August issue of Cancer Epidemiology , Biomarkers & Prevention , a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research , suggest that a green tea concentrate might help some people strengthen their metabolic defense against toxins capable of causing cancer .
In a study of 42 people , the concentrate − composed of chemicals known as green tea catechins in amounts equal to that found in 8 - 16 cups of green tea − boosted production of the enzymes , which belong to the glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) family , by as much as 80 percent in some participants .
GST enzymes are believed to be crucial to the body ’s defense against cancer - causing chemicals and other toxins , according to the study ’s lead investigator , H. - H. Sherry Chow , Ph.D. , a research associate professor at the University of Arizona .
They modify the cancer - causing molecules that would otherwise damage cellular DNA , thus rendering them inert .
“ They actually convert known carcinogens to non-toxic chemicals , and studies have shown a correlation between deficient expression of these enzymes and increased risk of developing some cancers , ” Chow said .
“ Expression of this enzyme varies dramatically in people due to genetic variation and environmental factors , ” Chow added .
“ Green tea catechins somehow increase gene expression of these enzymes , which can be an advantage to people with low levels to start with . ”
Green tea has long been of interest to researchers given studies that have shown populations in which it is often consumed , such as the Chinese and Japanese , generally have lower rates of cancer .
To find out if green tea can protect against cancer , the NCI has sponsored a number of rigorous scientific studies testing capsules of the extract , Polyphenon E , that have been prepared in Japan to meet exact specifications .
These pills contain epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) , a catechin known for its potent antioxidant activity , and are currently being tested against a variety of cancers in clinical trials .
This study was designed to see if green tea catechin concentrate had any effect on the levels of GST enzymes in healthy individuals − research that could explain the tea ’s anti-cancer properties .
Healthy volunteers were asked to abstain from consuming any tea or tea - related products for four weeks .
At the end of this “ washout period , ” blood was drawn and baseline GST enzyme levels were determined for each participant .
Then , the volunteers were asked to take four Polyphenon E capsules , for a total of 800 milligrams of EGCG , each morning on an empty stomach for four weeks and to abstain from drinking tea or eating many cruciferous vegetables , which contain other beneficial chemicals .
Another blood sample was taken after four weeks , and GST activity was determined .
Researchers found that use of Polyphenon E enhanced GST activity when data from all participants were included for analysis .
But it had its most significant effect in volunteers whose baseline blood measurements showed low GST activity − an 80 percent increase compared to baseline GST activity .
Activity did not change in volunteers with medium GST expression , or in those with the highest levels , GST seemed to decrease slightly although researchers believe that decline was due to random variation .
“ This is the first clinical study to show proof that chemicals in green tea can increase detoxification enzymes in humans , ” Chow said .
“ There may be other mechanism in play by which green tea may protect against cancer development , but this is a good place to start . ”

Know Your Enemy - for it be News Corp
The Assets
News Corp is a publically traded entertainment company run by Rupert Murdoch whose assets are valued at approximately 68 billion .
A partial list of these assets includes Twentieth Century Fox , Twentieth Century Fox Television , Fox Searchlight Pictures , Fox Broadcasting Company , BSkyB , Sky Latin America , Sky Television Italy , Fox News Channel , Fox Movie Channel , Fox Sports Channel , Fox Soccer Channel , FUEL TV , National Geographic Channel , FX Network , Speed Channel , The Weekly Standard , Gemstar ( TV Guide ) over 165 newspapers , and Harper Collins Books .
News Corp recently purchased My Space as part of a much larger Internet strategy and spending spree .
They are in the final stages of purchasing the Dow Jones Company whose prize asset is The Wall Street Journal .
This fall News Corp. is launching a 24 hour business channel which will have the look and feel of Fox News to be called Fox Business News ( FBN ) .
Lastly , and from my perspective , most importantly , Murdoch intends " to put YouTube out of business " through its joint venture with NBC Universal for a similar recently launched concept called My Space TV .
More on that later .
The Players
Although News Corp. employes a vast number of executives all over the world , power is highly concentrated into the hands of a few .
Rupert Murdoch , Peter Chernin and Roger Ailes .
This 3 - some make all of the major decisions .
If the name Roger Ailes sounds familiar it is because he is a life long wingnut .
who at one time worked for Nixon . and is a friend both of Karl Rove and the White House .
Ailes shares
Murdochs views that there is a liberal bias to the entertainment world that they are intent on " balancing " .
He is the only boss Bill O'Rielly has ever known as Bill started working for him straight out of college .
He is big , blustery , and currently pissed as hell about Fox News ' ratings decline .
He is currently working on numerous projects but highly attentive to these 2 :
( 1) remaking Fox 's 35 local television stations , broadcasting to nearly 40 percent of America 's homes , into Fox News Channel 's national image .
( 2 ) crafting the content of FBN in tandem with the makeover of the WSJ of which Jack Schaffer of the Slate had this to say :
That rotten old bastard wo n’t be able to keep himself from defiling the paper .
It ’s in his nature to contaminate his own wells .
As experienced Journal reporters and editors leave or are driven out , their replacements will owe their allegiance to Murdoch and Murdoch ’s people .
Will they bring to news coverage the impartiality we ’ve come to expect from the Journal ?
Or will they pull and duck punches on his behalf ?
Will they skew stories about Viacom and Condé Nast and China to please the well - known views of their master ?
You betcha .
I ca n’t recall any News Corp. employee who got a raise or a promotion after undermining the Murdoch empire ’s interests with an honest , accurate story .
A point about the News Corp .'s working environment .
I 've known quite a few people who have worked there .
I left the industry several years ago .
But each and every time a recruiter called me about an opening there , my answer was a loud NO .
It is singularly the worst working environment you can imagine .
The calls I have gotten at night from grown men and women actually weeping about either a co-workers stabs at them , or the talking down they withstood at a meeting are many .
I wish I had saved the many emails sent to me in secret asking my advice on how to respond to a peer 's email where they are being attacked for incomptence .
News Corp just might be Hell .
Back to our story .
Then there is Peter Chernin - who shares power equally with Ailes - who had this to say recently about My Space TV :
We willl Crush YouTube
At least that 's the plan , snip
As if we needed more proof of MySpace ’s intolerance of outside development , News Corp. chief operating officer Peter Chernin told investors at an industry conference today that since much of YouTube ’s traffic comes from MySpace , it ’s time to cut out the middle man .
Chernin estimated that around 60 - 70 % of YouTube ’s traffic comes from MySpace , and as a result he wants to ramp up MySpace Video , giving users less incentive to look elsewhere .
But while the 60 % figure might not be totally accurate , MySpace is definitely a catalyst for YouTube ’s growth - they actually reported a dip in traffic when MySpace temporarily disabled YouTube embeds at the end of 2005 ( they were forced to allow them again after a user revolt ) .
http://72.14.253.104/...
He is actually not as evil as Ailes .
It 's been years since I have been in his company , but I spent many an occassion with him when he ran Showtime - and with a clear liberal bias .
Perhaps the liberal part is gone , but its hard to change a basically decent person .
He is no wingnut and as you will read here , it 's also no coincidence that Hillary 's people showed up on Fox to defend DKOS the day after O'Reilly 's smear of Yearly Kos : Snip
In recent days , the word used more and more frequently to describe Hillary Clinton 's march to the Democratic presidential nomination has been " inevitable . "
She consistently leads public opinion polls across the country by a good 10 points over her nearest rival .
Hollywood , after a brief infatuation with Barack Obama , is now , according to the Los Angeles Times , consolidating its support behind the junior senator from New York .
Rupert Murdoch employee Peter Chernin extracted a cool $ 850,000 from wealthy Angelenos for the former first lady at a recent event in
his home .
A few days later , she was endorsed by the King of Hollywood himself -- Steven Spielberg
http://www.alternet.org/...
Surely this is a glimpse into the News Corp. world .
Chernin supporting Hillary .
Ailes egging O'Reilly on .
The Enemies
Murdoch has a lot of enemies , amongst them Ted Turner , Richard Branson and most importantly John Malone .
Let me caveat enemies .
These real power brokers if asked , would never own up to such a thing as " enemy " - well Ted would .
They would praise Rupert instead .
They actually play a much more sophisticated and nasty game .
And the king of this game is John Malone , in whose organization I honed my own skills .
The man is sheer genius.
snip
Ted Turner - Ah , Murdoch 's first big American kill .
One could lay the blame for CNN creator Turner 's ultimate biz demise more properly at the feet of Time Warner , but Turner vs. Murdoch was too classic a matchup not to believe in .
The conservative , rapacious Australian tabloid mogul versus his bizarro - world counterpart -- an American redneck news hawk with liberal , philanthropic delusions of grandeur .
These days , Turner can only seethe about Murdoch 's lack of charity , when it 's pretty certain that Turner would be more than willing to cross the street to kick him .
John Malone - Perhaps the first serious challenge to the Murdoch family 's dominance of News Corp. came via John Malone 's Liberty Media .
The American company had amassed a considerable though not yet controlling stake in News Corp. , which Murdoch interpreted as a threat ; Malone 's complaints about Murdochian " empire building " at the expense of shareholder return also did n't help .
The threat evaporated with a deal trading the News Corp. shares back as part of an $ 11 billion asset swap , including the transfer of a controlling interest in DirecTV over to Liberty .
Malone and Murdoch are talking sweetly of each other and the deal now , but the Malones are probably off the Christmas card list for a year or two , at least .
What its really all about
Money , plain and simple - specifically advertising dollars .
In recent days there have been a lot of articles surfacing not just about YouTube , but its owner Google .
Google is a very serious threat to News Corp .
but also to other media giants whose cable network holdings rely on advertising budgets : snip
Representatives from Google 's growing list of competitors say that unless checked now , Google will ultimately control most of the interactive advertising revenues for broadband .
Industry insiders understand that control over ad revenues will give Google tremendous clout over the future of content online , since it will have the resources to fund whatever it desires .
Consequently , Viacom 's legal action against Google is less about copyright infringement over clips from The Daily Show appearing on YouTube than about cutting the search and advertising behemoth down to size .
http://www.alternet.org/...
While NewsCorp , and others , are out to kill YouTube Malone is sitting at the opposite end of the table watching and planning .
Unlike Murdoch he moves slowly and strategically , and with the respect and solidarity of those that work for him in lock step behind him .
As noted above his recent acquisiton of satellite giant DirecTV from Murdoch is an example of how he moves .
To me , it would be utterly suprising if Malone was not working on a large strategic relationship with Google while the rest of the media moguls were trying to crush them .
And thus when I read this today , I was not surprised .
Snip
DIRECTV Next for Google Ad Deal ?
Just a short week after internet giant Google announced a partnership to sell TV advertising time for EchoStar , the online search company is rumored to have reached a similar deal with the country 's largest satellite TV provider DIRECTV .
Industry reports this week have said the deal is taking more time to finalize than the one inked with DISH Network because DIRECTV is managing its ownership change in the much - reported asset swap of News Corp. and Liberty Media .
According to Silicon Valley venture capital newsletter VentureBeat , citing an unnamed source close to the talks , the DIRECTV deal with Google will eventually go through .
DIRECTV spokesman Robert Mercer confirmed to SkyREPORT that the company is always looking for ways to increase ad sales revenue , but the satcaster " is not commenting on what 's being reported in the press " regarding any new partnerships .
Google declined to comment on the story .
Coupled with EchoStar 's footprint , a partnership between Google and DIRECTV would be significant , to say the least , giving the internet company 's advertisers access to more than 25 percent of U.S. TV households .
The move could push Google into unchartered territory , being the first to forge an alliance with both satellite providers and creating a unified advertising powerhouse bigger than the largest cable TV operation - Comcast
http://www.skyreport.com/...
My Prediction : Watch for an escalation in deals between Malone and Google .
WHY ?
We Are coming to the point of this diary .
Net Nutrality .
If you have read this far you know where most of the big media companies stand on this issue : they want to be the GATEKEEPER and that means limiting access to Internet Content through deregulation .
And by now you have probably guessed who is on the other side of the table , pushing for open access .
" High - speed Internet will open up access that might be slowed down by traditional media ownership concentration , " Malone says .
" Anybody who wants to set up an Internet broadcast can do it .
And there will be cross-platform convergence between the television and the personal computer . "
Turner agrees the regulators may need to step in to protect the public interest .
" There is no company out there — not Viacom , News Corp . ( which owns Fox ) or Disney , the big television powers — that really has the public interest primarily at heart , " he says .
" They have their own selfish financial interest at heart , and they would do just about anything for a buck .
I hate to say that , but it 's true
Here 's A Surprise Barry Diller weighs in :
Diller says that 's why he not only opposes deregulation — he wants some re-regulation .
" If you have this kind of concentration , then you must have rules and regulations for behavior , " he says .
http://www.usatoday.com/...
So What Does This Have To Do With O'Reilly and Kos
Again , this is my opinion , but I hope you will agree with me that its at the very least a well informed opinion .
Daily Kos is a problem for NewsCorp .
They do n't want to buy it because they can't monetize it - could you see people sticking around if it was 50 % advertising .
And they can't control it .
Its members are progressive Democrates , easily mobilized , and from a recent media industry report not going anywhere soon , in fact DKOS is a " success story " studied by media companies for its " stickiness " - or ability to maintain users , something main stream media struggles with daily .
For example .
Comcast announced TODAY a net loss of subscribers for the 2nd quarter .
Daily Kos ' successful stickiness lies in the fact that it does n't rely solely on the voice of the masses to dictate what is interesting .
Unlike Digg , which is so mass market that it is often less than useful , Daily Kos 's editorial voice helps sort content internally , based on what its editors know of the needs and desires of its readers .
This can be a useful tactic for companies to borrow from , particularly those that know they can't rely on their visitors to take the time to create content or share ideas .
http://www.imediaconnection.com/...
So to put it as simply as possible - DKOS must go away , be crushed for it does n't fit neatly into any grand News Corp. plan and its annoying in its opinions and ability to call out Fox whenever it deems fit .
Its merely a convenience to stick the words in Bill O'Reilly 's mouth because as a loud mouth he will be heard and that means the word will be spread .
O'Reilly is just a sockpuppet serving the NewsCorp master .
But it is a problem not likely to go away .
Like a dog with a bone , News Corp. will keep at this .
So Here 's a Suggestion for what to do about it
Since by now you know I have a great deal of respect for John Malone - here 's a page out of his book .
Learn where they are vulnerable .
Then slowly move in and take yout first bite .
And it better hurt badly enough for them to notice .
Do n't eat away at everything all at once .
Take several bites off that apple until their foundation starts to tumble a little .
Then make your move and NEVER loose site of your objective .
Where They Are Most Vulnerable And What You Can Do
About It
Murdoch etc. is planning on both Comcast and Time Warner Cable for the roll out of FBN to approximately 30 million cable households .
Both of these companies ( I imagine because that is their way ) have cut deals that have lessened their fees to carry FBN in exchange for signing on to distribute My Space TV - which will in turn hurt YouTube .
Why ?
2 very important reasons :
(1) Cable Operators programming fees cut right into their bottom line so horse trading is a common ritual .
( 2 ) Like Murdoch they yearn for a Gate - keeper world .
Or putting it another way - they are seriously anti net nutrality .
Luckily there is one thing cable operators hate more than bloggers - hearing from their subscribers .
So here is the recommended plan :
( 1) Stop focusing on Bill .
If nothing else I hope I have put into perspective how small he is realative to the world spinning around us .
(2) Time Warner , Comcast and Charter intend to roll out FBN on their digital tier - you know the tier YOU ARE PAYING EXTRA MONEY FOR .
Let them know now you will DROP THE TIER IF FBN IS CARRIED ON IT .
This tier is where a big piece of their profitability is coming from .
They charge 5 dollars , they pay 1 dollar in fees . 30 million x 4 . You do the math .
FBN CANNOT LAUNCH WITHOUT THESE ROLL OUT COMMITTMENTS
( 3) Its not just TimeWarner and Comcast .
If you are not a subscriber to either of these but are to another , you can call your local system and tell the customer service rep you have heard about FBN and then state your intentions .
( 4) As a next step tell the cable industry exactly what you think about My Space TV and that you are considering dropping cable TV altogther .
Everyone here can do that .
I 've supplied the contact info .
This has to be done more than once and by a lot of people .
And you have to mean it .
I KNOW I DO .
The cable industry 's marketing organization is called CTAM .
info below
(5) Do what we do best - blog about it .
But not just here - there are good sites ( list provided ) that are adjuncts to some of the cable industries best trade magazines .
I know the people who run these companies .
They will listen - especially the ones I am providing info on .
They share many of the feelings represented here even if during their daily lives they can't show it .
In closing , we have a lot to say .
Now lets take it to the right people and say it loud and clear .

In the effort to get this out please forgive any typos
MR . HUME : Governor Romney , your thoughts .
( Cheers , applause . )
MR. ROMNEY : Well , clearly your hypothetical suggests that everything we ’ve done up until this point and beyond did n’t work , and there ’s a lot we can do to keep that scenario from occurring .
But assuming that that has not worked and we ’ve been unsuccessful and your hypothetical is real and it is all too possible , you ’re dealing with a nation that talks about genocide , it talks about Israel being a one - bomb state , and it is unacceptable for a nation that talks about genocide and contemplates using nuclear weaponry to have nuclear weapons .
And as a result , we ’re going to have to do something else to persuade them not to go forward .
What do you do next before you actually take up the military action ?
What you do in action is this .
The president meets with leaders , Republican and Democrat , to make sure we ’re on the same page .
We want to make sure that Democrats sign up , that we ’re all part of this on a unified basis .
Number two --
MR . HUME : What if they do n’t ?
MR. ROMNEY : -- number two -- well , my experience is being able to build consensus , and I ’m not going to take that .
I believe good Democrats love America just like good Republicans , and I ’ll find a way to get us to work together .
Number two , you meet with our allies around the world and make sure we ’re on the same page on this .
Number three , you work with the people on Arabian Peninsula , and you say to them we want you to put some pressure on people like China , like Saudi Arabia .
They depend on your oil .
We want you to put pressure on China to also be part of it .
Now we take the military option off the table .
We hold in our hand -- when they see our military option in our hand , a possible blockade or possible aerial strikes , they recognize we mean business , and that ’s going to -- that ’s going to make them think twice and hopefully abandon their folly because it is unacceptable to the world for us to have a nuclear Iran .
And there ’s no price of oil which would justify that outcome .
( Applause . )
MR . HUME : All right .
Senator McCain , you have the last word here , sir .
SEN .
MCCAIN : At the end of the day , we cannot allow Iran to have nuclear weapons .
Now I believe that we can do a lot of things .
We can have a league of democracies to impose sanctions and to cut off the -- many of the things and benefits that the Iranians are now getting from other democracies .
I think it ’s clear that the United Nations Security Council will not act effectively with Russia and China behaving as they are .
But let ’s see what Iran has been doing .
Your hypothetical is closer to reality than many of us appreciate .
The Iranians are sending lethal IEDs that are killing American soldiers .
They ’re training and equipping terrorists .
They have dedicated themselves to the destruction of the state of Israel .
They are arming Hezbollah .
They are supporting Syria , and there ’s no doubt they ’re moving forward with the acquisition of a nuclear weapon .
We need to work together with our allies , but at the end of the day , it ’s the United States of America that will make the final decision .
On January of 2000 -- of 1981 , Ronald Reagan came to power and raised his hand as president of the United States of America .
By more than coincidence the Iranian hostages returned on that same day .
I would employ some of his methods .
( Applause . )
One of Leviev ’s greatest admirers is Eitan Raff , chairman of Israel ’s Bank Leumi , from which Leviev bought Africa Israel in 1996 .
The sale was controversial at the time .
“ He was a Russian , ” Raff says .
“ We did n’t know him or anything about him .
We thought he might be some kind of oligarch .
I hired two or three investigators to check him out .
He came up clean . ”
There were a number of foreign suitors for Africa Israel , but after fighting broke out in Jerusalem between Israeli and Palestinian gunmen , they became skittish and withdrew , leaving Leviev as the sole bidder .
The asking price was $ 400 million , and Bank Leumi had to sell ; it had been ordered by a court to divest itself of nonfinancial holdings , including Africa Israel , by a certain date .
Leviev had the bank over a barrel .
“ What would you say to $ 330 ? ” Leviev asked Raff .
“ No , it ’s worth four , that ’s the fair price , ” Raff said .
Leviev stuck out his hand , diamond - business style .
“ Four , ” he said .
“ He acted with great probity , ” Raff says .
“ He did n’t try to take advantage or squeeze .
His word is his bond , ” he says .
“ Look , I ’m a kibbutznik .
Leviev and I are n’t from the same world at all .
But I consider him a friend , and I think he ’s an example of what the head of a public company should be . ”
Leviev ’s biggest public - relations problem is his association with Arkady Gaydamak , a mysterious Russian - Israeli billionaire of unsavory reputation , now under indictment in France for a variety of offenses , including gunrunning and money laundering .
Gaydamak , who cuts a flamboyant figure and recently established his own political party in Israel , is reputed to have made his fortune selling arms in Angola in partnership with various European , Israeli and African military and government figures .
Leviev says he was first introduced to Gaydamak by the former Mossad chief Danny Yatom .
They certainly knew each other .
According to the Center for Public Integrity , a nonpartisan journalism group based in Washington , Leviev and Gaydamak jointly acquired a metallurgy plant in Kazakhstan in 1999 .
A year later , Gaydamak bought a 15 percent share of Africa Israel , which he later sold .
Leviev swears they are no longer partners , but the relationship has stained his reputation .
Unlike Gaydamak , Leviev has thus far steered clear of Israeli politics .
That does n’t mean he lacks influence , however .
He meets from time to time with the nation ’s leaders , mostly to discuss the economy .
He owns Israel ’s Russian - language television station , which reaches about 15 percent of the population .
Despite his allegiance to Chabad , Leviev is considered a moderate .
“ He ’s not one of the crazies , ” a former adviser to Ariel Sharon told me .
“ Certainly not a Greater Israel man . ”
Leviev ’s global view is Moscow - centric and more than a little Machiavellian .
He says he believes , for example , that America ’s difficulties in places like Iran , Syria and Venezuela come primarily from George W. Bush ’s failure to come to Russia ’s economic aid .
“ If Bush had invested $ 100 million to help the Russian economy early in his first term , he ’d have Putin ’s friendship , ” he says .
“ Instead , Bush put the money into a war with Iraq , and he ’s been paying for it all over the world ever since . ”
T here are reams and reams written about the history of Linux umpteen times by many .
So why another post on the history of Linux ?
I felt that I would n't be doing justice if this site dedicated to Linux did n't have atleast one post telling how Linux evolved from a project started by a university student to the robust OS it is now .
But as the title indicates , I have kept it really short so that any one can come up - to - date by just glancing through it .
To actually know the whole history , you have to go all the way back to 1971 .
In June 1971 , R ichard M atthew S tallman joined MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory as a programmer where he gained popularity with the hacker community and came to be known by his now popular name RMS .
At that time , all the programmers used to share their code freely among each other cutting across various institutions .
Fig : Richard Mathew Stallman - The Father of GNU Movement
In 1980 , with the advent of portable software - ie software that can be compiled to run on different computers , a business model emerged where in , the companies developing the code refused to share the code with their clients and began restricting copying and redistribution of their software by copyrighting it .
In response to this trend , Stallman , who believed in the principle that software has to be free always , founded the Free Software Foundation and in 1985 , published the GNU Manifesto .
This manifesto outlined his motivation for creating a free OS called GNU , which would be compatible with Unix .
By the way , GNU is a recursive acronym for GNU is Not Unix .
He along with a group of like minded programmers started work in developing the tools needed to make a complete OS - like an editor ( Emacs ) , a C compiler ( GCC ) , libraries and all associated generic Unix tools like cat , ls , chmod etc .
In the same year ( 1985 ) , a professor by name Andy Tanenbaum wrote a Unix like Operating system from scratch based on System V standards POSIX and IEEE for the Intel i386 platform .
He named it Minix .

In 1989 , Stallman released the first program independent GNU General Public Licence now popularly known as GPL or copyleft .
Not only that , he published all his work under this licence .
Now the only thing that GNU lacked was a completely free OS kernel .
Even though work was going on in developing HURD which was to fill that gap , the progress was slow .
In 1990 , A finnish student by name Linus Torvalds studying in the University of Helsinki came into contact with Andy Tanenbaum 's OS , Minix .
Linus wanted to upgrade Minix by putting in more features and improvements .
But he was prohibited by Tanenbaum to do so .
Then Linus decided to write his own kernel and released it under GPL .
This kernel is now popularly known as Linux .

After 1997 , a programming model other than the GPLed model emerged which is now popularly known as the Open Source Initiative .
Bruce Perens is credited for creating the Open Source definition - the manifesto of the Open Source movement in software .
Eric.S. Raymond another hacker became one of the prominent voice in this movement .
But he is more known for his very popular essay " The Cathedral and the Bazaar " which has since been published as a hard cover book by O'Reilly .

Popular Linus Speak
If you want to travel around the world and be invited to speak at a lot of different places , just write a Unix operating system .
An infinite number of monkeys typing into GNU emacs would never make a good program .
Making Linux GPL'd was definitely the best thing I ever did .
Really , I 'm not out to destroy Microsoft .
That will just be a completely unintentional side effect .
( NewYork Times Interview )
Popular Richard Stallman Speak
When you are talking about Linux as a OS , you should refer to it as GNU / Linux .
Linux is just the kernel .
All the tools that make Linux an OS has been contributed by GNU movement and hence the name GNU / Linux .
I could have made money this way , and perhaps amused myself writing code .
But I knew that at the end of my career , I would look back on years of building walls to divide people , and feel I had spent my life making the world a worse place .
( On why he decided against writing propritery software ) .
Fighting patents one by one will never eliminate the danger of software patents , any more than swatting mosquitoes will eliminate malaria .
( While talking on how to fight software patents - singly and together ) .
If anything deserves a reward , it is social contribution .
Creativity can be a social contribution , but only in so far as society is free to use the results .
If you want to accomplish something in the world , idealism is not enough - - you need to choose a method that works to achieve the goal .
In other words , you need to be " pragmatic . "
We do n't think of the Open Source movement as an enemy .
The enemy is proprietary software .
I consider that the golden rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who like it .
People sometimes ask me if it is a sin in the Church of Emacs to use vi .
Using a free version of vi is not a sin ; it is a penance .
So happy hacking .
Value your freedom or you will lose it , teaches history .
' Do n't bother us with politics ' , respond those who do n't want to learn .
Popular Raymond speak
Given enough eyeballs , all bugs are shallow .
Popular Tanenbaum speak
LINUX is obsolete ( In a Usenet message in 1992 )
Be thankful you are not my student .
You would not get a high grade for such a design .
Writing a new OS only for the 386 in 1991 gets you your second ' F ' for this term .
( To Linus Torvalds ) .
Microkernels are not a pipe dream .
They represent proven technology .
While most people can talk rationally about kernel design and portability , the issue of free - ness is 100 % emotional .
Little known facts about Linus Torvalds
Linus wanted to name his OS Freax instead of Linux .
instead of Linux .
Linus is known as the ' Benevolent dictator for life ' of Linux kernel .
' of Linux kernel .
Linus 's parents were both left wing campus radicals .
His father was a communist who spent a year studying in Moscow .
You and Me - We all form a part of the Linux history .
As you can see from the figure above , the ordinary users of Linux form the base of the Linux pyramid .
If the user base disappears , the whole pyramid crumbles .
So if you are a linux user , then you can boast to your kids , grandkids and great grandkids ( if you are still alive ; ) ) about the role you played in shaping the history of this wonderful OS .

Iraq Veterans Arrested at U.S. Capitol September 15th 2007

After marching from the White House to Congress with tens of thouosands of people , Dozens of veterans were among those arrested on U.S. Capitol plaza protesting the continued occupation of Iraq .
Did you know that you can get into really big trouble if you post the code beginning with 09 F9 11 02 on your website ?
It is very likely that a take - down notice will be send to the owner of the website as soon as a lawyer from one of the corporations guarding the secret is finding out about it .
You may be wondering why they are making such a big deal about this code that continues with 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 which only some users might identify as the code to rule them all , aka the processing key that unlocks the content of every HD - DVD available up to this point .
Did you know that the processing key ends with 63 56 88 C0 ?
I did not until I read an article where the AACS sent some takedown notices to websites owners who mentioned the key .
So , what is actually happening now is that this key will be reproduced on thousands of websites who report about this takedown notice ; it will be available in caches , in forum posts and in many other places including custom created T - Shirts , Mugs and Mousepads .
It seems that the takedown notice somehow backfired on the AACS , do n't you think ?
Instead of just keeping it under tight control by ignoring the code posting on sites where it has been posted on , the AACS made such a big deal out of it that the story went viral and reached even mainstream media that reported about it .
Some did not show or mention the code while others mentioned it openly on their sites .
But even if the code was not mentioned directly , it gave readers and viewers information about it , and it is likely that at least part of that user base used the Internet to find out more about that code and why organizations are hell - bent to censor all sites that post it .

Elvis Presley died 30 years ago on 16 August 1977 - or so the legend goes .
But maybe the story is not so simple .
When the call finally came , Nik Cohn went in search of the real King .
The ailing figure he has tracked down for this unique interview looks and even sounds different , but the truth of the man is laid bare as never quite before ...
Elvis is dying .
The prostate cancer he 's held at bay for years has metastasised , and he expects to be gone within a few months .
His wife Claudette wants him to start more chemo , but he feels it 's time to let go .
' I died once before , ' he reminds me .
' This is just the remix . '
Though the disease has whittled him down , he looks surprisingly strong .
In fact , the man who sits in a trailer home beside a Louisiana bayou , dressed in sweatpants and a football shirt , seems in better shape than the bloated , drug - addled wreck who ran away from the world 30 years ago .
Even before his illness , he 'd lost almost five stone .
He steers clear of peanut butter and banana sandwiches , and is so wary of addiction that Claudette has to bully him into taking his medications .
The new face he acquired after his disappearance retains an ageless , waxy sheen .
Only the faded blue eyes , sometimes clouded by pain , show damage .
He no longer sings , even in the shower .
The same surgeon who worked on his face also fixed his vocal cords , and his speaking voice today is low - pitched and scratchy , without resonance .
I ask if he misses making music .
He shrugs .
' It 's not an option .
Music brung me everything I had , but what I had was killing me .
The only way I could survive , I had to let it all go . '
I got his summons two nights ago , bang in the middle of American Idol .
' This is , uh , Elvis Presley , ' said the voice on the phone .
' I need you to get on a plane . '
Claudette meets me at Baton Rouge airport .
Stylish , with spiky , raven - black hair and a no - nonsense manner , she refers to her husband as Jake .
' Force of habit , ' she says , but does n't elaborate .
I 'd guess her age at 40 .
Elvis is 72 .
It 's mid-afternoon when we turn off the Interstate and hit a rutted back road that leads us deep into the swamps .
At one point , a herd of wild hogs rushes out of the bayou and almost crashes into us .
A few miles on , we come to a small clearing in the scrub pines .
A catahoula hunting hound with one blue eye and one brown rushes up to the car , barking furiously ; I also note a goat and assorted cats .
Elvis stands waiting at the door of the trailer , looking antsy .
' What took you so long ? ' he demands .
Before I can answer , he goes inside and plops down at the kitchen table , where his daughter Belle , who 's 14 and a dead ringer for Elvis at the same age , is playing with a tabby kitten .
Her spinal injury keeps her in a wheelchair for much of the time , though she can walk short distances with crutches .
She says she wants to be a vet .
The trailer is pretty basic - living area , kitchen , two small bedrooms .
Pride of place belongs to a framed picture of Elvis 's mother as a young woman , slim and pretty in a polka - dot dress .
There 's also a picture of Claudette as Miss Plaquemines Parish 1984 , radiant in bathing dress and tiara , and several studio portraits of Belle with her older brother , Jake Jr , but not a single image of Elvis himself , past or present .
Claudette pours us big glasses of iced tea , so loaded with sugar that the sweetness puckers my mouth , then leaves us alone to talk while she drives Belle to a physical therapy session .
In the fading afternoon light , Elvis looks tired but undefeated .
Though his remade face is as expressionless as a mask , I sense he's on edge - anxious to talk but unsure of where to begin , and primed to blow if I push the wrong button .
Once , when I ask about Jake Jr , he shoots me a look that would fell a charging rhino .
For an instant , I glimpse the man who shot and killed the TVs in Graceland with a handgun because he did n't care for the programming .
There is an awkward silence while Elvis gazes distractedly at a courtroom drama on the miniature TV next to the toaster oven .
The reception is poor and the set outdated , but not , as far I can see , bullet - scarred .
' Court TV is most all I watch now .
Crime , and football , ' Elvis says , intercepting my gaze .
He 's fanatical about LSU ( Louisiana State University ) , who play in Baton Rouge , and drinks his tea from a Bayou Bengals team glass .
' Claudette says I piss gold and purple , ' he confides , which reminds him he needs a leak .
As he moves toward the bathroom , his walk is stiff - kneed , each step a visible effort , and his shirt flaps loose , too big for his frame .
' I 'm losing my stuffing , ' he says .
By the time he returns , the news is on .
There 's been another round of car bombs in Baghdad , dozens dead , hundreds maimed .
George Bush assures us things are looking up .
' I do n't care for that man , ' Elvis says .
' How I was raised up , my mama taught me never to judge anyone till you walked a mile in their shoes .
I always believed in that , but Bush might change my mind .
I knew guys like him back at Humes High , playground bullies , all huff and puff , then you 'd see 'em in the showers , no manhood on 'em whatever . '
Distaste for bullies is as political as he gets .
' I do n't follow parties , policies , it 's all words to me , but killing your fellow man just does n't set right with me , I do n't care what he 's done . '
He 's equally dubious about the war on terror .
' They sell us fear , same way they sell cars or electric blankets .
Well , we 're all afraid ; that 's the condition of being alive .
I was frightened most of my life , and I 'll tell you this : fear will eat your soul , son .
Sure as hell ate mine .'
Before I have time to follow this up , he hauls himself to his feet .
' I need to start dinner , ' he says , and makes noise with the pots and pans .
As Claudette works , Elvis does most of the household chores , and cooking has become a form of therapy .
His speciality is jambalaya - yellow rice with hot sausage , shrimp , okra and Cajun spices .
As he sets the pots to simmering , and the trailer fills with rich aromas , he starts to unwind , and fills me in on what he 's been up to .
Until Hurricane Katrina , he was living in Metairie , a suburb of New Orleans , as Jake Smith .
The name was n't chosen at random - Jake Hess , the histrionic lead singer of the gospel group the Statesmen , was Elvis 's childhood idol , and Smith was his mother 's maiden name .
' The two most important people in my life , coming up .
I felt , having them in my name , they 'd always stay with me , kinda look out for me . '
In Metairie , he owned Jake Smith 's Pawn & Gun and a three - bedroom , ranch - style bungalow in a quiet cul - de-sac .
He drove an old Taurus , was a deacon at the Wayside Calvary Pentecostal church , played a little golf , occasionally went duck hunting .
He and Claudette had a strong marriage and two children they cherished .
' I felt blessed , ' he says .
But Katrina destroyed both his business and his home , and cast the family adrift .
Though he'd moved them to safety in Baton Rouge the day before the storm made land , they lost everything .
' Not just possessions , those can be replaced .
I 'm talking peace of mind . '
When Elvis returned to New Orleans , a few weeks later , to see what survived of Jake Smith 's life , he realised that Jake himself had washed away .
' When I saw the city in ruins , and what had happened to all the people , the way they were treated , lower than dirt , it was like something broke in me .
I 'd stayed to myself , locked away , for so many years .
After I stopped being Elvis , I just wanted the opposite .
To be a nobody , I guess .
Man , I 'll tell you , when you 've been where I was , being nobody feels real sweet . '
Somehow , after Katrina , that was no longer possible .
' Family , business , church - that used to be my whole world .
It was like I 'd been in a bubble , and the bubble burst .
I saw there 's no safe harbour ; life will track you down .
Pitch you in the water , just like it done those people down there , God 's children , everyone . '
His family were holed up in a Baton Rouge motel room , paid for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( Fema ) .
The night he got back , he told Claudette his true identity .
' Was n't easy , son .
Let 's just say she did n't take it kindly . '
He smiles ruefully .
' Claudette , of course , she 's a good few years younger 'n me , grew up on Prince . '
A flicker of amusement lights the tired eyes .
' Do n't tell her this , I 'll flat out deny it , but I kinda like Prince .
Little man can play him some guitar .'
Life among the evacuees at the Thunderbird Motel was no picnic .
' Lot of anger going round , a whole lot of guns .
I feared for my family . '
He thinks the stress brought on the resurgence of his cancer .
Yet he does n't regret the months spent there .
' Can you understand this ?
That place was living hell , but I felt connected .
Every man Jack of us was in the same boat .
Not a one had more than the clothes we stood up in .
Did n't matter what all we'd been before , we was nothing now . '
From the Thunderbird , they moved to a rented apartment behind a Chinese takeaway , and then , when the Fema money ran out , to this trailer in Cajun country , not far from the Atchafalaya Swamp .
They have a new identity ( which , for obvious reasons , I 'm sworn not to reveal ) and a new existence .
Claudette works as a dispatcher for the local police department , and Elvis , when health allows , earns a little extra customising cars .
Paying the bills is n't easy , even now that Jake Jr has left home and is living in Brooklyn , but the family 's wants are n't great .
Elvis grows snap beans , yams , and heirloom tomatoes in the yard , and neighbours sometimes bring fresh fish .
' I have what the Lord intends me to have , ' he says .
' No man should crave more . '
Noting that the 30th anniversary of his fake death may also be the date of his real death , he seems to relish the irony .
' I read in a book once , some French guy , that all reality is illusion .
Did n't make much sense to me at the time , but now I see what he was getting at .
Only he got it ass backwards .
All illusion is reality , leastways it 's fixing to be .
Just give it time .'
This taste for metaphysics goes back to his Hollywood years in the Sixties , when he became obsessed with spiritual inquiry .
' I needed answers bad .
Everything had happened so fast , man , I did n't know what hit me .
I mean , I never intended ...'
He pauses , struggling to find the right words .
' All I ever did was open my mouth to sing , because music , uh , that was my way letting things out , as natural as talking , more natural in fact .
I never was much at putting myself into words , but singing was like breathing .
Just flew out of me , I could n't hold it in .
And then , out of nowhere , the world blew up on me - bang , bang , bang - and suddenly I was , I guess you 'd have to say , the biggest star on earth .
One day I was n't shit , the next I had people talking ' bout me like I was a devil , or even like I was God . '
He stares out of the trailer window at his vegetable patch and the bayou beyond , where a snowy egret has perched on the stump of a bald cypress .
' God , ' he says again , and shakes his head .
' I even heard they started up a church , the Church of Elvis in Christ or some , uh , crud , when they thought I 'd died .
That was n't right , man .
I know it was meant kindly , but ...'
I ask what he regrets .
' Lisa Marie , ' he says .
' I never should have left without telling her , little as she was .
But then , if I told her , I could n't have left .
I heard she was running all around the house , crying " My daddy 's gone . " '
He swipes at his eyes .
' It was the drugs , I could n't think clear .
And after , it was too late . '
Elvis turns his back , stirring the pots .
' In life , there 's one moment when it 's your time .
All the rest is too damn late . '
What was his moment ?
' I 'd have to say Sun Records .
Lasted about a year , from " That 's All Right ( Mama ) " to " Mystery Train " .
After that , I made a lot of good records , great records even , but I was performing .
At Sun , it was purely instinct . '
Does he listen to today 's music ?
' Not too much .
Belle and Claudette , they both have iPods , sometimes they 'll play me a song I like .
" Cry Me a River " , that was one .
I seen Justin Tingaling on TV ; the boy has moves .
But I do n't really follow who 's new .
I favour songs , more so than artists .
Artists do n't age too good . '
What about the Stones ?
' I rest my case . '
Bob Dylan ?
' Voice like a dentist 's drill .
But he was an able tunesmith ; he could fashion a hit . '
Sinatra ?
' Frank was smart .
He learned how to make damage work for him .
I never did .'
Well , then , what about Elvis Presley ?
' Like I said , I made some records .
A few of 'em I can still listen to today .
Not so much the early stuff - " Hound Dog " , " Heartbreak Hotel " - the ones critics rave about , but after I got out of the army .
" Little Sister " , I still like that .
" Suspicious Minds " , " In the Ghetto " , two , three more .
I do n't seek them out , though . '
Does he hold any grudges ?
' The Colonel , you mean ?
Why would I ?
The man made me a whole ton of money .
Any problems came down the road are on me . '
It 's started to rain , and the catahoula wanders in , sopping wet , to be fed a few nuggets of sausage .
' Ol ' Jerry Lee , ' says Elvis , tickling the hound behind the ears .
' He 's getting up there in years , same as me , got some mileage on him , fleas too , but he still knows his way round a duck - blind , you best believe he does . '
After Claudette and Belle return , the four of us sit down to dinner .
Elvis says grace - ' Dear Lord , we have a stranger with us tonight .
Look kindly upon him , as we beseech
You to look upon us , and bless this , our humble repast . '
The jambalaya is world - class , but he has a small appetite these days and toys with his food , rarely taking his eyes off Belle .
With her , he shows a gentleness and warmth that makes me realise , by contrast , just how intimidating I found him while we were alone .
After dinner , we watch 24 .
Elvis thinks the show 's absurd , a waste of space .
' That could never happen , not in a million years , ' he complains .
' Daddy , ' says Belle , ' do n't be a worm . '
At the end of the evening , Claudette beds me down on a Barcalounger , which I 'm forced to share with Jerry Lee .
Elvis is right about his fleas , and I pass a restless night , rising at dawn to find the rain has passed and there is n't a cloud in the sky .
I make myself a cup of Maxwell House and the smell lures Claudette , who can't sleep either .
Barefoot and tousled in striped pyjamas , she spikes her coffee with a shot of Wild Turkey .
Without make - up , she looks years younger .
Sensing me watching her , lusting , she seems amused and dismissive .
' What am I doing with an old dying man ? ' she says , reading my mind .
She takes a glug , grimacing at the burn .
' Jake gets me .
He always has .'
They 've been together 21 years .
When they met , Claudette was 20 , a part - time model who paid the bills by waitressing at a waffle house .
' Why lie ?
I was a runaway . '
Growing up in Plaquemines , down river from New Orleans , she 'd been hog - wild , got herself in a heap of trouble .
' I had real bad taste in men , ' she says .
But Jake was different .
He came in for his breakfast same time each morning , always had the same order , extra syrup on his waffles , a poached egg on the side .
He seemed gentle and old - fashioned , a true Southern gentleman , but she sensed he was lonely .
' We were both lost , ' she says , ' so why not be lost together ? '
They married in nine weeks .
Their union has n't always run smoothly .
' I was young , I had needs , ' Claudette says , daring me to disapprove .
Once , in the early years , she ran off with the drummer in a punk group .
When the drummer dumped her in Tulsa , Jake took her back without a word .
' Never even asked where I 'd been . '
She was safe with him .
If he'd ever had a need to punish and destroy , like other men , life had burned it out of him .
Of course , between his face and the fact he never spoke of his past , she knew he harboured a secret , but one thing she learned from him was not to ask questions you do n't want answered , so she did n't pry .
Besides , their life has had enough upheavals - spitballs , she calls them - without looking for extra drama .
The time she was swinging Belle , aged five , and the swing broke and Belle broke her back , she thought she 'd never get over the guilt .
Then Jake Jr goes off to fashion school in New York , and one day , out of the blue , he calls to say he 's having an operation and they 're going to have to call him Jacqui from now on .
Throw in Katrina , and Jake 's cancer , and starting over in this trailer , barely surviving day to day : ' You might say our dance - card is full . '
How does she feel about being married to Elvis ?
' I ain't married to no Elvis .
Jake Smith 's the one I wed , and he 's the one I 'll bury . '
Does n't knowing the truth change anything ?
Claudette looks exasperated .
' Truth ?
I 'll tell you what 's true . '
She gestures towards the bedroom .
' That 's a man in there . '
By the time Elvis surfaces , the sun is high and hot , and the trailer , lacking air conditioning , feels like an oven .
Claudette has left for work , Belle is at school and Jerry Lee is busy treeing possums in the yard .
Elvis , still heavy - headed from the pills he needs to sleep through pain , moves like a sleepwalker .
He seems more fragile today ; closer to the end .
I offer to leave , but he does n't respond .
Clearly , he still needs to talk .
We climb in a pirogue ( a Cajun canoe , hollowed from a cypress trunk ) , and Elvis poles us along the bayou , through a carpet of lime - green duckweed , all very Discovery channel .
Beards of Spanish moss trail overhead , blue herons and baby alligators sun themselves on the mud banks .
When we reach open marshland , Elvis stops paddling and lets us drift , blistered by the heat .
A wild duck flies low , coming in to land .
In the Metairie days , when Jake Smith went on hunting trips with his pastor at Wayside Calvary , it would have made for an easy kill .
Not now .
' I can't shoot a rat no more , just can't seem to make myself squeeze the trigger . '
For some minutes , we float in silence while the pirogue floats in futile circles , tangled in water hyacinth .
' Why me ? ' says Elvis at last .
' I was n't nothing special .
Not too smart , not too dumb , had acne , could n't get laid .
After I hit , my teachers were interviewed , they all said the same .
Average .
So how come it was me changed the world ?
Which I did .
No point mealy - mouthing ; Little Richard did n't do it , Chuck Berry , Buddy Holly , none of those .
Elvis Presley did .'
He does n't sound boastful .
On the contrary , he sees his uniqueness as a curse .
' What I said yesterday , was only halfway truth .
Sun Records was my moment , yes , but Lord knows I paid .
They say God wo n't put more on you than you can stand ; well , he did on me . '
He starts to paddle , but the water hyacinth has a firm hold and the pirogue merely gets more entangled .
' For years , I hurt to listen to those songs .
They were too raw , sounded like screams . '
And now ?
' I 'm past hurting . '
He peers into the swamp water , dipping one hand in the murk .
' Some days I try to put myself back into the boy I was then , working at the Precision Tool Company , hanging on Beale Street , running to the all - night gospel singings at Ellis Auditorium , dating Dixie Locke .
Or the times I used to cruise the skating rink in my bolero clothes - bullfighter 's jacket , ruffle shirt , black peg-pants with the pink stripe , half a jar of goop on my hair - when I did n't even know how to skate .
And , y'know , it 's not me .
I recognise the face , but that boy 's a stranger to me . '
How does he strike you ?
' He looks kinda bold , but that 's not the truth .
Under the grease and fancy duds , he 's so scared he can't hardly breathe .
I 'll tell ya , he 's got fear before they sold fear . '
Fear of what ?
' Himself .
What all was in him . '
Was it fear that ...?
' Drove him ?
Some , maybe .
But he's not the only freaky kid who ever walked the earth , and none of the others done like him , not close . '
Talent ?
' Talent 's nothing .
Eddie Cochran had talent .'
Right time , right place ?
' That helped . '
Act of God ?
' Watch your lip , son . '
Then what ?
Another silence .
Far across the marsh , I can see a bank of thunderheads coming our way .
By now the pirogue is so snarled , we 'll need a hoist to lift us clear .
' What I think , the writers got it wrong .
They all followed Sam Phillips and said I was a white kid who sounded black , like that explained everything .
But I never did sound black ; I did n't even try to .
What I really sounded was church .
That 's the first place I sung , First Assembly of God Pentecostal , back in Tupelo , when I was n't but two years old .
And then , in Memphis , gospel singers were always my idols .
White church , coloured church , it did n't matter .
Meet them offstage and they were just regular folks , but when the spirit hit them , they were lifted up .
Transported .'
As Elvis talks , his weariness lifts and he 's borne back , reconnected to himself as that strange boy .
' Same happened to me , ' he says .
' I 'd get up on that stage and something entered me .
People who did n't know what I came out of said I was crazy or dirty , a crying shame , but anyone who rose up in a Southern church , they knew it was possession .
I was an empty vessel ; the Lord chose to fill me up with sound .
Gave me the power of , uh , rapture , and sent it forth around the world . '
You 're saying rock 'n 'roll was God 's work ?
' Do n't take it lightly , son . '
The blue eyes , all that 's still alive in that mask - like face , stare me down .
' I know the people today , they 've lost their belief , prob'ly think I 'm an old crazy fool .
Well , maybe I am , but I know this : them first records I cut , they 're nothing but holiness music with jive - ass lyrics .
That 's what swept the world , not white music , not black , but church .
And all those kids rioting , screaming , fainting , making an idol of me , they did n't know it , but they were giving praise . '
Suddenly , he 's done in .
The surge of memory and passion has drained him ; it 's all he can do to sit up .
' The Lord picked me out ; I know it in my heart .
But why ?
Like I said , I was nothin ' special . '
Perhaps that 's the reason , I suggest .
Elvis looks startled .
Obviously , the thought is new to him .
' Average ? ' he says , after a long pause .
' Might just be that 's it . '
The thunderheads have rolled in , whipping up the waters and turning the sky inky .
The first fat drops of rain spatter us , and the pirogue starts to rock .
Elvis makes one last attempt to steer us out of the hyacinths , but we 're stuck fast .
What now , I ask .
' We sit tight , ' says Elvis , ' and we wait for Claudette . '
Where is the King ?
The other sightings
Since 1977 there have been several sightings of Elvis and as with so many aspects of his life , a lucrative cottage industry has grown up to service fans ' interest .

He is really fit and healthy and gives us lots of advice on drugs ' ) as does honorelvis.com ( ' Oscar J. Peterson , an insurance salesman from Morton , Ohio , reported he saw Elvis relieving himself at a urinal in the men's room at Fuddrucker 's in Coconut Grove ' ) .
Gail Brewer - Giorgio is the author of several books on the subject , including Is Elvis Alive ?.
She invited fans to phone a premium - rate number to listen to proof of his existence .
Rock critic Greil Marcus published Dead Elvis in 1991 , in which he wrote : ' the enormity of his impact on culture , on millions of people , was never really clear when he was alive . '

Is n’t war supposed to be a time of sacrifice ?
Guess the big guys are too busy making money to sacrifice . ( 1 ) ( 2 )
3 . Speaking of sacrifice , Congress continued its special retirement system where just five years of service gets you full retirement with benefits at age 62 .
Sweet !
Where can we get that deal ? ( 1 )
4 . One day Congress was feeling so powerful it decided to trash the great protection against unlawful imprisonment , the writ of habeas corpus .
This dates back 800 years to the Magna Carta .
You can now be arrested without a charge , denied a lawyer , and held indefinitely .
They said it ’s just for terrorists but they lied .
As a special bonus , those torture techniques for terrorists can also be used on U.S. citizens .
More of that globalism business .

5 . But let ’s be fair , the U.S. Senate did take a firm stand on Iraq just recently .
They took the time to vote 72 to 25 to condemn an anti war group for criticizing the testimony of one of the few generals who actually supports the war .
At the same time they gave billions more to continue in Iraq .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Scores of illegal immigrants , including a man wanted for murder and a convicted child molester , were arrested in Southern California raids this week , U.S. authorities said on Friday .
The sweeps in Orange County , south of Los Angeles , were part of an operation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting “ criminal aliens ” -- defined as people in the country illegally who have also committed other crimes .
Of the 175 people arrested , 27 are criminal aliens and another 26 are “ immigration fugitives ” who had ignored deportation orders by a judge .
The raids were part of larger crackdown on immigration fugitives , which this year has resulted in the first ever decline in their number , to 632,189 , according to an agency spokeswoman .
“ ICE has been working to aggressively improve the systems that help us identify , target and remove fugitive aliens from the United States , ” Julie Myers , assistant secretary of homeland security for ICE , said in a statement .
The U.S. Senate is still struggling with a massive immigration overhaul , backed by President George W. Bush , that would legalize millions of illegals despite furious opposition from conservatives .
California , which shares a border with Mexico , has been at the forefront of the debate as its immigrant population has swelled in the past four decades , driving the state ’s population to more than 37 million .
Among those arrested in the raids was Almarez Reveles Gonzalo , 35 , wanted in Mexico for the murder of his 74 - year - old uncle , ICE said .
He was turned over to Mexican authorities .
Also arrested was Jamie Pena - Martinez , 30 , a Mexican national previously convicted of child molestation who was ordered deported .
Most of those arrested in the raids were Mexicans , but others came from India , Kenya , the Philippines and Columbia .
Of the 175 arrested , ICE said , 100 had already been deported .
Several genes with strong associations to schizophrenia have evolved rapidly due to selection during human evolution , according to new research in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
Researchers found a higher prevalence of the influence of so - called positive selection on genes or gene regions known to be associated with the disorder than a comparable control set of non-associated genes , functioning in similar neuronal processes .
This is consistent with the theory that positive selection may play a role in the persistence of schizophrenia at a frequency of one per cent in human populations around the world , despite its strong effects on reproductive fitness and its high heritability from generation - to - generation .
It also provides genetic evidence consistent with the long - standing theory that schizophrenia represents , in part , a maladaptive by - product of adaptive changes during human evolution - possibly to do with aspects of creativity and human cognition .
“ The world - wide presence of this disorder at an appreciable frequency , despite its impact on human health and reproductive fitness , is somewhat of a paradox , ” said Dr Steve Dorus from the University of Bath , who worked with Dr Bernard Crespi from Simon Fraser University ( Canada ) and Dr Kyle Summers from East Carolina University ( USA ) on the research .
“ This may be explained by the existing theory that the condition represents , in part , a by - product of adaptive changes during human evolution .
“ Our finding that positive evolutionary processes have impacted genes underlying the disorder is consistent with this idea .
“ However , the selective forces influencing the evolution of these genes remain unknown .
“ Given the complex genetic nature of the condition , selection may be mediated by a diverse array of neurodevelopmental , neurophysiological and psychological mechanisms .
“ Schizophrenia has also been associated with creativity throughout recorded history , but whether this link has a genetic basis is certainly not yet clear . ”
The researchers analysed the molecular evolution of the 76 genes that have the strongest genetic association with the disorder .
They surveyed human polymorphisms - discrete changes in the human genome that vary between individuals - for very recent selective events within specific human populations .
They also compared genes between mammalian species to identify selection on primate lineages salient to the evolution of humans and the disorder .
The research identified evidence for positive selection on a variety of genes , including three genes that have the best functional or reproducible associations with the disorder : disrupted in schizophrenia ( DISC1 ) , dystrobrevin - binding protein 1 ( DTNBP1 ) and neuregulin 1 ( NRG1 ) .
“ For the first time it is possible to complement our genetic understanding of the disorder with substantial evolutionary and comparative genomic analyses , ” said Dr Dorus .
“ Decades of intensive research , using association and inheritance studies between affected and non-affected siblings , has resulted in a much clearer understanding of the genetic basis of the disorder .
“ Hopefully , a better understanding of the evolution of the substrates underlying the disease will assist in characterizing how they are dysregulated in the disorder .
“ Understanding the impact of positive selection may also help refine hypotheses concerning genetic links between schizophrenia and aspects of human creativity and cognition .

Congressmembers rule : No calling Bush a liar Michael Roston
Published : Monday July 16 , 2007 Print This Email This A Congressional Democrat has been reined in for calling President George W. Bush a ' liar ' during a Thursday hearing of the House Judiciary Committee , according to the Monday edition of the newspaper Roll Call .
" Rep. Mel Watt ( D - N.C. ) offered a lengthy criticism of Bushs record toward the end of Thursdays hearing , which included a statement that Bush lied about the reasons for going to war with Iraq in 2003 , " writes Susan Davis .
" Rep. Chris Cannon ( R - Utah ) offered an objection on the grounds that Watts words were ' unparliamentary ' and violated House rules on debate and decorum that forbid personal attacks on Members , the president or vice president . "
The exchange occurred just before the end of the hearing that expected to receive testimony from former White House Counsel Harriet Miers , who failed to appear .
She cited the White House 's exercise of ' executive privilege . '
Davis notes that a problem then occurred .
" Commercial and Administrative Law Subcommittee Chairwoman Linda Sánchez ( D - Calif . ) countered that the words were not ' unparliamentary , ' which parliamentarians and leadership aides on both sides of the aisle later agreed was the wrong procedural call , " she writes .
Cannon and his fellow Republicans then failed in a vote that attempted to ' take down '
Watt 's words .
But because Rep. Sánchez 's ruling was said to interfere with House precedent on the question , Rep. Cannon threatened " to take it to the House floor in a privileged resolution . "
The two sides subsequently negotiated a compromise in which Sánchez agreed to vacate her decision that the words were not ' unparliamentary ' in a subsequent hearing .
Cannon is not a stranger to controversy of his own over strong statements .
He recently called former US Attorney for New Mexico David Iglesias an ' idiot ' in a Fox News broadcast .

In 1926 , when the scientific world was still a-puzzling and a - wondrin over the wave - particle duality of light , Einstein asked a pal , Emil “ Hurry ” Rupp , to conduct an experiment that would settle the matter .
If anyone could do it , thought Einstein , it was Rupp who was considered the latest and greatest experimental physicists of the day .
The experiment involved so - called canal rays produced in a gas discharge tube .
When an electric field passes across a gas at low pressure , the tube shines ‘ n ’ glows due to the movement of electrons from the cathode to the anode ( so - called cathode rays ) .
But if a hole is made in the cathode , so - called canal rays appear start a - streamin and a - strayin ’ through the hole in the opposite direction to the cathode rays .
The question that Einstein asked Rupp to resolve was whether the light from canal rays was wave - like or particle - like .
The matter was settled when Rupp said he could see with his own eyes that the light formed interference patterns .
That proved it must be wave - like .
Einstein presented the result as evidence in his own interpretation of quantum mechanics .
But nobody else could see these interference patterns and physicists soon began to doubt the veracity of Rupp ’s work .
In 1935 he publicly retracted five of his scientific paper in the previous year claiming to be suffering from “ psychasthenia linked to psychogenic semiconsciousness ” .
Rupp turned out to be the greatest scientific fraudster of the 20th century , surpassing even Hendrick Schoen from Bell Labs in his boldness and audacity ( and mental health ) .
It later emerged that everything Rupp had done in the previous ten years was a fraud .
Einstein swallowed it hook , line and sinker .
Now Jeroen “ Kongen ” van Dongen at the Institute for History and Foundations of Science at Utrecht University in the Netherlands has re-analysed Einstein ’s role in the controversy .
He says the evidence “ suggests a strong theoretical prejudice on Einstein ’s part ” which led him to ignore evidence that Rupp ’s the experiments were a sham and a -rigged .
Poor old Einstein !
But I know ya’ll will forgive him

It 's a classic cocktail party conundrum :
How do our brains decide where we should train our attention when people are milling all about us chatting away — some to us , some to others ?
In an attempt to find out , researchers at Stanford University and McGill University in Montreal scanned the brains of 18 subjects who were listening to classical music by 18th - century British composer William Boyce .
" You have to kind of segment these streams [ of information ] into chunks , " says senior study author Vinod Menon , an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Stanford .
The process of slicing the data , he continues , requires that you " identify something that 's interesting and then you have to switch on the attentional network . "
" Memory does n't work like video recorder , it 's more like DVD , " in how it recalls events as discrete chapters , explains study co-author Daniel Levitin , a psychology professor at McGill .
But why music ?
Simple , says Sridhar Devarajan , a Stanford neuroscience graduate student involved in the project .
" Transitions between musical movements , " he notes , " offer an ideal setting to study the dynamically changing landscape of activity in the brain during this segmentation process . "
The team wove together different movements from several of Boyce 's four - to five - minute symphonies and had volunteers listen to two nine - minute compositions through noise - canceling headphones while lying in an fMRI machine ; each of the musical tapestries consisted of 10 orchestral movements .
( Boyce 's compositions were selected because he is a relatively obscure composer and subjects were less likely to be familiar with his work , canceling out brain activity that would be generated if they had recollections of his symphonies . )
The team conducted full brain scans that allowed them to focus on regions of the brain of particular interest , monitoring them from 10 seconds before a transition between movements to 10 seconds after .
( A transition between movements is marked by a decline in the amplitude of sound followed by a brief period of silence that leads into a new section of music . )
According to Menon , during the transition periods the team not only observed activity in discrete brain regions , but they also noticed co-active networks ( two areas responding simultaneously ) reacting to the musical shifts .
Activity began in areas in the forward section of the prefrontal cortex of the brain as well as in parts of the temporal cortex just above the brain stem .
Menon speculates that it is this network that is " detecting a salient change " in the information stream .
Next , areas toward the rear of the prefrontal cortex and parts of the parietal cortex ( the outermost layer of the parietal lobe at the upper rear of the brain ) , began to respond .
The regions , Menon notes , are linked to attention and working memory .
" We feel that it could be a very general brain mechanism part of a core control signal that is generated in response to any attention - demanding task , " Menon says .
" I think any task that involves detecting a salient event and attending to it will command a similar type of response . "
Levitin adds , " Here we had a peak of activation associated with nothingness , " when there was no sound at all .
" [ Clearly ] , there are neural processes that are responsible for signaling the beginning and ending of events . "
Next up for Menon 's team : trying to determine the next level of processing after recognizing and responding to a change in an information stream .
It also plans to apply whatever new information it discovers to learn more about " what structure actually means in music . "

Summary
Yukihiro Matsumoto , the creator of the Ruby language , talks with Bill Venners about becoming a better programmer through reading code , learning languages , focusing on fundamentals , being lazy , and considering interfaces .
Yukihiro Matsumoto , or " Matz , " as he is known online , is the creator of the Ruby programming language .
Ruby is an object - oriented language suitable for writing day to day scripts as well as full - scale applications .
Matz began work on Ruby back in 1993 , because he wanted a language that made him productive while being fun to use .
Initially popular in Japan , Ruby has been finding its way into the hearts of programmers all over the world .
On September 24 , 2003 , Bill Venners met with Yukihiro Matsumoto at the JAOO conference in Aarhus , Denmark .
In this interview , which is being published in multiple installments on Artima.com , Yukihiro Matsumoto discusses Ruby 's design philosopy , the features of the Ruby language , and becoming a better programmer .
In Part I : The Philosophy of Ruby , Matz waxes philosophic about design imperfection , the danger of orthogonality , granting freedom with guidance , the principle of least surprise , and the importance of the human in computer endeavors .
In Part II : Dynamic Productivity with Ruby , Matz discusses morphing interfaces , using mix-ins , and the productivity benefits of being concise in Ruby .
In Part III : Blocks and Closures in Ruby , Matz discusses two kinds of nameless functions in Ruby , blocks and closures .
In this fourth and final installment , Matz talks about becoming a better programmer through reading code , learning languages , focusing on fundamentals , being lazy , and considering interfaces .
Reading Source Code
Bill Venners :
In an interview with CIPS Connections , you said , " I read a bunch of open source software source code , for example , Perl , Python , and many flavors of Lisp interpreter .
I know they were needed to write Ruby . "
What benefit do you think programmers can derive from reading source code ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Programmers can get a lot of benefit from reading source code .
You can't simply tell people how to be good programmers .
You can offer them some principles of good programming .
You can describe some good design experiences you 've had .
But you can't give them a real knowledge of how to be a good programmer .
I believe the best way for that knowledge to be obtained is by reading code .
Writing code can certainly help people become good programmers , but reading good code is much better .
Bill Venners : Why ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Because being a good programmer is a matter of experience .
Code is an expression of the thoughts , attitudes , and ideas of the programmer .
By reading code , you can not only figure out what particular task the programmers were trying to accomplish and understand how they did it , but you can also gain insight into how they were thinking .
This is the reason that reading code makes programmers better .
And besides that , if you want to know how to accomplish something in code , you can open a computer science textbook .
The textbook will explain the algorithm .
But if you want to understand the algorithm very quickly , reading code is the best way .
Moreover , you can execute code that implements theh algorithm .
You can use a debugger to watch the code as it performs the algorithm .
And this is much better than just reading a textbook .
Learning Languages
Bill Venners :
In the CIPS Connection interview , you gave ten tips for programmers .
One of them was , " Learn more than one programming language , preferably many different styles , like scripting , object - oriented , functional , logic , etc . "
What is the benefit of learning multiple programming languages ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Every language or system has its own culture .
In the background of every language or system are some central ideas .
Most of these ideas are good , but they are different .
By learning many languages and systems , you get exposed to different ideas — and that enhances your point of view .
If you do n't know Prolog , for example , you may not know the power of goal directed programming — programming by describing the problem to solve through specifying rules to apply .
This is a very interesting concept .
It is a very different way of thinking .
And if you do n't know Prolog , or the predicate logic , it 's very difficult to discover this way of thinking by yourself .
Knowing other systems and paradigms expands the world inside your brain .
That 's why I advise learning multiple languages .
Focusing on Fundamentals
Bill Venners :
You also said in your ten top tips : " Do n't focus too much on tools .
Tools change .
Algorithms and basic fundamentals do n't . "
What did you mean by that ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
That was partly about focusing on humans instead of machines .
Humans change very slowly , but systems change rapidly .
100 years ago , people were mostly the same as they are in the present time .
100 years ago we had no computers .
50 years ago we had computers , but they were very primitive .
20 years from now , I can't imagine how computers will be .
But I can imagine how people 20 years from now will think .
Another example is mathematics .
Mathematics has a very long history .
It 's a very mature science , but computer science is not .
So it 's good to retrieve ideas from mathematics .
Tools change very easily as time passes .
If you focus too much on present - day tools , your efforts will give you only short - term returns .
If you want benefits that will endure , you need to focus more on fundamentals .
Focus on mathematics and human psychology .
Focus on established sciences and established ways of thinking .
Being Lazy
Bill Venners :
You also mentioned in your ten top tips : " Be lazy .
Machines should serve human beings .
Often programmers serve machines unconsciously .
Let machines serve you .
Do everything you can to allow yourself to be lazy . "
Why should I try to be lazy ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
You want to be lazy .
You want to do anything to reduce your work .
I work hard to reduce my work , to be lazy .
Bill Venners : I believe that .
Yukihiro Matsumoto : I work very eagerly to be lazy .
Considering Interface
Bill Venners :
You also mentioned in your ten top tips : " Be nice to others .
Consider interface first : man - to - man , man - to - machine , and machine - to - machine .
And again remember the human factor is important . "
What do you mean by , " consider interface first ? "
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Interface is everything that we see as a user .
If my computer is doing very complex things inside , but that complexity does n't show up on the surface , I do n't care .
I do n't care if the computer works hard on the inside or not .
I just want the right result presented in a good manner .
So that means the interface is everything , for a plain computer user at least , when they are using a computer .
That 's why we need to focus on interface .
Some software people — like weather forecasters , the number crunchers — feel that the inside matters most , but they are a very limited field of computer science .
Most programmers need to focus on the surface , the interface , because that 's the most important thing .
Bill Venners :
You also mentioned machine - to - machine interfaces , so are you just talking about interfaces for users or also for machines ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
It 's not just user interfaces .
When machines are talking to each other via a protocol , they do n't care how the other is implemented on the inside .
The important thing is the proper output getting passed correctly via the proper protocol .
That 's what matters .
If you have a good interface on your system , and a budget of money and time , you can work on your system .
If your system has bugs or is too slow , you can improve it .
But if your system has a bad interface , you basically have nothing .
It wo n't matter if it is a work of the highest craftsmanship on the inside .
If your system has a bad interface , no one will use it .
So the interface or surface of the system , whether to users or other machines , is very important .

( 用語、概念をいいかげんに使っているので絶対に真にうけないこと!!)
( マシン語を知らない子ども 達 - UEI shi3 zの日記とこれに対する反響を読んで書いたものです )
あまりにも当たり前過ぎて21世紀に入ってから言葉にしたことはあまりないのですが，当然のことながら，プログラムというのは，Curry-Howardの対応を理解して、初めて「書ける」と言うものです．プログラムが書ける，という状態は「Curry-Howardの対応を理解している」という状態の延長線上にあるべきで，Curry-Howardの対応を理解していないということは，プログラムの仕様を理解していない，つまりプログラムを理解していないのとほぼ同じことだと思います．
最近はLLと呼ばれる，いわゆる軽量スクリプト言語がメインになってきていますし，僕も普段はPHPでプログラムを書くことが増えてきましたが，それでも依然として，プログラムというのはCurry-Howardの対応を理解して書くもので，プログラムというものはすべて型付λ算法の延長上にあると思っています．
その意識がないと、たとえPHPやJavaScriptのコードを書いていても、不可解な動きをしたり、遅くなってしまったりしたときに「なぜだろう?」ということがピンとこないことになります。
まだ大学に入って無くて、趣味のプログラミングを楽しんでいる若い人たちには、ぜひCurry-Howard対応にもとづくプログラミングを勉強してみることを勧めます。
最近は素晴らしい時代になったもので、ごく初歩的な入門はHaskell言語などの静的型システムをもつ言語でもすることができます．
しかし本格的 にCurry- Howard対応で遊びたくなったら、AgdaやCoqなどの定理証明支援系を使うのがお勧めです．
今のプログラム仕様は複雑になりすぎていて、初心者が全ての性質を知ろうとすると膨大な時間と労力がかかります。
しかし、最終的にはそれは全て知らなければならないことですし、知っておくべきことです。
最近は、全くの文化系の女の子が、わずか数ヶ月の研修で「システムエンジニア」や「ITコンサルタント」と称してJavaのプログラムを書くような商売もあるらしいのですが、そんなときにもぜひCurry-Howardの対応を勉強してもらいたいと思います。Curry-Howardの対応が解らないと、そもそもシステムが満すべき仕様の構造やその証明の構成方法がわからないということなので、何が問題なのかわからないことの方が多くなると思います。
どれだけデバッガやコンパイラが進化しても、その仕組みを理解していることは絶対に必要です。
筆算ができない人が電卓を使い続けたときに答えが正しいのか間違っているのかわからないのと同様，Curry-Howardの対応が理解できない人が書いたプログラムは、一見うまく動いているように見えたとしても、それは奇跡のようなバランス、自転車で言えば補助輪がついた状態で奇跡的に動いているに過ぎず、なにか未知の問題が発生したときに素早くプログラムの仕様内部でおきていることに直感を巡らせ、適切な処置・対応をするためにはCurry-Howardの理解は不可欠と言って良いでしょう。
さらにいえば 、Curry - Howardの対応よりさらに下のレイヤーである、直観主義論理学を理解しているとさらに理想的です。
昔、形式的仕様記述の本といえば論理学の本を意味しました。しかし、今の若いプログラマ達は、下のような証明図をみても何を意味するか瞬時にわからないのではないでしょうか．(図は略)
プログラムは全て論理式とその証明の組み合わせでできています。プログラムを構成するのは全て直観主義論理なので、直観主義論理を理解しないとシステムの満すべき性質を理解していないことになります。
最低でも、一階述語論理系を構成できる程度の理解はしておいて欲しいと思います。
直観主義論理，Matin-Loefの型理論、依存型算譜言語の3つは、現在でもあらゆるプログラムの基礎になっているので、最低限おさえておきたいところです。
最後に参考文献をまとめておきます。

All 17 were injured around midday when police baton - charged a group of monks and mainly young protesters near the Shwedagon Pagoda , Burma 's holiest shrine , the witnesses said .
Among the wounded was an 80 - year - old monk who witnesses said was beaten about the head by security forces .
The elderly monk has participated in the daily anti-junta protests in Rangoon although he cannot walk and has to be carried .
' World is watching Burma ' Meanwhile , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting on the situation in Burma , saying " the whole world is now watching Burma " .
Brown , whose country is the former colonial power in the reclusive Asian state , added that a UN envoy should be sent to the country to make the seriousness of the situation to the " illegitimate and repressive regime " .
" I hope the Security Council will meet immediately , meet today and discuss this issue and look at what can be done , " he said .
" The first thing that can be done is that the UN envoy should be sent to Burma , " he said , reacting after the military junta moved to crack down on protesters in Rangoon .
" I hope he's in a position to go , to make sure that the Burmese regime directly is aware that any trampling of human rights ... not be acceptable in future , " he said .
" The human rights of the Burmese people are first and foremost , " he added .
And he warned : " The whole world is now watching Burma and its illegitimate and repressive regime should know that the whole world is going to hold it to account .
" The age of impunity in neglecting and overriding human rights is over . "
' The world does want restraint '
Foreign Secretary David Miliband urged restraint from Burma authorities .
" The world does want restraint , and it will hold the regime accountable for any actions , " he said , shortly before heading for New York to take part in the UN General Assembly .
But he acknowledged also the limits on what the outside world can do .
" The direct support that the monks and the students and the people of Burma can have is obviously limited by the fact that it's an extremely repressive regime that 's held the country in a very tight noose for so long . "
Miliband reiterated Britain 's support for democracy leader Aung San Sun Kyi , who has become an internationally recognised symbol of non-violent political change since her National League for Democracy won 1990 elections .
" She will know that the world is on her side and a democratic Burma must be the end result , " he told reporters in the sidelines of the ruling Labour Party 's annual conference in the south coast resort of Bournemouth .
Tear gas , shots fired Earlier , troops fired shots over the heads of Buddhist monks and their supporters today as Burma 's repressive military junta moved to crush the country 's biggest protest campaign in 20 years .
Tear gas was also fired to quell the latest rally , and participants were beaten and arrested after they defied the military 's warnings not to interfere in the country 's politics .
But even as word of the beatings and arrests spread , protest marches continued .
Witnesses said thousands of onlookers cheered as around 1000 Buddhist monks shrugged off the heavy presence of soldiers and police and kept marching toward the centre of the main city of Rangoon .
The crowd roared approval for the monks and shouted at security forces : " You are fools !
You are fools ! "
Police and troops then fired a volley of warning shots and tear gas to try to break up the march , witnesses said .
It was one of several demonstrations in the city today , held despite the junta 's warning yesterday that force could be used to end what it called illegal street protests .
Police charge protesters
Earlier , police baton - charged hundreds of students and monks who had defied a ban on gatherings to rally at Burma 's holiest shrine , the Shwedagon Pagoda .
Dozens of protesters , including some of the revered monks who have turned the spark of public anger into a nationwide movement in just a few days , were detained during the clashes in Rangoon .
Another march headed toward the house of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi , who has been held there under house arrest for most of the last 18 years .
As they walked , they urged a crowd along the streets to remain calm .
" We monks will do this , " they called to onlookers as a few dozen soldiers followed them in trucks .
" Please do n't join us .
Do n't do anything violent . "
Rally one of 14
There have been fears of a repeat of 1988 , the last time huge demonstrations emerged on the streets of Burma to challenge the junta 's iron rule .
Security forces opened fire , and around 3000 people were killed .
It was not immediately known if authorities were cracking down elsewhere today but the protests have become nationwide .
State media said there have been rallies in seven of the country 's 14 provinces .
In the western city of Sittwe , about 15,000 monks and people marched yesterday and a resident told AFP another march was planned for today .
" Anything can happen now , " said a Western diplomat in Rangoon before the crackdown began .
" There could be a limited crackdown , basically to frighten the monks and the civilians and to try to break the protest movement .
" It would be a kind of last warning before the worst . "
Today was the first time authorities in impoverished Burma used violence to break up the recent series of protests .
Analysts believe the junta had held back for fear that any violence against monks in the devoutly Buddhist nation would spark a huge outcry .
Agencies
Apple said Monday that many of the unauthorized iPhone unlocking programs available on the Internet cause irreparable damage to the iPhone 's software , which will likely result in the modified iPhone becoming permanently inoperable when a future Apple - supplied iPhone software update is installed .
The Cupertino - based company said it plans to release the next iPhone software update , containing many new features including the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store , later this week .
" Apple strongly discourages users from installing unauthorized unlocking programs on their iPhones , " the company wrote in a statement to the press .
" Users who make unauthorized modifications to the software on their iPhone violate their iPhone software license agreement and void their warranty . "
Apple added that the " permanent inability to use an iPhone due to installing unlocking software is not covered under the iPhone 's warranty . "
The iPhone maker 's announcement reflects an increasingly consistent anti-modification policy from the company , which is likely the result of pressure from AT&T to enforce the multi- year exclusivity agreement between itself and Apple .
In one recent incident reported by Mac news site MacNN , a customer discovered that Apple had refused service on his iPhone at a company retail store and even suggested that the phone would be permanently blacklisted from further support regardless of how well it was restored to factory conditions .
Both moves are likely to put Apple 's claims of possible permanent damage under close scrutiny , as the company will be responsible — if perhaps unintentionally — for breaking otherwise functional iPhones .
Here�s a quiz question for authors :
To copyright a written work in the United States , you must ( a ) register it with the Copyright Office ; ( b ) insert a notice that says � Copyright � 2007 � ; ( c ) insert a notice that says � All rights reserved . �
Answer : none of the above .
Under current law , a work is automatically copyrighted the moment it is �fixed in tangible form . �
And these days , that copyright lasts virtually forever : 70 years after the death of the author , in most cases .
Since there is no requirement to register a work and a copyright lasts so long , the legal owner of a work can be difficult to find , particularly when the work is more than a few decades old .
When some librarians at Carnegie Mellon University tried to request permissions to digitize a collection of out - of - print books , they were unable to find more than 20 percent of the rights holders , despite persistent efforts .
Failing to locate rights holders can be costly since copyright infringement may be subject to statutory damages of up to $ 150,000 an incident .
The costs of locating rights holders are an example of what economists call transactions costs .
Not surprisingly , high transactions costs tend to discourage transactions from occurring .
The so - called orphan works problem was examined by the Copyright Office in a 2006 report in which it proposed legislation to address the transactions costs issues .
Under its proposal , if you conducted a �diligent search� to locate a rights holder and still failed to find the owner , you would be off the hook .
You could then incorporate the work in question into your own work , as long as you provided proper attribution .
If the legitimate rights holder was subsequently found , he or she could not require that your work be withdrawn from circulation , but could collect �reasonable compensation� for use .
But what is a �diligent search ?�
The report leaves the interpretation of this phrase up to the courts but suggests some relevant considerations : whether the work includes identification , the age of the work , whether the work can be found in public databases like Copyright Office records , and so on .
The Copyright Office�s proposal is certainly a step in the right direction .
Clarifying the rights and obligations of the buyers and sellers of copyrighted material would reduce transactions costs , and that should lead to a more efficient market for intellectual property .
But does the proposed legislation go far enough ?
According to Lawrence Lessig , a Stanford University Law professor who is an expert in copyright law , it does not .
He favors a system where authors receive an automatic copyright when they create new works , but they must register their copyright within 14 years to retain it past the initial period .
( Unfortunately , such a registration requirement cannot apply to foreign creators because of international copyright treaties . )
This is in the same spirit as the copyright law in place before 1964 requiring that copyrights be renewed at the Copyright Office in their 28th year .
Materials that weren�t renewed fell into the public domain .
Mr. Lessig envisions the Copyright Office as specifying the standards for registries but not necessarily operating them , since the private sector may be better positioned to build and maintain such systems .
His inspiration is the domain name system used to register Internet sites .
In that system , a standards body specifies the design , but it is up to individual organizations to carry out the necessary registries .
The proposals by the Copyright Office and Mr. Lessig are not necessarily exclusive .
If easily accessible copyright registries existed , the courts would probably find that simply searching the registries would satisfy the diligent search requirement .
Creators of works with commercial potential would then have strong incentives to register their works .
In such a world , a legal requirement to register works could be redundant , since the commercial incentives to register would be strong .
Still , why take a chance ?
Establishing the expectations that works should be registered to receive the full protection of copyright law makes a lot of sense .
Creating a registry is not that difficult from either a technological or a business perspective .
The Copyright Clearance Center ( www.copyright.com) was established by a group of publishers in 1978 to provide rights clearance for printed works .
The Harry Fox Agency ( www.harryfox.com) serves as a clearinghouse for those who want to make recordings of songs , and there are plenty of Web sites devoted to image search to ease the sharing of photographs .
But would the creators charge excessive fees if rights clearinghouses became widespread ?
I would argue that just the opposite would occur .
An easy - to - use , efficient and competitive marketplace tends to push prices down .
Reducing the transactions costs of acquiring reproduction rights potentially makes both creators and users of information better off .
The orphan works legislation from the Copyright Office is still on the back burner in Congress .
Let us hope that it soon gets the attention it deserves .
Information plays a crucial role in today�s economy .
Making it easy for creators and users of information to find each other should be a high priority for policy makers .
Apparently this new form of invading your privacy was launched in January by Experian .
Here is there press release .
In an effort to help financial
services organizations collect on large volumes of uncollected debt ,
Experian( R ) , a global information solutions provider , today announced the
launch of Collection Triggers ( SM ) .
Collection Triggers is a robust and
flexible collections solution that monitors a company 's portfolio of
collections accounts .
When new information on one of these accounts becomes
available , indicating the possibility of recovering the debt , the organization
is notified within 24 hours and can then resume efforts to contact the
consumer and collect the outstanding debt .
" Our clients have been asking us to help solve the debt dilemma -- when
collection efforts go cold , the consequence is a huge burden of unpaid debt , "
said Kerry Williams , group president , Experian 's Credit Services .
" Collection
Triggers offers our clients the opportunity to know within 24 hours when a
debtor has had new credit activity , enabling quick action for the highest
probability of recovery . "
So companies are paying to have real time updates on your credit status .
Seems wrong to me .
But I 'm not a lobbyist for the credit industry .
Now you may be thinking to yourself , " hey , i'm not in credit card debt , that is n't my problem " .
Think again .
Applying for a mortgage ?
Refinancing ?
Well , your info is also being sold on a real time basis without your approval .
Those are sold as " mortgage triggers " .
As a former mortgage broker , Adryenn Ashley thought she knew what to expect when she refinanced her house in March .
Yet Ashley was unprepared for one twist she encountered : a barrage of phone calls and e-mails from rival lenders vying to sell her a better mortgage .
Some of the callers apparently knew just how much money she was borrowing .
Others made such misleading come -ons such as " We need to update your information " or " We need to complete your application , " Ashley recalls .
" I have privacy concerns over that , " she said from her home in Petaluma .
" My information should be confidential . "
These days , mortgage shoppers like Ashley are supreme telemarketing targets , thanks to " trigger leads " that the credit reporting bureaus sell to lenders the instant a consumer 's credit file is pulled by a loan officer .
So when Ashley 's lender checked her credit to prepare her loan , dozens of other mortgage companies were tipped off .
These alerts can be had for a few bucks per name if bought in bulk .
So you give the lender you are working with the authority to pull your credit report .
And then Experian sells it to anyone who is willing to buy that info .
Does that sound like an invasion of privacy ?
Not to the mortgage industry .
They claim that it allows you to " shop around " .
Apparently as a consumer you are too stupid to shop around and thus they need to make sure you do .
What next ?
" medical triggers " ?.
" Hi this is Dr Hibbert .
I understand you are suffering from Genital Herpes .
I would like to take this opportunity to offer you my new product VaxaGen .
Side effects may include ... " .
That is not how it looked at the time , however .
Vinokourov ’s fall came just as the peloton had closed to within about one minute of the four riders who had broken away 12 miles after the start and had led the stage for more than 90 miles .
The cyclists at the front of the pack were riding hard — and then they appeared to start riding a bit harder .
Image A bloodied Alexandre Vinokourov crossed the finish line after losing 1 minute , 20 seconds in the standings .

“ It ’s the last thing you want to see , someone like Vinokourov lose time like that , ” said Frank Schleck , a rider for CSC .
“ We did n’t know it happened until we came to the finish line . ”
But if the riders were unaware , they were among the few .
Many of the team cars , which follow the riders to help them if they have a flat tire or need a new bike after a crash , have televisions and the team managers watch race coverage .
And most of the riders talk to their managers on radios they carry in jersey pockets .
Nevertheless , Marc Biver , the general manager of Astana , said he did not believe that the peloton had tried to take advantage of Vinokourov ’s misfortune .
He said that because the fall occurred just as the large group of riders was about to catch the breakaway , it was inconceivable that they would slow to allow Vinokourov to catch up .
“ I do n’t see it as a personal attack against our team , ” Biver said .
“ It ’s a logical thing that happened .
Maybe I ’m wrong , but I did n’t see it like that and I do n’t consider like that .
Why should they wait ? ”
While Cancellara kept his lead , the lead changed hands in two of the other main competitions .
Sylvain Chavanel of Cofidis , who was in the four - man breakaway , was first over seven of the eight climbs on the stage and moved into first place in the king of the mountains competition .
Erik Zabel , a sprinter with Milram , took over the lead in the sprinters ’ competition by being one of the few able to stay with the main group over the final two climbs .
Zabel finished the stage in fifth place , vaulting him past Tom Boonen in the race for the green jersey , which Zabel has won six times before , the last time in 2001 .
As part of the ongoing commemorations marking the 50th anniversary of spaceflight this year , the New York Times offers a good package of stories interviewing NASA Administrator Michael Griffin , and presenting an overview of space projects in the U.S. and overseas .
The upshot ?
In each of two articles , a consistent message , particularly from Griffin : Other nations are threatening to erode the United States ' lead in space and space technology .
A sample :
" This is the last generation of Americans which is going to have the unquestioned opportunity to lead that enterprise , ” Mr. Griffin said .
“ Because in the next generation we are going to find , at least , Russia , China , India and Europe fully as capable as we are .
It will be a matter of interest and politics and societal will or desire .
But it will not be a matter of capability . "
Is this really such a bad thing ?
I 'm not entirely sure Griffin himself really believes this .
It 's certainly a net loss if you happen to be sitting inside the Pentagon , and watching the U.S. lead in spy satellites decay .
But if your goal is to get people to the Moon , Mars , and beyond , and to figure out as much as possible about the universe and our own planet as possible , having other people in the game can only help .
The knowledge and experience gained by China , India , Japan , Russia , and Europe , and anyone else who launches serious space projects , can be used collaboratively .
Nor is it a bad thing economically .
The U.S. economy has shown itself to be pretty good at keeping up a world - class aerospace industry .
Worldwide space ambitions could be a good thing for jobs , particularly with all of the private - sector space companies now springing up here .
Nevertheless , the articles forcefully make the point that big questions still have to be answered satisfactorily on a political , societal level , if we 're going to spend billions on manned spaceflight missions .
The biggest ?
Why are we doing this ?
The alternative could be collapse , before the lofty goals are reached .
Says John Logsdon , director of the space policy institute at George Washington University , in the first Times piece :
“ If the current proposals to restart human exploration fail politically , indeed , the human space flight endeavor conducted under government auspices might well lose its momentum .
I obviously hope that does n’t happen .
But it ’s far from a slam dunk that we ’re going back to the Moon and on to Mars . "

THE MUHAMMAD SALAH BOTTOMLINE
From a bulletin sent by the Council on American Islamic Relations : -
For many years now , Mr. Muhammad Salah lived life in the infamy of being labeled as the only designated US terrorist .
He suffered the repercussions of this judgment , long before he could face an open and fair trial in a US Court of law .
His assets were frozen , and his life shattered .
His family carried the burden of this label to their schools , workplaces , and to the local supermarket .
Today at the completion of an emotionally tolling trial on Mr. Salah and his family , the final verdict is out .
Though , he was found guilty of obstructing justice , he was found not guilty of racketeering – the major charge .
The third charge of providing material support to a terrorist organization had been dropped mid-trial .
And so , here 's the final word : Mr. Muhammad Salah is neither a terrorist nor a criminal for having supplied charitable aid to the most vulnerable factions of his occupied and war - ravaged country of origin , Palestine ; a jury of his peers understand that to be true .
Our justice system has affirmed what many in his family have long claimed , that Muhammad Salah , a conscientious and upright family man and community member was only guilty of being a bold Palestinian activist .
His fate is one that befalls many of his kind .
It is to my personal relief , that our justice system is where the buck stops on the political persecution of the embattled Palestinian people .
My sense of pride in our court system , however , comes with reservation .
Justice as we know it in America involves more than just an endpoint , it invovles the process of how to get there .
And while the verdict vindicates Salah and his name , the process , the trial , raises questions for those of us who are concerned about the rule of law , and the sanctity of our constitutional rights .
As a civil rights organization , our aspiration is to see every American granted his or her full rights under any and all circumstances .
Muhammad Salah 's right to a fair trial was forgone when the court decided to accept statements he made under torture .
It is a cause for concern to the American people when a U.S. court endorses foreign interrogation methods and detention practices that would be considered illegal under U.S. law .
Mr. Salah was systematically tortured by the Israeli Secret Service and interrogated for 80 days .
In some countries , such brutality is typically used to break down the psychological condition of a suspect .
Because the manner in which the confession was extracted would be inadmissible in the United States , it is repugnant to the public policy of American courts .
Muhammad Salah's 6th Amendment right to a public trial was also violated when the court ruled that portions of the suppression hearings and trial would be closed to the public .
Also , Muhammad Salah 's due process rights were violated when his assets were frozen before he could have the opportunity to defend himself in a public trial .
We hope that the suffering of the Salah family is over .
We also hope that the " terrorism " label be reserved in the future for those found guilty of that charge in an open and fair trail administered in a respected court of law .

" America does not go abroad in search of monsters to destroy . "
� John Quincy Adams
While it certainly was not his intent , Adams � assertion serves to remind us of a truth revealed by vast oceans of tears , torrential rivers of blood , and formidable piles of human remains .
Leaving murder , mayhem , and misery in its wake , America does " go abroad , " but not , as Adams noted , " in search of monsters to destroy . "
What Adams failed to perceive , despite living in the midst of the Native American genocide and the abject evil of chattel slavery , is that America is the monster .
Yet like most monsters that exist outside the boundaries of imagination , the printed word , celluloid , or digital imagery , the United States and its denizens ostensibly appear rather harmless and mundane .
In fact , it would probably be more accurate to say that a fair number of people still perceive us as downright heroic , cloaked as we are in our beguiling raiment of freedom and democracy .
" You need to ask why is it that we�re so surprised when the alleged BTK killer [ in Wichita ] ends up being someone who lives among us and works in our church and is a Cub Scout leader , " says Daryl Koehn , an ethicist at the University of St. Thomas in Houston and author of a new book , " The Nature of Evil . "
" We want evil to be monstrous , " she says , " because if evil is monstrous , then by definition it doesn�t look like us . "
� " Calling Evil by Name " from the Christian Science Monitor ( 3/10/05 )
While Jefferson penned the words , " life , liberty , and pursuit of happiness " in our Declaration of Independence , the notion actually evolved from Locke�s " life , liberty , and the pursuit of estate " and Adam Smith�s " life , liberty , and the pursuit of property . "
Smith�s version even found its way into The Declaration of Colonial Rights , crafted by the First Continental Congress in 1774 .
We in the United States act monstrously because in spite of Jefferson�s re-wording , we did not divorce ourselves from Locke�s and Smith�s notions .
We perceive an inextricable link between our happiness and the degree of material success we achieve .
Forged within the context of capitalism , which has become savage beyond comprehension as it rages against its inevitable self - destruction , our relentless devotion to our " inalienable right " to " life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness " focuses primarily upon enhancing our own lives ( others be damned ) , filling our heavily - mortgaged homes to the rafters with as much " stuff " as we can acquire , and satiating every hedonistic desire the law will allow , and then some .
We rarely pursue the spiritual form of happiness to which Jefferson was probably alluding .
In a nation where " I " rarely defers to " we " and property rights trump humanity , we US Americans tend to be all about " me " and hell - bent on dying a winner by possessing the " most toys . "
" About 24,000 people die each day from hunger or hunger - related causes .
Three - quarters of the deaths are children under the age of 5 . " �- The Hunger Project , United Nations ; Fall 2003
" You can find your way across this country using burger joints the way a navigator uses stars . "
� Charles Kuralt
Think about that figure of 24,000 for a moment .
Each day that passes , nearly three times as many human beings succumb to malnutrition and hunger than the total number of people we have lost in our illegal and murderous invasion of Iraq that began in 2003 .
Yet as Charles Kuralt pointed out , there is no shortage of victuals in the United States .
Fast food restaurants , the progenitors of numerous evils , including factory farming , Mcjobs , the corporatization of culture , and the " throw away " society , are nearly ubiquitous .
We US Americans are " lovin� it " and having it " [ our ] way " so much that highway weigh stations stops may eventually become mandatory for all motorists .
40 million of us are obese and 3 million more are morbidly obese .
Ironically though , we are so selfish and self - absorbed , that not only do we use our immense military and economic might to extort and force the rest of the world to supply our tiny percentage of the world�s population with a shockingly gluttonous one fourth of the Earth�s resources , we allow hunger and homelessness to exist amongst our own people !
Television , which is both our grossly distorted window to the world and a Siren�s call to viciously lacerate our souls upon the jagged coast of the Isle of Avarice where we ultimately find ourselves spiritually devoured by the beast called Consumerism , acts as a powerful catalyst for America�s pathological fascination with shopping .
While our multi-national corporations rape and exploit developing nations , our insanely over - funded death machine wages wholesale terror with a vengeance , our power - brokers on Wall Street man the bulwarks of predatory capitalism , our almost infinitely corrupt government protects and advances the interests of a cynical plutocracy , and the corporate media cover their collective asses , we US Americans disregard our consciences ( which have been rendered virtually impotent by the inculcation of the notion of American Exceptionalism anyway ) and pursue our " happiness " through serial retailing .
What better way to inject a dose of instant nirvana into our lives without becoming another of the 300,000 non-violent drug offenders behind bars in the US ?
Aside from its legality , shopping�s beauty lies in the ease with which one can attain the high it offers .
We merely arm ourselves with a fistful of readily obtainable credit cards ( remaining oblivious to the usurious interest to which we are obligating ourselves ) , jump in our SUVs that were actually designed to be used for public transit but somehow became modes of personal transportation , and head for the nearest leviathan , cookie - cutter retail establishment .
( Who knew the stairway to heaven had only three steps ? )
Once one arrives , there is a high probability of having a profound spiritual experience , like this for instance : Entering the mall , you find yourself captivated by a kiosk peddling expensive sunglasses .
One pair in particular demands your attention .
Initiating a moment of narcissistic bliss , you casually don the shades and catch a glimpse of yourself in one of the many mirrors the vendor has generously provided .
Smiling with self - satisfaction , you tell yourself you look " killer " in those $ 300.00 Dolce and Gabbanas .
Madison Avenue�s indoctrination has convinced you that you deserve them and that you need them to show people who you are .
So of course , you make them yours .
You , my friend , have just been elevated to a higher plane of existence in retailing paradise .
On a really good shopping day , we find ourselves in the midst of an enchanted world where the line between reality and the American Dream becomes an indistinct blur .
An upscale mall in suburban America is THE place to be on a weekend afternoon if you fancy yourself to be one of the " beautiful people " �white , at least comfortable financially , attractive , and thus amongst the only people who truly matter in this world .
Yet there is also plenty of room for the rest of us �those who refuse to relax our death grip on the losing lottery ticket that our magical thinking tells us is a guaranteed winner .
Why do we refuse to let go of a pipe dream ?
Because we see ourselves as a nation brimming with Horatio Algers .
" The good life " is just around the corner , if we just work hard enough .
So potent is this pernicious lie , they will have to pry this metaphorical lottery ticket from our " cold , dead hands . "
Posturing , preening , styling , profiling , seeing , being seen , and best of all , exercising their patriotic duty to God , country , and retailer , the " beautiful people " set the trend for the rest of us .
It �s hard to conceive of something more " inspiring " than the most spoiled and privileged human beings on the face of the planet filling their Hummers with bags emblazoned with the likes of Abercrombie , Neiman Marcus , the Limited , Nordstrom , and Saks so they can stay ahead of the fashion curve , play with the latest electronic toys , best the neighbors , and to have more contents to dampen the echoes reverberating throughout their relatively empty McMansion domiciles , which are large enough to house fifty people but often afford shelter to only a few .
Whether we are amongst the " blessed elite " of humanity or not , as US Americans it is our patriotic duty to shop .
Shopping was our first " counter - terrorism measure " after 9/11 , remember ?
Our very way of life depends upon our wallets and our willingness to open them .
If we falter in our sacred duty to over - indulge our desires at the expense of humanity and the Earth , dear reader , our world as we know it will be lost to the " Islamic hoards " , " Godless Communists " , and " Hispanic invaders . "
As long as greed , self - absorption , selfishness , and consumerism are so deeply woven into our sociocultural fabric , we who comprise the collective in the United States will exist as a living testament to Victor Hugo�s observation that , " Adversity makes men , and prosperity makes monsters . "

The draft law aims to boost US use of renewable energy
The draft law details support for " clean " energy sources like biofuels , wind , solar and geothermal resources .
It would withdraw some $ 16bn ( £ 8 bn ) in annual subsidies from the oil industry .
But the bill is opposed by President George Bush , and still has to be merged with other energy measures passed by the Senate before it can become law .
If it passes in its current form , the bill will require all American utility companies to generate 15 % of their energy from renewable sources by the year 2020 .
It also calls for more stringent efficiency standards for lighting and electrical appliances .
And it would do away with tax concessions long enjoyed by the major oil companies such as Exxon - Mobil , Conoco and Chevron .
Powerful lobby
But there is a long way to go yet .
The bill has to be married up with a very different approach taken by the Senate .
The Democrats , who now control Congress , are taking on one of America 's most powerful lobbies .
The oil industry has friends in very high places - not least inside the Bush administration .
A federal district court judge struck down two key pillars of the Patriot Act Wednesday , ruling that using a secret spying court to wiretap and secretly search Americans ' homes for criminal prosecutions violates the Constitution 's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures .
Federal district court judge Ann Aiken struck down the government 's ability to get orders from the secret spy court for anything other than acquiring foreign intelligence activities , saying that using that court and its lowered standards – instead of getting a traditional criminal wiretap order – violates the Fourth Amendment 's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures .
The ruling applies to Patriot Act changes to wiretapping laws and to so - called sneak - and - peak searches , where the government can search someone 's home secretly and never have to disclose the search to the individual .
The ruling comes out of a lawsuit brought by Portland attorney Brandon Mayfield , who was arrested by the FBI shortly after train bombings in Madrid , Spain .
The FBI publicly said Mayfield 's prints matched the bomb , though Mayfield had no passport and the Spanish police told the FBI they did not believe the print was a match .
The government approached the secret spying court , saying that Mayfield was an " agent of a foreign power " which allowed the government to get warrants to secretly search his home and office , as well as bug his house and eavesdrop on him , for use in a criminal court .
Prior to the Patriot Act , searches authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act had to have a primary purpose of gathering foreign intelligence , rather than prosecuting a person .
Mayfield , a practicing Muslim who argues he was targeted by the FBI because of his religion , was later exonerated of all charges .
Mayfield and the government settled his lawsuit , with the exception of his challenge to the changes to the Patriot Act that allowed the government to use secret spying orders , rather than traditional wiretaps , for criminal cases .
Judge Aiken , a federal district court judge in Portland , Oregon , found that the Patriot Act handed too much power to the executive branch :
The practical result of this amendment , objected to by plaintiffs , is that in criminal investigations , the government can now avoid the Fourth Amendment 's probable cause requirement when conducting surveillance or searches of a criminal suspect 's home or office merely by asserting a desire to also gather foreign intelligence information ...
In place of the Fourth Amendment , the people are expected to defer to the Executive Branch and its representation that it will authorize such surveillance only when appropriate .
The defendant here is asking this court to , in essence , amend the Bill of Rights , by giving it an interpretation that would deprive it of any real meaning .
This court declines to do so .
If the decision holds , the government will also have to destroy the materials it seized from Mayfield 's house .
That evidence may include , according to the ruling " photocopies or photographs of documents from confidential client files in Mayfield 's law office , summaries and excerpts from the computer hard drives from the Mayfield law office and plaintiffs ' personal computers at home , analysis of plaintiffs ' personal bank records and bank records from Mayfield 's law office , analysis of client lists , websites visited , family financial activity , summaries of confidential conversations between husband and wife , parents and children , and other private activities of a family 's life within their home . "
The government will almost certainly appeal the decision ( .pdf ) to the 9th U.S. Circuit Appeals Court .
The case is Mayfield v. United States .

Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster
For nearly as long as there have been LEGO bricks , there have been LEGO churches .
There 's just something about making a little temple for your plastic mini-figures to worship at that appeals to the spirit .
Odds are you 've gotten the email with photos of the amazing LEGO Church built by Amy Hughes - if you have n't , I recommend you go and take a look at what a true LEGO Master can do when she sets her mind to it .
I 'm nowhere near Amy 's class when it comes to Church Building - in fact , up until I started this project I had never tried to construct any sort of large scale LEGO building .
( Normally I focus on spaceships and the odd superhero vehicle . )
But when I learned of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster I knew that the time had come for me to try something new .
A quick email to Bobby , the church 's founder , and I had official sanction to " break ground " on perhaps my most radical departure from Spaceship building ever .
It took several months to complete this model - although a lot of that time was spent with a bad case of " builder 's block " ( Pun unintentional , I assure you . )
I 've no idea of the total number of bricks involved , but it did pretty much consume my collection of light grey parts .

The truth is , I donâ€™t see anything particularly Grand about it , anyhow .
Just Old .
Like Caligula , Genghis Khan and Torquemada .

MoveOn accuses Rudy of valuing money over Iraq strategy in new ad David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 17 , 2007

The war over the war continues this week .
MoveOn.org , the controversial anti-war group that Republicans bashed for its ad targeting Gen. David Petraeus , is hitting back against one of its harshest critics , Rudy Giuliani .
The former New York mayor has criticized his most prominent potential Democratic opponent , Hillary Clinton , for not distancing herself from MoveOn 's " General Betray Us ? " ad that ran in last Monday 's New York Times .
And he purchased his own ad in the Times last week responding to MoveOn .
In a new advertisement the group hopes will air soon in Iowa , MoveOn accuses Giuliani of " going AWOL " when he was picked to advise the president on his Iraq strategy , and the liberal group says the former mayor has betrayed voters ' trust .
Giuliani , who is a top candidate to snag the Republican presidential nomination , was tapped to serve on the Iraq Study Group , but he was later booted from the panel when he failed to show up for meetings , choosing instead to collect six - figure speaking fees , the group alleges .
Newsday reported that Giuliani quit the group after behind admonished for failing to attend meetings -- instead appearing for paid public speeches .
But Giuliani insisted his decision to withdraw from the group stemmed from his desire not to politicize its findings because he was considering a presidential run .
 It seemed to me that it should be apolitical ,  Mr. Giuliani said when asked in December 2006 about his decision , according to the New York Times .
Although he has made the war on terror a central tenet of his campaign , Giuliani has scant foreign policy experience aside from serving as New York 's mayor when nearly 3,000 people died in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Giuliani left office four months later .
" After skipping important meetings of the Iraq Study Group , he quit , and gave speeches -- for money , " MoveOn 's new ad says .
In 14 months , Giuliani made $ 11.4 million speaking to audiences around the world about Sept. 11 and his time as mayor .
When he quit the bipartisan Iraq Study Group in May of 2006 , Giuliani was in the middle of his busiest stretch of speeches , when he gave 20 in a single month and took in $ 1.7 million , according to Newsday .
MoveOn.org purchased an advertisement in the New York Times timed to last week 's congressional hearings featuring Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker .
The ad asked if Petraeus would become " General Betray Us ? " by cherry picking data to give a false impression of progress in Iraq .
Giuliani jumped on the group and tried to tie its strident message to Clinton .
Giuliani continued his anti-Clinton attacks in a nearly five - minute long " exclusive " interview Monday morning on Fox News .
He had criticized Clinton for telling Petraeus that hearing his testimony requires a " suspension of disbelief , " and on Monday he continued to push the Hillary - Move On link .
" I thought the comments she made against Gen .
Petraeus were taking politics beyond even the sort of horrible nature of politics today , " Giuliani said .
" MoveOn.org specializes in character assassination . "
MoveOn has stood by its advertisement , and in its rebuttal refers to Giuliani 's decision to abscond from the Iraq Study Group as a " betrayal of trust . "
" Republican voters should ask Giuliani , ' Where were you when it counted ? ' " asks the narrator of the ad , which MoveOn is raising money to air in Iowa .
MoveOn posted its ad on YouTube Monday :

Living Blogging from Mick Gravel for President press conference
Starts off talking about the election .
Displays a copy of the Constitution , noting that Article I is about the Congress , while the executive are Article II .
It 's guaranteed to end the war by Labor Day and have all of our troops home by Christmas .
Let me explain why I can say it 's guaranteed .
In my career , I waged a number of filibusters .
I waged a filibuster for 5 months to end the draft .
No one likes to anger their peers .
This tough law says that if the P , the VP , Sec of Def , , they commit a felony , penalty if 5 years in jail without the possibility of parole .
Forget the resolutions .
We can get it passed in the House .
They 'll filibuster in the Senate .
Let'em .
Pelosi and Reid acquire their positions by accomodating their bodies .
I 'm asking them to stop accomodating and get tough with their bodies .
Cloture votes , at noon every single day , takes a half hour , gives the American people time to learn , absorb and react .
My guesstimate is that it would be less than 20 days in the Senate .
Bill goes to Senate .
President vetoes .
I 'm recommending Pelosi and Reid bring it up at noon every single day until they get the votes to overrride George Bush 's veto .
Seven days a week , no vacations .
Let 's stop -- you 're in session 7 days a week .
These votes are only a half hour a day .
They 'll have a lot of time on Saturdays and Sundays .
For once they 'll be earning their pay .
Has to be so tough because human beings are losing their lives because we 're not doing the right thing .
The only way to end it is with tough legislation and tough tactics .
S&P 500 : Total and Inflation - Adjusted Historical Returns
Historical prices for the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock - market index can be obtained from websites like Yahoo Finance , using the ^GSPC ticker , or Google Finance , with .INX .
Yahoo can even graph the series since 1950 .
Those numbers , and their corresponding graphs , are useful for evaluating the past performance of stock investments , because the S&P500 index is well regarded as a proxy for the large - cap stock market .
Nevertheless , to study the real profitability of the market , we need to average and graph not only the price , but the effect of dividend distributions and inflation as well .
That is the purpose of this work .
Total Return
According to Standard & Poor 's , the dividend component was responsible for 44 % of the total return of the last 80 years of the index .
If we are to analyze the historical profitability of stock investments , this portion cannot be neglected .
Therefore , it is of interest to graph and average the total return ( meaning the increase in value if all dividends were reinvested ) instead of the evolution of price .
The following graph shows the S&P 500 historical return since 1950 :
The effect of investing $ 1 in 1950 is seen .
The orange curve shows the result of having all dividends reinvested ( i.e. , the total return ) , while the blue curve disregards dividends , therefore reflecting only the evolution of price .
As can be seen , reinvesting all dividends produced about 8 times the return .
Note that the y - axis is logarithmically scaled , for better appreciation of the earlier trends .
Inflation and Dividend - Distribution Trends
Phrases like " one dollar invested in 1926 would be $ 3000 today " are often heard regardless of the fact that a 1926 dollar has little relation with a 2009 dollar .
To evaluate properly how much can be earned through stock investments in a long period of time , the effect of inflation has to be extracted from the picture , by adjusting the intermediate results according to an index such as the Consumer Price Index published by the U.S. Department of Labor .
The following graph shows inflation per year , together with annual dividend distribution rates .
Some interesting trends can be seen in both :
As we observe in the graph , in recent years the stock market delivers more of its profits through capital gains .
You can also see the high inflation rates that occured in the 1970s .
Inflation - Adjusted Data
Incorporating inflation data to historical total returns and relative prices produces the following inflation - adjusted graph :
As can be seen , the stock market was very profitable , in real terms , in the 1950 to 1965 and 1983 to 2000 periods .
On the other hand , it did n't perform well from 1965 to 1983 , and neither it did for the last decade .
Still , during these periods , it partially worked as a shelter from inflation .
Annual Averages per Decade
The following table shows average annual results for each decade :
Price
Change Dividend
Dist .
Rate Total
Return Inflation Real
Price Change Real
Total Return 1950's 13.2 % 5.4 % 19.3 % 2.2 % 10.7 % 16.7 % 1960's 4.4 % 3.3 % 7.8 % 2.5 % 1.8 % 5.2 % 1970's 1.6 % 4.3 % 5.8 % 7.4 % - 5.4 % - 1.4 % 1980's 12.6 % 4.6 % 17.3 % 5.1 % 7.1 % 11.6 % 1990's 15.3 % 2.7 % 18.1 % 2.9 % 12.0 % 14.7 % 2000's - 2.7 % 1.8 % - 1.0 % 2.5 % - 5.1 % - 3.4 % 1950-2009 7.2 % 3.6 % 11.0 % 3.8 % 3.3 % 7.0 %
Notes : Figures for dividend distribution rates in the previous table present high uncertainty , of about ± 5 % .
Geometric averages were calculated for price changes , total returns and inflation .
Raw data for this work was obtained from the following sources :
It is clear that there are many people in this country , including myself , who demand accountability from this Administration for the terrible mess it made in Iraq and its egregious and even illegal power grabs throughout its six - plus years in power .
I believe that the President and Vice President may well have committed impeachable offenses .
But with so many important issues facing this country and so much work to be done , I am concerned about the great deal of time multiple impeachment trials would take away from the Congress working on the problems of the country .
The time it would take for the House to consider articles of impeachment , and for the Senate to conduct multiple trials , would make it very difficult , if not impossible , for Congress to do what it was elected to do – end the war and address some of the other terrible mistakes this Administration has made over the past six and a half years .
While some have pointed to Republicans ’ decision to impeach President Clinton , I am also concerned about the over -use of impeachment .
And I am conscious of the fact that I would have a specific role to play as a sworn , impartial juror should an impeachment be tried in the Senate .
If charges come to the Senate , I will approach them and the trial with the same seriousness that I had when I participated in the Clinton impeachment trial .
I would not prejudge the case one way or the other should it come to this .
I fully respect the anger and frustration many Americans feel with this Administration .
I share much of it .
But on balance , I think Congress ’s time is much better spent ending the war in Iraq , conducting the oversight that was absent for the last six years , and advancing progressive legislation .
UPDATE : I know that many of you disagree with my approach to this issue , but I thought it was important to make it clear where I ’m coming from and explain why I am not calling for impeachment .
I certainly do believe in holding this Administration accountable and upholding the Constitution and the rule of law .
That ’s why last year I called for the President to be censured for his authorization of the illegal wiretapping program .
I thought that was the appropriate course because it would have put the Senate on record in condemning the President ’s wrongdoing .
I still think that the censure resolution played an important role in focusing the public and the media ’s attention on the issue .
And I am working to make sure that Congress finally exercises its oversight responsibility by holding hearings and demanding information about the wiretapping program , the U.S. attorney firings and other abuses of power .
Many of you also wrote that if I recognize that the President and Vice President may have committed impeachable offenses , than it is our responsibility to impeach .
As I pointed out , it is the role of the House to impeach , and it is the role of the Senate to try impeachments .
But the Constitution left it up to the judgment of members of Congress whether or not moving forward with impeachment is best for the country .
Please keep the comments coming .
I ’ll do my best to read them all .
I very much appreciate your honesty and directness .
This exchange is very important to me .
The popping of the housing bubble is much like the six phases of the typical project .

Amid Wisconsin's deepening mortgage foreclosure crisis , Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee on Tuesday announced an inquiry into what went wrong .
" We need to find out who are the people being foreclosed , who are their servicers and original lenders , and what kinds of loans did they get , " said Catey Doyle , the organization 's chief staff attorney .
" There are a lot of questions about who bears responsibility for this situation , ( and ) the only way to find out who the players are is to manually go through court files . "
Volunteers working under the group 's supervision recently launched a review of all Milwaukee County Circuit Court cases filed since June 2006 , Doyle said .
She said the group will report its findings this fall by lender , zip code , loan type and other factors .
" Loans made in the last year got progressively more and more outrageous , " Doyle said .
" It was like a feeding frenzy .
Now we 're seeing 20 foreclosures a day on average in Milwaukee County , and sometimes 30 .
It 's really depressing . "
All year , her office has been awash in complaints of deceptive lending practices - " dozens of them , " Doyle said .
SUSIE GHARIB : More analysis now on that sub - prime credit watch by Standard & Poor's .
Joining us , David Wyss , chief economist of S&P .
Hi , David .
DAVID WYSS , CHIEF ECONOMIST , STANDARD & POOR'S : Good evening .
GHARIB : Let 's begin by getting your reasons of why S&P put these mortgage - backed securities on negative credit watch .
WYSS : Well , the basic reasoning is they 're simply not performing as well as we expected .
The housing market is not turning around in a hurry .
We did n't really expect it to .
Home prices still have a ways to drop .
And we 're already seeing substantially higher default rates on these securities than we had anticipated at this point .
So it was time to move them .
GHARIB : But why now ?
All of these factors that you 've mentioned have been going on in the housing sector has been struggling for some time , why now ?
WYSS : Well , largely because we need to get enough record on these securities to see how they 're performing .
We knew the housing sector was underperforming .
We knew that when we rated these securities .
But what surprised us is that even given the poor performance for the housing sector , the default rates are running higher than we would have expected given the FICO scores here , given the loan - to - value ratios in these mortgages .
GHARIB : Now I understand that there are 612 mortgage securities on your credit watch list .
And you 're reviewing them and some of them will be downgraded .
How many of them will be downgraded do you think ?
WYSS : Well , if we knew that we would n't have to put them on credit watch .
But I would say , you know , the great majority .
My personal guess would be at least 90 percent .
Let 's keep this in perspective .
We 're looking at $ 12 billion .
That sounds like a lot of money -- it is a lot of money to most of us .
It 's only 2 percent of the sub - prime securities we rated during that period .
And it 's 0.01 percent of the U.S. mortgage market .
GHARIB : All right .
So if it 's 2 percent , then how serious is this announcement that you made today ?
How worried should investors be ?
WYSS : I do n't think you should be worried generally , but obviously what we do worry about , is there a concentration of this risk that has built up in some of the hedge funds , for example , that could cause problems .
Right now we seem to be in an overlapping state centered around panic ( this phase can last a long time ) with lingeringand the beginnings of thenow underway .
As anecdotal evidence as to where we are in the cycle I point to Foreclosure crisis sparks investigation
As part of the Search for the Guilty phase , there is an ongoing denial and coverup by some of those who are guilty but are trying very hard to stop any fingers from pointing in their direction .
This One on One with David Wyss , Chief Economist of S&P shows what I mean .
David
Wyss is trying like mad ( as are numerous others in the state of denial ) to contain the damage by containing the negative sentiment .
It 's galling to see shills saying with straight face the problem is only with 2 % of subprime when a full 65 % of the bonds in indexes that track subprime mortgage debt do n't meet the S&P ratings criteria that were in place when they were sold .
The 2.1 % downgrade of debt by the S&P is a joke .
I talked about this at length in Stress Test .
The ploy by David Wyss at the S&P is doomed to fail .
Sorry David , no matter how hard you try , you can't put air back into a popped bubble .

Were he to update the book to reflect the experience of today ’s children , he ’d need to call it “ All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Preschool , ” as kindergarten has changed .
The half day devoted to fair play and nice manners officially began its demise in 1983 , when the National Commission on Excellence in Education published “ A Nation at Risk , ” warning that the country faced a “ rising tide of mediocrity ” unless we increased school achievement and expectations .
No Child Left Behind , in 2002 , exacerbated the trend , pushing phonics and pattern - recognition worksheets even further down the learning chain .
As a result , many parents , legislatures and teachers find the current curriculum too challenging for many older 4 - and young 5 - year - olds , which makes sense , because it ’s largely the same curriculum taught to first graders less than a generation ago .
Andersen ’s kindergartners are supposed to be able to not just read but also write two sentences by the time they graduate from her classroom .
It ’s no wonder that nationwide , teachers now report that 48 percent of incoming kindergartners have difficulty handling the demands of school .
Friedrich Froebel , the romantic motherless son who started the first kindergarten in Germany in 1840 , would be horrified by what ’s called kindergarten today .
He conceived the early learning experience as a homage to Jean - Jacques Rousseau , who believed that “ reading is the plague of childhood .
. . .
Books are good only for learning to babble about what one does not know . ”
Letters and numbers were officially banned from Froebel ’s kindergartens ; the teaching materials consisted of handmade blocks and games that he referred to as “ gifts . ”
By the late 1800s , kindergarten had jumped to the United States , with Boston transcendentalists like Elizabeth Peabody popularizing the concept .
Fairly quickly , letters and numbers appeared on the wooden blocks , yet Peabody cautioned that a “ genuine ” kindergarten is “ a company of children under 7 years old , who do not learn to read , write and cipher ” and a “ false ” kindergarten is one that accommodates parents who want their children studying academics instead of just playing .
That the social skills and exploration of one ’s immediate world have been squeezed out of kindergarten is less the result of a pedagogical shift than of the accountability movement and the literal - minded reverse - engineering process it has brought to the schools .
Curriculum planners no longer ask ,
What does a 5 - year - old need ?
Instead they ask ,
If a student is to pass reading and math tests in third grade , what does that student need to be doing in the prior grades ?
Whether kindergarten students actually need to be older is a question of readiness , a concept that itself raises the question : Ready for what ?
The skill set required to succeed in Fulgham ’s kindergarten — openness , creativity — is well matched to the capabilities of most 5 - year - olds but also substantially different from what Andersen ’s students need .
In early 2000 , the National Center for Education Statistics assessed 22,000 kindergartners individually and found , in general , that yes , the older children are better prepared to start an academic kindergarten than the younger ones .
The older kids are four times as likely to be reading , and two to three times as likely to be able to decipher two - digit numerals .
Twice as many older kids have the advanced fine motor skills necessary for writing .
The older kids also have important noncognitive advantages , like being more persistent and more socially adept .
Nonetheless , child advocacy groups say it ’s the schools ’ responsibility to be ready for the children , no matter their age , not the children ’s to be prepared for the advanced curriculum .
In a report on kindergarten , the National Association of Early Childhood Specialists in State Departments of Education wrote , “ Most of the questionable entry and placement practices that have emerged in recent years have their genesis in concerns over children ’s capacities to cope with the increasingly inappropriate curriculum in kindergarten . ”
Furthermore , as Elizabeth Graue , a former kindergarten teacher who now studies school - readiness and redshirting at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , points out , “ Readiness is a relative issue . ”
Studies of early - childhood teachers show they always complain about the youngest students , no matter their absolute age .
‘ In Illinois it will be the March - April - May kids ; in California , it will be October - November - December , ” Graue says .
“ It ’s really natural as a teacher to gravitate toward the kids who are easy to teach , especially when there ’s academic pressure and the younger kids are rolling around the floor and sticking pencils in their ears . ”
But perhaps those kids with the pencils in their ears — at least the less - affluent ones — do n’t need “ the gift of time ” but rather to be brought into the schools .
Forty - two years after Lyndon Johnson inaugurated Head Start , access to quality early education still highly correlates with class ; and one serious side effect of pushing back the cutoffs is that while well - off kids with delayed enrollment will spend another year in preschool , probably doing what kindergartners did a generation ago , less - well - off children may , as the literacy specialist Katie Eller put it , spend “ another year watching TV in the basement with Grandma . ”
What ’s more , given the socioeconomics of redshirting — and the luxury involved in delaying for a year the free day care that is public school — the oldest child in any given class is more likely to be well off and the youngest child is more likely to be poor .
“ You almost have a double advantage coming to the well - off kids , ” says Samuel J. Meisels , president of Erikson Institute , a graduate school in child development in Chicago .
“ From a public - policy point of view I find this very distressing . ”
Nobody has exact numbers on what percentage of the children eligible for publicly financed preschool are actually enrolled — the individual programs are legion , and the eligibility requirements are complicated and varied — but the best guess from the National Institute for Early Education Research puts the proportion at only 25 percent .
In California , for instance , 76 percent of publicly financed preschool programs have waiting lists , which include over 30,000 children .
In Pennsylvania , 35 percent of children eligible for Head Start are not served .
A few states do have universal preschool , and among Hillary Clinton ’s first broad domestic policy proposals as a Democratic presidential candidate was to call for universal pre-kindergarten classes .
But at the moment , free high - quality preschool for less - well - to - do children is spotty , and what exists often is aimed at extremely low - income parents , leaving out the children of the merely strapped working or lower - middle class .
Nor , as a rule , do publicly financed programs take kids who are old enough to be eligible for kindergarten , meaning redshirting is not a realistic option for many .
One morning , when I was sitting in Elizabeth Levett Fortier ’s kindergarten classroom in the Peabody School in San Francisco — among a group of students that included some children who had never been to preschool , some who were just learning English and some who were already reading — a father dropped by to discuss whether or not to enroll his fall - birthday daughter or give her one more year at her private preschool .
Demographically speaking , any child with a father willing to call on a teacher to discuss if it ’s best for that child to spend a third year at a $ 10,000 - a- year preschool is going to be fine .
Andersen told me , “ I ’ve had parents tell me that the preschool did not recommend sending their children on to kindergarten yet , but they had no choice , ” as they could n’t afford not to .
In 49 out of 50 states , the average annual cost of day care for a 4 - year - old in an urban area is more than the average annual public college tuition .
A RAND Corporation position paper suggests policy makers may need to view “ entrance - age policies and child - care polices as a package . ”
Random thoughts on all sorts of things .
Senator accuses Bush of being ' brain dead ' Will Menaker
Published : Thursday July 5 , 2007 Print This Email This
At a campaign stop in Des Moines , Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had some tough words for the President , along with two GOP presidential candidates .
" This guy is brain dead , " Biden said of Bush , eliciting a chorus of laughter from his audience .
Known for his slips of the tongue , Biden added , " I know Ill be quoted , Ill be killed for that .
Speaking of Bush 's decision to commute the sentence of Scooter Libby , Biden stated ,  This is a guy who is on the balls of his heels , heres a guy who is lower off in the polls than any president in modern history and he goes ahead and he does something that just flies in the face of the sensibilities of the American people .
A White House spokesperson did not immediately return RAW STORY 's calls seeking comments Thursday .
The outspoken senator did not stop with the President , singling out Rudy Giuiliani , " I can hardly wait to debate Rudy Giuliani if he is their nominee ,  he said .
 Because I will eat his lunch . "
Not wanting to leave the other GOP front - runner unscathed , Biden said of Mitt Romney , " I found Romney s statements yesterday profound  crazy  when he talked about going to war with Iran , why are we talking about going to war with Iran ? 
Scientists are researching new ways of harnessing the sun ’s rays which could eventually make it cheaper for people to use solar energy to power their homes .
The experts at Durham University are developing light - absorbing materials for use in the production of thin - layer solar photovoltaic ( PV ) cells which are used to convert light energy into electricity .
The four - year project involves experiments on a range of different materials that would be less expensive and more sustainable to use in the manufacturing of solar panels .
Thicker silicon - based cells and compounds containing indium , a rare and expensive metal , are more commonly used to make solar panels today .
The research , funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) SUPERGEN Initiative , focuses on developing thin - layer PV cells using materials such as copper indium diselenide and cadmium telluride .
Right now the project is entering a new phase for the development of cheaper and more sustainable variants of these materials .
The Durham team is also working on manipulating the growth of the materials so they form a continuous structure which is essential for conducting the energy trapped by solar panels before it is turned into usable electricity .
This will help improve the efficiency of the thin - layer PV cells .
It ’s hoped that the development of more affordable thin - film PV cells could lead to a reduction in the cost of solar panels for the domestic market and an increase in the use of solar power .
Solar power currently provides less than one hundredth of one percent of the UK ’s home energy needs .
The thin - layer PV cells would be used to make solar panels that could be fitted to roofs to help power homes with any surplus electricity being fed back to The National Grid .
This could lead to cheaper fuel bills and less reliance on burning fossil fuels as a way of helping to generate electricity .
Professor Ken Durose , Director of the Durham Centre for Renewable Energy , who is leading the research , said : “ One of the main issues in solar energy is the cost of materials and we recognise that the cost of solar cells is slowing down their uptake .
“ If solar panels were cheap enough so you could buy a system off the shelf that provided even a fraction of your power needs you would do it , but that product is n’t there at the moment .
“ The key indicator of cost effectiveness is how many pounds do you have to spend to get a watt of power out "
“ If you can make solar panels more cheaply then you will have a winning product . ”
To aid its research the university has taken delivery of a £ 1.7 million suite of high powered electron microscopes , funded by the Science Research Investment Fund , which have nano - scale resolution allowing scientists to see the effects that currently limit the performance of solar cells .
One of the microscopes is the first of its kind in the UK and Professor Durose said : “ This instrument will put the North East right out in front .
“ We are working on new ideas in renewable energy and this opens up tremendous opportunities in research . ”
Durham , Newcastle and Northumbria universities , The New and Renewable Energy Centre ( NaREC ) , in Blyth , and the Centre for Process Innovation ( CPI ) , in Wilton , have formed a consortium to bid to host the Energy Technologies Institute ( ETI ) in the North East .
The Consortium bidding to host the Energy technologies Institute ( ETI ) in NorthEast England , has been named as one of three short - listed finalists to host the headquarters of this national centre , which will be responsible for the allocation of approximately £ 1bn of private and public research funds into renewable and low carbon energy .
The North East Consortium will now face competition from Scotland and the Midlands , at a final selection presentation in London on September 6th .
Made up of representatives from industry sponsors and Government , the selection panel will then make their recommendation to the ETI board , with the host location to be formally announced in early October .
Mark Pearson Energy and Process Innovation Manager at One NorthEast , a member of the ETI bid team commented : “ This announcement by Durham University highlights the strength in depth we have in energy research and development in the North East , and the opportunities and change this can generate in our regional economy and built environment .
“ Our bid to host the ETI recognises our capability across the region to make this initiative a success for the UK . ”

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday April 12 2007
In the article below , Totnes is in Devon , not Cornwall .
This has been corrected .
There is , as the ads say , no Plan B .
The age of cheap oil is drawing to a close , climate change already threatens , and politicians dither .
But the people of Lampeter , a small community in the middle of rural Wales , gathered together earlier this week to mobilise for a new war effort .
They decided to plan their " energy descent " .
It was in fact the biggest public meeting in Lampeter anyone could remember .
West Wales has a long tradition of alternative living , but the scale of this was different .
More than 450 people filed into the hall in a place where the total population is just 4,000 .
They had come to turn themselves into a Transition Town - one of a rapidly growing network of places that have decided not to wait for government action , but to prepare for life after oil on their own .
First , the coordinator of the Transition Town movement , Rob Hopkins , told them how urgent the crisis is .
Hopkins , who helped create the earliest Transition Towns in Kinsale , Ireland , and Totnes , Devon , and advises the 20 or so others that have signed up , describes himself as an early topper .
He 's one of those who think that in the next five years we will have reached peak oil - the point at which half the world 's oil reserves have been used up .
After that production goes into irreversible and rapid decline and our main source of energy starts running out .
Since we have not so far identified another viable energy source to replace it , the only rational response , he said , is to plan our energy descent .
" Life after oil will have to look very different . "
The world , he explained , divides into early toppers and late toppers .
The early toppers , made up largely of former industry geological experts , calculate that world oil production has already or will very soon peak .
The end of oil is nigh , in other words .
The late toppers , made up mostly of more optimistic oil companies , governments and economists , predict we have longer , with peak oil some 20 to 30 years away .
" I tend to believe the people with no vested interest , but either way this is one of the most dramatic shifts humanity has had to face , " Hopkins warned .
By now the people of Lampeter , from ageing hippies to young activists , were shifting in their plastic seats ( made with oil ) and drawing anxiously on their water bottles ( made with oil ) if not reaching for their medicines ( made with oil ) .
Hopkins told them they were likely to experience a range of common symptoms that accompany initial peak oil awareness .
One might be an irrational grasping at infeasible solutions .
At hydrogen , for example .
No good , running the UK's cars on hydrogen would need 67 Sizewell B nuclear power stations or a wind farm bigger than the south - west region of England .
Or what about biofuels ?
No again , it would take over 25 m hectares of arable land to run the UK's vehicles on biodiesel , and the UK only has 5.7 m hectares of arable land .
We need to eat too .
Unfortunately , British farming has evolved " into a system for turning oil into food " , reliant on the energy - intensive manufacture of synthetic fertiliser , heavy use of oil - based plastics , and centralised just - in - time distribution systems that also guzzle oil .
After Hopkins , Guardian columnist George Monbiot , who lives near Lampeter , tried to cheer them up .
Unlike Hopkins , he said he had been persuaded that the end of oil was not nigh , but only nigh - ish .
We may have another 10 to 30 years .
And there was lots of coal for energy .
The problem was that if we switched back to sin fuels that increase our emissions , climate change will undo us even faster than peak oil .
The drive for change in Lampeter has come in part from a group of local farmers - both Patrick Holden , the Soil Association 's director , and Peter Segger , the businessman who was the first to supply the mass market with organic foods through the supermarkets , have their land nearby .
Both have decided that the future lies in selling more of their produce locally instead of having it trucked round the country .
Segger and his partner Anne Evans have already switched from supplying the major retailers to selling half their vegetables within Wales ..
Holden confessed to a touch of both survivalism and optimism .
As an organic farmer who does not use artificial fertiliser , he said he had been feeling smug until he heard Hopkins speak a couple of months ago .
But he realised his produce was also part of the problem once it left his farm , feeding into the system of centralised distribution .
Now he is trying to make his farm self sufficient in energy : he has already invested in burying half a mile of pipes under a field to extract heat from the soil that keeps his house warm .
Four hours into planning their energy descent and over bowls of local cawl broth the crowd in Lampeter were considering what they would like to happen - a ban on advertising that encourages consumption ; turning the local supermarket into a giant allotment - and what they could they could actually do - install a community wind turbine ; encourage low - energy buildings using sheep 's wool for insulation ; swap skills .
Someone suggested that a local landowner give the town an acre for a community vegetable garden .
There was an awkward silence until someone else remembered a playing field that would serve the purpose , if the council agreed .
There was plenty of inspiration from pioneer towns .
Transition Totnes has introduced its own currency with notes that can only be spent in local shops .
Its businesses are being audited by an accountant who provides a wake - up call by identifying parts of their operations that become unprofitable as oil prices rise .
The town is planting nut trees which can provide emergency food and timber for construction while also acting as carbon sinks .
Lampeter decided emphatically on a show of 450 hands that it would meet again to plan its next stage .
And then its people spilled out on a clear spring night into the car park and , just this one last time , drove home .
How we use oil
· 130kg packaging made from oil - derived plastics is consumed by British households each year .
Two - thirds of it is used in food production
· 57 miles is the average distance a tonne of freight now travels by road .
In 1953 it was 21 miles
· 95 % of our food products require the use of oil , and the supply of food accounts for 21 % of Britain 's energy use
· 3.5 litres of oil is needed to produce half a kilogram of steak
Did you hear about the former head of China ’s food and drug administration ?
He took bribes to approve bogus pharmaceuticals , some of which killed people .
China just sentenced Zheng to death .
Now THAT is a country that ’s serious about quality control .
http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/29/health/main2860989.shtml
It looks like the main reason he got the death penalty is that he was bad for business .
China does n’t want to be seen as a country with poor quality control .
They figured that being seen as a country that kills thieving political assholes would be seen as more of a positive thing .
They were right !
My immediate reaction to the story was “ Why ca n’t we be more like China ? ”
Generally , I ’m not a huge fan of the death penalty , for purely practical reasons :
1. Death sentences costs tax payers more than life sentences because of the lengthy automatic appeals .
2. Sometimes we convict the wrong guy , as DNA testing has shown .
3 . I ’d be amazed if the death penalty deterred anyone who was in the frame of mind of committing a heinous crime .
But I ’d be willing to make an exception for politicians that take bribes .
That sort of behavior threatens the integrity of the entire system .
The value is in the signal it sends to the citizens about what the government will tolerate .
There ’s nothing ambiguous about the death penalty .
If I were a Chinese citizen , I ’d feel a lot better about the quality of my food and drugs going forward .
I still think democracy is the best form of government .
But the Chinese are closing that gap fast .
There ’s an interesting battle brewing that may decide the fate of Facebook , the hugely popular social networking site .
The country network of which I ’m a member , South Africa , has tripled in size to 300 000 in just three months .
I did n’t know there were that many internet connections over here .
However , there ’s a dark cloud on the horizon .
A very dark cloud .
Microsoft is , according to the Wall Street Journal , in talks to buy a stake in the startup :
Microsoft in recent weeks approached Facebook with proposals to invest in the startup that could value the fast - growing site at $ 10 billion or higher , said people familiar with the matter .
If those talks bear fruit , Microsoft could purchase a stake of up to 5 % in the closely held startup , at a cost in the range of $ 300 million to $ 500 million , the people said .
But Microsoft must first outgun Google , which has also expressed strong interest in a Facebook stake , according to people familiar with the matter .
Microsoft ’s Passport signon technology ( now rebranded as Live ID ) has proved to be wide open to abuse , and not only by external miscreants .
When Microsoft bought Hotmail almost ten years ago , the webmail pioneer turned into a sluggish performer and a hotbed of spam .
As this page documents , Microsoft itself had for years been both negligent and willfully complicit in some of the abuse .
On one occasion it changed , without notification , all users ’ preferences to share information with third parties , for example .
On another , it tried to claim copyright on everything sent via Hotmail .
It certainly has not been particularly respectful of users ’ privacy , and has burned its trust relationship with its more savvy customers .
I ’m sure Microsoft has tightened up its privacy policies by now .
It ’s appointed a Chief Privacy Officer and its PR machine makes all the right defensive noises .
However , a 3 500 word policy can hide many secrets .
My reading of its copyright notice suggests that it still claims an exceptionally broad licence to copy , use and sublicence anything you post on any Microsoft service , even if it is intended only for a private community .
So I vowed never to use any Microsoft - owned online service — MSN Messenger , Windows Live , Hotmail — ever again .
Publications that required Passport Network registration were simply dropped from my reading list .
Facebook is already over - cluttered with applications .
Some are useful , some cool , some annoying , and some just downright offensive .
I do n’t mean in the prurient sense ; I mean in the spam hotbed sense .
I usually decline to install them , but I accepted a fun one involving beer just yesterday .
Contrary to explicit instructions not to , it invited a random selection of friends , some of which I really did n’t want invited .
This kind of spamware can kill Facebook .
But not as quickly as Microsoft can .
If Google buys Facebook , I ’ll live with it .
The Googleplex 0wnz me already , and I ’m not even a heavy user of its services .
However , it has yet to show the kind of negligence or nefarious activity that will compromise my trust .
For now , the convenience of its online tools outweigh the very real privacy risks .
But if Microsoft buys Facebook , I ’m outta there like a shot .
The Hotmail fiasco alone was enough for me to never trust Microsoft with private information of any sort again .
Through negligence , incompetence and deliberate action , Microsoft has abused the trust of users too often in the past .
Here ’s hoping Facebook does n’t become the latest victim .
Update :
In good Facebook tradition , I ’ve created a group : If Facebook sells to Microsoft , we ’re leaving .
I used to ride a motorcycle .
It was a Suzuki GS 1150 .
That ’s 1,150 cc engine with 123 horsepower .
Since it only had to accelerate 500 pounds , it could go from 0 to 70 in less than 3 seconds and only one gear change , which I knew from personal experience .
It was the kind of bike that taunted you , that dared you to ride fast .
There was a gas station near one of my favorite riding places that sold high octane racing fuel .
I loved to fill up and go for a long twisty ride .
The racing fuel had a different smell , it smelled like adventure .
Riding a motorcycle is such a manual process .
Between clutching , shifting , accelerating and braking , you have to use both hands and both feet .
You lean into turns .
Riding involves your entire body .
My motorcycle riding days ended when someone made a right turn in front of me .
I was enjoying a straight road to the maximum , went around a bend and right in front of me was a car , pulling into a driveway .
I would have swerved into the left lane , but there was an on coming pickup truck .
My only choice was to hit the brakes .
I remember seeing the horizon fly past my feet , then I landed in the gravel on the other side of the car .
I walked away with a sore wrist and a scratch on my right ankle .
The motorcycle never ran again .
I have n’t ridden a motorcycle since , but when I ’m driving and need to pass someone , my left hand wants squeeze the clutch , and with rising gas prices , I am tempted , but not enough .
But the thing I miss the most about riding a motorcycle is the sense of “ club ” among riders .
When another rider passed you on the road , they always gave a wave .
Not a big wave , just enough to acknowledge a fellow club member .
These days I do still ride two wheels , but they are pedal powered .
Last month I managed over 120 miles .
Most of those miles were 2 and 4 mile trips to the grocery , to the hardware store and anywhere else I needed to be .
I only drive my car if I need to drive into the city , a 25 mile trip , one way .
This spring and summer I ’ve noticed more bicycles on the road and yesterday , the coolest thing happened .
A fellow bicyclist going the other way , waved .
Not a big wave , just enough to acknowledge a fellow club member , to say “ I see you ” , using your own power to get where you want to go .
I waved back .
Taken two days ago during an IDF drill in the Golan Heights .
The man on the right ?
Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz .
The worst part :
The photographer said Peretz raised the capped binoculars three times , nodding as [ Lt. Gen. Gabi ]
Ashkenazi explained what he was “ seeing . ”
Exit question : Given what ’s happening across the border right now , is it time for Peretz to join Rumsfeld in oblivion ?
Update :
This explains a lot .
Update : Reader James B. e-mails to say he does n’t think Bush ’s binoculars have the lens caps on .
Rather , what we ’re seeing are anti-reflectors .
In the middle of a 2004 interview with an Irish TV journalist ( ( http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2007/07/bush-in-ireland.html); transcript ) , President Bush , denying that he is swayed by popular opinion , said , “ My job is to do my job . ”
This reminded me of a line I sometimes heard from U.S. officials in Iraq , usually in public affairs , when an unpleasant subject like sectarian violence or the electricity shortage came up : “ It is what it is . ”
Such tautological assertions have become a useful currency of discourse in the Bush Administration .
They refuse to engage or make an argument ; instead , they are designed to foreclose any possibility of debate .
They imply that talk of causation or complication is for wimps .
They convey a spirit of tough - minded realism while managing to say nothing at all .
They are at the same time no -nonsense and nonsensical .
Like the gangster language of Nixon and his men on the Watergate tapes ( “ the big enchilada ” ) , or the long - winded exegeses of Clinton and his flacks ( “ It depends on what the meaning of the word ‘ is ‘ is ” ) , they express the mental atmosphere that seeps out of the Oval Office , pervades Washington , and eventually characterizes an entire government .
When I think back on the Bush years , I will remember “ It is what it is ” as a linguistic marker of intellectual emptiness , and my chief demand of the next Administration will be : Substantive predicates !
Not unrelated :
There ’s a detail buried in Bob Woodward ’s fascinating piece in today ’s Washington Post on the Iraq Study Group .
On November 13 , 2006 , the same day that the group met with Bush and heard an hour - long speech on winning in Iraq , it also sat down with General Michael Hayden , the director of the C.I.A. , who provided the most convincing assessment of the war that I have seen from any Administration official .
Woodward reports :
Hayden catalogued what he saw as the main sources of violence in this order : the insurgency , sectarian strife , criminality , general anarchy and , lastly , al - Qaeda .
Though Hayden had listed al - Qaeda as the fifth most pressing threat in Iraq , Bush regularly lists al - Qaeda first .
As it happens , today ’s Post also carried a story from the Pentagon that quotes the U.S. military ’s chief spokesman , Brigadier General Kevin Bergner , describing Al Qaeda as “ the principal threat ” to Iraqis .
It ’s possible that the C.I.A. sees it one way and the Pentagon another .
It ’s possible that , over the past eight months , the C.I.A. has changed its views .
It ’s more likely that General Bergner , who used to work for the White House , is repeating the Administration line .
After four years in Iraq , apparently , America ’s wartime leadership still believes that candor is the enemy of success — that message discipline and the will to win can defeat the facts .
Levels of flavonoids increase over time in crops grown in organically farmed fields , according to a rare long - term study scheduled for publication in the July 18 issue of ACS ’ Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry , a bi-weekly publication .
Other research has suggested that consumption of flavonoids may protect against cancer , heart disease , and other age - related diseases .
In the new study , Alyson E. Mitchell and colleagues compared levels of key flavonoids in tomatoes harvested over a 10 - year period from two matched fields — one farmed organically and the other with conventional methods that included commercial fertilizers .
The research focused on tomatoes because per capita consumption in the United States is so high , second only to potatoes .
Researchers analyzed organic and conventional tomatoes that had been dried and archived under identical conditions from 1994 to 2004 .
“ The levels of flavonoids increased over time in samples from organic treatments , whereas the levels of flavonoids did not vary significantly in conventional treatments , ” their report stated .
Increases corresponded with the accumulation of soil organic matter in organic plots and with reduced fertilization rates .
“ Well - quantified changes in tomato nutrients over years in organic farming systems have not been reported previously . ”

A new breakthrough in hydrogen storage technology could remove a key barrier to widespread uptake of non-polluting cars that produce no carbon dioxide emissions .
UK scientists have developed a compound of the element lithium which may make it practical to store enough hydrogen on - board fuel - cell - powered cars to enable them to drive over 300 miles before refuelling .
Achieving this driving range is considered essential if a mass market for fuel cell cars is to develop in future years , but has not been possible using current hydrogen storage technologies .
The breakthrough has been achieved by a team from the Universities of Birmingham and Oxford and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire , under the auspices of the UK Sustainable Hydrogen Energy Consortium ( UK - SHEC ) .
UK - SHEC is funded by the SUPERGEN ( Sustainable Power Generation and Supply ) initiative managed and led by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) .
Fuel cells produce carbon - free electricity by harnessing electrochemical reactions between hydrogen and oxygen .
However , today ’s prototype and demonstration fuel - cell - powered cars only have a range of around 200 miles .
To achieve a 300 mile driving range , an on - board space the size of a double - decker bus would be needed to store hydrogen gas at standard temperature and pressure , while storing it as a compressed gas in cylinders or as a liquid in storage tanks would not be practical due to the weight and size implications .
The UK - SHEC research has therefore focused on a different approach which could enable hydrogen to be stored at a much higher density and within acceptable weight limits .
The option involves a well - established process called ‘ chemisorption ’ , in which atoms of a gas are absorbed into the crystal structure of a solid - state material and then released when needed .
The team has tested thousands of solid - state compounds in search of a light , cheap , readily available material which would enable the absorption / desorption process to take place rapidly and safely at typical fuel cell operating temperatures .
They have now produced a variety of lithium hydride ( specifically Li 4 BN 3 H 10 ) that could offer the right blend of properties .
Development work is now needed to further investigate the potential of this powder .
“ This could be a major step towards the breakthrough that the fuel cell industry and the transport sector have waited for , ” says UK - SHEC ’s Project Co-ordinator Professor Peter Edwards of the University of Oxford .
“ It ’s due to SUPERGEN ’s vision of combining many of the leading groups in the UK to tackle this , arguably the biggest challenge for the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles .
This work could make a key contribution to helping fuel cell cars become viable for mass - manufacture within around 10 years . ”

In Osama Bin Laden ’s latest screed , one of the things he exhorts people to do is give up interest .
The charging and paying of interest is forbidden in strict Islam .
Known as riba ( increase ) , it was the subject of some of Mohammed ’s most vehement condemnations .
One can see why with only a cursory look at history .
Namely , moneylending was largely an uncontrolled practice that guaranteed a class structure that could not be broken , incurred debts that led to involuntary servitude , and was an all around nasty way to keep the serfs in the fields .
Mohammed , rather than suggesting some form of regulation , vented spleen and condemned it outright .
Christians , of course , had their own attitude toward it , which led to out - groups being the only ones allowed to lend money ( Jews , famously , but not exclusively ) .
The prohibition was based mainly on two Biblical passages ( both Old Testament ) : Leviticus 25:36–37
( “ Take thou no usury … ” ) and Ezekiel 18:13 ( “ He that have give forth usury , and hath taken increase : shall he live ?
He shall not live … ” ) .
The Catholic Church used to excommunicate moneylenders .
The law said : Quidquid sorti accedit , usura est “ what exceeds the principal is usury . ”
( The Italian Renaissance , aside from great art and a few geniuses , also revolutionized banking .
The bankers noted that this applied only to loans , not contracts , so they erected a facade behind which they could do exactly what they wanted .
They made no loans .
They traded in Bills of Exchange .
Technically , it was a sale of one kind of money in exchange for another that could be paid at a future date .
As rates of exchange varied , interest was built in automatically without there seeming to be any charged . )
Islam is not so vague , though .
In this article the author explains the prohibition in no uncertain terms .
Lending anything with an expectation that it will be repaid plus a profit is prohibited .
Period .
There are of course downsides to this , as shown in this article .
What is permitted in Islam is charity — in fact , there is built in a poor tax , called a Zakat .
People of sufficient means pay a percentage of their wealth for the maintenance of the poor .
Which leads us directly to the major problem with such a prohibition ( and the assumptions entailed by claiming that the Zakat is just substitute ) : it is based almost entirely on a notion of static wealth , wealth which is not subject to any deterioration by simple , even low - level inflationary tendencies , of by the more complex medium of economic dynamism based on supply and demand and the introduction of variable factors — population growth , invention , drought and famine , excess harvests , disease , life expectancy — factors which guarantee that the value of coin , no matter how it is determined , changes , because the world in which it exists changes .
In short , there is no mechanism for the predictable increase in personal — or community — wealth .
Such increases are made by conquest or accident in such a system .
If it is assumed that one may not profit from one ’s property other than through the price charged for product , then the system is likely to remain static at best , deteriorating at worst .
Which is what has happened to all the great empires , including the vast and impressive Islamic Empire of the 8th , 9th , and 10th centuries .
All of them accrued wealth through conquest — Greece , Rome , Egypt , the Hittites , even little Israel , which basically kicked the original owners out of Canaan and absorbed what they found .
Islam spread like fire in the first couple centuries of its existence , absorbing numerous principalities , and their productive capacities and , most importantly , their latent wealth .
The Greeks and Romans had the best handle on how to keep it — through complex trade systems and , in the case of the Romans , premodern banking methods that allowed for variation of local value , periodic economic fluctuations caused by anything from bad harvests to a local invader .
Others did n’t really have a good handle on it .
Islam continued as an Imperial force by eventually absorbing Byzantium , but even they had to get into a little bit of the borrowing game when Christendom came bashing on their door as competitor .
In the transformation of systems that occurs during major wars , a kind of tax on devastation and rebuilding occurs that looks , sometimes , like growth , but really it ’s a reconsolidation into smaller and ever more concentrated realms .
It was those Italian bankers that eventually , through the methods they developed and which later turned into full - blown credit systems after the Reformation , that spelled hegemonic doom for any system that could n’t — or would n’t — keep up .
I do not wish to go into a long disquisition about the benefits of credit systems — or their myriad faults — but it is clear to anyone not hampered by culturally - enforced expectations that any system which does not allow for the possibility of one ’s neighbor collapsing is itself doomed .
Islam does not prohibit trade .
Trade is great , it is necessary , it is the thing that keeps the whole show running , but it is not itself a static entity .
If , say , after a century of trading commodities with your neighbor , one year a blight wipes out the crop of whatever you ’ve been happily trading for .
Your neighbor now has nothing to trade .
You now have no one to dump your exports on , because they ca n’t afford to pay you .
You either look for someone else to take it , or …
Or what ?
You now have an excess of what you had before .
You can dump it by discounting it to someone who does n’t need it as much , which threatens stability on the homefront because you ’re going to take a loss .
You can give it to your longtime trading partner as charity , but now you have a shortfall in what you ’ve been getting from them and have to make up the difference from someone else , with whom you do not have the same arrangement .
The whole edifice teeters .
Or you can set up credit arrangements and base payments to your domestic producers on what your neighbor will pay you once they ’re back on their feet , which of course means you still have the expense of subsidizing those domestic producers while you wait , which is an expense you wish to recoup , so the credit you ’ve extended comes with an expectation that they will pay a bit more to cover that expense ( over time so it ’s not a crushing payment ) and gives them time to recover .
That ’s called Interest , that fee , and in this scenario is helps maintain the overall stability of both systems .
But there ’s a far more personal element in the prohibition against interest that is not often discussed and is more to the point .
It took a long time for the present system to evolve , but eventually what it has come to offer is the chance for the individual to obtain a modicum of independence .
Our credit system allows for Joe Blow to borrow money in order to acquire the property and means to live as he or she wants , without being a serf .
You can start your own business without having to be perpetually beholden to the charity of a sponsor ( which is allowed in Islam — the lender basically becomes a partner with the borrower on a profit - sharing basis , which , depending on the nature of the arrangement , may make independence perpetually impossible — see the second article linked ) .
Without credit systems that include ( regulated ) interest schedules , there would be no middle class .
( The pre to post Renaissance merchants were not middle class , they were just shy of the aristocracy , and were decidedly in the minority — most people were poor , to varying degrees , with no method to ever be anything else . )
The middle class — threatened today because of any number of abuses to the system that permitted its existence — is a modern phenomenon which could not exist without the complex system of credit that came to fruition in the 19th century and found its place in the mid-20th century .
When you look at the Christian systems that condemned interest and at the Islamic social history that likewise forbade it , what you see is a propertied class intent on maintaining its unique power and position .
A regulated banking system that served the needs of the peasantry — however one defines that — was not in their interest , because it meant those they considered their servants might one day thumb their noses at their rightful liege lords .
So when Bin Ladin and his ilk condemn capitalism and interest - based credit , you have to wonder what kind of a world they would see in its place .
Certainly capitalism has problems and will no doubt be supplanted by another system , just as it supplanted mercantilism and its earlier systems all the way back to feudalism .
Certainly there is abuse — look at this sub - prime lending crisis — but a devolution back to Sharia ’a economics would essentially return a huge portion of the population to a condition of obligation to a charity system and return the princes — like Bin Ladin — to a status of “ gracious lord ” who could make points with Allah by dispensing Zakat and living like –well — a prince .

But , to begin with , I suppose I need to say I 'm looking for a man who wants the company of a cute young woman on a regular basis .
I 'm not currently in Toronto , but I 'm looking to move there , hopefully by the end of July .
I do n't want to live alone , and instead of moving there then looking for roommates , I want to go from point a to b right away .
B being with a guy who'll enjoy my company .
My regular company and my romantic company .
A live - in boyfriend type , you could say .
This is going to sound desperate , because it is , but I do n't care if you have roommates , or if you live in a small house / apartment .
I 'll sleep on the floor , the couch , the bathtub , or with you if you like .
I 'm not picky and I do n't complain .
I 'm totally humble , meek , and unobtrusive .
But some say quite funny .
You do n't have to take me out or celebrate anniversaries like you do with people you date .
I would feel more comfortable if it was more low - key and laid back .
Cause it 's more comfortable that way , right ?
I do n't expect you to exclusively see me ; I 'm not a big supporter of monogamy , so see as many other girls you like .
If you just want a girl to live with and not be romantic with , that 's fine too .
I wo n't be insulted .
And I 'm quite quiet , so you wo n't even know I 'm there , really .
I do n't really have any bad habits .
I 'm not addicted to drugs , alcohol , cigarettes , but I 'm not uptight , I do n't care if other people use them .
I think people can make their own decisions .
I also do n't eat much .
So basically , I 'm cheap and easy .
I do wish that did n't make me sound bad .
So , the thing is , I do n't have a lot of money .
I 'm actually pretty poor , but as soon as I move , I 'll get a job .
I 'll get three jobs , swear .
If I do n't you can kick me out and I 'll live on the streets until I get one .
I 'm easy to get rid of if you change your mind .
I 'm not a leech .
I 'm very independent .
This move is actually me trying to balance out having independence without isolating myself .
Because I 'm alone all the time .
I can't take it .
So I need someone to take me in .
Like a pet .
Well , except you do n't have to feed me or clean up after me or pay attention to me .
I guess more like a house plant ?
A cactus , maybe ?
I dunno .
I suppose I 'm cactus - like .
But cuter .
I 'm completely serious .
I know someone out there must feel lonely , and wish there was a nice girl to come home to , to talk to or care about them .
I 'll do the cooking and the washing - up .
All the housework as well as work at as many jobs I can handle .
All the money goes to rent , bills , etc .
It 's like having a roommate or a live - in girlfriend but without the stress .
I wo n't cause stress , promise .
I 'll relieve stress on a regular basis .
I give great massages , head rubs , hand jobs , blow jobs .
Did I really just put that ?
Yeah .
You wo n't be getting nothing out of this .
I 'm very appreciative to anyone who would let me stay with them .
But I 'm not a whore .
I 'm actually a virgin .
Those things I mentioned , yeah , I 'll do them , as often as you like , but I wo n't go all the way .
Weird phobia , I guess .
But that 's why I do n't care if you go around with other girls .
I understand men have needs , and I can only do so much to meet them .
It 's not normally a one - woman job .
Hence why monogamy does n't always work out .
Anyways , if you do feel lonely , but do n't know if I 'm a good match for you , reply back and I 'll answer any questions .
I guess I can give a little personal info here ; I hope you find it useful .
I like Doctor Who , Black Books , Bright Young Things and Snatch .
Neil Gaiman is my hero , and I like a lot of bad music , so I wo n't list that here .
I love comics , or graphic novels .
I 'm new to them , but I really like Gaiman , Warren Ellis , and Alan Moore .
I read x-men scans off the internet .
So , basically , I guess I 'm a huge geek .
I 'm 1337 , but I can't fix your computer .
I know a little french , but not enough to hold a conversation in it .
Hopefully I can brush up on it in Canada .
One of the reasons I want to live in Canada is because I love cold weather .
I 'm sure I 'll complain about it come winter , but I miss it , having been in North Carolina for thirteen years .
I come from up north though , New York , near the border to Canada .
So I do n't have a southern accent ; the only time you 'll here me say y'all is to say that I never say y'all .
( ( Also , if you need more pictures , let me know .
I have bajillions of them .
Body shots are hard to get ; I always suffer from slightly - out - of - focus or head - cut - off ness .
You can see those of course , but for those curious now , here are my stats : 36 bust , 27 waist , 36 hips ; hair : orange ; eyes : green ; height : 5 '6 '' ; weight : 130 ; athletic : engages in track , lacrosse , kick boxing , and softball .
I can kick ass , but I choose not to , because I 'm passive , and I know violence is n't right .
I do n't yell .
I do n't have a bad temper at all , despite what you 've heard about redheads .
I 'm an optimist .
Some people find that surprising due to how much black I wear . ) )
In a flash , the blast incinerates air , sprays metal , burns flesh .
Milliseconds after an improvised explosive device ( IED ) detonates , a blink after a mortar shell blows , an overpressurization wave engulfs the human body , and just as quickly , an underpressure wave follows and vanishes .
Eardrums burst , bubbles appear in the bloodstream , the heart slows .
A soldier — or a civilian — can survive the blast without a single penetrating wound and still receive the worst diagnosis : traumatic brain injury , or TBI , the signature injury of the Iraq War .
But in the same instant that the blast unleashes chaos , it also activates the most organized and sophisticated trauma care in history .
Within a matter of hours , a soldier can be medevaced to a state - of - the - art field hospital , placed on a flying intensive care unit , and receive continuous critical care a sea away .
( During Vietnam , it took an average of 15 days to receive that level of treatment .
Today the military can deliver it in 13 hours . )
Heroic measures may be yielding unprecedented survival rates , but they also carry a grim consequence :
No other war has created so many seriously disabled veterans .
Soldiers are surviving some brain injuries with only their brain stems unimpaired .
While the Pentagon has yet to release hard numbers on brain - injured troops , citing security issues , brain - injury professionals express concern about the range of numbers reported from other military - related sources like the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center , the Department of Defense , and the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) .
One expert from the VA estimates the number of undiagnosed TBIs at over 7 ,500 .
Nearly 2,000 brain - injured soldiers have already received some level of care , but the TBIs — human beings reduced to an abbreviation — keep coming .
" We would get about 300 helicopters landing a month , all having some level of trauma , " says Dr. Elisha Powell , an orthopedic surgeon who served as commander of the U.S. Air Force Theater Hospital in Balad , Iraq , a facility described as " MASH on steroids , " where most of the s everely brain injured are treated .
A soldier treated at Balad Air Base stands a 96 percent chance of surviving ; several hundred come through every month .
I ask Dr. Gerald Grant , who served as one of the few neurotrauma surgeons in Iraq , how the hospital managed to keep patients alive .
" It 's complex in that it 's not only medical advances , " he tells me .
" This war is different in that the aerovac system is superb .
The ability to get someone into your care facility with many forward surgeons and subspecialists so close to the front line , very quickly , is a novel concept in this theater . "
The moment an injured soldier hits the helipad at Balad , he 's swept into a whirlwind of critical care .
It 's the one ER in the world where up to 10 surgical specialists are hell - bent on saving a life .
Patients get lined up with IVs and catheters , undergo CT scans and X - rays , and then hit the operating table — the hospital 's best time is 18 minutes .
The head - and - neck team tackles their trauma while a cardiothoracic surgeon and a vascular surgeon go to work on the chest .
They 're shoulder to shoulder with the urologist , who 's brushing against the chief trauma surgeon , who 's coordinating everything over the buzz of orthopedic surgeons drilling external fixators into bone .
It 's crowded .
It 's hot .
Amid the cramped bustle , doctors are pushing the boundaries of medicine .
They 're going through crates of the hemophilia drug Factor VII , yet to be approved for trauma but a wonder drug in stopping bleed - outs .
At $ 3,000 a vial , two vials per dose , the price is a drop in the bucket compared with the expenses incurred during the critical phase of recovery , which can easily exceed a million dollars in the coming weeks .
The lifetime cost of care for brain - injured troops could reach $ 35 billion , according to a Nobel Prize–winning economist and a Harvard University budget expert .
If the diagnostics come up positive for blast - related brain trauma , the neurosurgeon takes action based on observable signs of trauma .
Depending on whether the brain was pulled , pushed , twisted , or punctured in the blast , the neurosurgeon could elect major surgery .
" Our expression is ' Go big or go home , ' " Grant says .
" We really want to do the definitive operation that we know will be OK for them . "
In a matter of minutes , a surgeon will saw the skull in half and discard the damaged portion .
There will be a plastic replacement waiting farther down the line .
Shrapnel is excised , cerebral tissue swells , and the scalp is pulled taut and sewn back over a ballooning brain .
Thanks to the wealth of surgical resources , a procedure that takes several hours in any general hospital in the United States might take Balad surgeons 30 minutes .
" The secret to our hospital 's ability is throughput , " Powell says .
" We have to keep churning .
Things that would overwhelm a major hospital would not overwhelm us .
During the worst incident , we had 35 people come to us in 90 minutes , all by helicopter , landing with just horrible injuries . "
" There are soft tissue traumas where we have no scalp , no eye , and no skull base left , " Grant says .
" And we have to somehow treat that acutely in one surgery setting . "
Many of the soldiers treated at Balad wo n't remember being there .
After leaving the frontline hospital , they 're loaded onto a massive C - 17 cargo plane that has been retrofitted to hold an entire intensive care unit — up to 8 critical care patients and 27 noncritical litter patients .
It 's basically a flying warehouse abuzz with armor - clad clinicians and portable life - support units .
Known as a critical care air transport team , each consists of a critical care physician , a critical care nurse , and a respiratory therapist .
There are 249 of these teams in the Air Force , catering to all branches of the armed forces .
Five hours later , the C - 17 lands at Ramstein Air Base in Germany .
Having been prepped through a satellite tracking system , doctors at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center ( just across the autobahn from Ramstein ) already have a strong grasp of any patient 's treatment needs .
In Balad , surgeons do n't have the time to check medical records or advance directives , so every life is saved at any cost .
But that 's not the case in Landstuhl .
In addition to being a transitional facility , Landstuhl also happens to be the place where the family has a voice in their loved one 's fate .
" You can look at someone and see they will not survive , " says Dr. Gene Bolles , former chief of neurosurgery at Landstuhl .
" When you see that , you are up front with the families .
But so often , you do n't know enough .
When you are in the military , you do n't question , you just save life .
When I was there , our modus operandi was to maintain them and keep them alive to get them to the States . "
" It is very rare for us to have family contact in Iraq because the communication is so difficult , " Grant explains .
" The family can meet the patient in Germany .
They are there to make decisions for them , and they can withdraw care there , whether the patient has an advance directive or not . "
When one veteran 's wife , Michele Reid , spoke with a doctor at Landstuhl about her husband , Pete , she was surprised to learn that he had survived an attack on May 2 , 2004 .
She had feared him dead after receiving funeral notices for some of the friends he served with .
A Navy Seabee , Pete Reid was one of the three severely injured servicemen hit by a barrage of mortar shells in Ramadi , Iraq .
Thirty people were injured , six were killed .
" First they told me he lost his eye and that his brain was bleeding , " she says .
" But then they said that they did n't think he was going to make it . "
Michele asked for the phone to be placed next to Pete 's ear , and she told him to hang on , that she wanted to see him get better .
Later that day , Pete emerged from his coma , opened his eyes , and asked a nurse when he could see his wife .
The team immediately flew him back to the States to see Michele .
The aggressive level of care continues once the troops return toeither Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington , D.C. , or the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Maryland .
At Walter Reed , troops undergo intensive therapies aimed at helping them regain their independence .
Reid was transferred to Bethesda , where Michele was waiting for him .
" When they let me see him , I lost it , " she says .
" I could see his open wounds when they pulled back the sheet .
He did n't say anything — he just squeezed my hand . "
While in the intensive care unit at Bethesda , doctors told Michele that her husband had a 1 percent chance of recovery , and if he survived , he would be vegetative .
" I cried , I prayed , I cussed , and I screamed , " Michele says . "
After a few days , Pete turned his head toward me and said , ' Enough already .
I 'm going to be OK . ' "
+++
From Walter Reed , soldiers are then triaged to one of the nation 's VA polytrauma centers , where the hard work begins .
( There are only 4 polytrauma centers and 21 designated polytrauma rehabilitation sites , a painfully small number to deal with the great many injured troops . )
Weeks ago , a staff sergeant might have been conducting complex tactical operations ; on the polytrauma unit , his biggest challenge might involve lifting his head off the pillow .
Another soldier experiencing sequencing problems might try his hand at disassembling a carburetor in one of the rehab rooms .
That same soldier could then be taken to physical therapy to work on his balance .
Because of the brain 's complexity , each injury manifests its own unique set of challenges .
" All the polytrauma centers offer patients highly individualized care , " says Dr. Rose Collins , a psychologist with the Minneapolis polytrauma center .
" One of my roles is to decrease the barriers thatget in the way of your participating in rehabilitation . "
Soldiers are not the only ones whose issues get addressed at the center .
" Part of myjob is to help their families , " she says .
" How do you make positive meaning out of this ?
How do you grieve ambiguous losses ?
On some level , family members prepare for the possibility of death , but they do n't prepare for the possibility of severe disability .
Who , outside in thereal world , thinks about the lifetime impairments of a traumatic brain injury ? "
At the polytrauma center in Tampa , Florida , Michele had a better idea of what condition her husband was in .
He arrived at the center with a hundred stitches along his scalp and a missing eye .
Surgeons had removed some of his stomach muscles along with portions of his hip boneand transplanted them to his right leg .
Michele could come to terms with his physical injuries , but the personality changes brought on by the TBI made her feel as though her husband was a different man altogether .
The injuries to Pete 's right frontal lobe caused severe impulse control and reasoning problems .
" Near the beginning , Pete threw his urinal and grabbed people by the throat , " Michele says .
" He thought he was still in Iraq , and he even tried to stab out his one good eye with a pen .
He could never be left alone , ever . "
Inside the Minneapolis VA 's polytrauma unit , military insignias adorn the walls , and the milieu is preternaturally calm — a necessity in brain - injury treatment centers .
Color - coded floor tiles in front of entryways help soldiers who can no longer read room numbers .
Halls and doorways are extra wide , all the furniture is movable , and even the bathroom fixtures are amputee - friendly .
The unit was recently redesigned to be completely focused on treatment .
Like Balad , Landstuhl , and Walter Reed , the polytrauma center represents the culmination of research and resources , a level of care to which many private hospitals aspire .
The patients on the unit represent some of the most complicated treatment challenges in the world .
While there , I met a young soldier who had received the military 's full battery of services .
He had been blown apart and put back together , but not entirely , not yet .
The upper left quadrant of his head was missing , pending a new skull plate , and the remainder was dappled with tufts of dark hair and notches left by shrapnel .
In place of two limbs , he had prosthetics — one arm , one leg .
The visible parts of his body were replete with fresh skin grafts , giving him an uneven , patched - together appearance .
In some respects , he did n't look quite possible , but because he could talk and interact and function , he was a success story .
The guy parked in the foyer 's corner , whom I did n't meet , was n't faring as well .
He was wrapped head to toe in heavy white blankets , with only his mouth and a single gray hand exposed .
A plastic tube ran from his lips back behind the chair ; he never moved for the duration of my visit .
From a far room , the angry wailings of another brain - injured patient broke the calm .
As I passed that soldier 's room , I could see him sitting on the edge of his bed , swiping an arm at the nurse who was trying to help him .
Behavioral outbursts , particularly those driven by agitation , are a common side effect of brain injury .
What looks otherworldly to us now will be commonplace in a matter of years .
Projections based on a recent VA report suggest that 400,000 veterans deployed in the global war on terrorism will file for disability .
Can such a number be adequately treated ?
With the lifetime costs of civilian brain injuries escalating , are local communities prepared for the complex treatment measures many veterans will require ?
In high heels and a business suit , Marilyn Price Spivack makes an unlikely rock star , but in the world of brain - injury experts , that 's exactly the image she conjures up .
She is innately tenacious , bold , and energetic .
The availability of cognitive , neurobehavioral , and mental health services is sorely lacking , Spivack explains .
Men and women in the military will receive excellent care for a time , but eventually , they are going back to their communities .
" The military is doing an extraordinary job in saving young soldiers and treating them through the acute rehabilitation phase , " says Spivack , who works with the brain - injured population at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston .
In the early 1980s she founded the Brain Injury Association , today the foremost advocacy organization for TBI survivors .
" Now the government must make a commitment to help them in their recovery , but where are the resources going to come from ?
Asbrain - injury professionals , we know that TBI services are n't available in many places across the country , and we are aware of huge holes inthe system , " she says .
" Frankly , I 'm frustrated and angry about the government 's refusal to give the TBI population the support itd esperately needs . "
Spivack is not being glib ; the giant holes are glaringly apparent .
Many states do not have a single brain - injury rehabilitation center , and of the states that do offer some level of TBI treatment , few actually provide enough assistance to acquire even the most basic levelof specialized care .
At rates that can exceed a thousand dollars a day for postacute TBI rehabilitation , there are n't many American families that can afford a month 's worth of treatment , much less the recommended minimum of 90 days .
As recently as mid-July 2006 , the VA Office of the Inspector General admitted that patients and families were dealing with major inadequacies .
The reality is that a fundamental level of care is simply absent in most states .
The military did not anticipate the magnitude of the problem , and now they are scrambling to add new brain - injury programs and services .
Problems experienced by patients and families include inadequate or absent communication with case managers , lack of follow - up care , and being forced to pay out - of - pocket for necessary treatments and medication .
An evaluation of TBI programs and services conducted by the Institute of Medicine reads like a list of indictments .
It concludes that " finding needed services is , far too often , an overwhelming logistical , financial , and psychological challenge . . . . the quality and coordination of post acute TBI service systems remains inadequate . "
Samuel Reyes Jr. had never heard the term " traumatic brain injury " before he enlisted in the Marines .
As a machine gunner who patrolled Route Mobile near Fallujah , he was well aware of the loss of limb and life .
He regularly saw the unspeakable , and then he lived it .
On September 6 , 2004 , Reyes rode in the back of a seven - ton supply truck with his patrol buddies and members of the Iraqi National Guard .
A suicide bomber pulled up next to the truck and detonated its payload of C - 4 explosive and 250 - millimeter shells .
The blast reduced the truck to little more than a chewed - up driveshaft .
Only Reyes and four other marines survived the attack .
Reyes 's body sustained a range of trauma in the attack .
The impact of the blast cleaved his tongue in two and tore open his abdomen from rib cage to navel .
It slammed both his knees into a metal barrier and peppered his back with shrapnel .
His left arm was blown open to the bone .
" I remember waking up , being on the street , being hot like I was on fire , " Reyes recalls .
" People were talking to me , asking questions I could n't understand .
Someone told me I got hit by an IED [ improvised explosive device ] , and I got scared because I knew what it meant . "
Reyes could not have guessed what had happened inside his skull .
Blast - related brain injuries like those sustained by Reyes can deliver multiple TBIs .
First there is barotrauma , in which the body suffers the same magnitude of pressure felt deep underwater .
It 's theorized that portions of the brain swell and decompress almost instantly during this stage , causing a host of cellular defects throughout the brain .
Objectslike shrapnel and gravel penetrate the skull , ping - ponging within the cranium walls .
The force of the blast then blows an individual against an object , like a wall or a roof , causing blunt trauma to the head .
Finally , in response to these injuries , the brain releases a metabolic cascade of neurochemicals that have a toxic effect on brain tissue .
Reyes had no penetrating fragments ; he experienced three of the four blast insults .
Reyes 's ride through the military 's medical system was n't as clean as most .
The medevac helicopters never arrived , so he was trucked to an ER .
His heart stopped on the way to Baghdad — twice .
Reyes awoke in a blur of bandages , surrounded by other wounded soldiers .
Later that day , his platoon commander appeared from out of the haze and told him seven of his friends had died in the blast .
The accompanying Iraqi soldiers had all died as well , he said .
" I had already lost a lot of friends before that , and this was another really big kick , " Reyes says .
" It 's really bad to feel it , to hear it , and to know it . "
The lieutenant left Reyes alone with his grief , and eventually Reyes 's mind wandered to his own well - being .
" It was all really going downhill then , " Reyes says .
" I was wondering what was going to happen to my military career , or if I could ever have a career at all anywhere else .
It was hard to think of all that . "
At the time of his injury , Reyes had only two more weeks of duty remaining before his tour was over .
A natural - born athlete , he had planned to try out for Marine Recon , a component of special operational forces , and then move on to Officer Cadet School .
He dreamed of someday leading his own platoon , then working his way up the chain of command until retirement .
His entire future began to crumble away as he lay helpless among the damaged .
+++
In less than a day , Reyes was transported to Balad , where a critical care air transport team accompanied him to Landstuhl .
There he regained enough strength to make it to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Maryland .
" I was just waiting at Bethesda , " Reyes explains .
" By then , I was walking a bit better , but I still had a lot of headaches , a lot of pain , and vision blurs . "
Prior to his injury , Reyes had perfect eyesight ; now he wears glasses in order to drive .
After a couple of days as an inpatient , Reyes was discharged to Camp Pendleton , near San Diego , where his father saw him for the first time since his injury .
" I was just happy to see he was alive and walking , but I knew something was different , " Reyes Sr . tells me .
" I could tell by theexpression on his face that he did n't know me at first . "
Reyes accompanied his father home for a three - week medical leave .
During his entire journey through the military 's most elite treatment centers , nobody mentioned anything about a traumatic brain injury to him — the most that was discussed was the likelihood of a mild concussion .
Meanwhile , Reyes 's concentration was shot , his tolerance was low , and he still could not shake the terrible headaches .
He figured he was just a little shaken up and that his head would clear in a short time .
During his convalescence at home , Reyes did n't tell his family orfriends about his memory gaps .
Initially , he recognized no one .
Reyes 's father grew increasingly concerned .
" I had to keep explaining things to him , " Reyes Sr . says .
" He would ask me how everyone was , and I would have to tell him who they were and how he was related to them . "
Reyes smiled and shook the hands of high school buddies and cousins , trusting that his memory would be jogged , but other problems began tocreep in .
Once , he drove an old girlfriend to work and then lost hissense of direction .
When he dropped her off , he had a full tank of gas .
He pulled into his driveway hours later with less than a quarter of atank .
Reyes also began drinking heavily ; it was the only thing thatsoothed the searing pain in his head .
When he returned to Camp Pendleton that October , Reyes complainedand complained , but the Marines put him back to work training newrecruits .
He misidentified guns ; he forgot to include details aboutspecial combat procedures .
It took the Marines a month to realize that Reyes was n't the same , but instead of looking deeper , he says theysimply allowed him to whittle his time away playing video games in thebarracks while the rest of his friends prepared for another tour inIraq .
Finally , in June 2005 , out of concern for Reyes 's unrelentingheadaches , a civilian doctor tested him for neurological problems .
Itwas the first time Reyes heard the term " brain injury . "
" I did n't know what a brain injury was , how it was caused , what itdid , or what it was going to do to me , " Reyes says .
" It was justanother term .
They told me I would have to deal with these problems mywhole life and that I needed to work with it and to find ways to livewith it . "
The military sent Reyes straight to the polytrauma center in PaloAlto .
" They told me that his mild concussion was n't as mild as they thought it was , " Reyes Sr . says , recalling his first meeting with the Palo Alto treatment team .
The team told both father and son that the memory damage might be permanent but that the son could still benefit from rigorous rehabilitation .
At Palo Alto , Reyes spent more than a year learning to learn again .
The rehab team gave him a handheld organizer that beeps when he has appointments .
They taught him meditation in hopes of relieving his anger .
They educated him about brain injury and warned him that itwould probably be tough on his social life .
Reyes is currently stationed back at Camp Pendleton .
His primary duty involves chauffeuring a sergeant major around the base , a job he feels comfortable doing .
As he grows more aware of his limitations , he is beginning to draw connections between his injury and its effect on his life .
" I do n't really tell people about my injury , " he says .
" I do n't like to go out at all .
I stay inside and do things with people I know .
I do n't talk to my friends as much .
When I get really upset , I forget how to calm myself . "
Reyes 's injury may be fresh , but his challenges mirror the complaints I hear from other survivors many years after the injury .
Isolation , addiction , agitation — they are all quintessential characteristics of a serious TBI .
When I ask officials in the VA system if they knew about the long - term outcomes faced by blast - injury survivors , I am met with shoulder shrugs .
The injury is too new , the research is ongoing , the book is still being written .
I ask Reyes 's father if he has any advice for other families dealing with the effects of a blast injury .
" There ain't no really easy way toget through this , " Reyes Sr . says .
" You got to hope like hell someone is there to help you . "
After five months of multiple transports between VA hospitals inBethesda and Tampa , Seabee Pete Reid was finally cleared to returnhome .
He still struggles with frequent nightmares , and sometimes he asks for the car keys , thinking he can still drive .
His behavioraloutbursts occur only every few days now .
" When someone dies , you go through all the steps of grieving , " sayshis wife , Michele .
" When someone goes through what we have , you grieve over and over because the TBI never goes away .
This has ripped our family apart emotionally , physically , and financially .
He was once the strong one who kept our lives together , and now our roles have changed drastically . "
Pete Reid has a good sense of what he has lost , and what remains .
" My biggest problem right now is staying focused , " he says .
" But I also miss being able to drive and do things around the house .
It 's frustrating to be taken care of , to not be able to wash myself and use the toilet on my own . "
Reid knows he wo n't return to the service , but he still carries a strong sense of duty .
I ask him what he sees himself doing 10 years from now , and he does n't hesitate a moment in his answer .
" I hope to help other vets so they do n't have to go through what my wife has had to deal with , " he says .
" To me it seems like we had a lot of paperwork and mess to deal with .
If they 're going through the trouble of fixingme up , then they ought to help walk us through the red tape . "
In its ambitious efforts to save lives , the military did not expect the dire circumstances that await surviving soldiers .
With most other kinds of injuries and disorders , there are a wealth of services in place .
Any heart patient can find affordable treatment within city limits , and any kidney patient can get dialysis within state lines .
But brain - injury patients are stranded in their communities , isolated without basic services .
Why have we devoted such tremendous effort to sustaining life while investing so little to support and nurture it ?
How did we become so shortsighted about such a serious problem ?
Spivack agrees that the equation is unbalanced .
" Our government will spend whatever it takes in pharmacology and technology to save people , and if they do n't die , it 's OK , " she says .
" Prevent fatality .
They speak to caring , but meanwhile services are being cut and access is an issue .
When we first began this effort , everybody talked about the quality of life , maximizing functionality .
It costs money , and a lifetime of commitment . "
Today Samuel Reyes Jr. perseveres despite the realities of his impairments .
He plans to enroll in college and pursue a career in business management .
" I expect school to be really hard , but I just want to try , " he says .
Behind the impairments , you can still sense the soldier .
Reyes 's determination is rivaled only by his loyalty to the Marines .
He believes they 'll take care of him , Semper Fi .
I want to believe Reyes , but I know there are obvious problems with service delivery .
What happens when he and others are taken off active duty ?
In my eyes , he 's the future .
He 's one of the thousands of veterans who will be in routine contact with brain - injury centers , asking for advice and help .
Bolles points out that the actual number of troops wounded in Iraq is likely to be twice as many as reported .
Will local VA hospitals have brain - injury clinicians ready to deal with a plague of psychologicaland social issues ?
Can communities already overburdened with brain - injury patients sustain the new influx of veterans ?
The military has done a spectacular job repairing bodies , but it has not yet learned how to put lives back together .
" More lives are being saved , " says Bolles .
" At the same time , those that are being saved are the more critically injured .
There 's a higher incidence of permanently disabled people . "
America is n't prepared for the injured 's medical demands .
After the dream - team care is finished , soldiers are finding themselves trapped in a nightmare .
DID ANATOMICALLY modern humans interbreed with Neanderthals , the muscle - bound , big - browed and possibly mute cave dwellers who disappeared from Europe and the Middle East about 30,000 years ago ?
The answer may be less interesting than the fact that so many Homo sapiens are fixated on the question .
The debate about whether there ’s a Neanderthal skeleton in our collective closet was revived last week when two groups of scientists reported that they had deciphered DNA from the thigh bone of a Neanderthal man who lived in Croatia 38,000 years ago .
From their analysis of genetic material in the bone , the scientists estimated that Neanderthals and the modern people who supplanted them had 99.5 % of their genes in common .
This will come as an unpleasant surprise to anyone who remembers the film “ Clan of the Cave Bear , ” in which a comely Cro-Magnon played by Daryl Hannah was adopted into a clan of brutish Neanderthals .
But it will cheer anthropologists who argue that if you gave a Neanderthal a bath , a haircut and an iPod , he would blend in with any contemporary crowd .
Since the discovery in the 19th century of Neanderthal remains in Germany ’s Neander Valley , scientific opinion has seesawed between the idea that Neanderthals were an evolutionary dead end only distantly related to modern humans and the view that at least some Neanderthals felt the urge to merge with smarter , nimbler modern humans who left Africa about 100,000 years ago .
Unfortunately , the new revelations about Neanderthal DNA do n’t settle the question .

A 99.5 % genetic overlap between modern humans and Neanderthals might seem to suggest recent , um , intimacy .
Yet humans and chimpanzees are almost as closely related , sharing an estimated 96 % of their genomes despite the fact that their last shared ancestor is thought to have lived millions of years ago .
Scientists said last week that human and Neanderthal ancestors also began to diverge about 500,000 years ago .
Yet at least one leading advocate of the possibility of human - Neanderthal hybrids said the new information was “ unequivocal evidence ” of “ interbreeding . ”
Did they or did n’t they ?
It will take more than a few DNA printouts to dispel the hope ( or is it the fear ? ) that survivors of the “ Clan of the Cave Bear ” walk among us .
It ’s official :
There ’s big money to be made selling virtual window dressing on the internet .
Yesterday , at the Stanford Summit , an annual tech industry love fest , the dreadlocked virtual worlds guru Jaron Lanier told Silicon Valley that " in 25 years , we will all get rich buying and selling virtual goods " , and today , the idea was seconded by Wallop CEO Karl Jacob , one of six " social - networking " types who addressed conference attendees this afternoon .
When asked how social networks would make their money over the next decade , Jacob said : " We believe there 's a world five years down the road - three years down the road - where the most common thing you do on a social network is buy the things you want to dress up your profile with and the applications you need in order to do that . ”
He wants people to know that they do n't need imagination to have personality .
" Self - expression is a very powerful concept , " he explained .
" We want to take people away from the idea that they have to do it themselves and that they can buy forms of self - expression in the virtual world . "
This virtual goods market , he went on to say , is analogous to the cell phone ring - tones market .
Fellow speaker Gina Bianchini , CEO of Ning , was n’t so sure : " I think that if I had to choose between the targeted advertising market and the ring - tone market , I ’d choose targeted advertising . "
Most of Jacob ’s fellow speakers - including MySpace senior vice president Chris Wolfe and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz - believe that good ol ' web advertising will drive social networking into the next decade , as the let - the - web - drive - your - social - life " technology " migrates onto handheld mobile devices and spreads across the globe .
" With MySpace , we 're transforming the company into a global network .
We 're now live in 18 countries , and we 're launching in a new country every three months , " Katz said .
" Mobile is the other huge initiative , so that you can access these networks wherever you go - from your pocket . "
But Jacob refused to fall in line .
At one point , he also said that social networks will soon extend well beyond mobile devices into , well , everything .
" If in ten years we 're still talking about social networking profiles , something went radically wrong , " he said .
" Ten years out ... I think social networking will be woven into pretty much every product and every thing we touch .
It will be part of both our online lives and our real - world lives . "
Somehow , this reminds us of Linden Labs CEO Philip Rosedale telling conference attendees that in ten years , the popularity of virtual worlds like his own Second Life will exceed the popularity of the Web itself .
Jacobs envisions a world where the stuff now stored on sites like MySpace and Facebook is part of the clothes we pull on each morning .
" We can wear [ social networking databases ] , " he said .
" We 've got all this clothing with computers and networks and stuff . "
Shock - a company called nTag interactive is already going after this market , offering wearable electronic name tags that let you easily trade personal information with people you meet at business cocktail parties .
Does that mean social networking will reinvent business in much the same way IBM and Sun believe virtual worlds will ?
The odds are n’t good .
MySpace ’s Katz admits , " Knowing how addictive this stuff , I can imagine the whole thing [ social networking for business ] going horribly wrong and nobody getting anything done . "
The most important message of the afternoon : Social - networking companies do n’t like to be called social - networking companies .
Says Moskovitz , " We define Facebook as a directory that provides social utility . "
So there you have it . ®
CHANGE ON WISTERIA LANE CHANGE ON WISTERIA LANE Wisteria Lane 's new landscape Applewhites cast aside ' Housewives ' :
That '90s show Wisteria Lane 's new landscape UNIVERSAL CITY , Calif .  Southern California 's heavy April rains fell hard on Wisteria Lane , but the residual effects are pleasing to the eye .
The trees are full , and the thick green grass in front of the Desperate Housewives homes on the Universal Studios backlot is almost crying out for a good mow from lawn boy John Rowland ( Jesse Metcalfe ) , who ( contracts permitting ) will return in Season 3 .
Likewise , this past season 's general sense of discontent — on and off the set — with Housewives ' story lines , plus a slippage in the ratings from the stratospheric levels of the first year , have planted seeds of change for the 2006 - 07 season .
Though Housewives remains ABC 's top show with an average 22.1 million viewers , last year at this time , 25 million were watching .
The show has lost younger viewers , and ABC 's increasingly popular Grey 's Anatomy is threatening to take over the top spot .
A tease of what 's to come next season is offered in Sunday 's two - hour finale ( 9 p.m. ET / PT ) , which will be the swan song for at least six characters and feature the returns ( via flashback ) of three favorite faces from the past .
The theme of the episode , says show creator Marc Cherry , is Moving Day .
" All of these women will be leaving certain parts of their life behind and moving on , " says Cherry , believing it made sense to " juxtapose that ( through flashbacks ) to the time when they moved onto Wisteria Lane with all their hopes and expectations for their future . "
Felicity Huffman ( who plays ambitious working mom Lynette ) says the flashback sequences are a great device for viewers " to experience the history and see what these characters were like before we first met them . "
Not to mention what they were like before Season 2 spun the women off into disconnected side stories .
Back to the future
But this early May day on Wisteria Lane feels just like old times as Teri Hatcher ( the accident - prone Susan ) , Marcia Cross ( uptight widow Bree ) and Brenda Strong ( future suicide victim Mary Alice ) film a 1998 flashback to their characters ' first meeting with new neighbors Lynette and Tom ( Huffman and Doug Savant ) .
Work - focused Lynette has just learned she is pregnant with twins and is none too pleased .
For fun , Huffman ( wearing long hair extensions ) screams expletives at Savant that she knows will never make it past ABC censors .
" You 're playing Russian roulette with my ovaries ! " she yells at Tom in front of their horrified new neighbors , who have come bearing welcome gifts .
Dissatisfaction also has troubled the Housewives cast behind the scenes this season as the show weathered last year 's departure of executive producer Michael Edelstein and this month 's exit of executive producer Tom Spezialy , both over creative differences .
Everyone on the show agrees Season 2 was a letdown from the breakout success of the series ' freshman year .
Cross , back in October 2004 when Housewives was just becoming a phenomenon , said that the minute she had a problem with her character 's story line , she would " be in the writers ' office begging for a change . "
This season , she has exercised that option on several occasions .
" I love this part and what they have me do , but I 've been at Marc 's door plenty of times going , ' You 've got to be kidding , ' " she says .
Other cast members point to specific problems in Season 2 .
" The cast got a little thick , " says James Denton , whose character , Mike the plumber , had virtually nothing to do this season .
" We had 19 regulars this year , even more than Lost , so there were a lot of characters to service . "
Denton was so frustrated that at one point he went to his producers to discuss his future .
" I had conversations about what their plan was for Mike to give them an out , " says Denton , who is now in Santa Fe filming a zombie Western movie , Wanted Undead or Alive , with Chris Kattan .
" I told them I 'd be happy to go explore other things if they really were n't sure what to do with Mike . "
Part of the character explosion was a new family with a new mystery , the Applewhites , and viewers had trouble warming up to them , Denton says .
" Viewers were pretty vocal about what they liked and what they did n't — like bringing in a new family with no connection to the neighborhood . "
Denton also says Season 2 lacked the " sweet romance " of the first year .
His Season 1 love interest , Hatcher 's Susan , had the least - defined story arc of all the housewives .
While the others faced alcoholism , work crises and miscarriage , Susan just sort of went on some bad dates .
Asked what Susan 's arc has been , Hatcher says : " She has n't had one .
Marc has said it has been a giant problem from the beginning .
They 've sort of thrown some things up against the wall and tried to see if they 'd stick , and they have n't .
It is hard to invest in the arc of what you are trying to do with your work when you literally show up and there 's no script to shoot .
That 's kind of the way this year has gone . "
Cherry remembers
Hatcher coming to him , begging , " Let me sleep with someone ! "
He jokes that she is " always complaining that she does n't have a boyfriend in real life , so I think she pushes me to have her date on the show because it 's the only action she gets . "
Hatcher , resting her head on Cross ' shoulder in between takes , tries to stay optimistic , stressing , " I love Susan more than anything .
When they write her well , there is nothing more fun .
And I really would love to do this show for as many years as it runs , so I have no interest in anything but this show being as good as it can be .
That all said , I have nothing to do with the writing . "
The man who does is Cherry .
When he arrives on the set in a golf cart , he 's greeted with cheers .
" Here 's the king ! " Huffman proclaims .
Though Cherry acknowledges that mistakes were made , he also says , " I see some other shows on TV and think , even the most boring episode of Desperate Housewives still has more twists and turns in it than your average hour of TV . "
He has laid out a plan to recapture the first - season magic .
" We 're going to focus on domestic drama at home , " Cherry says .
" And I 'm going to work much harder to criss - cross all the women 's stories so that their lives bump up against each other . "
Susan 's new directions
To help make that possible , Lynette will eventually end up back home , a change that makes Huffman happy .
" I loved being at work , but maybe it was time to work my way out of the office , " she says .
" But I ca n't just go back to being a stay - at - home mom , because we 've seen that done and after a while it 's not that fun to watch . "
Although he 's still formulating a Season 3 story line for Susan , Cherry says the character will be dealing with her daughter , Julie , growing up and beginning to date .
And Andrea Bowen , who plays Julie , says she 's more than ready .
" It 's time for something a little more spicy , " she says .
" Julie 's just so good . "
As for romance , all Denton will say is , " I have a lot to do in the finale " — Mike and Susan " sure are cozy . "
But everyone is keeping mum about whether that might continue in Season 3 .
" I have no idea where Mike ends up , " he says .
There will be another big mystery in Season 3 , but unlike the Applewhite story , Denton says , it " involves a number of people in the neighborhood that you already care about . "
One thing that wo n't change : Mary Alice as narrator .
Cherry says he was pitched the idea of having a new " dead " character narrate the show each year , and he briefly considered Steven Culp ( killed off as Rex in last year 's finale ) as a replacement .
But he opted to stay with the familiar and will use Mary Alice 's voice - over to move the story forward six months into the future at the start of Season 3 .
( " A smart move , " says Huffman , who , like many , felt that Season 2 lagged in getting off the ground . )
About 15 minutes of the season premiere will catch viewers up on the missing months : " A whole lot will have happened , " Cherry says .
" We come into their lives at breaking points . "
" The writers are bringing the future into the present , " Strong explains .
" This finale builds to a much stronger season with a much clearer arc . "
And next season , Savant hopes , " will be back to being audacious — stuff you can't see anywhere else on television . "

The Season 3 premiere will catch up with the Housewives six months after the events of Sunday 's finale .
But the problems of race and poverty in America “ still require the highest caliber of attention , ” said Mr. Edgar , who cited the flawed government response to New Orleans and its mostly poor , black population after Hurricane Katrina .
He said he was distrustful of the Justice Department ’s leadership to make appropriate decisions as to the nation ’s civil rights priorities .

A New Mission
Some critics say that many of the Justice Department ’s religious - oriented initiatives are outside its mandate from Congress .
While statutes prohibit religious discrimination in areas like employment and housing , no laws address some of the issues in which the department has become involved .
“ They are engaging in freewheeling social engineering , ” said Ayesha Khan , counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State , and “ using the power of the federal government to put in place an ideological , not constitutional agenda . ”
The department declined to make available for interviews Assistant Attorney General Wan J. Kim , who heads the civil rights division , or Eric Treene , who holds the newly created position of special counsel for religious discrimination .
Ms. Magnuson , the Justice Department spokeswoman , said it was justified in devoting so much attention to the issue because Congress has demonstrated its interest by including religion in the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and enacting the 2000 law involving zoning restrictions , the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act .
Ms. Magnuson also said the department had not diminished its interest in enforcing racial and national origin discrimination cases .
The changes at the Justice Department began under Attorney General John Ashcroft , but have accelerated under Alberto R. Gonzales , his successor .
Mr. Gonzales has increasingly cited his agency ’s record on behalf of religious causes as among his most important accomplishments , often noting the successful intervention in cases on behalf of people who had suffered discrimination for wearing Muslim head coverings .
In speeches , he routinely says that religious freedom is the nation ’s “ first freedom because our founders saw fit to place it first in the Bill of Rights . ”
A USC Information Sciences Institute researcher is among a growing group of computer scientists learning to solve difficult IT problems of information classification , reliability and meaning by datamining public websites like Digg , del.icio.us and Flickr .
That tool , according to ISI computer scientist Kristina Lerman , is people , human intelligence at work on the social web , the network of blogs , bookmark , photo and video - sharing sites , and other meeting places now involving hundreds of thousands of individuals daily , recording observations and sharing opinions and information .
Lerman shared her recent work with others in the burgeoning new field of social information processing a special AAAI - sponsored symposium on the subject March 26 - 28 at Stanford .
She says that extracting ' metadata ' about transactions -- who is talking to whom , who is listening , how conclusions are reached , and how they spread -- can help researchers answer currently refractory problems about documents : their accuracy and quality , their categorization , the relation of their embedded terminology .
One benefit , according to Lerman , who in addition to her ISI appointment , is a research assistant professor at the Viterbi School of Engineering Department of Computer Science at University of Southern California , is automatic determination of the semantics of content from one kind of metadata : tags .
Tags play a crucial role in a longrunning project called the Semantic Web .
For about a decade , she notes , researchers sought a way to organize data so that someone searching for a specific kind of " check " would n't have to weed out unwanted references to chess , symbols , verification procedures , financial documents , political science theories and many more .
Tagging seeks to eliminate ambiguities by affixing ' tags , ' computer labels peeling apart the multiple meanings of ordinary language into discreet indicators of meaning , guiding computer searches .
But with natural language being as complex as it is , making sense of tags is not easy .
Attempts to manually attack the vocabulary and build in the intricate interconnections that signal different word meanings have proved frustrating .
Lerman hopes she 's onto another way .
Hundreds of thousands of users are now online , chattering away on all kinds of topics .
This volume of directed discourse provides a new way to extracting meaning from tags — statistical models .
The process has been called " folksonomy , " a collectively constructed informal classification system .
Unlike the traditional approach to the Semantic Web , in which a few knowledge professionals try to agree on a formal classification system which will then be used to annotate data , folksonomy emerges from collective tagging activities of many individuals .
New social websites aimed at sharing information such as del.icio.us and Flickr organically grow ways for site members to access each others holdings .
Typically , the members themselves spontaneously create a tagging system , encouraged by the site architecture .
The tags emerging from such systems , Lerman and collaborators have found , can be turned to broader purposes .
One of Lerman 's initial tagging investigations used the photo - sharing site Flickr , analyzing results returned by a request for images of ' beetles , ' including some pictures of insects , some pictures of Volkswagens , and a few other entries .
By extracting the tags that Flickr users had described the images with , and applyng a mathematical technique called the " Expectation - maximization ( EM ) algorithm , " Lerman found it possible to quite accurately separate pictures of insects from pictures of cars returned by the “ beetle ” search .
Lerman has gone beyond tagging to using metadata to acquire more and more accurate information about the content of documents in social networking situations .
A Lerman paper now in pre-publication on " Social Information Processing in Social News Aggregation " notes :
The rise of the social media sites , such as blogs , wikis , Digg and Flickr among others , underscores the transformation of the Web to a participatory medium in which users are collaboratively creating , evaluating and distributing information .
The innovations introduced by social media have lead to a new paradigm for interacting with information , what we call ' social information processing ' .
In the paper , Lerman argues that " by tracking stories over time , that social networks play an important role in document recommendation . "
In addition to providing a platform for document recommendation , social Web enables researchers to study collective user behavior quantitatively .
In the same paper , Lerman also presented a mathematical model of how collaborative rating and promotion of stories emerges from the independent decisions made by many users .
She found good agreement between predictions of the model and user data gathered from Digg .
In another paper , examining de.licio.us , Lerman and collaborators " describe a probabalistic model of the user annotation process , " and then used the model " to automatically find resources relevant to a particular information domain ... with promising results . "

I Shut Down The Little Rock Airport
By Eileen Blass , USA TODAY
Photo by Eileen Blass / USA TODAY
A Lightware bag filled with photographic equipment was the cause of the evacuation of the terminal building at Little Rock National Airport .
The smaller black bag in the foreground was packed inside the large Lightware .
Airline travel is a pain these days .
I have been a staff photographer with USA TODAY for the last 18 years and I fly frequently .
I 've had my share of airport delays .
Have n't we all ?
Lost luggage , long security lines , canceled flights , the works .
Since 9/11 , the two words I have heard most are " bag check " .
My travels on Friday August 24 , 2007 gave the words " bag check " a whole new meaning .
I was in Little Rock , Arkansas working on a story with my colleague , reporter Andrea Stone .
When our reporting was complete , Andrea and I headed for Little Rock National Airport for flights home .
After checking in at the Delta counter , I dragged my lighting kit and luggage cart over to the TSA folks at the In - Vision CTX machine .
This is a large x-ray machine used to examine checked bags .
With my bag dropped off , Andrea and I headed to the airport restaurant for a bite to eat .
I was enjoying my roast beef sandwich , when 20 minutes into our meal we --- and all others in the restaurant --- were told to leave immediately and proceed to the terminal exit .
Jeez , an EVACUATION !
That was a new one for me .
Into news mode I went , photographing passengers heading for the exits and waiting outside .
I poked around the parking lot looking for different angles .
Police and fire vehicles were on the scene .
Andrea , standing just inside the terminal entrance with other passengers , had just made a call to USA TODAY offices to report the evacuation .
An airport official approached and asked if there was anyone on Delta Flight # 4307 by the name of Blass .
Andrea could n't believe what she was hearing .
She spoke up that she was my colleague and told the official that I was outside .
I was standing in the parking lot , calling my husband at home in Pennsylvania to ask him if there was something I should know , like …were we being attacked ?
With Andrea shouting my name , I hung up before the connection to my husband went through .
Who was that official with Andrea , I wondered ?
I bet he'd tell us what was going on .
I was ready to ask questions , but he had a few for me .
" Are you Eileen Blass " Yup , I said .
" Are you flying out on Delta ? "
Uh huh .
" Did you check a large black bag ? "
Yes .
Then I heard my heartbeat in my head .
Andrea and I looked at each other .
Huh ?
This was my entire fault ?

Passengers stand outside the terminal building at Little Rock National Airport .
The airport was evacuated for about 30 minutes because a TSA screener flagged a suspicious bag belonging to USA TODAY staff photographer Eileen Blass .
I was escorted into the terminal and Andrea was asked to wait in a seating area .
No , I explained , she 's my colleague and we needed to be together .
Besides , who was going to take notes !!!
Larry Gillan of the Little Rock police department said that the bomb squad had been called because whatever was in the bag was showing as not normal , coming up " bright red " on monitors .
I gave Larry a detailed description of what was in the checked bag : Dyna - Lite power packs , three flash heads , light stands , umbrellas , and a black bag containing wires and cables for my radio remotes .
Officials were asking me questions .
I passed around my press credentials .
I told them I had flown into town the day before with the bag .
Andrea was taking notes .
Someone asked to see my driver 's license .
What was my date of birth , my address , my phone number ?
This could n't be happening .
Bernie Sherwood of the Little Rock Fire Department asked me about the bag 's contents .
He noted there was a " lot of wiring in there . "
He explained that the only thing they did n't see were the " detonators " , which Sherwood said was " the big concern for me . "
He asked about the black bag of wires , which was what gave them the most grief .
Eventually , my lighting kit was deemed safe and the airport , closed for about 30 minutes , reopened .
Passengers filed in , many grumbling on their cellphones .
I overheard a few choice words .
But wait , this was n't over yet .
I stepped outside to catch my breath .
Oh…my … God …the media had arrived .
Live TV trucks , a reporter doing a stand up , video being shot , a still photographer walking around , a man carrying a reporter 's notebook .
It was " breaking news . "
Watching the scene unfold , I felt like I was watching my own funeral .
It was creepy .
Having seen enough , I went back into the terminal .
The day did n't improve a whole lot .
I proceeded to the passenger security checkpoint with my carry - on , a rolling " Airport Security " camera bag .
Placing the bag on the conveyor belt , naturally I expected to hear those two little words , and I did .
" BAG CHECK ! " I was told everything had to come out of the bag , be placed in a tray , and run through the x-ray again .
Would somebody please tell me what the heck is going on ?
This was more than swab treatment .
I asked why , were these new procedures ?
The TSA lady said they have to do this now .
Interesting , nobody did that in Philadelphia the previous day .
She hoisted my carry - on bag and trays , filled precariously with cameras and lenses , back to the x-ray machine .
Thankfully , I passed inspection and was free to go to my gate .

Members of the media gather outside the terminal building at Little Rock National Airport after reports of a suspicious checked piece of luggage .
The airport was evacuated for about 30 minutes .
I was flying home to Philadelphia through Atlanta .
But , the flight to Atlanta was delayed for hours by bad weather .
I had a sinking feeling that my connection to Philadelphia would be long gone by the time I got to Atlanta .
But hey , how much worse can this get ?
At least it was n't my fault .
With three hours to wait , I plopped down on the concourse floor , pulled out my laptop and surfed the Net .
I found breaking news reports from local TV websites about my little baggage debacle .
Here 's a couple of links :

http://tinyurl.com/324kr6
Arriving in Atlanta after midnight , I was now stranded with crowds of other frustrated passengers delayed by weather .
There was no way home that night .
Delta rebooked me on a flight the next afternoon .
But there was no way in hell I was going to sleep on the concourse floor .
Not this night , anyway .
I was tired , hungry , and grumpy and would have very much appreciated a shot of Chivas .
I found a hotel and needed to sleep .
But the day kept swirling in my head .
Security is tight everywhere these days .
Every time I fly , I am reminded of what 9/11 did to us .
We are all reminded by it .
This whole debacle seemed funny but it was really quite serious .
I learned that my daughter literally rolled on the floor in stitches when she heard someone thought her mom might be a threat to the flying public .
She was eight years old when 9/11 happened .
I covered 9/11 , and I understood why security officials were being vigilant .
It 's their job .
The travel day from hell did have one little ray of sunshine .
When all the questioning was done in Little Rock , Larry Gillan of the Little Rock Police Department lingered .
He had asked me lots of questions earlier about the contents of my bag .
He was n't finished with me just yet .
Larry , I might add , was a really pleasant guy .
When all the officials were done with their questions , Larry posed one more , in a manner reminiscent of Peter Falk 's character , Columbo .
" I have one last question for you , ma'am . "
He wanted to know if a lens hood would be a smart purchase for one of his own photographic lenses .
I obliged by giving him a brief explanation on why a lens hood was a very good idea .
You know … one should never miss an opportunity to talk shop .

Fair Warning :
There is nothing funny in this post .
If you came here looking for a bit of light entertainment , you wo n't find it here today .
It 's taking all my courage to post this .
I find myself compelled to talk about something and trust me , no one is more shocked than I .
Those of you who know me in real life know that this is not a story I tell often .
There are many reasons why I do n't and I 'll talk about some of them later but , well , here 's why I feel like I have to say something now .
Today , the Yarn Harlot wrote THIS post .
Yes , she 's Canadian and mostly blogs aboutbut she 's also very much a thinking woman .
Her account of the Tory Bowen story is concise and pretty fair , I think .
But I feel the need to speak out on this issue because a sexual assault had a very big effect on my life and probably more so because shame thrives in secrecy and when evil goes unnamed .
When I was either 13 or 14 , I went to spend the night with the girl who lived catty - corner across the street .
She was a year younger than I was and we were n't good friends but it was during Spring Break and we'd been playing together .
We went to sleep in her parent 's bed -- I do n't know where her parents slept nor where her mother was .
Anyway , in the middle of the night , I woke up to find her father kneeling beside the bed , with his hands all over me under my pajamas .
He did n't rape me .
But he touched me sexually without my consent and I can't begin to describe what that was like .
At age 14 . I did n't know what to do so I pretended that I was still asleep but said , " Stop. Stop . " sort of sleepily .
After a bit , he did and he left the room .
I lay awake all night and cried , trying to make sense of what had happened .
Trying not to go to sleep for fear it would happen again .
I felt like it was probably MY fault in some way .
I wished I had n't worn those pajamas .
In the morning , I made an effort to tell him , " I never remember what happens at night . "
I thought I would be in some kind of trouble ...
I do n't know what I thought .
I just wanted to get away and pretend it had never happened .
I never told anyone .
But soon after , I started going out into the backyard at night after dinner and throwing up .
And that began an almost 17 - year long battle with bulimia .
At the time , I think I was consciously trying to become sexless .
Because surely , if there was something about me that drove grown men-- FATHERS -- to do such dirty things , I needed to change .
It took me many years too realize that this man was really sick and that normal grown men do not find girls sexually attractive .
Men with normal sex lives do not prey upon the young or weak or defenseless .
After the family moved away , when I was in college , I finally told my mom what had happened .
It 's taken many , many years to let go of the shame of that one single night .
And the repercussions have been pretty huge and horrific -- more than I want to talk about here .
I do n't usually talk about it at all because I never wanted to be defined by my status as a victim .
I do n't write about having had cervical cancer , either .
Nor eating disorders .
Once I thought I would like to get my license and counsel girls with eating disorders .
Now I know I just could n't do that and survive .
I feel so much gratitude for people who can , though , and not just a little shallow that really , all I want to do is laugh and make people laugh .
I 'm at a point in my life where what I really want to do is find the fun in the daily absurdity and silliness of life .
If , given that , you are wondering why I 'm telling you all this now , it 's because this event made me see that there is a time for speaking up about injustice and about the reality of rape .
Regardless of what words that judge lets Tory Bowen use , the reality of her rape does not change .
She will be affected by it for the rest of her life .
But I would also put forth the idea that there is more than one way to rape a woman , and what that judge in Nevada is doing is as harmful to Tory Bowen as what her assailant did .
When you take away a person 's ability to talk about a horrific event -- to seek justice for it by fully describing it -- you add a level of pain that never goes away .
Guilt and shame and dysfunction thrive in secrecy and in the dark .
I do n't want to say that if we all sit by and watch what 's happening without voicing our despair that such a thing can happen in this country -- THIS COUNTRY , not Iraq or Dafur or Bosnia -- then we are a party to the rape of Tory Bowen .
I do n't feel that all of us are meant to be the torch bearers in every cause .
But for me , everything changed when I became the mother of two girls .
God forbid that something should ever happen to my daughters .
But if it does , I hope that they will trust that they can talk about it and not only be heard , but have justice served .
For me , the stakes are much higher now .
And silence is no longer an option .

Army chiefs are being forced to provide reports to the Afghan government detailing the death of every civilian killed during British troops ' clashes with the Taliban .
They were previously required to file papers on such incidents only to the Ministry of Defence .
But now , following a demand by Afghan President Hamid Karzai , the documents are sent to the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) and then used to brief members of the Kabul administration .
The move comes after increasing controversy inside Afghanistan over those being killed during the recent upsurge in violence .
However , defence experts fear the reports may disclose operational secrets .
Tory MP Patrick Mercer , a former Army commander , said : " There is a possibility that , through providing casualty details , sensitive material threatening the security of British troops may fall into the wrong hands . "
President Karzai accused foreign soldiers of carelessly killing scores of Afghans with " extreme " and " disproportionate " force .
He warned that the fight against the Taliban could be lost unless the forces showed more restraint .
His comments came days after the deaths of an estimated 25 civilians in an air strike ordered by British and Coalition forces in Helmand province .
About 90 foreign soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan this year but no figures have been made public for Afghan casualties .
Defence sources have suggested inaccurate artillery and off - target air strikes were responsible for the majority of the civilian deaths .
More precise weapon systems are now being rushed into service .
Captain Leo Docherty , who fought last year in Helmand before leaving the Scots Guards to write the book Desert Of Death , said : " Civilian deaths catastrophically undermine the entire Nato effort as relatives of the dead , bent on vengeance , flock to the Taliban cause . "
An MoD spokeswoman said : " We share information relating to the operations we undertake because UK forces are in Afghanistan at the behest of the Afghan government . "
Once upon a time , there was an instructor who taught physics students .
One day the instructor called them into the classroom and showed them a wide , square plate of metal , next to a hot radiator .
The students each put their hand on the plate and found the side next to the radiator cool , and the distant side warm .
And the instructor said , Why do you think this happens ?
Some students guessed convection of air currents , and others guessed strange metals in the plate .
They devised many creative explanations , none stooping so low as to say “ I do n’t know ” or “ This seems impossible . ”
And the answer was that before the students entered the room , the instructor turned the plate around .
1
Consider the student who frantically stammers , “ Eh , maybe because of the heat conduction and so ? ” I ask :
Is this answer a proper belief ?
The words are easily enough professed — said in a loud , emphatic voice .
But do the words actually control anticipation ?
Ponder that innocent little phrase , “ because of , ” which comes before “ heat conduction . ”
Ponder some of the other things we could put after it .
We could say , for example , “ Because of phlogiston , ” or “ Because of magic . ”
“ Magic ! ” you cry .
“ That ’s not a scientific explanation ! ”
Indeed , the phrases “ because of heat conduction ” and “ because of magic ” are readily recognized as belonging to different literary genres .
“ Heat conduction ” is something that Spock might say on Star Trek , whereas “ magic ” would be said by Giles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer .
However , as Bayesians , we take no notice of literary genres .
For us , the substance of a model is the control it exerts on anticipation .
If you say “ heat conduction , ” what experience does that lead you to anticipate ?
Under normal circumstances , it leads you to anticipate that , if you put your hand on the side of the plate near the radiator , that side will feel warmer than the opposite side .
If “ because of heat conduction ” can also explain the radiator - adjacent side feeling cooler , then it can explain pretty much anything .
And as we all know by this point ( I do hope ) , if you are equally good at explaining any outcome , you have zero knowledge .
“ Because of heat conduction , ” used in such fashion , is a disguised hypothesis of maximum entropy .
It is anticipation - isomorphic to saying “ magic . ”
It feels like an explanation , but it ’s not .
Suppose that instead of guessing , we measured the heat of the metal plate at various points and various times .
Seeing a metal plate next to the radiator , we would ordinarily expect the point temperatures to satisfy an equilibrium of the diffusion equation with respect to the boundary conditions imposed by the environment .
You might not know the exact temperature of the first point measured , but after measuring the first points —
I ’m not physicist enough to know how many would be required — you could take an excellent guess at the rest .
A true master of the art of using numbers to constrain the anticipation of material phenomena — a “ physicist ” — would take some measurements and say , “ This plate was in equilibrium with the environment two and a half minutes ago , turned around , and is now approaching equilibrium again . ”
The deeper error of the students is not simply that they failed to constrain anticipation .
Their deeper error is that they thought they were doing physics .
They said the phrase “ because of , ” followed by the sort of words Spock might say on Star Trek , and thought they thereby entered the magisterium of science .
Not so .
They simply moved their magic from one literary genre to another .

DALLAS , Texas ( CNN ) --
A cheap , highly addictive drug known as " cheese heroin " has killed 21 teenagers in the Dallas area over the past two years , and authorities say they are hoping they can stop the fad before it spreads across the nation .
" Cheese heroin " is a blend of so - called black tar Mexican heroin and crushed over - the - counter medications that contain the antihistamine diphenhydramine , found in products such as Tylenol PM , police say .
The sedative effects of the heroin and the nighttime sleep aids make for a deadly brew .
" A double whammy -- you 're getting two downers at once , " says Dallas police detective Monty Moncibais .
" If you take the body and you start slowing everything down , everything inside your body , eventually you 're going to slow down the heart until it stops and , when it stops , you 're dead . "
( Audio slide show : A father describes his teen son's death )
Steve Robertson , a special agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington , says authorities are closely monitoring the use of " cheese " in Dallas .
Trying to keep the drug from spreading to other cities , the DEA is working with Dallas officials to raise public awareness about the problem .
Authorities also are trying to identify the traffickers , Robertson says .
" We are concerned about any drug trend that is new because we want to stop it , " he says .
Why should a parent outside Dallas care about what 's happening there ?
Robertson says it 's simple :
The ease of communication via the Internet and cell phones allows a drug trend to spread rapidly across the country .
" A parent in New York should be very concerned about a drug trend in Dallas , a drug trend in Kansas City , a drug trend anywhere throughout the United States , " he says .
Middle schoolers acknowledge ' cheese '
" Cheese " is not only dangerous .
It 's cheap .
About $ 2 for a single hit and as little as $ 10 per gram .
The drug can be snorted with a straw or through a ballpoint pen , authorities say .
It causes drowsiness and lethargy , as well as euphoria , excessive thirst and disorientation .
That is , if the user survives .
( Interactive :
What is " cheese " ? )
Authorities are n't exactly sure how the drug got its name " cheese . "
It 's most likely because the ground - up , tan substance looks like Parmesan cheese .
The other theory is it 's shorthand for the Spanish word " chiva , " which is street slang for heroin .
By using the name " cheese , " drug dealers are marketing the low - grade heroin to a younger crowd -- many of them middle schoolers -- unaware of its potential dangers , authorities say .
" These are street dealers , dope dealers , " Moncibais recently warned students at Sam Tasby Middle School .
" They give you a lethal dose .
What do they care ? "
Moncibais then asked how many students knew a " cheese " user .
Just about everyone in the auditorium raised a hand .
At one point , when he mentioned that the United States has the highest rate of drug users in the world , the middle schoolers cheered .
( Watch middle schoolers raise hands , admit they know drug users )
" You know , I know being No. 1 is important , but being the No. 1 dopeheads in the world , I do n't know whether [ that ] bears applause , " Moncibais shot back .
Authorities say the number of arrests involving possession of " cheese " in the Dallas area this school year was 146 , up from about 90 the year before .
School is out for the summer , and authorities fear that the students , with more time on their hands , could turn to the drug .
' Cheese ' as common a problem as pot
School officials and police have been holding assemblies , professional lectures , PTA meetings and classroom discussions to get the word out about the drug .
A public service announcement made by Dallas students is airing on local TV , and a hotline number has been created for those seeking assistance .
Drug treatment centers in Dallas say teen " cheese " addicts are now as common as those seeking help for a marijuana addiction .
" It is the first drug to have even come close in my experience here , " says Michelle Hemm , director of Phoenix House in Dallas .
From September 2005 to September 2006 , Phoenix House received 69 " cheese " referral calls from parents .
Hemm says that in the last eight months alone , that number has nearly doubled to 136 .
The message from the parents is always , " My kid is using ' cheese , ' " she says .
Phoenix
House refers them to detoxification units first , but Hemm says at least 62 teens have received additional treatment at her facility since last September .
Fernando Cortez Sr. knows all too well how devastating cheese heroin can be .
A reformed drug user who has spent time in prison , Cortez had spoken to his children about the pitfalls of drug use .
He thought his 15 - year - old son was on the right track .
But on March 31 , his boy , Fernando " Nando " Cortez Jr. , was found dead after using cheese heroin .
" I should have had a better talk with him , " he says .
" All it takes is once .
You get high once and you die , and that 's what happened to my son . "
He knows it 's too late for his son .
Now , he is using his son 's story to help others .
" All I can do is try to help people now .
Help the kids , help the parents . "
CNN.com senior producer Wayne Drash contributed to this report .
It appears as though the long knives are out in Washington .
Career operatives in the CIA and State Department who opposed the neocons ’ attempt to " sex up " the intel during the run-up to the Iraq War are being purged wholesale .
Various cliques at the CIA , who systematically leaked information to the press about just how bad things are in Iraq , are being replaced by yes - men or ideologues who can be relied upon to " toe the administration line " .
Anyone still doubting the Trotskyite ancestry of the neocons should finally be convinced by this housecleaning , which is being perpetrated in a manner that would make Chairman Mao blush ( and which is also compromising our security by terminating numerous experienced intelligence analysts ) .
Meanwhile , the drumbeat for an attack against Iran continues more stridently than ever .
Elements within this administration are opening a propaganda campaign designed to sabotage the European Union ’s attempt to negotiate an agreement with Iran concerning its nuclear weapons program .
Rumors and innuendo are being spread about the deceit of the Europeans , the duplicity of the Iranians , and the impotence of diplomacy as a means to solve this dispute .
Given this record , it is becoming increasingly obvious that President Bush is now wholly on - board with the neocons ’ agenda and that an Iranian conflict may be on the way .
After all , Karl Rove was famously quoted as saying that there must be " no war in ’ 04 ” due to the impending election .
This , of course , says nothing about ’05 .
But before we begin the saturation bombing , antiwar Americans should take the time to investigate the realities of Iran so as to be more informed about the political realities of that ancient land .
One of the greatest resources I ’ve found concerning Iranian politics is The Last Great Revolution .
Written by journalist Robin Wright , who has reported for The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post , it is a veritable treasure - trove of information .
The current pro-war narrative being spun by the administration basically revolves around assertions that Iran is a dangerous dictatorship run by a band of fanatical mullahs .
It is claimed that the nation is a cross between Inquisitional Spain and Soviet Russia , complete with a military - industrial complex manufacturing WMDs which will be passed on to Osama bin Laden for deadly terrorist attacks against America .
Since Americans should know by now to take everything that this administration says about WMDs with a huge grain of salt , it behooves us to treat this entire neocon narrative with intense skepticism .
Ms. Wright paints a much different picture than the one currently being spoon - fed to the American public .
The Islamic Republic was officially born , she notes , in 1979 after a national referendum accepted the constitution and created the numerous institutions which now make up the Iranian government .
That referendum , like all subsequent Iranian elections , was reasonably free and was carried out with a universal franchise ( which included women ) .
The governing system was conceived by the Ayatollah Khomeini who , despite being a religious extremist , sought to create a unique political arrangement in Iran .
Basically , he wanted to fashion a society which blended democratic institutions with oversight by Islamic scholars .
The system includes a parliament and a president who are elected by universal suffrage .
Several seats in the parliament are reserved for religious minorities , including the Jewish , Christian , and Zoroastrian communities .
The governing process is monitored by a supreme cleric ( the Faqih ) and a body of clerics called the Council of Guardians .
The basic criticisms of the Iranian government revolve around the powers of these religious offices .
Specifically , the Council of Guardians retains the power to disqualify candidates and parties for membership in the parliament .
In addition , this Council may nullify laws passed by the parliament if they are deemed to be in conflict with Islamic Law ( though it should be added that these Islamic offices were included in the constitution which was adopted by the original referendum back in the 1970s ) .
But several points should be considered regarding these criticisms .
First , the Council of Guardians is often limited in its disqualifications by practical political considerations .
Mohammed Khatami , the current president , is a reformer who is in constant conflict with the conservative clerics and who has defeated the clerical candidate for that office several times .
The Council has never dared to declare him unfit for office , fearing the political repercussions of such a decision .
In addition , the parliament has often been controlled by reformist forces who oppose the strident Islamism of the mullahs .
While this system is obviously not a prototype of Jeffersonian republicanism , it is nevertheless incorrect to call it a dictatorship .
In fact , the Iranian government is probably the most representative and democratic government in the Muslim Middle East .
In addition , Western attacks on this system because of its nullification of candidates and its proscription of political parties expose us to charges of hypocrisy .
After all , even after the vetting process , the current Iranian parliament contains members from approximately 10 different political parties .
It is thus only fair to analyze our own system by this same standard .
For instance , how many parties are currently represented in our Congress ?
By my count , all but 2 of the 535 members of our House and Senate belong to either of the two dominant parties ( along with one Socialist and one Independent ) .
Our system unabashedly discriminates against third parties by a variety of backdoor mechanisms that are only slightly more democratic than the Iranian Council of Guardians .
Ballot access laws and campaign finance laws are rigged to prevent the fair participation of third parties in our elections .
Participation in presidential debates is largely restricted to the two major parties by the shadowy maneuverings of the Commission on Presidential Debates .
In this past election , the Democratic Party also engaged in a range of legal shenanigans to keep Ralph Nader off the ballot in numerous states , in flagrant disregard for the democratic rights of his supporters .
Other western nations also fall far short of the stringent standard by which Iran is being judged .
Just a few weeks ago , a court in Belgium completely outlawed the Vlaams Blok , a right - wing anti-immigration party , because it was " espousing discriminatory ideologies " .
The Blok had garnered the largest vote total of any party in the last parliamentary elections there .
Is this behavior any more " democratic " than the Council of Guardians ?
And do these facts disqualify America and Belgium from membership in the democratic family of nations ?
Do they make us fair game for " regime change " ?
The second point of criticism , the nullification of parliamentary laws by the Council of Guardians , also makes for an interesting comparison .
Basically , Western critics charge that it is unacceptably dictatorial for a government to allow its laws to be voided by a committee of unelected scholars .
Unfortunately , our federal government has been degenerating into a system of judicial fiat for years .
Our federal court system , which is comprised of unelected judges , is rife with judicial activism in which popular laws passed by elected representatives are thrown out … often by the most tenuous of constitutional rationales .
Major aspects of our culture have been altered in an undemocratic fashion by this judiciary .
Polls show that nearly 80 % of the American voters , for instance , support prayer in public schools .
Without Roe vs. Wade , probably 20 or 30 states would ban abortion .
And it is hard to imagine that any elected body in America would ban Santa Claus decorations or displays of the Ten Commandments from public forums .
Even more blatantly undemocratic , the federal judiciary has been nullifying a plethora of victorious popular referendums on topics such as recognizing English as the official language and withholding welfare from illegal aliens .
I should add here than I am not taking a side on any of these issues ( nor am I singing the praises of untrammeled majoritarianism ) , but am merely demonstrating that the decisions of the judiciary in these instances are flagrantly against the will of the majority .
Furthermore , these decisions have been enacted by bodies which are only marginally more " democratic " than the Iranian Council of Guardians .
The salient point here is that these criticisms of the Iranian system are not correct in labeling it as a hopeless dictatorship .
It is a unique blend of democratic institutions monitored and fine - tuned by several bodies of religious scholars .
This system was enacted in a free vote by the clear majority of the Iranian electorate .
It is far from ideal , but our own system is also far from ideal .
Furthermore , administration attacks on Iran suffer from one additional dose of hypocrisy .
The very same US government which is horrified by the Islamic Republic is simultaneously supporting a variety of nations in the Middle East which are far less democratic than Iran .
Hosni Mubarak , who rules Egypt like an ancient pharaoh , is financed by billions of dollars of American foreign aid .
American allies like the King of Morocco and the Emir of Kuwait are nearly absolute monarchs .
The Bush administration even supports horrific despots like Islam Karimov , the potentate of Uzbekistan ( whose secret police is as brutal as any in the world … including those of Saddam Hussein ) .
How can we attack a semi- democracy like Iran while supporting violent and oppressive puppet - regimes across the breadth of the Middle East ?
This sort of double standard is well - known and much - discussed across the region , and it undermines the credibility of our foreign policy .
My goal is not to sugar - coat the Islamic Republic .
There are numerous aspects of their governance , especially the judiciary and the police , which are undeniably authoritarian .
But how many Americans are aware that women may vote and hold political office in Iran ?
How many Americans are aware that the president of Iran is a reformer who is intensely disliked by the conservative Islamist establishment ?
How many Americans are aware that religious minorities have guaranteed representation in the Iranian parliament , and that Judaism is far more tolerated there than in almost all of the Muslim nations which are currently subsidized as our " allies " ?
How many Americans are aware that there are Christian members of the Iranian parliament , while there are no Muslim members of the American Congress ?
These are facts about which the American public must be made aware before they acquiesce to yet another disastrous " nation building " escapade in the Middle East .
If the neocons elect to attack Iran , they will be once again pouncing on a sovereign nation based on a blatant disregard for international law , our Constitution , and the beliefs of our Founding Fathers .
Their attack will undoubtedly be preceded by a propaganda campaign based on lies , distortions , and fabricated intelligence ( a process that will be enormously facilitated by the new " personnel changes " recently enacted at the CIA and the State Department ) .
While the Islamic Republic has its flaws , it is one of the few governments in the region which is at least partially representative of its people and which has the possibility of peacefully evolving into a more democratic system .
Destroying it will not only blacken our reputation , it will also set back political liberalization in the Middle East for decades .
The Best of Steven LaTulippe
Cuatro semanas antes de la invasión de Irak , que se produjo en la noche del 19 al 20 de marzo de 2003 , George W. Bush mantenía en público su exigencia a Sadam Hussein en los siguientes términos : desarme o guerra .
A puerta cerrada , Bush reconocía que la guerra era inevitable .
Durante una larga conversación privada con el entonces presidente español , José María Aznar , celebrada el sábado 22 de febrero de 2003 en el rancho de Crawford , Tejas , Bush dejó claro que había llegado el momento de deshacerse de Sadam .
" Quedan dos semanas .
En dos semanas estaremos militarmente listos .
Estaremos en Bagdad a finales de marzo " , le dijo a Aznar .
[ CONSULTA el acta de la reunión ]
Dentro de este plan , Bush había terminado por aceptar , el 31 de enero de 2003 - tras una entrevista con el primer ministro británico , Tony Blair - , introducir una última maniobra diplomática : la propuesta de una segunda resolución del Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas .
Su objetivo : abrir la puerta legal a la guerra unilateral que EE UU se aprestaba a desencadenar con más de 200.000 soldados preparados en la región para atacar .
Bush era consciente de las dificultades internas de Blair y no desconocía las de Aznar .
Sólo siete días antes de esa reunión en el rancho de Crawford , tres millones de personas se manifestaban en varias ciudades de España contra la guerra inminente .
" Necesitamos que nos ayudéis con nuestra opinión pública " , pide Aznar .
Bush le explica el alcance de la nueva resolución que piensa presentar : " La resolución estará hecha a la medida de lo que pueda ayudarte .
Me da un poco lo mismo el contenido " .
A lo que Aznar responde : " Nos ayudaría ese texto para ser capaces de copatrocinarlo y ser sus coautores y conseguir que mucha gente lo patrocine " .
Aznar , pues , se ofrece a dar cobertura política europea a Bush , en unión con Blair .
El sueño de Aznar de cimentar una relación con EE UU , siguiendo el ejemplo del Reino Unido , estaba a punto de hacerse realidad .
Aznar había viajado el 20 de febrero con su esposa , Ana Botella , a EE UU haciendo una escala en México para persuadir ( infructuosamente ) al presidente Vicente Fox de la necesidad de apoyar a Bush .
El 21 , la pareja , acompañada por los colaboradores del presidente , llegó a Tejas .
Aznar y su esposa se alojaron en la casa de invitados del rancho .
En la reunión del día siguiente , sábado , participaron el presidente Bush , su entonces asesora de Seguridad Nacional , Condoleezza Rice , y el responsable de asuntos europeos del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional , Daniel Fried .
Por su parte , acompañan a Aznar su asesor de política internacional , Alberto Carnero , y el embajador de España en Washington , Javier Rupérez .
Bush y Aznar mantuvieron , como parte del encuentro , una conversación telefónica a cuatro bandas con el primer ministro británico , Tony Blair , y el presidente del Gobierno italiano , Silvio Berlusconi .
El embajador Rupérez tradujo del inglés para Aznar y también del italiano para Condoleezza Rice ; otras dos intérpretes hicieron su trabajo para Bush y sus colaboradores .
Fue Rupérez quien se encargó de elaborar el acta-resumen de la conversación en un memorándum que ha permanecido secreto hasta hoy .
La conversación impresiona por su tono directo , amigable y hasta amenazador , cuando , por ejemplo , se refiere a la necesidad de que países como México , Chile , Angola , Camerún y Rusia , miembros del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU , voten la nueva resolución como una muestra de amistad hacia EE UU o se atengan a las consecuencias .
Se advierte la nula expectativa en el trabajo de los inspectores , cuyo jefe , Hans Blix , había desmontado hacía sólo una semana , el 14 de febrero , los argumentos expuestos por el secretario de Estado norteamericano , Colin Powell , ante el Consejo de Seguridad el 5 de febrero de 2003 , con " datos sólidos " apoyados calurosamente por la ministra de Exteriores española , Ana Palacio .
Unos datos que el propio Powell calificó , más tarde , como un conjunto de falsedades .
El informe de Blix
Según Blix , Irak estaba dando pasos hacia una cooperación activa para resolver los temas de desarme pendientes .
Su tono había sido menos crítico que el de su informe del 27 de enero de 2003 .
" Desde que llegamos a Irak hace tres meses hemos realizado más de 400 inspecciones sin previo aviso en unos 300 lugares .
Hasta ahora , los inspectores no han encontrado ninguna de las armas prohibidas ...
Si Irak se decide a cooperar todavía más estrechamente el periodo de desarme a través de las inspecciones puede todavía ser breve " , señalaba el jefe de inspectores .
El director general del Organismo Internacional de la Energía Atómica ( OIEA ) , Mohamed El Baradei , informó el 14 de febrero de que todavía quedaban por aclarar algunas cuestiones técnicas ; pero , añadió , " no quedan ya problemas de desarme por resolver " .
Según dijo , no se había hallado prueba alguna de que en Irak se estuvieran llevando a cabo actividades nucleares o relativas a la energía nuclear , otro claro mentís de lo que afirmó Powell sobre el programa nuclear iraquí .
Tanto los primeros frutos de la labor de inspección como la finalización de los preparativos de EE UU llevaron a Bush a fijar el comienzo de la operación militar hacia la fecha del 10 de marzo de 2003 , a la cual se añadieron nueve días para obtener la segunda resolución .
El proceso de persuasión moral al cual se abocaron Aznar y Palacio a golpe de teléfono y en reuniones bilaterales no logró reunir más que cuatro votos : los tres promotores y Bulgaria .
Eran necesarios 9 votos .
El fracaso de esta cobertura legal de la guerra inminente llevó a Bush a acordar con Blair y Aznar la celebración , el 16 de marzo de 2003 , de una cumbre en las Islas Azores , lugar sugerido por Aznar como alternativa a las islas Bermudas por una razón que él mismo explicó a Bush : " El solo nombre de esas islas va asociado a una prenda de vestir que no es precisamente la más adecuada para la gravedad del momento en que nos encontramos " .
Allí , ese 16 de marzo , Bush , Blair y Aznar decidieron sustituir al Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas y usurparon sus funciones para declarar por su cuenta y riesgo la guerra contra Irak .
En la mañana del 17 de marzo , el embajador del Reino Unido ante la ONU anunciaba en Nueva York la retirada de la segunda resolución .
Una derrota en la votación hubiera complicado más la carrera hacia la guerra .
EL PAÍS ofrece a sus lectores en exclusiva el acta-resumen de la conversación .
White Phosphorus ( WP )
Israel used White Phosphorus against HAMAS targets in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead in January 2009 .
This violated no international laws or conventions .
White Phosphorus ( WP ) , known as Willy Pete , is used for signaling , screening , and incendiary purposes .
White Phosphorus can be used to destroy the enemy 's equipment or to limit his vision .
It is used against vehicles , petroleum , oils and lubricants ( POL ) and ammunition storage areas , and enemy observers .
WP can be used as an aid in target location and navigation .
It is usually dispersed by explosive munitions .
It can be fired with fuze time to obtain an airburst .
White phosphorus was used most often during World War II in military formulations for smoke screens , marker shells , incendiaries , hand grenades , smoke markers , colored flares , and tracer bullets .
The Battle of Fallujah was conducted from 8 to 20 November 2004 with the last fire mission on 17 November .
The battle was fought by an Army , Marine and Iraqi force of about 15,000 under the I Marine Expeditionary Force ( IMEF ) .
US forces found WP to be useful in the Battle of Fallujah .
" WP proved to be an effective and versatile munition .
We used it for screening missions at two breeches and , later in the fight , as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes when we could not get effects on them with HE .
We fired " shake and bake " missions at the insurgents , using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out .
...
We used improved WP for screening missions when HC smoke would have been more effective and saved our WP for lethal missions . "
White phosphorus is not banned by any treaty to which the United States is a signatory .
Smokes and obscurants comprise a category of materials that are not used militarily as direct chemical agents .
The United States retains its ability to employ incendiaries to hold high - priority military targets at risk in a manner consistent with the principle of proportionality that governs the use of all weapons under existing law .
The use of white phosphorus or fuel air explosives are not prohibited or restricted by Protocol III of the Certain Conventional Weapons Convention ( CCWC ) , the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects , which regulates the use of " any weapon or munition which is primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to persons . . . "
White Phosphorus ( WP ) - Incendiary
WP is a colorless to yellow translucent wax - like substance with a pungent , garlic - like smell .
The form used by the military is highly energetic ( active ) and ignites once it is exposed to oxygen .
White phosphorus is a pyrophoric material , that is , it is spontaneously flammable ) .
When exposed to air , it spontaneously ignites and is oxidized rapidly to phosphorus pentoxide .
Such heat is produced by this reaction that the element bursts into a yellow flame and produces a dense white smoke .
Phosphorus also becomes luminous in the dark , and this property is conveyed to " tracer bullets . "
This chemical reaction continues until either all the material is consumed or the element is deprived of oxygen .
Up to 15 percent of the WP remains within the charred wedge and can reignite if the felt is crushed and the unburned WP is exposed to the atmosphere .
White phosphorus results in painful chemical burn injuries .
The resultant burn typically appears as a necrotic area with a yellowish color and characteristic garliclike odor .
White phosphorus is highly lipid soluble and as such , is believed to have rapid dermal penetration once particles are embedded under the skin .
Because of its enhanced lipid solubility , many have believed that these injuries result in delayed wound healing .
This has not been well studied ; therefore , all that can be stated is that white phosphorus burns represent a small subsegment of chemical burns , all of which typically result in delayed wound healing .
Incandescent particles of WP may produce extensive burns .
Phosphorus burns on the skin are deep and painful ; a firm eschar is produced and is surrounded by vesiculation .
The burns usually are multiple , deep , and variable in size .
The solid in the eye produces severe injury .
The particles continue to burn unless deprived of atmospheric oxygen .
Contact with these particles can cause local burns .
These weapons are particularly nasty because white phosphorus continues to burn until it disappears .
If service members are hit by pieces of white phosphorus , it could burn right down to the bone .
Burns usually are limited to areas of exposed skin ( upper extremities , face ) .
Burns frequently are second and third degree because of the rapid ignition and highly lipophilic properties of white phosphorus .
If burning particles of WP strike and stick to the clothing , take off the contaminated clothing quickly before the WP burns through to the skin .
Remove quickly all clothing affected by phosphorus to prevent phosphorus burning through to skin .
If this is impossible , plunge skin or clothing affected by phosphorus in cold water or moisten strongly to extinguish or prevent fire .
Then immediately remove affected clothing and rinse affected skin areas with cold sodium bicarbonate solution or with cold water .
Moisten skin and remove visible phosphorus ( preferably under water ) with squared object ( knife - back etc. ) or tweezers .
Do not touch phosphorus with fingers !
Throw removed phosphorus or clothing affected by phosphorus into water or allow to burn in suitable location .
Cover phosphorus burns with moist dressing and keep moist to prevent renewed inflammation .
It is neccessary to dress white phosphorus - injured patients with saline - soaked dressings to prevent reignition of the phosphorus by contact with the air .
Some nations recommend washing the skin with a 0.5 - 2.0 % copper sulphate solution or a copper sulphate impregnated pad .
Wounds may be rinsed with a 0.1 % - 0.2 % copper sulphate solution , if available .
Dark coloured deposits may be removed with forceps .
Prevent prolonged contact of any copper sulphate preparations with the tissues by prompt , copious flushing with water or saline , as there is a definite danger of copper poisoning .
It may be necessary to repeat the first aid measures to completely remove all phosphorus .
White Phosphorus ( WP ) - Smoke
White Phosphorus ( WP ) creates a smoke screen as it burns .
Phosphorus smokes are generated by a variety of munitions .
Some of these munitions such as the M825 ( 155 - mm round ) may , on explosion , distribute particles of incompletely oxidized white phosphorus .
Smokes obscure vision and are used to hide troops , equipment , and areas from detection .
Smoke screens are essential for movement in city fighting .
In the December 1994 battle for Grozny in Chechnya , every fourth or fifth Russian artillery or mortar round fired was a smoke or white phosphorus round .
White Phosphorus and Red Phosphorus burn to produce a hygroscopic smoke containing phosphoric acids .
Red phosphorus ( RP ) is not nearly as reactive as white phosphorus .
It reacts slowly with atmospheric moisture and the smoke does not produce thermal injury , hence the smoke is less toxic .
The extinction for these smokes is primarily due to scattering in the visible and absorption in the infrared ( IR ) .
These smokes are composed of spherical liquid particles that grow with relative humidity to an equilibrium size by absorbing ambient moisture that depends on the ambient relative humidity .
The mass extinction varies significantly with relative humidity .
The White Phosphorus flame produces a hot , dense white smoke composed of particles of phosphorus pentoxide , which are converted by moist air into phosphoric acid .
This acid , depending on concentration and duration of exposure , may produce a variety of topically irritative injuries .
Most smokes are not hazardous in concentrations which are useful for obscuring purposes .
However , any smoke can be hazardous to health if the concentration is sufficient or if the exposure is long enough .
Medical personnel should be prepared to treat potential reactions to military smokes once such smokes have been introduced to the battlefield .
Exposure to heavy smoke concentrations for extended periods ( particularly if near the source of emission ) may cause illness or even death .
Casualties from WP smoke have not occurred in combat operations .
At room temperature , white phosphorus is somewhat volatile and may produce a toxic inhalational injury .
In moist air , the phosphorus pentoxide produces phosphoric acid .
This acid , depending on concentration and duration of exposure , may produce a variety of topically irritative injuries .
Irritation of the eyes and irritation of the mucous membranes are the most commonly seen injuries .
These complaints remit spontaneously with the soldier 's removal from the exposure site .
With intense exposures , a very explosive cough may occur , which renders gas mask adjustment difficult .
There are no reported deaths resulting from exposure to phosphorus smokes .
Generally , treatment of WP smoke irritation is unnecessary .
Spontaneous recovery is rapid .
White phosphorus fume can cause severe eye irritation with blepharospasm , photophobia , and lacrimation .
Irritation of the eyes and irritation of the mucous membranes are the most commonly seen injuries .
These complaints remit spontaneously with the soldier 's removal from the exposure site .
The WP smoke irritates the eyes and nose in moderate concentrations .
With intense exposures , a very explosive cough may occur , which renders gas mask adjustment difficult .
There are no reported deaths resulting from exposure to phosphorus smokes .
White Phosphorus - Non-Military Applications
The amazing thing is that White Phosphorus is used in almost every product imaginable - from soft drinks to toothpaste .
White phosphorus is used by industry to produce phosphoric acid and other chemicals for use in fertilizers , food additives , and cleaning compounds .
Small amounts of white phosphorus were used in the past in pesticides and fireworks .
In recent years , concentrated phosphoric acids , which may contain as much as 70 % to 75 % P2O5 content , have become of great importance to agriculture and farm production .
World - wide demand for fertilizers has caused record phosphate production .
Phosphates are used in the production of special glasses , such as those used for sodium lamps .
Bone -ash , calcium phosphate , is used to create fine chinaware and to produce mono - calcium phosphate , used in baking powder .
Phosphorus is also important in the production of steels , phosphor bronze , and many other products .
Trisodium phosphate is important as a cleaning agent , as a water softener , and for preventing boiler scale and corrosion of pipes and boiler tubes .
The Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) , and numerous state / local law enforcement authorities throughout the United States , have noted an alarming trend involving illicit methamphetamine production .
Methamphetamine ( AKA speed , crank or meth ) is a major drug problem in the United States .
All businesses engaged in the sale of red phosphorus , white phosphorus and hypophosphorous acid products should be aware of the use of these products by clandestine methamphetamine laboratory operators .
White Phosphorus - Background
Phosphorus is an element , the name derived from the Greek " phosphoros " or light bearing , the ancient name for the planet Venus when appearing before sunrise .
Brand discovered phosphorus in 1669 by preparing it from urine .
Phosphorus exists in four or more allotropic forms : white ( or yellow ) , red , and black ( or violet ) .
Ordinary phosphorus is a waxy white solid ; when pure it is colorless and transparent .
White phosphorus has two modifications : alpha and beta with a transition temperature at - 3.8 oC .
It is insoluble in water , but soluble in carbon disulfide .
Never found free in nature , Phosphorus is widely distributed in combination with minerals .
Phosphate rock , which contains the mineral apatite , an impure tri-calcium phosphate , is an important source of the element .
Large deposits are found in Russia , in Morocco , and in Florida , Tennessee , Utah , Idaho , and elsewhere .
White phosphorus may be made by several methods .
By one process , tri-calcium phosphate , the essential ingredient of phosphate rock , is heated in the presence of carbon and silica in an electric furnace or fuelfired furnace .
Elementary phosphorus is liberated as vapor and may be collected under phosphoric acid , an important compound in making super - phosphate fertilizers .
White Phosphorus ( WP ) - Other Health Effects
Systemic toxicity may occur if therapy is not administered .
Therapy consists of topical use of a bicarbonate solution to neutralize phosphoric acids and mechanical removal and debridement of particles .
A Wood 's lamp in a darkened room may help to identify remaining luminescent particles .
The early signs of systemic intoxication by phosphorus are abdominal pain , jaundice , and a garlic odor of the breath ; prolonged intake may cause anemia , as well as cachexia and necrosis of bone , involving typically the maxilla and mandible ( phossy jaw ) .
Prolonged absorption of phosphorus causes necrosis of bones .
It is a hepatotoxin .
The presenting complaints of overexposed workers may be toothache and excessive salivation .
There may be a dull red appearance of the oral mucosa .
One or more teeth may loosen , with subsequent pain and swelling of the jaw ; healing may be delayed following dental procedures such as extractions ; with necrosis of bone , a sequestrum may develop with sinus tract formation .
In a series of 10 cases , the shortest period of exposure to phosphorus fume ( concentrations not measured ) that led to bone necrosis was 10 months ( two cases ) , and the longest period of exposure was 18 years .
Signs and symptoms include irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract ; abdominal pain , nausea , and jaundice ; anemia , cachexia , pain , and loosening of teeth , excessive salivation , and pain and swelling of the jaw ; skin and eye burns .
Phossy jaw must be differentiated from other forms of osteomyelitis .
With phossy jaw , a sequestrum forms in the bone and is released from weeks to months later ; the sequestra are light in weight , yellow to brown , osteoporotic , and decalcified , whereas sequestra from acute staphylococcal osteomyelitis are sharp , white spicules of bone , dense and well calcified .
In acute staphylococcal osteomyelitis , the radiographic picture changes rapidly and closely follows the clinical course , but with phossy jaw the diagnosis sometimes is clinically obvious before radiological changes are discernible .
It is good dental practice to take routine X - ray films of jaws , but experience indicates that necrosis can occur in the absence of any pathology that is visible on the roentgenogram .

The other men in the crowd had their eyes glued to the cricket .
But Chelsy Davy proved enough of a distraction to take Prince Harry 's eye off the ball .
The young royal and his girlfriend appeared more interested in each other than in England 's crucial World Cup match against Australia in Antigua .
While romantic observers mused that their behaviour was an indication of the depth of their love , the more down - to - earth members of Harry 's circle favoured the explanation that cricket is not really his game .
He always was more of a rugby man .
Scroll down for more ...
Either way , it is clear the couple are enjoying their three - week jaunt in the Caribbean in advance of the prince 's deployment to Iraq as a troop commander with the Blues and Royals .
They spent their first week lazing around in the sun , smoking heavily and drinking Planters Punch in the exclusive Barbados resort of Glitter Bay , where they are sharing a private condominium .
Yesterday they roused themselves from their sun loungers to hop on to a private
plane to nearby Antigua .
Accompanied by two Scotland Yard protection officers and Zimbabwean - born Chelsy 's brother , Shaun , the couple took their places in the stands without any fanfare .
Harry , 22 , his arm slung around his girlfriend 's shoulders , wore a striped polo shirt and sunglasses while Chelsy , 21 , looked stunning in a green and white striped vest top and minuscule denim skirt .
The prince does appear to be picking up the cricket bug .
Thanks to a close friend who is working for the World Cup security team , he and Chelsy also plan to attend England 's match against Bangladesh in
Barbados on Wednesday .
In recent days they have also been spending time with television presenter Jeremy Clarkson , who is holidaying with his family on the island 's nearby Coral Reef resort .
On Wednesday Harry and the Top Gear star went fishing together before enjoying a long lunch followed by a game of tennis doubles .
On Friday night they dined together at the exclusive beachside Fishpot restaurant , a favourite of other celebrity holidaymakers including Sir Cliff Richard , Cilla Black and Tony Blair .
Unusually for Harry , who was recently photographed sprawled in the gutter outside a London nightclub , he and his girlfriend have been trying to keep a low profile .
Scroll down for more ...
One holidaymaker said : ' They are making a concerted effort not to even be seen together , but everyone knows who they are .
Harry was in the pool when he was mobbed by children screaming " Prince Harry " .
He jumped out without saying a word looking embarrassed , although Chelsy smiled and said hello . '
The prince has been wearing a pair of bright red Baywatch - style shorts that almost match his sunburned cheeks .
Bronzed Chelsy has turned heads in a blue and white polka - dot bikini .
The couple will return to England in two weeks when they plan to throw a going - away party for Harry before his six - month tour of duty in Iraq .
I ’ve been putting off my second attempt at this essay for awhile .
But recently I came across a YouTube video of Linus Torvalds explaining his Git version control system at a Google Tech Talk .
It ’s kinda funny because Linus likes to use a lot of tongue - in - cheek hyperbole .
He called the CVS the devil , Subversion developers morons , and had some fun banter with Google engineers who use the centralized model in Perforce which he insisted can never work as well as a distributed model .
I ’ve tried and failed to explain to the world what is special about Git .
I was encouraged to see Linus himself have some trouble also .
It ’s not that I ’m a failure , this thing is just hard .
But it is n’t so different from a lot of other hard to explain things .
Say you just learned Ruby on Rails , you made your first little Rails website in record time , and you ’ve just got to tell your co-workers about this fantastic Ruby thing .
While you wait for Eclipse to start , it looks a lot less shiny today , you head over to the break room and attack your first target coworker .
And as you launch into your first explanation to the incredulous , words fail you .
How do you explain to the newly hired former J2EE consultant that not having config files and hard coding everything using a special convention is more flexible ?
Words fail because you sort of have to have been there and consumed enough kool - aid to see where these nut jobs were coming from .
And they were right !
Dead right !
How do you explain enlightenment ?
Maybe you just learned Erlang and it ’s your new hammer .
Ready to convince your boss to let you try it in anger ?
It ’s hard to explain to somebody what a fun party it was because , well , if they were n’t there , they were n’t there .
And if they were n’t there , they did n’t experience first hand all that fun .
No enlightenment for them .
But I ’ll try again .
My first attempt failed , but I think I ’ve learned better this time .
First I want to talk about SpongeBob .
There ’s this episode of SpongeBob where his boss makes he and Squidward work 24 hour shifts at the fast food joint .
SpongeBob ca n’t get enough of being a fry cook and pesters Squidward mercilessly for the whole night .
“ Hey Squidward , I ’m cleaning the bathroom … at night ! ” “ Hey Squidward , I ’m polishing the tables … at night ! ”
Or whatever .
And how many times have we seen some stupid blog meme like this : “ Hey Internet !
It ’s Ruby program for … the Y combinator ! ” “ Hey Internet !
It ’s a Perl program for … the Y combinator ! ”
Or maybe it ’s a language : “ Hey everyone , it ’s a wiki … in Haskell !
It ’s a weblog .. in Haskell !
It ’s a stupid blog post … about Haskell ! ”
Or the much maligned : “ Hey Internet !
It ’s a scheme implementation of … FizzBuzz ! ” “ Hey Internet !
It ’s full J2EE stack implementation of … FizzBuzz ! ”
All these little toys flying around the Internet , and here ’s where I try to get back on track .
I ’ve heard some folks cursing the fact that so much energy is being wasted on mere toys , when we could try and get some real work done .
I think something was lost with CVS and Subversion .
Torvalds points out that in his not so humble opinion , CVS and Subversion are inferior to just passing around patches and tarballs .
And here he is n’t being tongue - in - cheek .
He really means that .
How could that be ?
When all you have is a mailing list and patches , even the core developers of a project have to communicate their code on a mailing list , and in little mail sized bits .
What ’s outrageously cool about the whole thing , is real work degenerates into little memes .
“ Hey look at this patch , it ’s a new filesystem that twice as fast as the old one ! ” ( see series of 6 patches )
“ Hey , I increased your performance by 10 % with this modification . ”
( Patch sent in reply to patch 2 )
“ Hey , that ’s cool , but you missed a case and could corrupt unless you handle this . ”
( Patch sent in reply to patch 5 . )
What I ’m getting at is it ’s that silly SpongeBob , “ Hey Squidward ! ” behavior , but it gets real work done .
Where CVS and Subversion go wrong is that they make it convenient for core developers to skip that step .
The core developers lose out on code review , and more importantly , on that stupid code banter .
Stupid code banter is a fundamental human need .
Why would sane people post FizzBuzz implementations on the intarweb ?
Because code banter is required for human sanity .
Once CVS and Subversion got popular everyone forgot the natrual way to bat code around , and had to turn to artificial drugs , Y and FizzBuzz .
Git comes from this guy and his friends who , in their isolated kernel world , never forgot about the fun of batting code around , and how you can harness it to get real work done .
They saw early on that it ’s 10 times more fun to review code before the flaws are petrified in in a subversion trunk .
That ’s the real lesson .
… in my not - so humble opinion .
Barely sane people deprived of natural cleansing code banter .
What one example of real code banter looks like .
Another one , showing you do n’t have to always mean it .
Notice it ’s “ untested . ”
Now , does n’t that look more fun than fizzbuzz ?

I 've previously mentioned our semi-thriving Facebook Group .
On the group 's Wall , a reader named Blake wrote this question :
" Hey all you knowledge junkies , I just had a question that I thought might receive some informed answers here .
Do congenitally blind persons dream ?
And if so , what do those dreams consist of ?
I know the easiest means to find out would be to ask a blind person , but my lack of blind acquaintances inhibits that solution .
THANKS . "
I found a 1999 study titled " The Dreams of Blind Men and Women : A Replication and Extension of Previous Findings , " attributed to Craig Hurovitz , Sarah Dunn , G. William Domhoff and Harry Fiss .
Here 's an excerpt from the abstract :
" Drawing on a sample of 372 dreams from 15 blind adults , this paper ... revealed that those blind since birth or very early childhood had ( 1 ) no visual imagery and ( 2 ) a very high percentage of gustatory , olfactory , and tactual sensory references . "
There are probably other studies with differing abstracts .
So let 's open this up to the blind community .
If we have any blind folks in the audience , or if you have a blind person in your house , let us know whether these findings ring true .
We 'll also accept insight from the simply smart and sighted community .
Here 's how to use the new Fiber class ( warning : class name may change ) to generate an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers .
I use " generate " in the sense of Python 's generators .
Ruby 's new fibers are " semi-coroutines " .
1 fib = Fiber.new do
2 x , y = 0 , 1
3 loop do
4 Fiber.yield y
5 x , y = y , x+y
6 end
7 end
8 20 .times { puts fib.resume }

A fiber is a unit of execution that must be manually scheduled by the application .
Fibers run in the context of the threads that schedule them .
Each thread can schedule multiple fibers .
In general , fibers do not provide advantages over a well - designed multithreaded application .
However , using fibers can make it easier to port applications that were designed to schedule their own threads .

These method names ( resume / yield ) are from Lua. " transfer " is from Modula - 2. " double resume error " is from Python 's generator .
BTW , I 'm thinking about name " Fiber " .
Current Fiber means Semi-Coroutine .
Fiber : : Core is Coroutine .
Yes , name of Fiber is from Microsoft , but it 's means Semi-Coroutine such as Lua 's coroutine and Python 's generator .
Semi-Coroutines

Coroutine ( Fiber : : Core )
It is still hot topic among core developers .
But fibers ( and external iterators ) are likely to remain in the final 1.9 , more likely than continuations .
lightweight concurrency
In modern concurrency settings they [ Fibers ] are becoming increasingly useful , however .
Without them , or something like them ( e.g. Rubinius Tasks ) , you must play some very ugly games to get lightweight concurrency -- see the use of explicit continuation - passing ( functions , not Continuations ) in Scala 's actors library for an example of the best that can be hoped for in their absence .
Granted , Fibers will make things harder for JRuby
A Behind - The - Scenes Look At How DRM Becomes Law
Cory Doctorow looks at the back room dealing that allowed entertainment companies and electronics companies to craft public policy on digital rights management .
Otto von Bismarck quipped , " Laws are like sausages , it is better not to see them being made . "
I 've seen sausages made .
I 've seen laws made .
Both processes are pleasant in comparison to the way anti-copying technology agreements are made .
This technology , usually called " Digital Rights Management " ( DRM ) proposes to make it hard for your computer to copy some files .
Because all computer operations involve copying , this is a daunting task -- as security expert Bruce Schneier has said , " Making bits harder to copy is like making water that 's less wet . "
At root , DRMs are technologies that treat the owner of a computer or other device as an attacker , someone against whom the system must be armored .
Like the electrical meter on the side of your house , a DRM is a technology that you possess , but that you are never supposed to be able to manipulate or modify .
Unlike the your meter , though , a DRM that is defeated in one place is defeated in all places , nearly simultaneously .
That is to say , once someone takes the DRM off a song or movie or e-book , that freed collection of bits can be sent to anyone else , anywhere the network reaches , in an eyeblink .
DRM crackers need cunning : those who receive the fruits of their labor need only know how to download files from the Internet .
Why manufacture a device that attacks its owner ?
One would assume that such a device would cost more to make than a friendlier one , and that customers would prefer not to buy devices that treat them as presumptive criminals .
DRM technologies limit more than copying : they limit uses , such as viewing a movie in a different country , copying a song to a different manufacturer 's player , or even pausing a movie for too long .
Surely , this stuff hurts sales :
Who goes into a store and asks , " Do you have any music that 's locked to just one company 's player ?
I 'm in the market for some lock - in . "
The entertainment industry gets electronics companies to go along with DRM through a combination of rewards and threats .
The reward is the entertainment industries ' promise of access to their copyrighted works .
Add DRM to your iPhone and we 'll supply music for it .
Add DRM to your TiVo and we 'll let you plug it into our satellite receivers .
Add DRM to your Zune and we 'll let you retail our music in your Zune store .
And the entertainment industry threatens to sue companies that do n't comply .
In recent years , entertainment companies fought over the creation of records , radios , jukeboxes , cable TV , VCRs , MP3 players and other technologies that made it possible to experience a copyrighted work without the entertainment companies ' permission .

They are just lines on a graph , but for many subway riders they will provide unique insight into one of the great aggravations of life underground : why trains on some lines are so often both crowded and late , while on other lines the trains seem to cruise along on schedule with almost no one on board .
In an unusually candid effort at self - examination for a habitually insular agency , New York City Transit yesterday presented what could be called an index of straphanger frustration .
It made an analysis of each subway line that shows at a glance how often trains run late , how crowded they are and whether more trains could be added to ease the problems .
What is revealed is both predictable and eye - opening .
Many subway lines are simply maxed out , meaning there is no room on the tracks they use to add trains that could carry the swelling numbers of riders .
And that has implications that range from day - to - day decisions about how trains travel through the system to long - term planning on how to best move people around a growing city .
“ From my point of view , this is scary , ” said Howard H. Roberts Jr. , the president of New York City Transit , who presented the data to members of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ’s board .
“ This is scary in the sense that right now , on a lot of these lines , we ’re several years and a big capital construction project away from being able to provide what I consider adequate service .
We ’re constrained . ”

A growing number of shopping malls are turning away teenagers during evening hours unless they 're accompanied by adults .
Restrictions at some malls apply every night , others on Fridays and Saturdays .
Hours and ages vary .
The rules are meant to reduce fighting and ensure that adults and families do n't avoid malls where rowdy teenagers take over stores , corridors and food courts .
The Mall of America in Bloomington , Minn. , was the first U.S. mall to create an " escort policy " in 1996 , says the International Council of Shopping Centers .
The idea has caught on : 39 malls now have limits on teenagers .
Fifteen implemented such policies in the past two years and dozens more are considering them .
There are 1,104 enclosed malls in the USA .
Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa , Wis. , has n't worked out details yet , but it will implement an adult - escort policy this spring following recent disturbances involving teenagers .
" We felt like strong and decisive action was necessary , and we 're taking it , " says Kirk Ballard , spokesman for General Growth Properties , owner of Mayfair and 209 other malls .
Columbia Mall in Columbia , Mo. , and Capital Mall in Jefferson City , Mo. , began restricting teens in February .
Saint Louis Galleria is considering doing the same .
In November , a food - court dispute resulted in arrests of four adults and five juveniles .
Malls with the policies say they reduce disruptive conduct and improve stores ' profits : • Fairlane Town Center in Dearborn , Mich. , has required visitors under 18 to be accompanied by an adult after 5 p.m. every day since 2004 .
Sales increased , and loitering and retail fraud have been cut in half , manager Cathy O'Malley says .
" It really is a safety issue . " • Metrocenter Mall in Jackson , Miss. , requires customers younger than 17 to be with an adult Fridays and Saturdays starting at 3 p.m .
Teenagers sometimes " get a little miffed , " says marketing manager Sharee Lucius , but " it was really just out of control on the weekends . "
• In 1995 , the Mall of America had more than 300 incidents such as fights , says spokeswoman Anna Lewicki Long .
In the first year teens under 16 were required to be with an adult starting at 4 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays , there were two .
" It was n't just adults being intimidated , it was teens , " she says .
The change did n't drive teens away :
The number of stores catering to them has doubled to more than 75 .
• At Oglethorpe Mall in Savannah , Ga. , restrictions on teens started in 1997 .
The year before the policy , 1,600 teens 16 and younger were banned for inappropriate conduct , Ballard says .
In the first full year of the policy , 12 were banned .
O'Malley says educating teens and their parents is the key to avoiding controversy .
Mall staff met with mayors , school boards and cultural groups and provided sensitivity training for security officers .
Twenty malls considering similar policies have asked O'Malley for guidance .
It works so well at her mall , she says , " We do n't even have to check IDs anymore . "

Three years ago I dropped out of being a paid - employee and switched to being a consultant .
I ’ve had a number of people ask about my experiences as they ’re interested in following a similar route .
I ’m going to write a short set of posts on the subject and I welcome questions .
Articles : Introduction , Successful Freelancing , Talking to People , Making a Sales Call , Books and Resources .
First I should set the scene .
Why did I quit my job ?
For five years I worked at the MASA Group developing A.I. software for ‘ big industry ’ .
Our company sat outside of the dot - com boom and bust , none of our products were associated with the web .
I was well - placed in the UK office as Senior Programmer and I ran projects between the UK and French offices , met clients and planned the technical future of our operations .
Life was fun .
I had however always wanted to be my own boss …
During the last year of my employment the company changed direction and the UK office was bought - out by my direct boss – the new focus was n’t so much fun for me .
The company had a tricky time figuring out who it serviced and what it offered and after a year I chose to resign and start my own consultancy .
The move was somewhat risky as I had no prior experience at being a contractor , no track record for agencies and no private client list for consulting work .
I took out a Â £ 7,000 loan – enough to cover several months worth of mortgage payments , and resigned .
I had no savings as I ’d just bought my first property .
Lesson – you need several months worth of living expenses if you ’re going to switch to selling your skills .
You either want money put aside or a loan which you ’ll need to repay .
I opted for a 7 year repayment term to give myself plenty of room ( I repaid the loan inside of 2 years ) .
Freelancing as a Consultant A.I. Researcher
I founded Mor Consulting Ltd. in 2004 as a 1 - man company .
I needed a limited company as some of my consultancy clients would only want to bill to a Ltd. company rather than a sole - tradership .
Founding the company cost Â£ 250 via an accountant , for note my yearly accountancy fees are roughly Â£ 500 ( paid after year - end accounts are completed ) .
My accountant ( Bristow Still ) made the process super - simple , I had no prior experience in founding a company yet the process was painless and completed in a few weeks with just a few things to sign .
Having an account in the same town as you is convenient – visiting them to ask questions and sign forms makes life easy .
Spreading your Name ( Marketing ! )
The hardest things I found were the fact that nobody knew that I was :
Available Skilled in certain niches ( programming , artificial intelligence , leadership )
The solution was to talk to all of my friends and past associates and let them know about my change in status , my new availability and what I ’d be interested in doing .
Each email was hand - crafted , targeted towards their business ( for past associates ) and personal .
Never spam your friends .
The response was very helpful and quickly I was offered various pieces of generic contract programming work , often for short term jobs ( 1 - 2 months each ) , all local to Brighton .
The Sussex Innovation Centre is a great example of a useful hub – 70 tech companies , all small , most hungry for extra resources .
You can visit lots of related companies and obtain friendly referrals with a minimum of effort – maximising your ability to search for new work .
Spreading your name and skills around is likely to be the most important thing that you do whilst you get established ( which could take a year ) .
It is also the most time - costly – I spent 2 months spreading word around before interesting A.I. - related things came my way .
At first I had to be liberal in what I accepted – anything coding related that paid the bills was useful .
Quickly I worked to accept only A.I. - related work as that would help to build my reputation , from there I never looked back .
Right now I ’m going through a similar exercise with my second start - up and our new professional screencasting arm , a new part of business inside ShowMeDo .
What do you want to know ?
If you ’ve read this far then you probably have specific questions in mind .
Do leave me a comment , I ’m interested in answering questions .

Italian prisons hold hundreds of people serving life sentences
Their request was published as a letter in the daily newspaper La Repubblica .
Italy has almost 1,300 prisoners serving life terms , of whom 200 have served more than 20 years .
Italy has been at the forefront of the fight against capital punishment and recently lobbied the UN Security Council to table a moratorium on it .
But at home some of the country 's longest serving prisoners want the death penalty re-introduced .
' Light into shadows '
The letter they sent to President Napolitano came from a convicted mobster , Carmelo Musumeci , a 52 - year - old who has been in prison for 17 years .
It was co-signed by 310 of his fellow lifers .
Musumeci said he was tired of dying a little bit every day .
We want to die just once , he said , and " we are asking for our life sentence to be changed to a death sentence " .
It was a candid letter written by a man who , from within his cell , has tried hard to change his life .
He has passed his high school exams and now has a degree in law .
But his sentence , he says , has transformed the light into shadows .
He told the president his future was the same as his past , killing the present and removing every hope .
' Need for change '
Italy abolished the death penalty after World War II .
Under current laws , prisoners serving life can obtain the right to brief periods of release after 10 years and conditional release after 26 years of good conduct .
The Communist Refoundation party 's senator , Maria Luisa Boccia , has proposed draft legislation to abolish the life sentence and replace it with a maximum sentence of 30 years .
The president has spoken many times about the need to change the sentencing regime .
But in his response to the letter , he said it was now for parliament and the government to deal with the prisoners ' request .
ESSEN , Germany ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush ’s plan to combat climate change got a cool reception on Friday in Europe , where the European Union ’s environment chief dismissed it as unambitious and the “ classic ” U.S. line .
Bush , under pressure to do more ahead of a summit in Germany next week of the Group of Eight industrial nations , said on Thursday that he would seek a deal among top emitters on long - term cuts in greenhouse gases by the end of 2008 .
“ The declaration by President Bush basically restates the U.S. classic line on climate change -- no mandatory reductions , no carbon trading and vaguely expressed objectives , ” EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas said , according to his spokeswoman .
“ The U.S. approach has proven to be ineffective in reducing emissions , ” Dimas said .
Bush called for a long - term deal on cuts among 15 top emitters led by the United States , China , Russia and India , a shift from an existing U.S. policy lasting to 2012 that will allow U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to rise .
German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel , whose country holds the rotating EU presidency , said Bush ’s announcement could be seen as progress only if it prepared the way for a United Nations pact to extend the Kyoto Protocol past 2012 .
“ If it is an attempt to hamper such an international climate change agreement , then it is dangerous , ” he told reporters .
“ The European Union and also the G8 should not be content with initiating a process that just means that we ’ll have some vague agreements between 10 or 15 countries in the world . ”
G8 DEFEAT FOR MERKEL ?
Some newspapers portrayed Bush ’s plan as a defeat for German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who wants the G8 to agree now on a need for world cuts of about 50 percent in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 .
“ One of the customs at G8 summits is that the other participants grant the host a success on their big issue , ” the Financial Times Deutschland said in an editorial .
“ The fact that Bush has not kept to this is an affront , and he ’s made Merkel ’s defeat even worse , ” it said .
The Guardian said “ Bush kills off hopes for G8 climate change plan . ”
In Washington , a senior White House official insisted Bush ’s proposal was aimed at helping to find a consensus and was no way an effort to upstage Merkel ’s efforts .
“ It is not a competitor to anybody ’s proposal .
It is an effort to make a contribution to an ongoing dialogue , ” said Stephen Hadley , Bush ’s top national security adviser .
“ The president thought it would be better for him to lay it out before the G - 8 meeting so people can think about it , ” Hadley said , adding that he had spoken to his G8 counterparts before Bush ’s speech and that Bush and Merkel spoke via videoconference about it on Friday .
Merkel ’s spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm said it was too early to predict the outcome of the G8 .
“ I think we can say at this stage that it ’s going to be tough , that we face very intense discussions , ” he said .
U.N. reports this year have projected ever more heat waves , floods , desertification and rising seas because of rising temperatures linked to greenhouse gases , mainly from fossil fuels .
The EU aims to cut its emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .

Some leaders including Prime Minister Tony Blair , Bush ’s main ally in Iraq , welcomed Bush ’s climate shift .
“ I want to see us now go further from what President Bush has laid out , but let ’s be clear that for the first time we have the possibility of the elements of a global deal , with America behind it , with a target for reduction in greenhouse gases , ” Blair said during a trip to South Africa .
Dimas himself noted that European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and Merkel had emphasised that Bush ’s plan did at least create more chances for dialogue .
Bush said he wanted to convene the biggest polluting nations by the end of the year to explore ways of limiting emissions -- precisely what Merkel had hoped to do in Heiligendamm , to which she has invited non-G8 countries including China and India .
Thirty - five nations , including the EU , back the Kyoto Protocol which obliges an average cut in emissions of five percent below 1990 levels by 2008 - 12 .
Bush decided against implementing Kyoto in 2001 , saying it would cost U.S. jobs and wrongly excluded developing nations .

Like a wave traveling along a string , Alfven waves run along the sun 's magnetic field lines and reach deep into space .
While astrophysicists have identified the waves far away from the sun , they 've never been detected close to our star - the ripples were too small and too fast to spot .
Scientists have detected waves following magnetic lines that radiate from the sun at a velocity of 9 million miles per hour .
From the article
If you could surf this wave and harness its force , at such a speed , it would take only 10 hours to reach the sun from the earth and 1 minute and 45 seconds to reach the moon ; going to Mars from the earth would be about the duration of a flight to Hawaii .
Christened the alfven waves , scientists at the National Solar Observatory 's Sacramento Peak Observatory in New Mexico believe they are the mechanism that transfers energy from the sun to the Corona , or sun 's atmosphere , which heats up to millions of degrees - far hotter than the sun 's surface .

KARACHI , Pakistan , April 15 ( Reuters ) —
Tens of thousands of people rallied Sunday in Pakistan ’s biggest city , Karachi , in opposition to a radical religious school that has begun a Taliban - style anti-vice campaign in the capital , Islamabad .
“ The people of Islamabad are insecure and under threat due to the activities of these religious terrorists , ” said Altaf Hussain , a Pakistani party leader who addressed the rally by telephone from London .
Mr. Hussain , who lives in self - imposed exile in Britain though his party , the Muttahida Qaumi Movement , is in the governing coalition , said the religious extremists in the Lal Masjid , or Red Mosque , in Islamabad and the adjoining madrasa , Jamia Hafsa , had hurt Islam ’s image .
“ Islam is a religion of peace and it does not need Kalashnikovs and sticks , ” he said at the rally , while a helicopter whirled overhead and hundreds of police officers stood by .
If you are worried about your health as you get older , you will often need to consider how to keep track of everything .
It 's not always easy to stay on top of the things that may come along , but there …
This post is by a guest blogger .
I am a scientist .
I come across a lot of engineers .
They are alien life forms , but I have had a symbiotic relationship with them .
I found myself getting confused trying to understand the differences between us , until I realised that behaviour depends on environment .
You can see how we are different in three ways :
general differences in behaviour ,
working on hardware projects ,
and working on software projects
The latter is where it gets weird .
General Behaviour
Left to themselves , scientists are obsessed with truth , and engineers worry only about what works .
Scientists are impractical purists .
Stuff you build — a lab lash up , a sprawling C program — is ragged and messy .
It does n’t matter because you are going to change it soon .
You do n’t stop until you figure out whats really going on .
Engineers are pragmatic .
It does n’t matter whether the theory is actually correct in any deep sense .
They worry and puzzle until they get something that works .
Then they stop , polish , and admire .
I once listened to an engineer talking about grain silos .
He ’d done a simulation showing that when you set it up so and so , and jiggle , the big and little bits segregate .
My brow furrowed , “ Does n’t that seem to violate the second law of thermodynamics ? ”
He stared back blankly .
“ So ? ” , he said .
[ Answers on a ten pound note please ]
Hardware Projects
When it comes to hardware projects the scientist becomes a customer .
The purist / pragmatic hats get swapped from the scientist to the engineer .
I am an astronomer .
Unlike my condensed matter chums , we do n’t potter in the lab .
Our work is done with big instruments on even bigger telescopes , that we share as national or international facilities .
These things are highly engineered machines and they have to work right .
The scientists come up with the concepts – e.g. “ what we need for the next step in big cosmological redshift surveys is a multi - fibre spectrograph , only it has to work in the infrared . ”
Then they work with a team of engineers to design it ; then it actually gets built by engineers , technicians , industrial contracts , etc .
Normally there is a “ Project Scientist ” inside the team who makes sure the engineering group delivers what the scientists wanted .
So essentially s/he is a kind of commissioning customer .
So does this mean the Project Scientist has to stop the engineers from cutting corners ?
It ’s normally the opposite .
The scientist is getting impatient ; he wants his new toy .
It may be the Scientist ’s toy , but its the Engineer ’s baby .
“ Ahh ” , say the engineers , “ we need to do more tests . ”
“ Oh , and wait a minute , if we open up the cryostat and use a different type of wire the read noise should go down . ”
“ Well , ” they say , “ it could pass the CDR we suppose ; but there is a 5 % chance it will fail at altitude .
We should really take it apart and re-align .
We should change the baffling while we are at it … ”
There comes this point in every Project Scientist ’s career where you learn the same lesson that managers learn in industrial teams .
Eventually you have to shoot the engineers and ship the product .
Yell “ enough ! ” and get that f***er up the mountain .
Software Projects
When getting a piece of kit made , the scientist is no longer a purist .
This is n’t her work , it is just something she needs so she can do her work .
For the engineers , when building that piece of kit , this is their work , and they are very proud .
They are still basically practical folk , but the lure of the technically sweet , and their pride in their work , overcomes their judgement .
Now when we come to software projects , the engineers seem to shoot straight past the purist stage and land in a misty realm of philosophy .
I am not talking about normal software development – the code that keeps everyday systems working .
Here the engineers are pretty hard headed and practical .
I am talking about innovative software projects – difficult datamining tools , ambitious grid infrastructures — roughly the software equivalent of building some new type of spectrograph .
Talented software engineers love this stuff .
It ’s even more fun than transaction software for banks .
Already we are in the “ oooh , I could make this even better ” stage .
But it gets worse .
“ Well , ” they say , “ there is whole new technology emerging . ”
( OWL , REST , Web 3.0 , take your pick )
“ We should change the whole architecture and re-engineer .
In fact , ” they say , their eyes glistening , “ when you think about it , it makes you realise there ’s a whole different approach , I mean for users and for us .
It ’s difficult to explain . ” “ but its kinda , well .
Hmm .
I need to think about this . ”
Think ??!!
You ’re not supposed to think !
You ’re supposed to implement !
You ’re an engineer !
But the scientist is hooked as well .
When he wants a piece of hardware , he states what he wants — it needs to do A and B ; it needs to fit next to that other gizmo ; it must n’t flex more than X when its tipped .
Then he crosses his arms and sticks to his guns .
When he wants a new software tool , he is a bit woolier , but he knows all about this iterative development stuff , and expects he will sharpen his requirements as he sees the prototypes emerge .
But he sees the first prototype he says , “ oh , now hang on that gives me an idea .
Nah , we got this all wrong , what we want is more like blah .
In fact , thats really strange , you know , I read this blog the other day , and it made a very interesting point … ”
This is why most software projects fail .
Not because the software industry is incompetent or immature in its methodologies .
Not because software is just too intrinsically hard .
Nope .
They fail because this stuff is just too damned interesting with too many ways to do things and too many things to do .

Tate ( right ) played a blushing bride transported onto the Tardis
She will join David Tennant for the complete 13 - week run of the new series of Doctor Who , which is due to begin filming in Cardiff later this month .
Freema Agyeman , who played the Doctor 's companion Martha Jones in the third series , will return mid-series .
Kylie Minogue will also be starring in this year 's Christmas special .
Tate will be returning to her role as Donna , the runaway bride who found herself transported into the Tardis as she prepared for her wedding on Christmas Eve .
The episode , broadcast on BBC One on Christmas Day , attracted an audience of 9.4 million .
Donna was invited by the Doctor to travel with him at the end of the episode , but the invitation was declined at the time .
We are delighted that one of Britain 's greatest talents has agreed to join us for the fourth series

" I had a blast last Christmas and look forward to travelling again through time and space with that nice man from Gallifrey . "
Agyeman , 28 , is to play Martha Jones in three episodes of spin - off show Torchwood , which producers have said will " expand " her character .
She replaced Billie Piper , who left at the end of the second series .
The fourth series of Doctor Who is due to debut on BBC One in Spring 2008 .
A Christmas special starring David Tennant and Kylie Minogue will be screened on Christmas Day 2007 .
Next week Warren Beatty will turn 70 .
It is an age when traditionally life should be relaxing , reflective and calm .
But it is not panning out that way .
Like millions of other elderly Americans , Beatty is not going gentle into that good night .
In fact he was recently snapped leaving Los Angeles ' notorious nightclub Hyde , a hot spot usually frequented by such youthful tearaways as Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton .
Beatty is the famous face of a social phenomenon sweeping America as its population becomes more and more dominated by the elderly .
A quiet retirement is not for them .
Internet dating website Match.com says its most lucrative demographic is the over - 50s .
It is clearly no longer about a home in Florida , pottering around the garden and a pension plan .
It is now a story of new jobs , increased political power and a devil - may - care attitude to living life however one sees fit .
They are redefining what it means to grow old in America .
The country is undergoing a demographic revolution as it ages and braces itself for the retirement of the postwar baby - boomer generation .
It is a shift that will change the way America works and lives .
The United States is about to become a society that increasingly exists not for the benefit of the young , but for the benefit of the old .
The facts speak for themselves .
The boomers were born between 1946 and 1964 .
There are about 76 million of them and now each day 10,000 boomers hit their 50th birthdays .
The leading edge of the generation has just started turning 61 .
As they grow old they are leaving behind a huge employment gap .
Some firms are facing the retirement of up to 40 per cent of their workforce over the next decade .
Yet the boomers are also creating new ' silver industries ' designed to match their new needs .
Advertisers and marketing firms are scrambling to catch up .
No one quite knows what it all will mean , only that change is coming .
' It is going to change the way we do everything , absolutely everything , ' said Bob Fell , director of strategy and planning at Varsity , a firm that advises companies on how to cope with this brave new Boomer world .
Across every aspect of American society , high - profile elderly people are having the time of their lives .
Keeping Beatty company in Hollywood is Jack Nicholson .
He , too , turns 70 in the next few weeks but has just starred in an Oscar - winning film and still fills the gossip columns by seducing women young enough to be his granddaughter .
It is not just men .
Diane Keaton , 61 , recently spoke of her love life in terms that sound as though they come from a teenager .
' I 'm attracted to men and I love playing around them .
But a life shared together ?
That 's a different world , ' she told More magazine .
The New York Post called her a ' perennial bachelorette ' .
It is not just in entertainment either .
In journalism Barbara Walters still rules the roost at her ABC show , The View .
She is 76 .
In politics Democrat Nancy Pelosi has just become the first female Speaker of Congress .
She is 66 .
On the Republican side of the aisle , John McCain is a front - runner for the 2008 presidential election .
He could easily win the race for the White House and become the most powerful man in the world .
He is 70 years old , and most Americans do not care about his age at all .
In the world of business , men like Viacom 's Sumner Redstone , 83 , run huge corporate empires with the verve of people half their age .
As the elderly grow in numbers and become more powerful , they are changing America in ways that go far beyond just health costs and social security payments .
' The landscape of American society has really changed .
It is a whole new world , ' said Professor Joseph Quinn , an economist at Boston College and author of Economic Implications of an Ageing Society
The elderly in America are now fuelling a housing boom as they seek to buy second homes in warmer climes .
They are increasingly shunning any form of retirement - through need or choice - and taking on second jobs and new careers .
They are flexing their political muscles .
The main group lobbying for the elderly , the American Association of Retired People , is one of the most powerful organisations in the country .
It has 35 million members and an operating budget of $ 800 m ( about £ 408 m ) a year .
Nor is it shy of using its power .
It was instrumental in derailing President George W Bush 's plans for social security reform and spent more than $ 20 m on a campaign to do so .
The reasons for America 's ageing population are simple .
First , despite all the headlines over an obesity crisis , Americans are healthier and longer - lived than at any time in their history .
The second reason is the baby - boomers .
The generational bulge born from the increased birth rate in the two decades after the Second World War is moving through into its twilight years .
That does not just mean an increase in numbers of elderly , however .
It also means a different type of elderly person .
' They do n't want to recognise the fact that they are getting old .
They are going to go down fighting , ' said Fell .
That might explain many of the strange things going on in American life .
The huge popularity of such impotence drugs as Viagra means elderly people can enjoy reinvigorated sex lives .
That in turn might show why plastic surgery for the over - sixties has tripled in recent years .
Meals - on - wheels services are adjusting as the elderly shun old - fashioned meals in favour of muesli , other healthy options and vegetarian foods .
Fell 's company , Varsity , makes a living from telling executives how to change their advertising to target the new elderly .
He recently spoke to casino owners in Las Vegas .
His message : out with the cheap bus tours , in with the razzmatazz and dazzle .
Effectively , they should market to the elderly as they did to the young .
' The extent that they have to change almost shocks them , ' Fell said .
The retirement of the baby boomers could even change something as fundamental as the five - day working week .
As more and more elderly people keep working part - time or seasonally , the average American job could become a three days a week affair or just nine months of the year , allowing an aged employee the chance to still spend the summer months somewhere warm .
' Flexibility of employment will be the key , ' said Quinn .
It could even change the structure of that most American of institutions : the road system .
By 2030 an estimated 70 million US drivers will be over 65 , making up a quarter of all drivers .
Various government studies have pointed to the needs to change intersections and build more roundabouts to cope with the different driving habits of old people .
The age of the boy racer is at an end .
He is being replaced by his grandfather .
There is a downside to all this .
Generations below the baby - boomers simply do not provide enough people to fill all the jobs being created by the American economy .
That ensures that many elderly people will have to keep working whether they choose to or not : society cannot afford to have them retire .
Some experts believe that spiralling social security costs are already completely unsustainable .
Social security and healthcare cost the federal government $ 1.034trn in 2005 , more than twice the defence budget .
By 2030 the costs could be as much as 75 per cent of the entire federal budget .
Yet by 2010 there is expected to be a labour shortage in America of 10 million jobs .
That problem could be filled by immigration .
' We have a safety valve in this country in that folks want to come and live here , ' said Quinn .
But immigration is a hot - button issue and it is far from certain that it is politically feasible to encourage cheap labour to move to the US .
America is already building a wall on its border with Mexico to keep illegal immigrants out .
The other massive problem is the increased health costs and rising numbers of elderly diseases .
Alzheimer 's sufferers alone are rapidly increasing in numbers .
There are five million with Alzheimer 's in America , a rise of 10 per cent from five years ago .
By 2050 that number is expected to triple .
But for the moment many Americans standing on the edge of their elder years are taking a leaf out of Beatty 's book and embracing new opportunities .
Sometimes they are completely unexpected .
Take Jeanie Linders , 58 .
Inspired by the changes her generation of women baby - boomers was going through she began writing a musical based on them .
She called it Menopause : The Musical .
It had its debut in a tiny Florida theatre in 2001 .
Six years later , it is still playing to baby - boomer audiences in their tens of thousands .
It has been staged in 18 different US cities and nine different countries .
Next week it has its premiere in London .
Linders sees it as an example of continuing Boomer success and is adamant that ageing members of that generation are going to revolutionise America .
' We are blazing a new path .
Women and men of my generation are reinventing themselves .
We do not feel old .
We do n't know what old means , ' she said .

· In 2007 , 4.6 Americans turned 65 every minute .
By 2025 it will be eight every minute
· In 1980 , Americans over 50 years old comprised 25 per cent of the population .
By 2050 they will make up around 37 per cent
· There are 76 million ' baby boomers ' in America , those who were born between 1946 and 1964 .
They started turning 61 last year
· As fewer young workers enter the US workforce , there will be a labour shortage of 5 million people by 2010
It is as though I ’m back as an analyst at the CIA , trying to estimate the chances of an attack on Iran .
The putative attacker , though , happens to be our own president .
It is precisely the work we analysts used to do .
And , while it is still a bit jarring to be turning our analytical tools on the U.S. leadership , it is by no means entirely new .
For , of necessity , we Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ( VIPS ) have been doing that for almost six years now  ever since 9/11 , when " everything changed . "
Of necessity ?
Yes , because , with very few exceptions , American journalists lose their jobs if they expose things like fraudulent wars .
The craft of CIA analysis was designed to be an all - source operation , meaning that we analysts were responsible  and held accountable  for assimilating information from all sources and coming to judgments on what it all meant .
We used information of all kinds , from the most sophisticated technical collection platforms to spies to open media .
Here I have to reveal a trade secret , which punctures the mystique of intelligence analysis .
Generally speaking , 80 percent of the information one needs to form judgments on key intelligence targets or issues is available in open media .
It helps to have training from past masters of media analysis , which began in a structured way in targeting Japanese and German media in the 1940s .
But , truth be told , everyone with a high - school education can do it .
It is not rocket science .
This is not to denigrate the contribution of CIA operations officers , case officers running sensitive agents , for though small in percentage of the whole nine yards available to be analyzed , information from such sources can often make a crucial contribution .
Consider , for example , the daring recruitment in mid-2002 of Saddam Hussein ’s foreign minister , Naji Sabri , who was " turned " into working for the CIA and quickly established his credibility .
Sabri told us there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
My former colleagues , perhaps a bit naively , were quite sure this would come as a vast relief to President George W. Bush and his advisers .
Instead , they were told that the White House had no further interest in reporting from Sabri ; rather , that the issue was not really WMD , it was " regime change . "
( Do n’t feel embarrassed if you did not know this ; our corporate - owned , war - profiteering media has largely suppressed all this . )
So our former colleague , operations officer par excellence Robert Baer , reports ( in this week ’s Time ) that , according to his sources , the Bush / Cheney administration is winding up for a strike on Iran , that Bush ’s plan to put Iran ’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the terrorism list points in the direction of such a strike , and that delusional " neoconservative " thinking that still guides White House policy concludes that such an attack would lead to the fall of the clerics and rise of a more friendly Iran .
Hold on , it gets even worse :
Baer ’s sources tell him that administration officials are thinking that " as long as we have bombers and missiles in the air , we will hit Iran ’s nuclear facilities . "
VIPs member Phil Giraldi , writing in The American Conservative , earlier noted that Karl Rove has served as a counterweight to Vice President Dick Cheney , determined as Cheney seems to be to expand the Middle East quagmire to Iran .
And former Pentagon analyst retired Lt. Col.
Karen Kwiatkowski , who worked shoulder - to - shoulder with the most rabid Pentagon neocons just before the attack on Iraq , has put into words ( on LewRockwell.com ) speculation several of us have been indulging in with respect to Rove ’s departure .
In short , it seems a good bet that Rove , who is no one ’s dummy and would not want to have to " spin " an unnecessary war on Iran , lost the battle with Cheney over the merits of a military strike on Iran , and only then decided to spend more time with his family .
Whatever else Rove has been , he has served as a counterweight to Dick Cheney ’s clear desire to expand the Middle East quagmire into Iran .
As for White House spokesperson Tony Snow , it seems equally possible that , before deciding he has to make more money , he concluded that his stomach could not withstand the task explaining why Bush / Cheney needed to attack Iran .
With the propaganda buildup we have seen so far , what seems most likely , at least initially , is an attack on Revolutionary Guard training facilities inside Iran , and that can be done with cruise missiles .
With some 20 targets already identified by anti-Iranian groups , there are enough assets already in place to do that job .
But the while - we ’re - at - it neocon logic referred to above may well be applied after , or even during , that kind of attack from the air .
Cheerleading in the MSM
Yes , it is happening again .
The lead editorial in Tuesday ’s Washington Post regurgitates the unproven allegations that Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard Corps is " supplying the weapons that are killing a growing number of American soldiers in Iraq ; " that it is " waging war against the United States and trying to kill as many American soldiers as possible . "
Designating Iran a " specially designated global terrorist " organization , says the Post , " seems to be the least the United States should be doing , giving the soaring number of Iranian - sponsored bomb attacks in Iraq . "
It ’s as though Dick Cheney is again writing the Post editorials .
And not only that , arch neocon James Woolsey has just told Lou Dobbs that the U.S. may have no choice but to bomb Iran in order to halt its nuclear weapons program .
As Woolsey puts it , " I ’m afraid within , well , at worst , a few months ; at best , a few years ; they could have the bomb . "
Woolsey , self - described " anchor of the Presbyterian wing of the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs , " has long been way out in front plumbing for wars , like Iraq , that he and other neocons myopically see as being in Israel ’s , as well as America ’s , interest .
Within days of 9/11 , Woolsey was arguing for war with Iraq even while conceding , at the time , that there was no evidence tying Iraq to 9/11 .
The latest is also rubbish .
And Woolsey knows it .
And so do the reporters for the Washington Post , who are aware of , but have been forbidden to tell , a highly interesting story .
The NIE That Did n’t Bark
The National Intelligence Estimate on if and when Iran is likely to have the bomb has been ready since February .
It has been sent back four times  no doubt because its conclusions do not support what folks like Cheney and Woolsey are telling the president .
The conclusions of the most recent NIE on the issue ( early 2005 ) was that Iran could probably not have a nuclear weapon until " early to mid-next decade , " a formula memorized and restated by Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell at his confirmation hearing in February .
One can safely assume that McConnell had been fully briefed on the first " final draft " of the new estimate , which has now been in limbo for half a year .
It is a safe bet that the conclusions of the new draft resemble those of the 2005 estimate all too closely to suit Cheney .
It is a scandal that the congressional oversight committees have not been able to get hold of the new estimate , even in draft .
For it is a safe bet it would give the lie to the claims of Cheney , Woolsey , and other cheerleaders for war with Iran and provide powerful ammunition to those arguing for a more sensible approach to Iran .
Despite the administration ’s warlike record , many Americans may still cling to the belief that attacking Iran wo n’t happen because it would be crazy ; that Bush is a lame - duck president who would n’t dare undertake a new reckless adventure when the last one went so badly .
But  with this administration  rationality has not exactly been a strong suit .
Bush has placed himself in a neoconservative bubble that operates with its own false sense of reality .
As psychiatrist Justin Frank noted in a July 27 memorandum updating his book , Bush on the Couch :
" We are left with a president who cannot actually govern , because he is incapable of reasoned thought in coping with events outside his control , like those in the Middle East .
" This makes it a monumental challenge  as urgent as it is difficult  not only to get him to stop the carnage in the Middle East , but also to prevent him from undertaking a new , perhaps even more disastrous adventure  like going to war with Iran , in order to embellish the image he so proudly created for himself after 9/11 as the commander in chief of ‘ the first war of the 21st century . ’ "
Bridgeman
NATURE is full of surprises .
When atoms were first proved to exist ( and that was a mere century ago ) , they were thought to be made only of electrons and protons .
That explained a lot , but it did not quite square with other observations .
Then , in 1932 , James Chadwick discovered the neutron .
Suddenly everything made sense — so much sense that it took only another 13 years to build an atomic bomb .
It is probably no exaggeration to say that biology is now undergoing its “ neutron moment ” .
For more than half a century the fundamental story of living things has been a tale of the interplay between genes , in the form of DNA , and proteins , which the genes encode and which do the donkey work of keeping living organisms living .
The past couple of years , however , have seen the rise and rise of a third type of molecule , called RNA .
The analogy is not perfect .
Unlike the neutron , RNA has been known about for a long time .
Until the past couple of years , however , its role had seemed restricted to fetching and carrying for DNA and proteins .
Now RNA looks every bit as important as those two masters .
It may , indeed , be the main regulator of what goes on in a cell — the cell 's operating system , to draw a computing analogy — as well as the author of many other activities ( see article ) .
As important , molecular biologists have gone from thinking that they know roughly what is going on in their subject to suddenly realising that they have barely a clue .
That might sound a step backwards ; in fact , it is how science works .
The analogy with physics is deeper than just that between RNA and the neutron .
There is in biology at the moment a sense of barely contained expectations reminiscent of the physical sciences at the beginning of the 20th century .
It is a feeling of advancing into the unknown , and that where this advance will lead is both exciting and mysterious .
Know thine enemy
As Samuel Goldwyn so wisely advised , never make predictions — especially about the future .
But here is one : the analogy between 20th - century physics and 21st - century biology will continue , for both good and ill .
Physics gave two things to the 20th century .
The most obvious gift was power over nature .
That power was not always benign , as the atomic bomb showed .
But if the 20th century was distinguished by anything from its predecessors , that distinctive feature was physical technology , from motor cars and aeroplanes to computers and the internet .
It is too early to be sure if the distinguishing feature of the 21st century will be biological technology , but there is a good chance that it will be .
Simple genetic engineering is now routine ; indeed , the first patent application for an artificial living organism has recently been filed ( see article ) .
Both the idea of such an organism and the idea that someone might own the rights to it would have been science fiction even a decade ago .
And it is not merely that such things are now possible .
The other driving force of technological change — necessity — is also there .
Many of the big problems facing humanity are biological , or are susceptible to biological intervention .
The question of how to deal with an ageing population is one example .
Climate change , too , is intimately bound up with biology since it is the result of carbon dioxide going into the air faster than plants can remove it .
And the risk of a new , lethal infection suddenly becoming pandemic as a result of modern transport links ( see article ) is as biological as it gets .
Even the fact that such an infection might itself be the result of synthetic biology only emphasises the biological nature of future risks .
At the moment , policymakers have inadequate technological tools to deal with these questions .
But it is not hard to imagine such tools .
Ageing is directly biological .
It probably cannot be stopped , but knowing how cells work — really knowing — will allow the process to be transformed for the better .
At least part of the answer to climate change is fuel that grows , rather than fuel that is dug up .
Only biotechnology can create that .
And infections , pandemic or otherwise , are best dealt with by vaccines , which take a long time to develop .
If cells were truly understood , that process might speed up to the point where the vaccine was ready in time to do something useful .
But physics gave the 20th century a more subtle boon than mere power .
It also brought an understanding of the vastness of the universe and humanity 's insignificant place in it .
It allowed people , in William Blake 's phrase , to hold infinity in the palm of a hand , and eternity in an hour .
Know thyself
Biology , though , does more than describe humanity 's place in the universe .
It describes humanity itself .
And here , surprisingly , the rise of RNA may be an important part of that description .
Ever since the human - genome project was completed , it has puzzled biologists that animals , be they worms , flies or people , all seem to have about the same number of genes for proteins — around 20,000 .
Yet flies are more complex than worms , and people are more complex than either .
Traditional genes are thus not as important as proponents of human nature had suspected nor as proponents of nurture had feared .
Instead , the solution to the puzzle seems to lie in the RNA operating system of the cells .
This gets bigger with each advance in complexity .
And it is noticeably different in a human from that in the brain of a chimpanzee .
If RNA is controlling the complexity of the whole organism , that suggests the operating system of each cell is not only running the cell in question , but is linking up with those of the other cells when a creature is developing .
To push the analogy , organs such as the brain are the result of a biological internet .
If that is right , the search for the essence of humanity has been looking in the wrong genetic direction .
Of course , such results are speculative and primitive .
But that is the point .
Lord Rutherford , who proved that atoms exist , knew nothing of neutrons .
Chadwick knew nothing of quarks , let alone supersymmetry .
Modern biologists are equally ignorant .
But eventually , the truth will out .
The buzz of closures
I found an interesting discussion about closures .
I find this quote particularly true ( and amusing ) :
There has been a great deal of interest in closures lately , driven in great part by the fact that there is talk of adding some form of anonymous functions to the Java .
Most of the time , people talk about “ adding closures ” to Java , and that prompts a flurry of questions of the form “ what is a closure and why should I care ? ”
Yes , why would they care ?
As someone put it , if you always programmed in Basic , you think you do n't need recursion .
You can't comprehend a complex language feature — such as recursion — unless you actually try to make some sense of it .
Yes , no matter how many computer science courses you 'd take , you can't do real programming unless , well , you do real programming .
In other words , your teacher might have told you what recursion means , but unless you actually use it , you 'll never know what is it good for .
Consequently , I think there are 2 types of programmers .
Some would spend a lot of their free time trying to understand and make use of some techniques that might — or might not , but usually will — serve them for real - world problems .
The other camp is very boring : those are the people that are payed for some job and only do what their boss asks .
Now , the boss will never ask you to use closures ( or any other language feature for that matter ) .
He 'll just tell you “ do this ” ASAP , and you have to figure out how to finish it as soon as possible .
Well , using closures , ASAP can mean a lot sooner than without them , no matter what language are you programming in ( assuming of course that it supports this 30 - years - old concept ; some new and much hyped languages still do n't . ) .
I have former colleagues that have completed their B.S. in computer science ( which I still did n't ) .
One of the courses you do in the college is an AI course which , of course , uses Lisp as the supporting language .
Well , the horror is that none of them understands what 's a closure , and asks me every time I mention the word “ OK , Java / C# might not have that , but why would I need it anyway ? ” .
So after preaching functional programming for some time , and after I saw my fellows here ignore me , I 've come to the conclusion that it 's better for them not to understand it .
A boss is a boss , and he 'll favor someone who has a B.S. ( which I do n't ) .
So I at least want to keep the technical advantage . :-p
So , ya Java folks , do n't even think about closures .
You do n't need them .
Just focus on writing specs and UML-s and Factories and Managers and Listeners and Executors .
The system took just five minutes to send out a tsunami alert after the massive undersea earthquake that occurred off the island of Sumatra on Wednesday , Sept. 12 .
" There actually was a tsunami , " Jochen Zschau , director of the geophysics department of the GFZ earth sciences institute , told German news service DPA .
" Fortunately it was only about one meter ( three feet ) high when it made landfall on the Indonesian west coast .
Even a little bit bigger would have been quite dangerous . "
Time of the essence
At least 10 people were killed and more injured by Wednesday 's tsunami
Zschau said a first automatic alert from the GFZ - installed seismographs and buoys arrived in Jakarta and Potsdam near Berlin , enabling his team to inform Indonesian officials earlier than other scientists .
" It took us just five minutes to find out the epicenter and strength , " he said .
The old tsunami warning system took 15 minutes to issue an alert and US seismologists , who use data from that system , did n't send out a warning message until half an hour after the quake occurred .
The tsunami tidal wave of December 2004 , which killed more than 220,000 people , reached the Indonesian coast after 20 minutes .
While the German system is still not completed , Zschau said it will be completely up and running in place by the end of next year .
The buoys record abnormal waves and other phenomena in the water to indicate if the ocean is shifting .
The German government financed the system after the great Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 , which killed some 230,000 people .
Wednesday 's epicenter was close to the same place as in 2004 .
" And they 're still building billion - dollar houses , right in the middle of the desert , " says Paul Oyashi , incredulous .
" It does n't seem rational , does it ? "
In a word , no .
Rational , some would say , would be a mass migration from the drought - ravaged American southwest , where Southern California just experienced its driest 12 - month period in recorded history , to more verdant climes .
One such place ?
Cleveland , the battered hub of Cuyahoga County , where Oyashi sits as director of the department of development .
" We do n't have earthquakes , we do n't have brush fires , we 've got all the fresh water you could ever want , " Oyashi says .
" That 's logic .
But the problem is , it flies in the face of reality . "
LOGIC HAS NEVER been the lone – or even dominant – factor in human behaviour .
And in Cleveland , much like all the depressed cities of the Great Lakes rust belt , the reality is this : over the past four decades , the population has bled away to less than half , as it has in Buffalo and Detroit .
And the loss continues .
Last year , Cuyahoga was sixth among American counties in population loss , trailing only the four counties in the New Orleans area decimated by Hurricane Katrina as well as Wayne County , home to Detroit .
A foreclosure crisis on defaulted mortgages in Cleveland , mirrored all along the rust belt , left about 10,000 of the city 's 80,000 homes vacant .
" Jaywalking is far too easy in downtown these days , " Oyashi says gruffly .
At first glance , the crises of the rust belt and the Southwest would seem unrelated .
They are , in fact , inexorably linked .
Each has what the other does not .
In Phoenix , tremendous affluence ; in Cleveland , and in Detroit , Toledo , Youngstown , Buffalo , Rochester , Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie , abundant , near - endless water – in the Great Lakes alone , as much as 25 per cent of the world 's supply .
And as the Southwest and parts of the Southeast grapple with historic drought , water supply depletion – earlier this year , Lake Okeechobee in Florida , a primary water source for the Everglades , caught fire – and the creeping sense that , with climate change , things can only get worse , a new reality is dawning : that logic , finally , will have a larger role to play in human migratory dynamics , continent - wide .
With it come not just doomsday scenarios , but for certain urban centres left for dead in the post - industrial quagmire , a chance at new life .
" Sticking a straw in the Great Lakes is not a solution to Phoenix 's water problems , " says Robert Shibley , director of the Urban Design Project at the State University of New York at Buffalo .
" Maybe it 's time to really think about what constitutes need and stop spending money to build carrying capacity in places that do n't have it by nature , and start investing in places that do . "
Shibley has long been a champion of Buffalo 's dormant potential – a potential reduced by half or more through the latter part of the 20th century , as the population fell below 300,000 from a historic high of more than 700,000 .
He suggests that in the Great Lakes basin , where less than half a per cent of the world 's population sits within easy reach of a quarter of the planet 's fresh water , the opportunity for harmony exists .
In a perfect world governed by reason , Shibley says , the only robust economic centre in the region would serve as its heart .
And that would be Toronto .
That 's an issue for international bureaucrats to solve .
But the reality is this : according to the U.S. government , the population of the United States is expected to reach 450 million by 2050 – an increase of almost 50 per cent .
The predicted pattern of settlement for these new citizens will take them to the seven most built - out regions of the country – Arizona , Texas , Florida and California among them .
" You 're going to have 150 million people living in at least seven of the major regions that do n't have water , do n't have carrying capacity , can't feed themselves , " Shibley says .
" It 's an ecological disaster waiting to happen .
So there 's a good reason to think that people should come back to the Northeast , where we have the carrying capacity , and have the water . "
Some have already taken notice .
Last year ,
The Economist ranked Cleveland the most liveable city in America ( 26th in the world ) based on five categories : stability , health care , culture and environment , education and infrastructure .
Among the booming cities of the Southwest , only Los Angeles and Houston cracked the top 50 .
Phoenix did n't make the list , falling behind Nairobi , Algiers and Phnomh Penh among the world 's top 126 urban centres .
Water is a factor .
It is already a significant issue in the major regions Shibley mentions which , not coincidentally , depend on the same diminishing source for much of their hydration .
In 1922 , seven states – many of them , like Nevada , Arizona , Texas and California , desperately arid – signed the Colorado River Compact , which divvied up the mighty waterway 's seemingly abundant flow .
But recent observation of the river is alarming .
Only two per cent of the river 's water makes it beyond the U.S. border , where large Mexican cities dependent on its bounty are left with a trickle – much less than they need .
With climate change , river flow has been dwindling , due , among other things , to decreasing snowfall and less consequent spring runoff , which forms a significant part of the Colorado River basin 's lifeblood .
The river is the main water source for more than 30 million people stretching from Colorado in the north all the way down to the U.S. - Mexico border .
By the end of the century , inflow to the river ( which includes runoff and tributaries ) is expected to drop by as much as 40 per cent .
At the same time , climate change projections show temperatures in the most parched regions of the Southwest increasing between five and seven degrees .
That would make Phoenix 's hottest days well over 54C .
In Arizona , though , these warnings seem to fall on deaf ears .
" The Greater Phoenix region continues to bust at the seams , " says Christopher Scott , a research professor of water resource policy at the University of Arizona in Tucson .
" People look at this and think , ` This ca n't go on , can it ? ' "
But it does , and faster than anywhere else in America .
From 1990 to 2005 , the population of Greater Phoenix grew 47.7 per cent .
In Scottsdale , a posh , affluent corner of Greater Phoenix that , despite the lack of moisture , has more golf courses per capita than anywhere else in America , growth was 72.1 per cent over the same period .
Altogether , Greater Phoenix will likely crest at 4 million people some time this year , making it the fourth - largest metropolitan area in America .
By mid-century , some estimates suggest it will reach 10 million , leaving Phoenix and Tucson fused in the desert .
" We 'll basically be one massive urban corridor , " Scott says .
Phoenix receives water from the Colorado through canals hundreds of kilometres long , pumped through parched landscapes and small communities along the way that take their fill .
It is , essentially , a city that should n't be there , so distant is the water supply .
Scott , who has studied water supply issues from India to Mexico to West Africa , has seen no end to water - appropriation schemes in development - crazy Arizona .
" Piping in sea water from the Sea of Cortez in Mexico , desalinating it , and then piping the salty brine back into the ocean – that 's the kind of hare - brained notion I 've heard here , " he says .
" Do I consider these things tenable ?
Not at all .
But these are proposals people are talking about seriously , in public , and they 're getting a lot more play . "

Scott worries that technology may well make such things possible , but at a destructive energy cost that simply exacerbates the problem .
" We 're already starting to ask questions about the larger issues associated with pumping in all that water along those canals – the energy costs , and the carbon impact associated with it , " he says .
" They may solve the water issue short - term , but they pull the sustainability rug out from under you in the process . "
The long - term solution , of course , is to relocate people where they can comfortably exist .
( Oyashi certainly knows a place where you can get a decent house on the cheap . )
In a free society , of course , forced migration is n't really an option .
But as the sustainability crisis worsens , " usually economic forces will do it for you , " says Robert McLeman , a professor of geography at the University of Ottawa .
" When cities have to build new infrastructure and to jack up taxes to cope , when the cost of running a household becomes prohibitive , people will move . "
McLeman has long studied the impact climate has on migration all over the world .
As climate change continues apace , the numbers of potential environmental refugees from such countries as Bangladesh , India and Pakistan are staggering – as many as 50 million in the next five years , according to a U.N. report .
In the U.S. , says McLeman , the stresses of climate change will be most keenly felt in the " dry belt " states of the Southwest .
Given that many sun belt residents fled the rust belt for warmer climes in the first place , a backtracking is n't out of the question in the climate - changed world .
" Once the heat becomes unbearable , they may find the freezing cold a little more bearable –especially if it's not quite so freezing cold as they remember . "
It wo n't happen without help .
In Buffalo , Shibley speaks of a federal urban sustainabilty plan that funnels federal money to the Great Lakes region to help draw population back .
It 's been more than 30 years since the U.S. had a comprehensive national urban plan .
Looming ecological crises in burgeoning urban centers more than justify a revival .
" Cities do n't grow by topsy , it 's not a thing of nature – it's a function of public policy , " he says .
But a significant piece is missing , McLeman warns .
" These cities will have milder climates , be easier to live in , and cheaper , " he says , " but ultimately , they 'll have to have the jobs to go with them . "
Oyashi is painfully familiar with the concept .
Cleveland may have a surfeit of cheap , liveable housing and an abundance of fresh water , but its problems are legion .
Abandoned industrial sites litter the area , too big or too expensive to put to other purposes .
Small victories pale in the face of greater challenges , like trying to convince Ford not to close two of its three plants in the region .
" We 've got some dinosaurs walking around here , " he says .
But those problems , endemic rust - belt - wide , are just the most visible .
High crime rates , languishing schools and spiralling urban poverty plague Cleveland , too .
Phoenix , for all its money , can't make it rain any more than Cleveland , with all its water , can print the money it needs .
The difference , Oyashi says , is that the Great Lakes are a viable place to live long term .
" The problem is , " he says , " that does n't do anybody any good now . "
He lays the responsibility at the federal government 's door .
" It 's not like we have a policy that says , ` You know , we should have a national policy that provides incentive for people to live in ecologically sustainable areas , ' " he says .
" What we have here is ` Go wherever you want , do whatever you want , and the government will follow with its chequebook . '
You get this haphazard checkerboard of winners and losers , rather than directed development in the regions that can sustain it .
It 's crisis management . "
But the coming crisis , Shibley warns , could well become something no chequebook could manage .
" We 're so focused on the cost of keeping large populations in the Southwest , " he says , " that we have n't considered anywhere near enough the cost of leaving them out there long term .
All of this is going to come home to roost , and as a society , we 're going to have to figure out lower - impact ways of delivering quality of life .
We can do that right here , right now . "

Why the stipulation ?
Some people might argue that Scarlett Johansson can act , another might say Katherine Heigl , and another poor fool might say Jessica Simpson .
But none of them have ever been nominated for an Academy Award , which -- for all its faults and inability to land in the right hands -- is still basically the gold standard of film acting .
Kate Winslet
Kate Winslet deserves special mention , because she ’s been nominated for an Oscar just about every other year since she turned twenty .
She ’s not the hottest actress in the world , or even on this list , but watch her in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and tell us she does n’t remind you of a girl you dated .
She ’s sexy in that quirky but realistic way .
Charlize Theron
It ’s been pointed out ad nauseum , but once again : is n’t it ironic that Charlize Theron , a beautiful woman , had to make herself absolutely hideous to win an Oscar ?
She also proved it was n’t a fluke when she was nominated again ( for North Country ) .
But for us , she really pushed it over the top with her guest appearances as Rita on Arrested Development .
Yes , yes -- her plotline eventually got kind of tired , but she really gave it her all and created some genuinely funny moments as Michael ’s retarded English fiancée .
Rachel Weisz
Rachel Weisz is somewhat more of an unconventional beauty than the others on the list .
Pictures do n’t really do her justice .
But watch just about any of her movies ( even the mostly - dismal Envy ) and you ca n’t help but admit that she steams up the cinema .
Her English accent might be part of it .
Darren Aronofsky is a lucky man .
Jennifer Connelly
Jennifer Connelly has been around forever and is still incredibly hot .
She was hot at twenty in The Rocketeer , at thirty in Requiem for a Dream , and even last year at thirty - six in both Blood Diamond and Little Children .
Sometimes people will say , “ Oh , but look at how big her eyebrows are .
She looks like Peter Gallagher with breasts . ”
Different strokes , man .
Different strokes .
Keira Knightley
Admittedly , we ’re not 100 % sure Keira Knightley can act .
But she was nominated for an Oscar last year for Pride and Prejudice ( did n’t see it ) and that ’s enough to get her on the list .
If we let Winslet on mainly for talent , we had to balance it out by having one who was mainly looks .
And look at her .
How could we say no ?
From the shadows a muscle - bound hulk wearing a garish yellow shirt and with a bible wedged under his arm strode in and ushered the traffickers ' leader into the bar .
Ten minutes later the leader , an assault rifle laid across his lap , was in tears .
Sobbing , he told his visitor , known in these parts as Pastor Dione , he wanted to leave the gang but did n't know how .
The preacher grabbed his arm and tried to comfort him .
" You might think that nobody cares about you , " he said forcefully .
" But Jesus loves you .
And I am here for you .
I am your pastor and I will help you . "
It has been a violent year even for Rio , which annually registers about 6,000 murders .
More than 50 police officers have died since January , while the latest clash between police and traffickers has claimed 16 lives in just over two weeks .
With no sign of the violence abating few are brave enough to reach out to the armed men on the frontline of Rio's 30 - year drug conflict .
A handful of support groups which aim to draw traffickers back into mainstream , law - abiding , society exists here .
Among them is Soldado Nunca Mais ( Trafficker Never Again ) and Afro-Reggae .
But for the most part such work is left to an army of Pentecostal preachers such as Dione dos Santos , the 33 - year - old head of the God 's Assembly , Restoration Ministry Church , in Senador Cámara , a rundown district in west Rio .
Each week hundreds of these missionaries trawl the back alleys and drug dens of Rio 's favelas armed with nothing but a copy of the New Testament , hoping to save both souls and lives .
" My function is to avoid deaths , brother , you get me ? " said Pastor Dione during one " incursion " , speaking in the same street slang he uses when addressing traffickers .
Alex Casemiro , another preacher , said : " Lots of pastors say they want to preach just so they can sit on their sofa .
Very few do what we are doing . "
He was racing through another slum in his Ford Focus hoping to help free three young men who apparently had been kidnapped and sentenced to death by a drug gang from another favela .
Like the UN and Red Cross , Rio's frontline preachers possess a type of carte blanche to operate in the city 's most inaccessible and dangerous corners .
When Rio's police try to enter a favela , they are often received with gun fire ; when the evangelists do so they are greeted with a slightly embarrassed smile or a hug from the gang members .
" No one here is so up themselves [ that they reject the preachers ] , " one high - ranking trafficker from the Third Command drug faction told the Guardian during a recent visit to one of the group 's HQs , a concrete shack manned by young traffickers armed with AK - 47s and an anti-aircraft machine - gun capable of firing up to 500 rounds a minute .
" The boys all know they are here to try and liberate us , to help us stop smoking , stop snorting and stop trafficking . "
Many such preachers are former gang members who see the traffickers not just as violent killers but also as deeply vulnerable young men .
Pastor Dione , who said that until 10 years ago he was also in the drug " movement " , often tells traffickers : " What you are , I once was .
What I am today , you too can become . "
On one missionary visit , and referring to Rio's four main drug factions , he told an AK - 47 - wielding trafficker : " A life is a life .

Not all of the preachers ' beliefs are as progressive as their attempts to rescue gangsters might suggest .
Many consider homosexuality the work of the devil and encourage their female worshippers to cover themselves with the roupao , a baggy body - length robe .
Yet the results of their highly risky visits to Rio 's slums are impossible to deny .
Pastor Dione claims to have convinced several hundred criminals to swap their weapons for the word of god .
" If it was n't for the pastor I 'd be dead already , " said one teenage recruit , who claimed that before his conversion he had been employed to chop up corpses with an axe .
A 21 - year - old , Marcelo dos Santos , one of the youngest members of Pastor Dione 's team , said : " My mum gets worried about the early mornings and the shootouts but this is our work , our lives are in the hands of Jesus . "
A garage holding mattresses and wooden pews serves as Pastor Dione 's church .
At a recent gathering the immaculately dressed evangelist was on stage preaching at the top of his voice to a heaving audience .
" Do you know what I say to the believers who are scared of evangelising in the drug dens ? " he bellowed .
" Stop clowning around !
Today we are going out onto the streets .
Today we are going to invade the drug dens . "
" Hallelujah ! " the worshippers screamed back .
After the service Pastor Dione and eight colleagues piled into a white VW van and went out into the night .
Two hours later they pulled up at a roadblock in the Complexo da Mare , a slum near Rio 's international airport .
Half a dozen traffickers , carrying grenades , revolvers and automatic rifles , surged round the van to receive a blessing .
" Come with us now !
Put your gun down and come with us back to the church , " the preachers insisted , prompting an uncomfortable silence .
After several hours preaching , Pastor Dione 's men were ready for bed .
They gathered in a bar to discuss the night 's events over Coca - Cola .
It was nearly 5 am .
" Who else comes here and hugs the drug traffickers ? " asked Pastor Dione .
" [ The traffickers ] think ' the state does n't care about me [ and ] the police come in here shooting , and these people come in here telling me I matter , that Jesus loves me ' - this is our mission . "

Red Command , Third Command , Pure Third Command , and Friends of the Friends , are the four main drug factions controlling many of Rio's 600 shantytowns , home to about 1 million Brazilians .
Estimates suggest there are at least 6,000 young men involved , some as young as 11 .
Since the 1980s , clashes between rival factions and police have become increasingly militaristic .
Police frequently seize machine - guns and rifles , while landmines and bazookas have also been found .
Civilian casualties have risen this year as the authorities pursue a more aggressive stance against the drug factions .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Britain is to expel four Russian diplomats in protest over Moscow 's refusal to extradite a key suspect in the poisoning of a former KGB agent .
Andrei Lugovoi , above , is the main suspect in the murder of Russian emigre Alexander Litvinenko .
Foreign minister David Miliband said Monday Britain would review the level of its cooperation with Russia on a range of issues , including changing the way Russian government officials get visas .
" This is a situation the government has not sought and does not welcome .
But we have no choice but to address it , " Miliband said in a speech to parliament outlining the measures .
" We have chosen to expel four diplomats , four particular diplomats , in order to send a clear and proportionate signal to the Russian government about the seriousness of this case . "
The Kremlin refuses to extradite Andrei Lugovoi , a former Russian state security agent , who British prosecutors wish to extradite to the UK over the suspected poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko .
Miliband said that international agreements meant Lugovoi could be extradited if he left Russia .
British prosecutors announced their decision to seek Lugovoi 's extradition on May 22 , but Russia formally refused to hand him over on July 9 .
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated sharply since Litvinenko's death .
Moscow authorities have proposed putting Lugovoi on trial in Russia , but British prosecutors have rejected this , doubting Moscow 's promises of a fair trial .
They allege Lugovoi used rare radioactive isotope polonium 210 to poison Litvinenko , a former Russian intelligence agent turned Kremlin critic , during a meeting in London in November .
Litvinenko became violently ill within hours of the meeting and died in hospital three weeks later on November 23 .
Traces of polonium were found in locations frequented by Lugovoi before Litvinenko's death but he has insisted he is innocent , saying British intelligence or anti-Kremlin agents probably murdered Litvinenko .
Britain would also suspend attempts to speed up the visa process for Russian citizens , Miliband said .
" The government believes Russia is a key international partner for the UK , " he said .
" For all these reasons we need a relationship based on trust and mutual respect . "
Litvinenko , a former employee of Russia 's Federal Security Service fled to Britain in 2000 and became a fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin , accusing him of planning to kill his opponents , including journalist Anna Politkovskaya who was murdered in October 2006 .

All About Alexander Litvinenko • Russia
For the past couple years , I have had the privilege of working as a consumer attorney .
I ’ve occasionally written about some of the topics I ’ve encountered as a consumer lawyer .
In this post , I ’ll address another issue that I commonly encounter in my practice : illegible forms full of fine print that deprive consumers of fundamental rights .
What provoked this topic is a lawsuit I am currently handling .
My client sued a payday lender based on a payday loan that she alleges the defendant repeatedly processed and renewed in violation of the payday lending laws of Missouri .
This is a big deal to my client and to all of the numerous potential class members of this class action .
Why is it important ?
For starters , this particular payday lender ( and many others ) charged 469 % interest .
This is not a typo .
I have often asked friends and acquaintances whether they ’ve heard of payday loans .
They usually say they have heard of those sorts of businesses .
I then ask them how much interest they think payday lenders charge .
Most people say something like this :
“ Oh , I hear that it is an exorbitant rate of interest , perhaps 25 % . ”
They are shocked to hear that it is legal to charge consumers 400 or 500 % interest on a small consumer loans .
They are shocked to hear that some of these companies make it part of their business plan to repeatedly violate Missouri lending laws .
They are also shocked at one other thing , the topic of this post .
They are shocked to see how unreadable and one - sided many business forms have become .
I should mention that the above lawsuit is not about the exhorbitant rate of interest , which is entirely legal .
How can that be ?
See here .
The suit concerns allegations that the lender violated numerous laws concerning renewals and paydown of the loans .
Take a look at the actual form here : arbitration agreement .
pdf
If you make it all the way through the form , send me a comment and I ’ll publish it so that you get full credit for your diligence .
The above form is an arbitration clause that is printed on the back side of every loan application by one of the businesses that I have sued .
This arbitration form is very much like the forms used by numerous other payday lenders and numerous other providers of goods and services to consumers from coast to coast .
The above form runs more than 1400 words .
All of those words are jammed onto one page in tiny type ( about eight point ) , with fully justified margins running the width of the page ( this makes it difficult to find where the next line begins ) .
The title of this all - important arbitration provision does not even mention “ arbitration . ”
The lines of this form are less - than - single - spaced to the extent that the lower strokes of a line actually touch the upper strokes of the letters on the line beneath it .
This form is so badly congested that I scanned the form at 400 dpi , then ran OCR ( optical character recognition ) on it using two separate programs ( OmniPage Pro 14 and Adobe Acrobat Standard ) .
Both of these programs failed pathetically , because the words and sentences are jammed together too closely for a machine to distinguish between the words and lines .
If a person were to reformat the above form to double - spacing with one - inch margins , the form would take almost 7 sheets of paper .
This printed information on the above form is so absolutely unreadable that the corporate representative of the company that implemented this form stumbled several times while trying to read it at a deposition .
It is written so poorly that a lawyer who works for the company could not explain a key provision of this arbitration clause immediately after being asked to read it .
My client ’s readability expert explained that this form was not readable , based upon an analysis he conducted .
It could not comfortably be read by anyone with less than a first - year graduate school level of training , he testified .
Further , the form was not legible , based upon the appearance of the words on the page .
Only a tiny sliver of consumers in America could be expected to make any sense out of this form .
If you ’d like to know more about the sorts of things that readability experts consider , check out this article or this one , for starters .
My client has also presented several consumer attorneys for depositions in this case .
Each of these expert attorneys stated that they had vast experience reviewing similar paperwork with their clients .
Each of them stated emphatically that no consumers ever actually read anything like the above form .
They described the form as “ impenetrable . ”
Normal people simply do n’t read forms written like this .
Despite all this evidence that no one will actually read forms like this , the above form purports to deprive consumers of the right to a jury trial .
The above form also deprives consumers of a right to file a class - action against the business for widespread wrongdoing ( this also deprives potential class members of the right to be a class member where the defendant corporation engages in widespread illegal activity ) .
These are fundamental rights that are being taken away from consumers based upon forms that are neither legible nor readable .
It would not matter what you put in the middle of this form , because no consumer is going to get to the middle of the form .
You could put in a sentence advising the consumer that all they have to do is stand up and say “ give me $ 100 ” and the business would hand the consumer $ 100 .
But no one would ever notice that part of this contract , because no one would ever get through the first couple of sentences , much less the first paragraph ( which , by the way , contains a single sentence of more than 250 words ) .
This illegible form requires that consumers address their grievances with this company one by one , in individual arbitration .
This , despite the fact that the case is based upon Missouri statutes so complicated that no consumer would ever realize that their rights have been violated ( and therefore would never think of pursuing an arbitration ) .
In order to pursue this case individually ( whether in arbitration or in a court ) , consumers would need attorneys .
According to the attorney experts , however , there are only a handful of attorneys in Missouri who have shown any willingness to take consumer cases and none of them would be a will to make any profit at all on very small claims like these ( typically less than $ 1000 of damages ) .
In fact , the clear testimony is that an attorney handling these small risky claims would lose money every time , even if they prevailed in court .
What is fascinating , then , is that this form and thousands of other forms used in commerce are absolutely illegible and unreadable .
The consumers do not read them and cannot read them .
It does not matter what is put into the middle of these forms , because no one is ever going to get there .
Not even the employees or the upper management of these companies read or understand these forms .
These forms are typically written in a different language , legalese .
In the case I am handling , the corporate representative could think of many rights to consumer gave up by signing the form , but could n’t think of any rights the payday lending company gave up .
The above form stripped the customers of valuable legal rights and left the business unscathed .
Nonetheless , millions of consumers are being deprived of their rights every day based upon legal forms like these , forms that simply cannot be read .
The consumers sign them simply because they are told to sign them by smiling workers employed by corporate behemoths .
People sign these forms because they are tricked into trusting the people who tell them to sign these forms .
Ironically , the signature line at the bottom of most of these fine print forms requires consumers to declare that they have “ read and understood ” forms that they have neither read nor understood .
Those sign them , of course , because they ’re told to sign them and they make the mistake of trusting businesses that are often unscrupulous .
Thus , business as usual is based upon a huge fiction .
Businesses and courts often assume that corporations have somehow communicated with their customers using unreadable forms .
The evidence is clear , however , that only one out of a thousand people will ever try to work his or her way through this sort of form .
Even fewer will succeed in understanding the form .
Before you scoff at all those people who do n’t fully read in their payday loan contracts , think of this .
This same sort of trusting ignorance is the same thing that happens when you install new software .
You are asked to check a box that you have read and understood the software disclaimers .
It is highly likely that you ( like most people ) simply checked the box and get on with the installation without ever attempting to read or understand any of those disclaimers .
When it comes to fine print , expediency trumps truth .
It is expedient to believe ( at least in courtrooms ) that everyone can read and does read such gibberish .
But this common legal finding has no basis in fact .
Unless you have a dedicated lawyer willing to put up a huge fight , a court in which you might someday find yourself might tell you that you were supposed to have read and understood legal boilerplate which was neither readable nor understandable .
Case closed .
There are now 9.3 millionaire million households ( 2006 ) , which is 5 % more than the previous year ( 8.9 million ) .
Where do all of the millionaires live ?
New Yorkers see so much wealth around them , they figure that it has to have the most rich people in the country , if not the world .
Well , not really , see chart above , click to enlarge .
According to
a new study
by TNS , the research company , Manhattan ’s number of millionaire households does n’t even rank among the top 10 counties in the country .

La conclusion du jugement , verbatim :
Thinking is the beginning of enlightenment , which brings a huge impact and change in human life .
Non-realize thinking are considered as resources that will not guide someone to attain wisdom .
The wisdom has transformed into words without subjectivity and completely without object , which penetrates the equality of all things , is undifferentiated .
Wirtschaftswunder 2.0 German Economic Boom Creates Job Machine
Experts in the government and academia are astonished over the strength of Germany 's economic recovery .
Unemployment is declining more rapidly and the government coffers are filling more quickly than during any other economic recovery in postwar German history .
What 's causing the powerful economic upswing ?
The US writer Noam Chomsky talks about the mechanisms behind modern communication , an essential instrument of government in democratic countries – as important to our governments as propaganda is to a dictatorship .
DM : Let ’s start with the media issue .
In the May 2005 referendum on the European constitution , most newspapers in France supported a yes vote , yet 55 % of the electorate voted no .
This suggests there is a limit to how far the media can manipulate public opinion .
Do you think voters were also saying no to the media ?
NC : It ’s a complex subject , but the little in - depth research carried out in this field suggests that , in fact , the media exert greater influence over the most highly educated fraction of the population .
Mass public opinion seems less influenced by the line adopted by the media .
Take the eventuality of a war against Iran .
Three - quarters of Americans think the United States should stop its military threats and concentrate on reaching agreement by diplomatic means .
Surveys carried out by western pollsters suggest that public opinion in Iran and the US is also moving closer on some aspects of the nuclear issue .
The vast majority of the population of both countries think that the area from Israel to Iran should be completely clear of nuclear weapons , including those held by US forces operating in the region .
But you would have to search long and hard to find this kind of information in the media .
The main political parties in either country do not defend this view either .
If Iran and the US were true democracies , in which the majority really decided public policy , they would undoubtedly have already solved the current nuclear disagreement .
And there are other similar instances .
Look at the US federal budget .
Most Americans want less military spending and more welfare expenditure , credits for the United Nations , and economic and international humanitarian aid .
They also want to cancel the tax reductions decided by President George Bush for the benefit of the biggest taxpayers .
On all these topics , White House policy is completely at odds with what public opinion wants .
But the media rarely publish the polls that highlight this persistent public opposition .
Not only are citizens excluded from political power , they are also kept in a state of ignorance as to the true state of public opinion .
There is growing international concern about the massive US double deficit affecting trade and the budget .
But both are closely linked to a third deficit , the democratic deficit that is constantly growing , not only in the US but all over the western world .
DM : When a leading journalist or TV news presenter is asked whether they are subject to pressure or censorship , they say they are completely free to express their own opinions .
So how does thought control work in a democratic society ?
We know how it works in dictatorships .
NC : As you say , journalists immediately reply : “ No one has been exerting any pressure on me .
I write what I want . ”
And it ’s true .
But if they defended positions contrary to the dominant norm , someone else would soon be writing editorials in their place .
Obviously it is not a hard - and - fast rule : the US press sometimes publishes even my work , and the US is not a totalitarian country .
But anyone who fails to fulfil certain minimum requirements does not stand a chance of becoming an established commentator .
It is one of the big differences between the propaganda system of a totalitarian state and the way democratic societies go about things .
Exaggerating slightly , in totalitarian countries the state decides the official line and everyone must then comply .
Democratic societies operate differently .
The line is never presented as such , merely implied .
This involves brainwashing people who are still at liberty .
Even the passionate debates in the main media stay within the bounds of commonly accepted , implicit rules , which sideline a large number of contrary views .
The system of control in democratic societies is extremely effective .
We do not notice the line any more than we notice the air we breathe .
We sometimes even imagine we are seeing a lively debate .
The system of control is much more powerful than in totalitarian systems .
Look at Germany in the early 1930s .
We tend to forget that it was the most advanced country in Europe , taking the lead in art , science , technology , literature and philosophy .
Then , in no time at all , it suffered a complete reversal of fortune and became the most barbaric , murderous state in human history .
All that was achieved by using fear : fear of the Bolsheviks , the Jews , the Americans , the Gypsies – everyone who , according to the Nazis , was threatening the core values of European culture and the direct descendants of Greek civilisation ( as the philosopher Martin Heidegger wrote in 1935 ) .
However , most of the German media who inundated the population with these messages were using marketing techniques developed by US advertising agents .
The same method is always used to impose an ideology .
Violence is not enough to dominate people : some other justification is required .
When one person wields power over another – whether they are a dictator , a colonist , a bureaucrat , a spouse or a boss – they need an ideology justifying their action .
And it is always the same : their domination is exerted for the good of the underdog .
Those in power always present themselves as being altruistic , disinterested and generous .
In the 1930s the rules for Nazi propaganda involved using simple words and repeating them in association with emotions and phobia .
When Hitler invaded the Sudetenland in 1938 he cited the noblest , most charitable motives : the need for a humanitarian intervention to prevent the ethnic cleansing of German speakers .
Henceforward everyone would be living under Germany ’s protective wing , with the support of the world ’s most artistically and culturally advanced country .
When it comes to propaganda ( though in a sense nothing has changed since the days of Athens ) there have been some minor improvements .
The instruments available now are much more refined , in particular – surprising as it may seem – in the countries with the greatest civil liberties , Britain and the US .
The contemporary public relations industry was born there in the 1920s , an activity we may also refer to as opinion forming or propaganda .
Both countries had made such progress in democratic rights ( women ’s suffrage , freedom of speech ) that state violence was no longer sufficient to contain the desire for liberty .
So those in power sought other ways of manufacturing consent .
The PR industry produces , in the true sense of the term , concept , acceptance and submission .
It controls people ’s minds and ideas .
It is a major advance on totalitarian rule , as it is much more agreeable to be subjected to advertising than to torture .
In the US , freedom of speech is protected to an extent that I think is unheard of in any other country .
This is quite a recent change .
Since the 1960s the Supreme Court has set very high standards for freedom of speech , in keeping with a basic principle established by the 18th century Enlightenment .
The court upholds the principle of free speech , the only limitation being participation in a criminal act .
If I walk into a shop to commit a robbery with an accomplice holding a gun and I say “ Shoot ” , my words are not protected by the constitution .
Otherwise there has to be a really serious motive to call into question freedom of speech .
The Supreme Court has even upheld this principle for the benefit of members of the Ku Klux Klan .
In France and Britain , and I believe the rest of Europe , the definition of freedom of speech is more restrictive .
In my view the essential point is whether the state is entitled to determine historical truth and to punish those who contest such truth .
If we allow the state to exert such powers we are accepting Stalinist methods .
French intellectuals have difficulty admitting that they are inclined to do just that .
Yet when we refuse such behaviour there should be no exceptions .
The state should have no means of punishing anyone who claims that the sun rotates around the earth .
There is a very elementary side to the principle of freedom of speech : either we defend it in the case of opinions we find hateful , or we do not defend it at all .
Even Hitler and Stalin acknowledged the right to freedom of speech of those who were defending their point of view .
I find it distressing to have to discuss such issues two centuries after Voltaire who , as we all know , said : “ I shall defend my opinions till I die , but I will give up my life so that you may defend yours . ”
It would be a great disservice to the memory of the victims of the Holocaust to adopt one of the basic doctrines of their murderers .
DM : In one of your books you quote Milton Friedman as saying that “ profit - making is the essence of democracy ” .
NC : Profit and democracy are so contrary that there is no scope for comment .
The aim of democracy is to leave people free to decide how they live and to make any political choices concerning them .
Making a profit is a disease in our society , based on specific organisations .
A decent , ethical society would pay only marginal attention to profits .
Take my university department [ at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ] : a few scientists work very hard to earn lots of money , but they are considered a little odd and slightly deranged , almost pathological cases .
Most of the academic community is more concerned about trying to break new ground , out of intellectual interest and for the general good .
DM : In a recent tribute , Jean Ziegler wrote : “ There have been three forms of totalitarian rule : Stalinism , Nazism and now Tina [ the acronym from British prime minister Margaret Thatcher ’s statement , “ There is no alternative ” – that is , to economic liberalism and global free - market capitalism ] . ”
Do you think they can be compared ?
NC : I do n’t think they should be placed on the same footing .
Fighting Tina means confronting a system of intellectual control that cannot be compared with concentration camps or the gulag .
US policies provoke massive opposition all over the world .
In Latin America , Argentina and Venezuela have thrown out the International Monetary Fund .
Washington can no longer stage military takeovers in Latin America as it did 20 or 30 years ago .
The whole continent now rejects the neo-liberal economic programme forcibly imposed on it by the US in the 1980s and 1990s .
There are signs of the same opposition to the global market all over the world .
The Global Justice Movement , which attracts a great deal of media attention at each World Social Forum ( WSF ) , is hard at work all year .
It is a new departure and perhaps the start of a real International .
But its main objective is to prove that there is an alternative .
What better example of a different form of global exchange than the WSF itself .
Hostile media organisations refer to anyone opposed to the neo-liberal global market as antis , whereas in fact they are campaigning for another form of global market , for the people .
We can easily observe the contrast between the two parties because their meetings coincide .
We have the World Economic Forum , in Davos , which is striving to promote global economic integration but in the exclusive interests of financiers , banks and pension funds .
These organisations happen to control the media too .
They defend their conception of global integration , which is there to serve investors .
The dominant media consider that this form of integration is the only one to qualify as globalisation .
Davos is a good example of how ideological propaganda works in democratic societies .
It is so effective that even WSF participants sometimes accept the ill - intentioned “ anti ” label .
I spoke at the Forum in Porto Alegre and took part in the Via Campesina conference .
They represent the majority of the world ’s population .
DM : Critics tend to lump you together with the anarchists and libertarian socialists .
What would be the role of the state in a real democracy ?
NC : We are living here and now , not in some imaginary universe .
And here and now there are tyrannical organisations – big corporations .
They are the closest thing to a totalitarian institution .
They are , to all intents and purposes , quite unaccountable to the general public or society as a whole .
They behave like predators , preying on other smaller companies .
People have only one means of defending themselves and that is the state .
Nor is it a very effective shield because it is often closely linked to the predators .
But there is a far from negligible difference .
General Electric is accountable to no one , whereas the state must occasionally explain its actions to the public .
Once democracy has been enlarged far enough for citizens to control the means of production and trade , and they take part in the overall running and management of the environment in which they live , then the state will gradually be able to disappear .
It will be replaced by voluntary associations at our place of work and where we live .
DM : You mean soviets ?
NC : The first things that Lenin and Trotsky destroyed , immediately after the October revolution , were the soviets , the workers ’ councils and all the democratic bodies .
In this respect Lenin and Trotsky were the worst enemies of socialism in the 20th century .
But as orthodox Marxists they thought that a backward country such as Russia was incapable of achieving socialism immediately , and must first be forcibly industrialised .
In 1989 , when the communist system collapsed , I thought this event was , paradoxically , a victory for socialism .
My conception of socialism requires , at least , democratic control of production , trade and other aspects of human existence .
However the two main propaganda systems agreed to maintain that the tyrannical system set up by Lenin and Trotsky , subsequently turned into a political monstrosity by Stalin , was socialism .
Western leaders could not fail to be enchanted by this outrageous use of the term , which enabled them to cast aspersions on the real thing for decades .
With comparable enthusiasm , but working in the opposite direction , the Soviet propaganda system tried to exploit the sympathy and commitment that the true socialist ideal inspired among the working masses .
DM : Is n’t it the case that all forms of autonomous organisation based on anarchist principles have ultimately collapsed ?
NC : There are no set anarchist principles , no libertarian creed to which we must all swear allegiance .
Anarchism – at least as I understand it – is a movement that tries to identify organisations exerting authority and domination , to ask them to justify their actions and , if they are unable to do so , as often happens , to try to supersede them .
Far from collapsing , anarchism and libertarian thought are flourishing .
They have given rise to real progress in many fields .
Forms of oppression and injustice that were once barely recognised , less still disputed , are no longer allowed .
That in itself is a success , a step forward for all humankind , certainly not a failure .
But he did n’t want to touch the white linen napkin on the table .
It was too clean .
“ I thought I was n’t worthy to use it , ” said Johnny , 45 , who said he suffers from schizophrenia and whose real name is John Carbonell .
“ I used the one that was in the basket where the bread was . ”
For the next several months , Johnny would drift between his old life underground and his new one above it , struggling the way a man freed from prison must readjust to society .
It is easy in a sense to take the city ’s homeless people off the streets , but it is harder , as Johnny ’s odyssey illustrates , to take homelessness out of them .
Even after Johnny moved into the apartment the first week of January , he returned to the wooded area around the cave to feed Meow Meow and the other stray cats he had named .
His first several days in the apartment — a light - drenched one - bedroom unit with hardwood floors and a large kitchen in a five - story building — he did not bother locking the door .
“ There ’s no doors in the cave , ” he explained .
He had bold ambitions of starting over :
He talked about getting a sewing machine , so he could design clothes , and he refused to move his belongings from the cave to the apartment because he worried about bringing in bugs .
He wanted to put up “ No Smoking ” signs , vowing not to indulge his old addictions in his new environment .

One Sunday in January , Johnny slept on the bed , on top of the covers , wearing a leather jacket and muddy boots .
He resembled not the sole occupant of Apartment 3B , but a visitor .
He said he spent the night in the apartment , then went back to the cave at 6 a.m. , then returned later that morning to the apartment .
The flashlight he used in the cave still shone inside his jacket pocket .
Anarchy Unbound , or : Why Self - Governance Works Better than You Think
No sane person believes that anarchy generates order .
The idea that anarchy could be superior to government in some cases seems even more absurd . [ 1 ]
Everyone from Thomas Hobbes to Adam Smith repeats the claim that societies need government to protect property and produce widespread cooperation .
Even the most libertarian thinkers believe this is true .
As Milton Friedman put it , “ government is essential both as a forum for determining the ‘ rules of the game ’ and as an umpire to interpret and enforce the rules decided upon . ” [ 2 ]
Self - governance , however , might work better than you think .
A small cadre of self - described “ anarcho - capitalists ” reject the anarchy - as - chaos “ wisdom . ”
In the 20th century the most notable of these thinkers have been Murray Rothbard , who grounded his defense of anarchy in natural rights theory , and David Friedman , whose book , The Machinery of Freedom , provided the quintessential consequentialist defense of a purely private society . [ 3 ]
Despite the important theoretical arguments in these and other anarcho - capitalist works , even among those familiar with them , most remain unconvinced .
On the one hand , natural rights defenses of anarchy do not persuade consequentialists , such as economists , who see significant problems with anarchy ’s ability to cope with cheating and violence .
On the other hand , most consequentialist defenses of anarchy are purely speculative .
In forging responses to how a stateless society could cope with every conceivable contingency it might confront , anarchists often offer imaginative conjecture , in some cases bordering on science fiction .
Ironically , the case for anarchy derives its strength from empirical evidence , not theory .
Most of the world , for most of its history , has existed without effective governments .
As noted economic historian Joel Mokyr points out , “ In England , ” for example , “ there was not even a professional police force to protect private property ” until the 19th century . [ 4 ]
Large arenas of economic activity in the world remain anarchic , or nearly so , to this day .
For example , there is no supranational sovereign with the authority to create formal international laws to regulate countries or to enforce such laws if they existed .
[ 5 ]
Adding to international anarchy is the absence of state - made , supranational commercial law to enforce contracts between private international traders . [ 6 ]
In large parts of the developing world governments are too weak or dysfunctional to perform even the most basic tasks , like securing the property rights of their citizens .
According to the 2007 Failed States Index , governments in 129 countries are on or nearing the brink of collapse . [ 7 ]
Somalia has no central government at all .
Even in the developed world pockets of anarchy persist .
The costliness of state enforcement , coupled with the fact that the state ’s eye cannot be everywhere all the time , means that people cannot in many cases rely on government to protect their property or enforce their contracts even though , officially , a well - functioning state exists .
Despite these significant arenas of anarchy we do not observe perpetual world war in the absence of global government , shriveling international commerce in the absence of supranational commercial law , or even deteriorating standards of living in Somalia .
On the contrary , peace overwhelmingly prevails between the world ’s countries , international trade is flourishing , and Somali development has improved under statelessness . [ 8 ]
If conventional wisdom is right then reality must be wrong .
How can this be ?
Empirical evidence , past and present , sheds light on how individuals under anarchy develop private institutional solutions to address the problems that statelessness presents .
The guiding force behind these solutions is none other than Adam Smith ’s “ invisible hand . ”
Importantly , Smith ’s principle applies not only to individuals ’ activities in the context of well - functioning institutions , but also to their activities in the development of institutions themselves .
The Invisible Hook
One of the most striking examples of this comes from 17th and 18th - century pirates .
[ 9 ]
In many ways pirate ships were like floating societies . [ 10 ]
And , like other societies , pirate ships confronted problems of theft of cheating .
Since they were outlaws , pirates did not enjoy state protection .
Government did not enforce employment agreements between pirates or other piratical “ contracts , ” nor did it prevent or punish theft between pirates , etc .
Notably , the anarchic environment that maritime bandits operated in did not lead them to simply throw up their hands and abandon the idea of their criminal enterprise .
On the contrary , the prospect of mutual gains from organizing this enterprise provided pirates with the incentive to find private ways of securing cooperation and order .
Even by modern standards the institutions pirates devised for this purpose were remarkably sophisticated .
Pirates created one of the earliest forms of written constitutions they called their “ articles , which codified many of the rules that governed their ships , as well as punishments for rule breakers .
These included rules specifying the division of booty , “ laws ” against theft , and even workman ’s compensation insurance to support crew members injured in battle .
To apply punishments and resolve disputes between crew members , pirates created an office called the “ quartermaster . ”
Crew members controlled quartermasters both through their articles , which prescribed the “ laws ” quartermasters could apply , and by democratically electing crew members to this office .
The office of the quartermaster allowed pirates to overcome another obstacle anarchy posed for their organization — restraining potentially abusive pirate captains .
A captain endowed with unlimited authority would be able to prey on his crew , skimming booty , mistreating crew members , and so on .
To check such abuse pirates initiated one of the earliest systems of divided power , which transferred authorities susceptible to captain abuse to the quartermaster instead .
In conjunction with also democratically electing their captains , pirate checks and balances overcame the threat of captain predation .
This system of governance was entirely voluntary .
Pirates drew up the articles governing their ships before taking voyage and required unanimous consent before sailing .
Any prospective crew member who disliked the proposed rules was free to exit before sail was underway .
The pirates ’ private system of governance worked extremely well .
Inter - pirate conflict was rare , order was well maintained , and pirates regularly successfully cooperated , making them among the most effective organized criminal outfits in history .
Trading with Bandits
A common objection to anarchy is that without government the strong will plunder the weak .
Indeed , perhaps the oldest , most well - accepted argument for the state is weaker individuals ’ inability to prevent stronger ones from plundering them .
How can self - governance alone prevent this ?
Many mechanisms of self - governance rely on reputation to secure good conduct . [ 11 ]
It ’s not difficult to see how reputation can in many cases prevent cheating even where government enforcement is not an option .
Imagine you go to a restaurant and order a $ 30 filet mignon .
When your food arrives you take a bite and realize the restaurant has served you a $ 10 flank steak instead .
The restaurant has defrauded you .
You could take the owner to court ; but then you realize that the simple time cost this will entail is not worth what you will recover even if you win .
Although in principle government exists to adjudicate this matter , in practice it does not .
Your dining experience is a little slice of anarchy .
Knowing this , restaurant owners should perpetually serve $ 10 flank steaks to customers who order filet mignon .
Of course restaurants do n’t do this .
And the reason they do n’t is because they realize that if they do , you ’ll stop eating there and tell everyone you know to boycott the restaurant as well .
Even without government , Smith ’s “ invisible hand ” leads the restaurant to do the right thing .
Reputation - based mechanisms of self governance have a major hitch , however . [ 12 ]
They require the restaurant owner to not have the power to take your money from you against your will . [ 13 ]
If , for instance , you announce your boycott of the fraudulent restaurant , but the owner is sufficiently stronger than you and can use the threat of violence to extract “ future business , ” your threat of boycott is useless .
Reputation breaks down .
In light of this problem many observers have concluded that anarchy is incapable of dealing with the problem of force .
Fortunately , individuals under real conditions of anarchy who have actually faced such problems are more innovative than these observers .
A simple historical case from late pre-colonial Angola illustrates this well . [ 14 ]
In the late 19th century the coast of Angola was home to a flourishing export market that shipped African goods to Europe .
On the one side of this market were European settlers who operated the export industry , and on the other side were African producers in the remote interior who harvested the goods required for export .
Connecting these two groups were African middlemen who traveled to the interior to collect the goods and then carried them to the coast for export .
In the 19th century this region was for all intents and purposes anarchic .
Although Europeans had settlements with European laws and interior African communities had their own , largely informal institutions of internal governance , there was no government to oversee the interactions between members of these groups or their interactions with the middlemen .
The problem this created was that middlemen tended to be substantially stronger than interior producers , posing the threat of force described above .
Why pay producers for goods if middlemen could use their superior strength to simply steal them instead ?
Like with the pirates , instead of throwing in the towel and either accepting that they would be routinely plundered or stopping productive activities altogether , so that there would be nothing for middlemen to steal , African producers devised an institutional solution to the problem of force that allowed them to realize the benefits of trade with these bandits .
The institution they devised for this purpose was credit .
The key to understanding how credit solved the problem of force and facilitated peaceful exchange is straightforward : you ca n’t steal goods that are n’t yet produced , but you can trade with them .
Here ’s how the credit institution worked : Producers would not produce anything today but would instead wait for middlemen to arrive in their villages looking for goods to plunder .
With nothing available to steal the middlemen had two options : return to the coast empty - handed after having made a trip to the interior , or make an agreement with producers to supply the goods they required on the basis of credit .
In light of the costliness of their trip to the interior , middlemen frequently chose the latter
According to their credit arrangements , middlemen advanced payment to producers and agreed to return later to collect the goods they were owed .
When they returned for this purpose all that was available for taking was what they were owed , so stealing was not an option .
Instead , middlemen frequently renewed the credit agreement , which initiated a subsequent round of credit - based trade , and so on .
This simple arrangement performed two critical functions in allowing producers to overcome the threat of force that middlemen presented .
First , it enabled them to avoid being plundered , as though they had not produced anything at all , but also to realize the gains from trade , as though middlemen did not pose a threat of violence .
Second , it transformed producers in the eyes of middlemen from targets of banditry into valuable assets they had an interest in protecting .
If middlemen wanted to be repaid they needed to ensure that their debtors remained alive and well enough to produce .
This meant abstaining from violence against producers and protecting producers against the predation of others .
Better off Stateless
“ Okay , ” you might think .
“ So , historically there are some cases where anarchy seemed to work pretty well .
But this does n’t demonstrate that anarchy is ever actually superior to government . ”
True , but recent evidence from Somalia does .
From 1960 , when Somalia gained its independence , until 1991 , it was ruled by a socialist ( though , officially , he later abandoned socialism ) dictator named Mohamed Siad Barre .
Barre ’s policies and behavior looked a lot like the wealth - destroying , wildly corrupt , and highly predatory policies and behavior we observe in many other Sub - Saharan African countries today .
In 1991 a coup d’etat tumbled Barre ’s regime .
Unlike most coups , which replace one predatory government with another , this one replaced the old regime with nothing .
Although there have been a few failed attempts at resurrecting government in Somalia , including the most recent one by the international community - backed “ Transitional Federal Government , ” for the last fifteen - plus years Somalia has been stateless .
This situation has caused a great deal of hand wringing among international observers who continually point to the severe poverty and other problems in the country .
Somalia has thus become the “ poster child ” for government ’s indispensability and evidence that anarchy leads to chaotic decline .
The great irony of these claims is that the data we have on anarchic Somalia point in exactly the opposite direction : namely , anarchy in Somalia has produced a higher level of welfare than government did .
In a recent study I compared Somali welfare under anarchy to welfare under government using all key development indicators for which data allowed comparison . [ 15 ]
According to the data , of the eighteen development indicators , fourteen show unambiguous improvement under anarchy .
Life expectancy is higher today than was in the last years of government ’s existence ; infant mortality has improved twenty - four percent ; maternal mortality has fallen over thirty percent ; infants with low birth weight has fallen more than fifteen percentage points ; access to health facilities has increased more than twenty - five percentage points ; access to sanitation has risen eight percentage points ; extreme poverty has plummeted nearly twenty percentage points ; one year olds fully immunized for TB has grown nearly twenty percentage points , and for measles has increased ten ; fatalities due to measles have dropped thirty percent ; and the prevalence of TVs , radios , and telephones has jumped between three and twenty - five times .
As Tatiana Nenova and Tim Harford discuss in their World Bank brief , “ Anarchy and Invention , ” much of this development can be attributed to improvements in public goods provided better by Somalia ’s anarchic private sector than by its former government . [ 16 ]
Should we conclude from Somalia ’s stateless improvement that it is a nice place to live ?
Of course not .
But Somalia ’s pre- and post - government performance highlights an important point about the desirability of anarchy .
Contrary to conventional wisdom , it is simply not true that any government is always superior to no government .
If state predation goes unchecked , government may not only fail to add to social welfare , but can actually reduce welfare below its level under statelessness .
Such was the case with Somalia ’s government , which did more harm to its citizens than good .
Somalia is extremely poor and remains a country with incredible problems .
But this does not demonstrate the desirability of government or the undesirability of anarchy , as many of those who advocate reintroducing government in Somalia pretend .
When thinking about the developing world we must be careful to avoid committing what economist Harold Demsetz called the “ nirvana fallacy . ” [ 17 ]
The nirvana fallacy involves ignoring real - world constraints that limit the menu of options ( and thus outcomes ) we have available to us .
For instance , in a world in which I am as wealthy as Bill Gates , I might drive a Ferrari .
Constrained by my actual income , however , I can only afford to drive a Subaru .
Although I would of course prefer the Ferrari , it would be silly to conclude that I should drive a Ferrari because this is the better car .
The fact that the Ferrari is superior is irrelevant ; given the constraints I actually face , the Ferrari is not in my feasible choice set .
We can extend this example a step further .
Imagine that I wrongly believe I should really be driving a Ferrari , and so I decide to try and do so .
My budget constraints prevent me from buying a functional Ferrari .
But I can afford a Ferrari with engine problems so severe it may explode when I drive it .
So a Subaru and a “ lemon ” Ferrari are in my feasible choice set .
If I purchase the “ lemon ” Ferrari , am I better off than if I had gone with the Subaru ?
Of course not .
Given the choices actually allowed by my constraints I would be better off with the Subaru .
The same kind of reasoning applies to thinking about anarchy versus government in Somalia and the large part of the developing world that is teetering on state collapse .
Although it is certainly reasonable to believe that a transparent , well - constrained , and highly - functional government , like the one we have in the United States , would improve Somali welfare beyond what it has experienced under anarchy , this does not mean that reintroducing government in Somalia would be better for Somalis .
Like all other choices , the choices we face in “ selecting ” governments are constrained .
Unfortunately for most developing countries , the political choice set they face is far smaller than the political choice set more developed countries face .
Historical features , such as clan tension , rampant corruption , territorial conflicts , and many others , which cannot be changed in the short run , severely restrict the kind of government countries like Somalia can reasonably expect to have if they have a government .
Sadly , well - functioning , well - constrained governments like the ones we observe in the U.S. and western Europe are not part of this choice set .
Ultra-predatory , corrupt , and abusive governments , however , are .
And so is anarchy .
As Somalia ’s experience illustrates , for many LDCs with these limited options anarchy may very well be the best feasible choice .
Parting Remarks
Anarchy , like all political - economic organizations , is riddled with problems .
It is not clear that these problems are any more numerous or severe than those that plague governments , however .
I have argued that anarchy works better than you think .
In the face of obstacles that stand in the way of individuals ’ ability to cooperate for mutual gain , individuals develop solutions to overcome these obstacles .
This is as true in society ruled by government as one that exists without government .
Where the state does not provide law , order , or the institutions required to produce these things , private institutions emerge to perform these roles instead .
My examples from above are not intended to suggest that these particular institutional solutions are generalizable or somehow suggest how other societies without government would evolve .
On the contrary , there is no “ blueprint ” for how anarchy would or does work . [ 18 ]
This , in fact , is the whole point .
Private institutional responses reflect the specific problems , times , places , and other conditions that give rise to them .
In a different time and a different place with different people , even the same problem situation may be met differently under anarchy .
The unifying feature of my examples is the incentive individuals have to solve their problems .
In this sense , the empirical evidence from anarchy only demonstrates that as long as there are unrealized gains to realize , people will find ways to realize them .
Fortunately for anarchists , this “ only ” is considerable .

For the Pentagon , telling the American public how much has been spent on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is fundamental to its effort to garner ( and maintain ) public and congressional support for these ongoing military operations .
It should be a simple question .
It is n’t .
In late July , for instance , the Department of Defense ( DOD ) reported to Congress that the war in Afghanistan had cost $ 78.1 billion ; the seeming precision of the decimal point notwithstanding , the number is laughably inaccurate .
Here ’s why :
The figure accounts for DOD “ obligations ” as of May 2007 , which does n’t include congressional appropriations or the amount the Pentagon has actually spent .
Instead , the agency describes obligations , vaguely , as “ orders placed , contracts awarded , services received , or similar transactions … that will require payments …. ”
In short , obligations are simply what the Pentagon thinks it might spend .
In terms of its obligations for Afghanistan going as far back as 2001 , the agency has muddied the waters even further , making no effort to document what was actually spent .
In addition , the estimates the DOD attributes to Afghanistan are not just for Afghanistan , but for Operation Enduring Freedom as a whole , which also includes military operations in the Horn of Africa , the Philippines , and “ elsewhere ” ( to use the Pentagon ’s term ) .
To date , the Defense Department has not informed the public , or apparently even Congress , how those costs break down .
Also neglected from the Pentagon ’s accounting of its war spending are fund transfers from annual appropriations that derive from the non-war segment of the DOD ’s budget .
These could total as much as $ 7 billion for both Iraq and Afghanistan .
There is also an additional $ 5.5 billion that analysts at the Congressional Research Services ( CRS ) believe was made available for expenditures in Iraq and Afghanistan , but which no one has been able to track .
And that ’s really just the tip of the iceberg .
The Defense Department ’s figures also fail to include expenditures on classified intelligence activities , which CRS has pegged at about $ 27 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan , or the costs incurred by the State Department or the Veterans Administration ( VA ) .
For the later agency , the cost to care for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan is only beginning to accrue .
In the end , it will total many billions of dollars .
All told , funding for Iraq and Afghanistan has included large amounts that have little or no real relationship to the wars .
This spending includes appropriations for the C - 17 , C - 130J , and V - 22 , among other aircraft that are unlikely to see the skies over either theater unless the wars are still raging three to five years from now ( when these aircraft are slated to roll off their respective production lines ) .
Several billion dollars have also been requested to fund the Army ’s reorganization into “ modular ” brigades — a plan that precedes the wars by several years and that would be funded without them .
Despite its tenuous relationship to ongoing military operations , this and other problematic spending has all appeared in Congress ’ “ emergency ” appropriations for the wars and , thus , should be included in the accounting of the funding for them .
As it stands , the Pentagon has virtually assured that an accurate tally of war spending will remain unknowable .
It has combined whatever records it retains detailing money spent in Iraq and Afghanistan with those documenting expenditures for all other DOD purposes , making it impossible to separate and identify the amount actually spent on the wars .
Surveying this fiscal junkyard in its May 18 report to Congress , the Government Accountability Office , whose auditors are well practiced in understatement , determined DOD ’s spending data on the wars “ to be of questionable reliability ” and reported that the Pentagon ’s figures “ should be considered approximations . ”
Rather than simply curse the darkness , CRS has attempted to sort through the morass to create an estimate of war spending since 9/11 .
The CRS study , comprehensive though it is , remains just an approximation , but it shows the Pentagon ’s accounting of its spending is so full of holes and misinformation that it has no credibility .
For instance , while the Pentagon pegs the cost of the war in Afghanistan at $ 78.1 billion , CRS estimates that $ 126.7 billion has been appropriated ( not counting an additional $ 30.8 billion that ’s been requested for fiscal year 2008 ) .
Sun Tzu , the Chinese military philosopher who authored The Art of War , a text written during the 6th century B.C. that remains widely read by military strategists , once said : “ If you know others and know yourself , you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles ; if you do not know others but know yourself , you win one and lose one ; if you do not know others and do not know yourself , you will be imperiled in every single battle . ”
Even with the help of CRS ’ analysis , our knowledge of a fundamental element of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq — their cost — is quite imperfect .
Based on Sun Tzu ’s prescription , it would appear that one of the biggest impediments to a favorable outcome in both wars is the lack of information provided to Congress and the nation by the Pentagon .
Soros - linked group hit with huge fine
The Federal Election Commission has fined one of the last cycle ’s biggest liberal political action committees $ 775,000 for using unregulated soft money to boost John Kerry and other Democratic candidates during the 2004 elections .
America Coming Together ( ACT ) raised $ 137 million for its get - out - the - vote effort in 2004 , but the FEC found most of that cash came through contributions that violated federal limits .
Advertisement
The group ’s big donors included George Soros , Progressive Corp. chairman Peter Lewis and the Service Employees International Union .
The settlement , which the FEC approved unanimously , is the third largest enforcement penalty in the commission ’s 33 - year history .
ACT , which ceased operations in 2005 , was formed in late 2003 and rapidly deployed an enormous organization to do the retail - level grunt work of politics .
It opened more than 90 offices in 17 states from which it mobilized an army of more than 25,000 paid canvassers and volunteers to knock on doors , stuff envelopes and make phone calls urging voters to defeat President Bush and support Democratic or “ progressive ” candidates including Kerry , the Democratic presidential candidate .
The FEC dismissed allegations that that Kerry ’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee violated campaign laws by coordinating with ACT or accepting excessive contributions from the group .
ACT was among a new breed of political committee , known as 527 groups , that stretched campaign finance rules on their way to shaping the 2004 elections .
Operatives used the 527s , named for the section of the IRS code under which they were registered , to spend money on politics outside the FEC ’s purview .
But the groups have largely faded from the political landscape as the FEC has sought to rein them in .
Late last year , commissioners handed down a total of $ 630,000 in penalties to three top 527s : Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , MoveOn.org and the League of Conservation Voters , and there are more complaints pending .
But the heads of two of the nonprofit campaign finance reform groups behind many of the complaints , including the one that led to the ACT penalty , say it ’s all too little , too late .
“ This action comes more than three years after our FEC complaints were filed and nearly three years after the 2004 presidential election was held , ” read a statement from Fred Wertheimer , president of Democracy 21 , and Gerry Hebert , executive director of the Campaign Legal Center .
Plus , they argued , the fine “ represents only a tiny fraction ” of the amount ACT spent illegally on the 2004 elections .
Wertheimer also is involved in a lawsuit to compel the FEC to pass a set of comprehensive rules regulating 527s , without which he said the groups are likely to reemerge in the 2008 campaign .
UPDATE : ACT issued a statement asserting the settlement “ vindicated ” the committee by dismissing charges that it coordinated with Kerry and the DNC and by finding ACT did not knowingly or willfully violate the law .
The statement suggested that ACT ’s problems were partly attributable to “ an uncertain and swiftly changing legal environment throughout 2004 ” and said the settlement will end “ three years of politically motivated charges by the Republican Party and ill - conceived allegations by self - styled campaign finance ‘ reform ’ groups . ”
ACT also touted its “ remarkable accomplishments , ” including what it called “ the single largest general public voter mobilization campaign in American history independently of any political party or candidate campaign . …
It is no wonder that the Republican Party responded by trying to force the organization to divert its resources from progressive political activism to defending its legal right to exist . ”
Also weighing in was the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation , which filed a complaint with the FEC against ACT because its contributions from SEIU came from members ’ dues .
“ The big problem with the FEC 's enforcement action , ” according to foundation executive Stefan Gleason is that “ not one cent of the millions of dollars illegally funneled into federal election activity will be returned to the unionized workers forced to foot the bill as a condition of employment . ”
Down in Bernard Malin 's basement is a softly thrumming metal box that turns natural gas into hot water and generates $ 600 to $ 800 worth of electricity a year – a bonus byproduct of heating his home .
" It 's like printing money , " says Mr. Malin , the first person in Massachusetts – perhaps in the nation – to own a residential " micro combined - heat - and - power " system , also known as micro-CHP .
But he 's not likely to be the last .
Since Malin changed his home heating system to micro-CHP in February , 18 other families in the Boston area also have adopted the technology , which squeezes about 90 percent of the useful energy from the fuel .
That 's triple the efficiency of power delivered over the grid .
Factories and other industrial facilities have used large CHP systems for years .
But until the US debut of micro-systems in greater Boston , the units had not been small enough , cheap enough , and quiet enough for American homes .
Add to that the public 's rising concern about electric - power reliability – seen in a sales boom of backup generators in the past couple of years – and some experts see in micro-CHP a power - to - the - people energy revolution .
" Right now these residential micro-CHP systems are just a blip , " says Nicholas Lenssen of Energy Insights , a technology advisory firm in Framingham , Mass .
" But it 's a ... technology that ... could have a big impact as it's adopted more widely over the next five to 10 years . "
The Japanese are early adopters
Home heating systems that produce a kilowatt of electricity – like Malin's – and bigger units that pump out about 4 kilowatts are already available in Europe and Japan .
They 'll make their commercial US debut in New England in January .
Of course , other home - based power - supply options – solar panels and wind generators – have preceded micro-CHP , with varying degrees of acceptance .
Both can be costly and hard to site .
Fuel cells are another much - anticipated option , but remain too costly for commercialization .
Micro-CHP , by contrast , is an advanced hybrid of existing technologies : an internal - combustion engine generator married to a high - efficiency home furnace .
In Japan , more than 30,000 homeowners have installed micro-CHP systems driven by quiet , efficient internal - combustion engines , each housed in a sleek metal box made by Honda .
Japan is ahead because gas utilities have been subsidizing and promoting the systems .
In Britain , where the systems look like dishwashers and sit under kitchen counters , 80,000 systems made by a New Zealand company are on order .
At least five companies are building micro-CHP systems worldwide .
Two are trying to enter the US market : Marathon Engine Systems of East Troy , Wis. , plans to bring a 4 - kilowatt hot - water system it sells in Europe to the US early in 2007 .
Climate Energy of Medfield , Mass. , has developed a forced - hot - air system that marries a high - efficiency furnace to a superquiet Honda generator .
That system has been deployed as a pilot to several US homes , including Malin's .
Such systems help people like Lynn Denoy insulate themselves from high electricity prices because they draw power from the commercial grid much less often in winter .
" I feel good about money we 're saving – and the environment – because we 're using less gas [ than the old furnace ] and creating our own heat and electricity , " says the speech therapist from Braintree , Mass .
Ms. Denoy 's family will buy some power this winter – and all spring and summer when the furnace system is not running .
Still , micro-CHP makes some utilities nervous , experts say .
" In North America I do n't see utilities embracing it .
I think they 'll see it as more of a threat initially , " says Jon Slowe , a director at Delta Energy & Environment , an energy consulting company in Glasgow , Scotland .
At the municipal utility in Braintree , Mass. , where Malin and Denoy live , officials say micro-CHP could bolster the grid in their area with extra power , if the idea catches on .
" If 1,000 homeowners bought these in Braintree , that would be great – about 10 percent of our residential load , " says William Bottiggi , director of the Braintree Electric Light Department , which partnered with the American Public Power Association to subsidize some local installations .
But William Steeley of Distributed Energy Resources at the Electric Power Research Institute , whose members include investor - owned utilities , says the jury 's out .
" We are very intrigued by micro-CHP and its potential , " he says .
" It is competing against well - established technologies .
So we 'll have to see . "
Wind - powered turbines in back yards , solar panels on rooftops , and micro-CHP are part of a gradual shift by homeowners from central power plants and toward self - generated power .
Slowly gaining ground , the trend is " not at all pie in the sky , " says Cheryl Harrington of the Regulatory Assistance Project , a nonprofit that helps states and nations develop energy policy .
" The question is how to get electric utilities to actively support this kind of generation when it is on the customer 's side of the meter . "
And the price tag is ...?
Micro-CHP does n't come cheap – just with a long - term discount .
Basic systems cost from $ 13,000 to $ 20,000 , installed .
Even at the lower range , that 's at least $ 6,000 more than a new high - efficiency hot - air furnace , even after a gas company rebate .
Result :
The payback period on the initial investment is three to seven years , depending on the cost of electricity , say officials at Climate Energy .
The company expects to install about 200 systems next year , mostly in New England .
Given consumers ' interest in having a backup power generator on site , micro-CHP systems that provide that , as well as cut electric bills , may hold the most promise , say analysts .
Climate Energy wo n't have a model with backup capability until 2008 , but is poised to sell its " Freewatt " system that chops electric bills by about 50 percent .
Marathon , which makes larger home systems , will offer backup capability when its systems roll out early next year .
While all CHP systems use fossil fuel , some states and environmental groups have endorsed them as a step in the right direction .
Through efficiency gains , a Climate Energy system cuts carbon - dioxide emissions for electricity used in the home by 40 percent , company officials say .
If micro-CHP can capture even 1 percent of the 3 million home furnaces sold each year , that would be enough to make it more broadly affordable , says Eric Guyer , CEO of Climate Energy .
" I think there will be a mind shift over time . "
For Richard Hillel of Belmont , Mass. , that shift is here .
" When you can have something producing heat and electricity , too , it 's great , " he says .
" We should be doing anything we can to save energy . "
Over the past several months , the state of California conducted the most comprehensive security review yet of electronic voting machines .
People who I consider to be security experts analyzed machines from three different manufacturers , performing both a red - team attack analysis and a detailed source - code review .
Serious flaws were discovered in all machines , and as a result the machines were all decertified for use in California elections .
The reports are worth reading , as is much of the blog commentary on the topic .
The reviewers were given an unrealistic timetable and had trouble getting needed documentation .
The fact that major security vulnerabilities were found in all machines is a testament to how poorly they were designed , not the thoroughness of the analysis .
Yet California Secretary of State Debra Bowen has conditionally recertified the machines for use , as long as the makers fix the discovered vulnerabilities and adhere to a lengthy list of security requirements designed to limit future security breaches and failures .
While this is a good effort , it has security completely backward .
It begins with a presumption of security :
If there are no known vulnerabilities , the system must be secure .
If there is a vulnerability , then once it 's fixed , the system is again secure .
How anyone comes to this presumption is a mystery to me .
Is there any version of any operating system anywhere where the last security bug was found and fixed ?
Is there a major piece of software anywhere that has been , and continues to be , vulnerability - free ?
Yet again and again we react with surprise when a system has a vulnerability .
Last weekend at the hacker convention DefCon , I saw new attacks against supervisory control and data acquisition , or SCADA , systems – those are embedded control systems found in infrastructure systems like fuel pipelines and power transmission facilities – electronic badge - entry systems , MySpace and the high - security locks used in places like the White House .
I will guarantee you that the manufacturers of these systems have all claimed that they were secure , and that their customers believed them .
Earlier this month the government disclosed that the computer system of the US - Visit border control system is full of security holes .
Weaknesses existed in all control areas and computing device types reviewed , the report said .
How exactly is this different from any large government database ?
I 'm not surprised that the system is so insecure ; I 'm surprised that anyone is surprised .
We 've been assured again and again that RFID passports are secure .
When researcher Lukas Grunwald successfully cloned one last year at DefCon , we were told there was little risk .
This year , Grunwald revealed that he could use a cloned passport chip to sabotage passport readers .
Government officials are again downplaying the significance of this result , although Grunwald speculates that this or another similar vulnerability can be used to take over passport readers and force them to accept fraudulent passports .
Anyone care to guess who 's more likely to be right ?
It 's all backward .
Insecurity is the norm .
If any system – whether a voting machine , operating system , database , badge - entry system , RFID passport system , etc. – is ever built completely vulnerability - free , it 'll be the first time in the history of mankind .
It 's not a good bet .
Once you stop thinking about security backward , you immediately understand why the current software security paradigm of patching does n't make us any more secure .
If vulnerabilities are so common , finding a few does n't materially reduce ( . pdf ) the quantity remaining .
A system with 100 patched vulnerabilities is n't more secure than a system with 10 , nor is it less secure .
A patched buffer overflow does n't mean that there 's one less way attackers can get into your system ; it means that your design process was so lousy that it permitted buffer overflows , and there are probably thousands more lurking in your code .
Diebold Election Systems has patched a certain vulnerability in its voting - machine software twice , and each patch contained another vulnerability .
Do n't tell me that it's my job to find another vulnerability in the third patch ; it 's Diebold 's job to convince me that it has finally learned how to patch vulnerabilities properly .
Several years ago , former National Security Agency technical director Brian Snow began talking about ( . pdf ) the concept of " assurance " in security .
Snow , who spent 35 years at the NSA building systems at security levels far higher than anything the commercial world deals with , told audiences that the agency could n't use modern commercial systems with their backward security thinking .
Assurance was his antidote :
Assurances are confidence - building activities demonstrating that : 1 . The system 's security policy is internally consistent and reflects the requirements of the organization ,
2 . There are sufficient security functions to support the security policy ,
3 . The system functions to meet a desired set of properties and only those properties ,
4 . The functions are implemented correctly , and
5 . The assurances hold up through the manufacturing , delivery and life cycle of the system .
Basically , demonstrate that your system is secure , because I 'm just not going to believe you otherwise .
Assurance is less about developing new security techniques than about using the ones we have .
It 's all the things described in books like Building Secure Software , Software Security and Writing Secure Code .
It 's some of what Microsoft is trying to do with its Security Development Lifecycle , or SDL .
It 's the Department of Homeland Security 's Build Security In program .
It 's what every aircraft manufacturer goes through before it puts a piece of software in a critical role on an aircraft .
It 's what the NSA demands before it purchases a piece of security equipment .
As an industry , we know how to provide security assurance in software and systems ; we just tend not to bother .
And most of the time , we do n't care .
Commercial software , as insecure as it is , is good enough for most purposes .
And while backward security is more expensive over the life cycle of the software , it 's cheaper where it counts : at the beginning .
Most software companies are short - term smart to ignore the cost of never - ending patching , even though it 's long - term dumb .
Assurance is expensive , in terms of money and time for both the process and the documentation .
But the NSA needs assurance for critical military systems ;
Boeing needs it for its avionics .
And the government needs it more and more : for voting machines , for databases entrusted with our personal information , for electronic passports , for communications systems , for the computers and systems controlling our critical infrastructure .
Assurance requirements should be common in IT contracts , not rare .
It 's time we stopped thinking backward and pretending that computers are secure until proven otherwise .

Virginia Tech Lesson : Rare Risks Breed Irrational Responses
Computer graphics researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed systems for editing or altering photographs using segments of the millions of images available on the Web .
Whether adding people or objects to a photo , or filling holes in an edited photo , the systems automatically find images that match the context of the original photo so they blend realistically .
Unlike traditional photo editing , these results can be achieved rapidly by users with minimal skills .
“ We are able to leverage the huge amounts of visual information available on the Internet to find images that make the best fit , ” said Alexei A. Efros , assistant professor of computer science and robotics .
“ It ’s not applicable for all photo editing , such as when an image of a specific object or person is added to a photo .
But it ’s good enough in many cases , ” he added .
“ Why Photoshop if you can ‘ photoswap ’ instead ? ”
Efros and his colleagues will present papers on two related systems at the Association for Computing Machinery ’s Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques ( SIGGRAPH ) annual conference Aug. 5 – 9 in San Diego .
One system , called Photo Clip Art ( graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/photoclipart/ ) , was developed with graduate students Jean - François Lalonde and Derek Hoiem , and with Carsten Rother , John Winn and Antonio Criminisi of Microsoft Research Cambridge .
It uses thousands of labeled images from a Web site called LabelMe as clip art that can be added to photos .
A photo showing a vacant street , for instance , might be populated with images of people , vehicles and even parking meters derived from the LabelMe database ( labelme.csail.mit.edu / ) .
To make the resulting image appear as realistic as possible , the system analyzes the original photo to estimate the camera angle and lighting conditions , and then looks in the clip art library for an object — a car , for instance — that matches those criteria .
The user need only identify the horizon in the original photo to orient the system .
Using previously developed Carnegie Mellon technology for analyzing the geometric context of a photo , the system can then place the object within the scene , adjusting its size as necessary to put it in proportion to other objects of equal distance from the camera .
“ Matching an object with the original photo and placing that object within the 3 - D landscape of the photo is a complex problem , ” said Lalonde , who led development of the system .
“ But with our approach , and a lot of clip art data , we can hide the complexity from the user and make the process simple and intuitive . ”
The other system , called Scene Completion ( graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/scene-completion / ) , was developed by graduate student James Hays , another member of Efros ’ research team .
It draws upon millions of photos from the Flickr Web site to fill in holes in photos .
Some of the holes might be from damage to a physical photograph , but more often they are created when an editor cuts out part of an image to eliminate an unsightly truck from a picturesque street scene , or removing a passerby from a group shot of friends .
Photo editors often try to fill in those holes with sections derived elsewhere in the same image , but Efros said that a better match can often be found in a different photo .
The system looks for image segments that match the colors and textures that surround the hole on the original photo .
It also looks for image segments that make sense contextually — in other words , it would n’t put an elephant in a suburban backyard or a boat in a desert .
In the case of well - photographed cities or popular tourist attractions , Efros said , the system might get lucky and find a photo of the same scene on the Web .
In other cases , it might offer a number of possible images that could fill in the hole .
A retaining wall edited out of one photo , for instance , might be replaced by the image of a building , a grassy slope or a rock outcropping .
The system typically gives the user 20 different choices for filling in the hole .
The success of this approach depends on the number of photos available to the system , Hays said .
“ We saw a dramatic improvement when we moved from a database of 10,000 images to two million images , ” he noted .
“ And that is just a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions of images already available on sites like Picasa and Flickr .
We have tons of photos from which to choose . ”

Boeing 's year - end goal for 737 Max return gets a boost in Europe
Boeing 's push to return the grounded 737 Max jet to the skies by year - end got a boost from European regulators , who said they expect to sign off on their safety review by November .
Test flights and a separate round of simulator sessions conducted this month went well , Patrick Ky , executive director of European Union Aviation Safety Agency , told French reporters on Friday .
EASA expects to lift its grounding shortly after the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration , Ky said .
He expects Chinese authorities to take longer to allow the plane back in the air .
A billion people live in India -- one of every six on the planet .
Half of them are illiterate .
Only one in four has access to adequate sanitation .
Some 350 million Indians live on less than a dollar a day .
Yet India is also home to some of the world 's most advanced high - technology firms , and New Delhi is Silicon Valley East .
Several years ago , a computer scientist , Dr. Sugata Mitra , had an idea .
What would happen if he could provide poor children with free , unlimited access to computers and the Internet ?
Mitra launched what came to be known as the hole in the wall experiment .
FRONTLINE / World producer Rory O'Connor first encountered Dr. Mitra and his experiment while directing a film on global poverty .
Dr. Mitra heads research and development at NIIT , a leading computer software and training company in New Delhi .
Just outside his office is a wall that separates his air - conditioned 21st - century office from a slum .
Mitra decided to place a high - speed computer in the wall , connect it to the Internet , and watch who , if anyone , might use it .
To his delight , curious children were immediately attracted to the strange new machine .
" When they said , ' Can we touch it ? ' "
Mitra recalls , " I said , ' It 's on your side of the wall . '
The rules say whatever is on their side , they can touch , so they touched it . "
Within minutes , children figured out how to point and click .
By the end of the day they were browsing .
" Given access and opportunity , " observes O'Connor , " the children quickly taught themselves the rudiments of computer literacy . "
One boy in particular , Rajinder , has become a computer whiz and a celebrity in India .
" Mainly I go to the Disney site , " Rajinder tells FRONTLINE / World , but he also regularly visits news sites and likes to use computer paint tools .
His teacher says that Rajinder is a much better student now : " He has become quite bold and expressive .
I 've got great hopes for this child . "
When Dr. Mitra asks Rajinder to define the Internet , the doe - eyed boy replies immediately , " That with which you can do anything . "
After the success of the first hole in the wall , Mitra replicated his unique experiment in other settings , each time with the same result .
Within hours and without instruction , children began browsing the Web .
When O'Connor returned to India this year , he documented Mitra 's campaign to set up more computer kiosks in poor communities .
This time , Mitra and his colleagues made a special effort to recruit girls -- a revolutionary concept in a society in which only one in three females can read .
Again , Mitra was delighted with the results .
Given permission , girls rushed to the computers .
" I feel great ! " exclaims Anjana , an enthusiastic girl who lives in Madangir , a low - income district of New Delhi .
At home , her family is a bit mystified .
Anjana 's sister - in - law is a stay - at - home housewife who has never seen a computer .
But she is thrilled that Anjana has the opportunity to master a technology that seems to offer so much promise .
" It increases her knowledge , " she says , " and it will be a big help when she looks for a job . "
Dr. Mitra likes the way in which Indian children reinvent computer terms and icons in their own language .
" They do n't call a cursor a cursor , they call it a sui , which is Hindi for needle .
And they do n't call the hourglass symbol the hourglass because they 've never seen an hourglass before .
They call it the damru , which is Shiva 's drum , and it does look a bit like that . "
In his personal crusade to overcome the digital divide in India -- the gap between information " haves " and " have - nots " -- Mitra takes his hole in the wall experiment to a fishing village in the rural state of Maharashtra .
Once more , schoolchildren flock to his computer kiosks .
Mitra is convinced that computers can bring prosperity to poor , rural areas and provide local jobs .
" If cyberspace is considered a place , " Mitra tells FRONTLINE / World , " then there are people who are already in it , and people who are not in it ...
I think the hole in the wall gives us a method to create a door , if you like , through which large numbers of children can rush into this new arena .
When that happens , it will have changed our society forever . "

Back in the old days ( read : 1992 ) , I was a 3rd year student at my college and my grandmother offered to buy me a new car because my junker was collapsing from underneath me .
I was a poor college student and my mom was struggling financially with the recent death of my father , so instead of seeing me take out a loan for a used car , my grandmother came to the rescue .
She decided it was better to just buy me an inexpensive new car that would last for years , so I started shopping .
I knew I was incredibly lucky to have this opportunity so I really did my homework .
At the time it seemed like everyone I knew had a VW and they always said how good they were and how long they lasted , so it seemed like a good bet .
We went down to the local dealership and I picked out a brand new black GTI … man that was a nice car back then .
I had never driven such a quick and nimble car and was so excited to call it my own .
Then the headaches began .
First off , on the ride home alone , the knob that rolled the window up and down fell off .
No biggie , I figured , just snapped it back on .
Then a few weeks later the sunroof stopped closing all the way , and the radio only worked once in a while .
Although they were only minor inconveniences , I should have known right then that something was seriously wrong with this car .
Then the real trouble began .
The car began stalling at the most inopportune moments … like in the middle of busy intersections and while getting on the freeway .
And no matter how many times I brought the car in for service , they always fixed something and gave me the green light .
Except it was never really fixed , it kept stalling , the sunroof started leaking , more knobs fell off .
Over and over again I kept bringing it into the dealership , sometimes leaving it there for over a week so they could poke around inside the car .
But it was never fully “ right ” .
At this point , I was talking to a friend of mine who had just had a lemon law case with his car and it was decided in his favor .
He gave me the name of his attorney and I called him up and scheduled a meeting .
After telling him the story , he told me to start documenting each and every thing that went wrong with the car and to keep detailed records .
The repairs continued for a few months until he decided we had a strong enough case .
Back then if your car was in the shop for the same repair 3 times in year , you had a good shot at winning a lemon law case .
Well mine was in way more than that , so we filed the necessary papers .
To try to make a long story short , VW and my lawyer went back and forth for a few months with offers and counteroffers until I finally accepted an offer I could live with : they would take back the car , return my money , and pay my lawyer fees for me .
Sounds good to me !
So a few days later I returned the car , got my money and the lawyer was paid .
What is the moral of the story ?
Do not accept the fact that a car is not right … if you sense that something is wrong with the car you just bought , start tracking the repairs , repair dates , service people ’s names , etc and contact a good lawyer .
He or she can guide you through what you need to do to prepare a proper case .
The lemon laws , even though they are hard to prove sometimes , are in fact there to help you out in case you need it .
For me , the case was very easy and did not take that long to get through , but I have heard of other people waiting years for their case to close .
Lemon laws vary by state , so be sure to check out the info for your state to know if you have a possible case .
As for me , I went on to buy a 1994 Honda Civic that lasted 139,000 and 7 years before I sold it , and it still worked fine .
I could not have been happier with the outcome .

( Business 2.0 Magazine ) -- Dream of landing a coding job at an A - list tech company ?
It might be a good idea to prep for your interviews by pondering how many golf balls can fit inside a school bus .
Or how much you would charge for washing all the windows in Seattle .
Or why , exactly , manhole covers are round and not , say , square .
Seemingly random questions like these have become commonplace in Silicon Valley and other tech outposts , where companies are n't as interested in the correct answer to a tough question as they are in how a prospective employee might try to solve it .
Since businesses today have to be able to react quickly to shifting market dynamics , they want more than engineers with high IQs and good college transcripts .
They want people who can think on their feet .
Microsoft ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) often gets credit for bringing so - called open - ended logic - problem screening tools into vogue in the late 1980s , when Redmond interviewers peppered job candidates with offbeat questions like How much does a 747 weigh ?
" We want to gauge people 's creativity , " says Warren Ashton , recruiting manager at Microsoft .
The manhole cover problem is Ashton 's personal favorite .
The most common answer , he says , is that a square manhole cover , tipped at an angle , could fall through the hole .
" But some people recognize that you can roll a round manhole cover from site to site .
Others figure that you save money by making it round because of tooling requirements .
You want to see people taking their conclusions as far as possible . "
Such questions are more relevant to a high - tech job interview than you might think .
" Employers want to see if you can make an estimate in the ballpark , within an order of magnitude , " says Mark Jen , a former Google ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) employee who is now a program manager at Tagged .
Coders are constantly making educated guesses rather than calculating exact answers , so a good interview should probe how well a candidate handles such estimates .
That 's why Amazon.com ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) interviewers , for example , have been known to ask job candidates to guess how many gas stations there are in the United States or to ballpark that bill for washing all of Seattle 's windows .
But today 's interviews go beyond seat - of - the - pants estimation .
Author , design consultant , and veteran coder Bruce Eckel likes to have job candidates describe a chicken using a programming language .
eBay ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) often hits candidates with a word problem that goes like this :
You have five pirates , ranked from 5 to 1 in descending order .
The top pirate has the right to propose how 100 gold coins should be divided among them .
But the others get to vote on his plan , and if fewer than half agree with him , he gets killed .
How should he allocate the gold in order to maximize his share but live to enjoy it ?
( Hint : One pirate ends up with 98 percent of the gold . )
But no company has taken brainteaser recruiting quite as far as Google , which famously reeled in engineers three years ago by posting complex math problems on a billboard along Highway 101 in Silicon Valley .
Passing motorists were invited to submit their solutions to an undisclosed website .
( The site 's URL was hidden in the answer . )
If you got to the site , you were asked a second , more difficult question .
If you answered that one correctly , you were invited to submit your resume .
Once you got to the Googleplex for an interview , a favorite question was this :
You are shrunk to the height of a nickel and your mass is proportionally reduced so as to maintain your original density .
You are then thrown into an empty glass blender .
The blades will start moving in 60 seconds .
What do you do ?
It 's not just employees who have to adjust to the new screening processes .
Employers are also prepping for interviews in ways they never did before .
When LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman was searching for a new CEO earlier this year , he took an unusual approach to checking references .
Having set his sights on a particular candidate , he used the Linked In network to find what he calls " off - balance references " : 23 former associates who were not preapproved by the candidate .
Some were friends of friends - two degrees removed , in Linked In parlance .
Some had no idea who Hoffman was or why he was calling .
The unscripted references helped to prepare the team that interviewed Hoffman 's final choice .
Equally important , Hoffman got unfiltered information about a potential top - tier employee , minimizing the likelihood of getting duped .
" Normally it 's a low bar for someone to give you two or three people who'll say nice things about them , " Hoffman says .
" Our way of doing it requires a bit of detective work , and you need to put a story together .
But you quickly sense if a person is good or a sham . "
Getting a handle on a candidate 's people skills can be just as important - and just as tricky .
At aQuantive , a digital marketing company , job applicants go through an extensive interview loop and in most cases must win the approval of everyone who met them before getting an offer .
" We jokingly liken it to organ rejection , " says Kem Day , director of recruiting .
" But by reaching a better decision up front , we make sure that whoever we hire will get support from within the company . "

Preamble
I discovered Ruby fairly recently , through the excellent Ruby on Rails framework .
Although I do n’t consider myself a Ruby expert by any means , I read the PickAxe , I ’ve coded a few utilities for my personal use in Ruby and I ’m currently developing with Rails during my free time .
Ruby is currently my programming language of choice ; I started off with Turbo Pascal in high school , discovered C and C++ at university , did my thesis in Java and learned PHP from scratch because I wanted to learn how to make websites quickly and easily .
I guess I feel compelled to code sometimes , more as a form of entertainment than anything else .
Rather dissatisfied with what I tried language - wise , I was determined to start learning either Python or Ruby .
I chose the latter because I did n’t want incorrect indentation to break my code , and here I am , heaping praise upon it .
There are plenty of introductions , tutorials , articles and essays of different sorts which aim to guide the novice and advise the guru on how to get the most out of Ruby .
This article , however , is not one of them .
It ’s more of a modest , humble , and incomplete list of a few reasons which may ( or may not ) entice you to use Ruby or at least play with it a bit .
A word of caution : if you are using another programming language for work or whatever , do n’t complain to me if you do n’t want to use it anymore – that ’s exactly what happened to me , but luckily , it did n’t matter .
Ruby is a very beautiful and elegant language , but like all things of this sort , it may well poison your mind and corrupt your soul …
You have been warned .
h3 . Why learn Ruby ?
# 1 – You get all the treats without the tricks
Ruby borrows from all the best programming languages out there , from smalltalk to Java , Perl to Python .
Basically , here ’s the features and functionalities Ruby gives you which you may have seen elsewhere :
Exceptions : Believe it or not , exceptions are one of the most important things to master when developing any kind of application .
PHP4 programmers probably wo n’t know anything about them and they ’ll tell you to just print stuff on the screen or use their “ extremely advanced ” class for error handling .
Please , ignore them .
Fortunately for all of us , Ruby comes with try / catch ( or better , begin / rescue ) blocks and a series of predefined , extensible Exceptions to handle errors properly .
Namespaces : Ruby modules make excellent and easy - to - use namespaces , for the joy of Java and C++ enthusiasts .
Built - in Regular Expressions :
For all the Perl monkeys , you can put something between slashes and it will become a regular expression , ready to be matched with a =~ operator .
Overloadable operators : Ruby lets you define operators like + , - , etc. , for any of your classes .
Packages : Called “ gems ” , they really are solid and precious indeed … and they work !
Packages support dependencies , and they can be either cross-platform or platform - dependent .
Interactive Shell : the Interactive Ruby Shell can be used to test Ruby code instantly , similar to the Python console .
Unit Testing : The Test :: Unit module makes things so easy that you really do n’t have any excuse not to test your code .
# 2 – You ’ll love the little things
Ruby is elegant .
Why ’s that ?
Because it does n’t focus on making code concise so much as readable and usable .
Here are some tips to help you out :
You can use both if and unless in condition statements .
Of course you can just use if and negate the condition , but unless can be less error - prone at times .
Furthermore , you can use both operators as conditional modifiers , after a statement rather than before : order .new unless order .exists .
You can use question marks and exclamation marks at the end of your methods .
Although no convention is enforced , ? is added if the method should return true or false , while !
is used to clarify that the method does something forcefully , like destroying a database record , chopping off the last character of a string , etc .
You can use the alias directives to create an alias for a method already defined .
In this way you can have an exist and an exists method at no additional cost or repetition .
You can use the attr_reader , attr_writer or attr_accessor directives to automatically generate getter and setter methods for specified class members .
Some naming conventions are enforced for your own sanity : constants , classes and modules are capitalized , methods and members must start with a lowercase letter ; global variables are prepended by a $ , instance variables by @ and class variables by @@ ; etc .
and class variables by ; etc. Parentheses are optional in method calls .
You can therefore write File.open ( “ /home/h3rald/test.txt ” ) or simply File.open “ /home/h3rald/test.txt ” , which is particularly handy with methods that do n’t take parameters .
# 3 – You wo n’t ever use a semicolon again
You want to add another instruction ?
Just go on the next line .
Hit and you ’re done .
In Ruby , like in Python , newlines matter and you do n’t have to remember to end your instructions with a semicolon .
Unfortunately this means that you wo n’t be able to write your whole program in a single line of code , like the C++ folks … that ’s too bad , is n’t it ?
UPDATE : Indeed you CAN use semicolons as line delimiters in Ruby as well , the point , however , is that you do n’t have to .
# 4 – Everything is an object , as it should be
When I studied Java they taught me that everything is an object .
- “ So 14 and 374346.678 are objects then ? ”
- “ No , silly , they are numbers ! ”
In Ruby , numbers , strings , Boolean values et al are objects .
Really .
This means you ’ll write things like :
" YOU SHOULDN'T ALWAYS USE CAPITALS " . downcase #=> outputs " you should n't always use capitals " - 12.abs #= > outputs 12
instead of something like :
# PHP Code strtolower ( " YOU SHOULDN'T ALWAYS USE CAPITALS " ) ; abs ( - 12 ) ;
You save time , you save brackets , and it just makes more sense .
# 5 – Everything has a value
Or “ you ’ll hardly ever use return to return values ” .
In a nutshell , all Ruby instructions return a value , even variable assignments , so you do n’t really need to use the “ return ” keyword at the end of a method ; the value of the last assignment or any other expression will always be returned .
# 6 – You can alter your environment in any way you like
The first time I saw this , it really freaked me out .
Imagine a typical programming situation : you start using a system class or a class written by someone else and you notice that you ’d like to have an additional method .
At this point you have a few ways to handle this in ordinary programming languages :
s
You modify the developer ’s source code , if you have access to it .
This is normally not a good idea , and you should n’t do it .
You derive a new class from the original one , and you implement the new method there .
This is a good idea , but it could be overkill for just one method , and you may have to update some of your other code accordingly .
You give up , and you just create the method outside the class , somewhere else .
This can be done , but it is not very elegant and goes against Object Oriented Programming .
In Ruby , you can simply add the method to the original class , without having to hack the original source code , and even for system classes !
You want to have a method to automatically convert a measurement from meters to feet ?
You can simply extend the Numeric class as follows :
class Numeric def feet self * 3.2808399 end end
From now on , all your numbers will have a feet method , which can be used just like any other method that was originally defined for the class :
5.feet #=> Returns 16.4041995
Basically , Ruby classes are never closed and can be modified at any time from anywhere .
Use with care , of course .
# 7 You wo n’t get unicorns from birds and horses , but you ’ll still get donkeys if you want
I distinctly remember my C++ professor at university using animals to illustrate key object - oriented concepts like classes and inheritance .
Weird things came in when she tried to explain multiple inheritance to inherit a class Pegasus from a class Bird and a class Horse .
It had methods like “ fly ” and “ neigh ” … crazy stuff , anyhow , Ruby does not offer multiple inheritance .
This seems to be the trend , after all , and of course it ’s up to tastes .
I do n’t quite fancy multiple inheritances , as they may lead to unpredictable things .
Nevertheless , it is possible to create “ mix-ins ” using Ruby modules , so that members and methods defined in a module will be added to a particular class if the module is included in it .
# 8 You do n’t really need XML
XML is a nice , general - purpose markup language which can be processed by every programming language and used everywhere .
Unfortunately , it can also be quite verbose to write , very difficult to parse , and let ’s be honest , it ’s not really readable at first glance in many cases , unlike the following code snippet :
regexp : !ruby / regexp /a-zA - Z/ number : 4.7 string : a string
This is definitely easier and more readable than XML , is n’t it ?
Welcome to YAML , Ruby ’s favorite markup ( but not really ) language , which can be used to represent any Ruby object in a simple , clear and yet complete way .
Ruby can parse XML , but YAML ’s simplicity convinced a lot of developers to use it as an alternative to XML for configuration files , for example ( Rails does this ) .
The code snipped presented before was obtained by executing the following line of Ruby code :
{ " string " => " a string " , " number " => 4.7 , " regexp " => /a-zA-Z/}.to_yaml
The to_yaml method is defined for the Object class , which is the father of all of the other classes , and thus it is available in all Ruby objects .
This means that you can convert anything into YAML and re-convert anything back into Ruby objects , with total transparency for the developer .
So much for parsing , huh ?
# 9 Lambda is much more than a Greek letter
Ruby borrows some magic from Lisp and Perl with Proc objects and blocks .
Procs are _" blocks of code that have been bound to a set of local variables .
Once bound , the code may be called in different contexts and still access those variables . "
_ Consider the following :
def gen_times ( factor ) return Proc.new { |n| n*factor } end times3 = gen_times ( 3 ) times5 = gen_times ( 5 ) times3.call ( 12 ) #= > 36 times5.call(5 ) #=> 25 times3.call(times5.call( 4 ) ) #=> 60
I could have used the lambda method instead of Proc.new and gotten the same result .
This should ring a bell for people who know Perl and Python ( or Lisp ) .
You can do the same thing in PHP as well , but most people do n’t really use the function .
Additionally , Ruby makes extensive use of blocks , sort of “ unborn Procs ” , for example , to iterate the contents of an object and execute some code , like the each method available for the Array class :
[ 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ] . each { |c| puts c * 2} # = > outputs each element multiplied by 2 in a new line .
Should the code in the block exceed one line , you ’re advised ( but not required ) to include the block within do … end instead of using braces .
Ruby folks do n’t like braces much , really .
# 10 – You can go on Rails
Last but not least , you can always use Ruby on Rails for developing web applications .
Deployment may not be as easy as it is with PHP , but Rails was built in Ruby because Ruby has features no other language can offer .
Conclusion
Time ’s up .
You ’ve probably made up your mind about Ruby already , and you are either playing with it already , or you ’re totally ignoring it .
However , the next time you ’re frustrated because your code looks ugly and you think you could have done the same thing with half the code you got , do n’t blame me !
Notes
I should probably start out by pointing out that the title of this post is a lie .
By definition , RESTful protocols can not be truly SQL - like because they depend on Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URIs aka URLs ) for identifying resources .
URIs on the Web are really just URLs and URLs are really just hierarchical paths to a particular resource similar to the paths on your local file system ( e.g. /users/mark/bobapples , A :\Temp\car.jpeg ) .
Fundamentally URIs identify a single resource or aset of resources .
On the other hand , SQL is primarily about dealing with relational data which meansyou write queries that span multiple tables ( i.e. resources ) .
A syntax for addressing single resources ( i.e. URLs / URIs ) is fundamentally incompatible with a query language that operates over multiple resources .
This was one ofthe primary reasons the W3C created XQuery even though we already had XPath .
That said , being able to perform sorting , filtering , and aggregate operations over a single set of resources via a URI is extremely useful and is a fundamental aspect of the Web today .
As Sam Ruby points out in his blog post Etymology , a search results page is fundamentally RESTful even though its URI identifies a query as opposed to a specific resource or set of resources [ although you could get meta and say it identifies the set of resources that meet your search criteria ] .
Both Google 's Google Base data API and Microsoft's Project Astoria are RESTful protocols for performing sorting , filtering and aggregate operations similar to what you find in SQL over a hierarchical set of resources .
What follows is an overview of the approaches taken by both protocols .
Filtering Results using Predicates ( include supported operators and Google 's full text option )
Although Astoria provides an abstraction over relational data , it does so in a way that supports the hierarchical nature of HTTP URIs .
The primary resource also known as an entity set is placed at the root of the hierarchy ( e.g. the set of allmy customers ) and each relationship to another set of resources is treated as anotherlevel in the hierarchy ( e.g. each customer 's orders ) .
Each step in the hierarchy can be filtered using a predicate .
Below are some query URLs and the results they return
Google Base does not treat the data within it as a hierarchy .
Instead filters / predicates can be applied to one of two Atom feeds ; http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets and http://www.google.com/base/feeds/items which represent all the items within Google Base and all the items a specific user has stored within Google Base respectively .
The latter URL requires the HTTP request to be authenticated .
The first way one can filter results from a Google Base feed is by placing one or more categories as part of the path component .
For example
Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/hotels
Results :
All items from the ' hotels ' category within Google Base Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/jobs|personals
Results :
All items from the ' jobs ' or the ' personals ' category within Google Base Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/-recipes
Results :
All items in Google Base except those from the ' recipes ' category
The second way is to filter results in a Google Base feed is by performing a full text query using the q query parameter .
For example ,
Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets?q=atlanta
Results :
All items within Google Base that contain the string ' atlanta ' in one of their fields Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/hotels?q=atlanta
Results :
All items from the ' hotels ' category within Google Base that contain the string ' atlanta ' in any of their fields Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/hotels|housing?q=seattle|atlanta
Results :
All items from the ' hotels ' or ' housing ' categories within Google Base that contain the string ' seattle ' or ' atlanta ' in any of their fields Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/hotels?q=washington+-dc
Results :
All items from the ' hotels ' category within Google Base that contain the string ' washington ' but not the string ' dc '
The final way to filter results from Google Base feed is by applying a predicate on a field of the item using the bq query parameter .
For example
Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/hotels?bq=[location:seattle]
Results :
All items from the ' hotels ' category that have ' seattle ' in their location field Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/hotels?bq=[location:seattle]&q=ramada
Results :
All items from the ' hotels ' category that have ' seattle ' in their location field and ' ramada ' in any of their other fields Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/-hotels?bq=[location:@ " 1 Microsoft Way , Redmond , WA , USA " + 5 mi ]
Results :
All items from the ' hotels ' category whose location is within 5 miles of " 1 Microsoft Way , Redmond , WA , USA " Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/products?q=zune&bq=[price(float USD ) >=250.0 USD ]
Results :
All items from the ' products ' category whose price is greater than $ 250.00 and have ' zune ' in one of their fields
Supported Datatypes , Operators and Functions
As can be seen from the previous examples , both the Google Base data API and Astoria support operations on fields searching for string matches .
Astoria supports the major SQL datatypes , a list of which can be obtained from the table describing the System .
Data .
SqlTypes namespace in the .NET Frameworks .
The operations that can be performed on the various fields of an entity are the following comparisons
Operator Description eq Equal ne Not equal gt Greater than gteq Greater than or equal lt Less than lteq Less than or equal
The list of datatypes supported by Google Base is provided in the Google Base data API documentation topic on Attribute Types .
In addition to the comparison operators supported by Astoria , the Google Base data API also supports
Operator Description @ " ... " +
Xmi Convert string in quotes to a geocoded location and match anything that is within a radius of X miles / kilometers / meters around it depending on the unit of distance specified name ( type ) : X..Y
Test whether the value of the named attribute [ and optional type ] falls between X and Y ( e.g. [ event date range : 2007-05-20..2007-05 - 25 ] matches all events which fall between both dates ) date - range << date - range
Test if the date on the right hand side is a subset of the date range on the left hand side if boolean - expression then expression else expression Works like an if ... else statement in every programming language you 've ever used .
In addition to these operators , it turns out that the Google Base data API also support a full blown expression language for use within predicates .
This includes a library of over 20 functions from math functions like sin and cos to aggregation functions like sum and count as well as more esoteric functions like dist , exists and join .
Below are some queries which use these operators and functions in action
Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets?q=sale&bq=[item type:vehicles ][ location ( location ) ]
&orderby=[x=location ( location ) : neg ( min( dist( x , @' Seattle , WA ' ) ) ) ]
Results :
All vehicles whose listing contain the text ' sale ' and orders results by those that are geographically closest to the city of Seattle , WA Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/events?bq=[event date range:2007-05-20..2007-05-25 ]
Results :
All events that fall between May 20th 2007 and May 25th 2007
Sorting
Sorting query results is often necessary when working with large amounts of data .
Both Google Base data API and Astoria provide a way to indicate that the results should be sorted based on one or more fields .
In Astoria , sorting is done using the $ orderby query parameter .
For example ,
Query : http://astoria.sandbox.live.com/encarta/encarta.rse/Areas?$orderby=Name
Results :
All areas in the Encarta encyclopedia sorted alphabetically by their Name Query : http://astoria.sandbox.live.com/northwind/northwind.rse/Orders?$orderby=OrderDate desc Results :
All customer orders sorted in descending order by order date Query : http://astoria.sandbox.live.com/northwind/northwind.rse/Orders?$orderby=RequiredDate,Freight
Results :
All customer orders sorted by the required date and the cost of freight
The Google Base data API uses the orderby and sortorder query parameters to control sorting and sort order respectively .
Examples are shown below
Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/jobs?q=program+manager&orderby=salary(int)
Results :
All job listings containing the string ' program manager ' sorted by the salary field Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets?q=sale&bq=[item type:vehicles ][ location ( location ) ]
&orderby=[x=location ( location ) : neg ( min( dist( x , @'Cupertino , CA ' ) ) ) ]
Results :
All vehicles whose listing contain the text ' sale ' and orders results by those that are geographically closest to the city of Seattle , WA Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/housing?bq=[location:@ " 1 Microsoft Way , Redmond , WA , USA " + 5 mi]&orderby=[x=bedrooms ( int ) : if exists ( x ) then max (x ) else 0 ]
Results :
All items within the ' housing ' category that are within 5 miles of Microsoft 's headquarters sorted by number of bedrooms .
For items that do n't have a bedrooms element use the value 0 when sorting
Paging
When dealing with large numbers of items , it often is n't feasible to return all of them in a single XML document for a variety of reasons .
Both the Google Base data API and Astoria provide mechanisms to retrieve results as multiple " pages " .
In Astoria , this is done using a combination of the top and skip query parameters which indicate the number of items to return and what item to start the list from respectively .
Examples below
Query : http://astoria.sandbox.live.com/encarta/encarta.rse/Areas?$orderby=Name&$top=3
Results :
All areas in the Encarta encyclopedia sorted alphabetically by their Name , restricted to only showing 3 items per page Query : http://astoria.sandbox.live.com/encarta/encarta.rse/Areas?$orderby=Name&$top=3&$skip=1
Results :
All areas in the Encarta encyclopedia sorted alphabetically by their Name starting from the second item , restricted to only showing 3 items per page
The Google Base data API uses the max - results and start - index query parameters to indicate the number of items to return and what item to start the list from respectively .
The default value of max - results is 25 while its maximum value is 250 .
The total number of results is emitted in the returned feed as the element openSearch : totalResults .
Examples below
Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/hotels?bq=[location:seattle]&max-results=10
Results :
All hotels within the seattle area , restricted to 10 results per page Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/hotels?bq=[location:seattle]&max-results=50&start-index=100
Results :
All hotels within the seattle area , restricted to 50 results per page starting from the hundredth result
Astoria Specific Features
Using links within items the describe relationships is a core aspect of a RESTful protocol and is utilized by Astoria to show the foreign key relationships between rows / entities in the data base .
However it can be cumbersome to have to make multiple requests and follow every link to get all the content related to an item .
For this reason , Astoria includes the $ expand query parameter which automatically follows the links and retrieves the XML inline .
Compare the following queries
Query : http://astoria.sandbox.live.com/encarta/encarta.rse/Areas[Name eq ' History ' ] / Articles [ Title eq ' Civil War , American ' ]
Results :
The encyclopedia article on the American Civil War which has links to its Area , ArticleBody , Notes and RelatedArticles Query : http://astoria.sandbox.live.com/encarta/encarta.rse/Areas[Name eq ' History ' ] / Articles [ Title eq ' Civil War , American ' ] ?$ expand=ArticleBody , Notes , RelatedArticles Results :
The encyclopedia article on the American Civil War with its Area , ArticleBody and Notes shown inline as XML elements
GData Specific Features
Google Base has a notion of adjusted query results .
When this feature is enabled , Google Base will automatically use spelling correction , stemming and other tricks to try and match results .
For example , if you perform a search for the value " female " in the gender field of an item , the query adjustment engine will know to also match the value " f " in the gender field of any corresponding items .
The query adjustment engine applies its heuristics on queries for field names , field values and item categories .
The documentation is contradictory as to whether this feature is enabled by default or has to be specifically enabled by the user of the API .
Another interesting feature , is that the Google Base data API allows one to filter out repetitive results using a feature called " crowding " .
With this feature , limits can be placed on how many results that match a certain criteria should be returned .
See the following examples for details
Query : http://www.google.com/base/feeds/snippets/-/restaurants?crowdby=cuisine(text):2
Results : Return all restuarants stored within Google Base but show no more than 2 per cusine type
Conclusion
I actually could n't get this feature to work using either the example queries from the documentation or queries I constructed .
It is quite possible that this feature does n't work but is so esoteric that no one has noticed .
In comparing both approaches there is a lot to like and dislike .
I like the " expand " feature in Astoria as well as the fact that I can retrieve XML results from multiple paths of the hierarchy .
However there does seem to be a paucity of operators and functions for better filtering of results .

What happens when you stick nine scientists and engineers in a remote simulated Martian habitat and leave them there for 100 days ?
That is what a group of space scientists were trying to find out .
Their space habitat ( the size and shape of an expected martian abode ) is located near a crater on Devon Island above the Arctic Circle in Canada .
The simulation is an experiment in planetary exploration and its demands .
The team was looking at what happens to a crew in a remote , harsh , close - quartered environment under simulated Martian conditions ( crews would only go outside the habitat during a fully simulated EVA ) when they are working on real science .
" The work that this crew has done will contribute to studies of Mars and to studies of the response of permafrost on Earth to global warming , " said the mission ’s remote science principal investigator Chris McKay , of NASA Ames .
" Their pioneering simulation of crew operations on Mars time is by far the best work on this topic ever done .
It sets the standard for future Mars mission simulations . "
Next to studying global warming , the coolest thing the crew did was take advantage of the 24 hours of summer sunlight in the Arctic to shift all their operations to Martian Time ( a day on Mars is 24 hours and 39 minutes ) .
The crew would simply cover the hab windows from 8 pm to 8 am " local " Mars time every night .
Crew Commander Melissa Battler , a Canadian geologist , commented in her blog that one of the biggest challenges of shifting to Martian time was not when to fall asleep ( which they had no trouble with ) but when to eat !
" Several of us were hungry very frequently during our first 10 days of Mars Time , but our bodies seem to be adjusting now . "
Melissa adds that the extra 39 minutes does make a difference , " [ you ] feel like [ you 're ] getting more work done . "
Life at the end of the planet is not like home .
The crew bakes bread , makes a batch of cheese or yogurt , waters the " crops " ( spouts and lettuce they are growing ) , re-fuels the generator , washes a bit of laundry by hand and prepares home cooked meals to add some spice to the day and the meals .
" We ’ve all become acutely aware of the importance of water conservation , minimizing our garbage output , and generally behaving in a way to minimize our environmental impact . "
It harks back to the postlast week from WorldChanging .com about how extreme space exploration can help make living sustainably sexy .
As Commander Battler says it , " we ’ve all become incredibly self - reliant , and developed many other interesting , useful skills and attitudes , thanks to our isolated home in the Arctic ! "

Knowing AI programming techniques is not sufficient if you want to do either AI research or write AI applications .
Even graduate students in AI ignore the fundamentals -- data structure and algorithm designs and complexity analysis -- much more than they should .
Further , it is insufficient to know that reference books with these topics are available ; you need to know about the techniques to know when and where to look in these references .
One place where lack of fundamentals shows up is in performance .
AI techniques are generally difficult to implement and often slow .
You should n't be too eager to lose performance because you did n't know that available algoithmic techniques could help .
In this article , I look at a technique called " dynamic programming " and show an application of it .
Divide and Conquer
One of the first problem - solving techniques that a LISP programmer learns is divide and conquer -- attacking a problem by breaking it up into independent subproblems , solving them , and combining the results into the ultimate solution .
Simple recursive programs use divide and conquer .
Listing
One shows a slightly unusual definition of factorial that uses a more aggressive approach to divide - and - conquer .
( defun fact ( n ) ( labels ( ( prod ( start end ) ( cond ( (= start end ) start ) ( t ( let ( ( h ( floor (+ start end ) 2 ) ) ) (* ( prod start h ) ( prod ( 1+ h ) end ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( prod 1 n ) ) )
Instead of dividing the problem of n! into n and ( n - 1 ) ! , this solution divides it into :
· 1 ·...n/2
and
( n/2 + 1 ) · ... · n
These problems are multiplied .
The inner function prod computes :
end i · ... · n i = start
It is interesting to compare the running time of this program with the usual recursive definition of factorial :
( defun f ( n ) ( if ( < n 2 ) 1 (* n ( f ( 1- n ) ) ) ) )
When computing 5000 ! , fact is 2.67 times faster than f .
Notice that each performs the same number of multiplications as the other , but the order in which they are performed is different .
The multiplications to compute 8 ! are the following for f : 2*1 , 3*2 , 4*6 , 5* 24 , 6*120 , 7*720 , and 8*5040 .
For fact they are 1*2 , 3*4 , 2*12 , 5* 6 , 7*8 , 30 * 56 , and 24*1680 .
This multiplication makes a difference in the amount of storage used during computation .
Factorial of any number larger than 10 is a bignum , which is the name of the Common LISP type that holds integers that are larger than can be stored as machine integers .
Bignums are allocated in much the same way that cons cells are allocated .
Therefore , during a long calculation like factorial , intermediate bignums are consed and discarded .
If the number of bits required to represent m! is denoted by s , then the number of bits required during the computation of m!
using f is on the order of sm .
The number of bits required using fact is on the order of s log m .
Function f keeps an accumulated value that is repeatedly multiplied by a fixnum , which is a fixed - size quantity represented generally in 32 bits .
m multiplications are mostly of a bignum by a fixnum , and the final result is of size s.
If we think of the nth intermediate result being of size sn /m , the total storage required is on the order of ms .
Function fact creates a bignum of the same size but produces smaller intermediate results .
Let 's look at the first time through the recursive clause in prod .
The midpoint between 1 and m is computed , two subproducts ( p and q ) are computed and are multiplied together .
The resulting bignum has size s , which equals the sum of the sizes of p and q .
Suppose , for ease of argument , that m is a power of 2 , say 2 k .
We can look at the computation tree , which is a perfectly balanced binary tree , and see that the size of bignums at the root is s , as is the sum of the sizes of the two bignums at the level just below the root .
Each level contains subproducts that need to be computed to produce the products on the next higher level .
So , the third level contains four subproducts -- two that are multiplied to get p and two that are multiplied to get q .
Therefore , every level contains numbers in which the sizes total s , and k+1 levels exist .
The total amount of storage consumed is ks or s log 2 m .
This argument relies on the fact that the implementation of the bignum algorithms does not create additional garbage .
Another way to appreciate this argument is to count the number of fixnums that are produced by the multiplication expressions in each function .
While computing 1000 ! , f produces 11 fixnums and fact produces 1,033 fixnums .
fact produces more small intermediate results .
Finally , when computing 3000 ! , f conses 5.5 megabytes , while fact conses 58 kilobytes ; when computing 4000 ! , f conses 10 megabytes , while fact conses 78 kilobytes .
However , many optimization problems cannot be solved by using divide and conquer , which treats each subproblem independently from the others .
In a typical optimization problem , the subproblems are not independent but repeated or shared , and divide and conquer will solve each shared subproblem several times , which might cause significant slowdowns .

George Bush , famous for outlandish claims that have no bearing on reality , has outdone himself by claiming that the problem with Vietnam was that the U.S. withdrew its troops rather than fighting harder and longer .
In a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars , he did n’t say how long the U.S. should have stayed , but he did claim that the reason for the bloodshed in Cambodia , and the prison camps in Vietnam following withdrawal , was not the war itself , but the failure to continue the war without end .
Presumably , then , if Bush were president for life back then , we would still be in Vietnam , the draft would still be in place , and the bloodshed would have continued for decades .
My , what a vision !
You might think this is madness .
In fact , it is the reductio ad absurdum of a particular worldview that he and his friends have adopted .
Along the same lines , a few years ago , William Bennett , the former drug czar turned hyper - gambler , said that we should n’t have abandoned alcohol prohibition .
It was working just fine .
And after it was repealed , drinking went up .
Had we stayed the course , he said , we would be a healthier and more moral society .
Many on the left say we should not have abandoned the 55 mph speed limit .
Things were going just fine .
The repeal has made our roads less safe and increased people ’s dedication to the car and made us more dependent on foreign oil .
Maybe we should n’t have backed away from 90 % income tax rates .
Now the rich get richer , as less of their earnings are tossed to the wind .
Maybe we can do the same about the wage and price controls as during Hoover ’s and FDR ’s New Deals — why the heck did we abandon the war on low prices ?
The same goes for wage and price controls under Nixon in the early seventies — why did we just walk away from the war on high prices ?
For that matter , let ’s go back to the Civil War , especially given the numbers of Confederate flags that still fly outside rural homes south of the Mason Dixon line .
The military occupation and anti-insurgency was going well , and what did we do ?
We cut and ran , and left a whole region to languish in racism and hate .
It ’s interesting how those who believe in force as an article of faith eventually go the whole way , believing that the lessening of force is never the answer , and that all the problems in the world call for one and only one answer : ever more scary threats of violence .
Force , for this crowd , is the great organizing principle of society , the answer to all existing problems now , in the past , and in the future .
It becomes for them the overriding social and political salve , and there are no considerations that can possibly refute this contention .
We saw the extreme result of this mentality in the Soviet Union , which pursued the path of force for 72 years , and blamed all existing failures not on socialism but on the failure to impose this system without any misgivings or regrets .
A dictator with ultimate power can impose such a system until the whole of society crumbles into a heap , and still not be willing to face the errors of his ways .
Force is an article of faith .
To embrace freedom means to concede the limits of power .
In the case of Vietnam , there would have been no such thing as the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia had the U.S. not embraced Pol Pot .
In the same way , al - Qaeda got its start during the Cold War because the U.S. saw the radical Islamicists as anti-communist allies .
The extremists in Afghanistan were once seen as glorious freedom fighters .
Their training camps , guns , and furnished caves were provided courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer .
So it is in Iraq today .
After the U.S. overthrew Saddam ’s government , the plan was to jump - start a new central government under U.S. control .
That ’s when the fighting started .
What group would control it ?
There is no answer to that question , even today .
The U.S. has always thought the Shiites should run the show , religious law and all .
But that plan has n’t worked out .
On the day that Bush delivered his speech about the coming dawn in Iraq , 15 Americans died in combat .
Another 11 were seriously wounded from a suicide bomb .
On the Iraqi side , 154 died and another 175 were wounded .
The death parade marched through Baiji , Baghdad , Tikrit , Iskandariya , Hawija , Flaifel , and Tal Afar .
The mayor of al - Kharba was assassinated .
This was in one day !
Now , to the critical question that vexes all political and social science : why ?
I do n’t mean the proximate cause .
I mean the ultimate cause .
If you are Bush , the answer comes as a matter of faith : these unruly people need more force .
When that does n’t work , the answer is additional force .
When that does n’t work , we need more force still .
And so on , war without end .
There is no refuting these claims since the matter of cause and effect requires a slightly complicated set of deductions .
It is the same with all matters of government control .
It was prohibition of the alcohol trade , not alcohol itself , that generated violence .
It was price controls , not the market pressure for high and low prices , that caused economic problems .
It was the 55 - mile - per - hour speed limit that made criminals out of 100 % of drivers , not the normal propensity to want to get where you are going at a reasonable speed .
And so it is with Iraq .
The desire to get rid of the foreign military occupier is a universal feature of political history .
To recognize the failure of force is to admit that the state cannot accomplish all that it claims it can accomplish .
It is to admit the big lie .
Doing so requires humility , a willingness to own up to mistakes , a desire to face reality and to think about the long term .
These are traits that the state and its managers do not possess in large supply .
Witness : George Bush .
No , Iraq will not blossom like a rose garden the day after U.S. troops leave .
There will be bloodshed , and how much we can not know .
But the critical thing is that these people will be governing themselves , and the critical thing that prevents progress today — the presence of the foreign occupier — will be gone .
The solution is imperfect , to be sure , but it is better than the opposite of turning the entire world into a prison camp run by the U.S. government .

Another defeat for George Bush ’s effort to destroy our basic civil liberties .
A federal judge actually believes in the Constitution :
Two provisions of the USA Patriot Act are unconstitutional because they allow search warrants to be issued without a showing of probable cause , a federal judge ruled Wednesday .
U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken ruled that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , as amended by the Patriot Act , “ now permits the executive branch of government to conduct surveillance and searches of American citizens without satisfying the probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment . ”
Portland attorney Brandon Mayfield sought the ruling in a lawsuit against the federal government after he was mistakenly linked by the FBI to the Madrid train bombings that killed 191 people in 2004 .
Well , I did something apparently no one else cares to do : I looked up the individual suicides .
They are individuals , right ?
With different reasons for doing things ?
And guess what ?
I have another explanation : Ohio .
The headlines read , " Highest increase in youth suicide " and " girls aged 10 - 14 increased 75 % . "
And of course , the only explanation anyone seems to want to debate is antidepressants : was it too many prescriptions , or too few ?
And self - righteous indignation all around .
The year in question is 2004 , the most recent year the data is available .
I focused on girls aged 10 - 14 , because that 's what the majority of the news articles focused on .
Most reports described an increase of 75 % , from 56 - 94 .
I actually found 98 total suicides in this group .
If antidepressants had any effect -- in either direction -- then the increase should have been spread out throughout the country .
Most states had very few suicides in this demographic .
Maine had zero .
North Carolina had 1 . Oregon , 1 . Florida , 1 . Etc .
These small numbers are generally unchanged from 2003 .
California , which had the one of the highest absolute number of suicides , had 6 in 2003 , and 7 in 2004 .
If you look at Ohio , however , you see something interesting .
In 2003 , there were no suicides .
In 2004 , there were 11 .
Indiana was next : 0 in 2003 , 6 in 2004 .
This , of course , speaks to the problem of medicine ’s over - reliance on epidemiology .
People are different , and even “ matched controls ” have such variability that association studies are often nearly useless .
This is even more true in psychiatry .
Suicide is not an involuntary pathogen , it is a complex , volitional behavior whose causes can only be meaningfully investigated at an individual level .
I have to go back and look closely at all the states ' data , etc .
But it seems to me that when two small states account for almost half of the entire increase in the suicides , we should stop talking about antidepressants and maybe go find out what the hell happened over there ?
AUGUST 28 -- Here 's the Minnesota police report memorializing the June 11 arrest of U.S. Senator Larry Craig in an airport bathroom .
The Idaho Republican was nabbed in a men's restroom at the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport after he apparently sought some same - stall action from a plainclothes cop .
In a District Court complaint , Craig was charged with peeping and disorderly conduct .
He pleaded guilty earlier this month to the misdemeanor disorderly conduct count and was fined $ 1000 and sentenced to ten days in the Hennepin County lockup ( though the jail time was stayed as long as the politician keeps clean for a year ) .
According to the Airport Police Department report by Sgt. Dave Karsnia , Craig , 62 , appeared versed in the subtle signs of seeking a stall assignation , from under - the - divider hand motions to some furtive footsie .
For his part , Craig denies engaging in lewd conduct and contends that Karsnia ( pictured above left ) misconstrued his actions .
As for his expeditious plea , Craig now regrets admitting guilt , a realization that directly coincides with Roll Call 's unearthing of the details of his bathroom bust .
In a press conference today , Craig claimed he " did nothing wrong at the Minneapolis airport , " contradicting the plea agreement he signed earlier this month .
That document , a copy of which can be found here , includes an acknowledgement that the court will not accept a plea from anyone who believes they are innocent .
Along with being fingerprinted by cops , the business suit - wearing Craig posed for mug shots , which can be found here .
Like most senators , he had an American flag pin attached to his lapel .

Rescuers work near the blocked tunnel in Utah 's Crandall Canyon mine where six coal miners are trapped .
The mine collapse last night that killed and injured rescuers at a Utah coal mine generated seismic waves that reveal the event was a collapse and not a natural earthquake , seismologists say .
And increasingly strong evidence also supports the claim that the magnitude - 3.9 seismic event that initially trapped six miners on Aug. 6 was the mine collapse itself and also not a natural earthquake , say seismologists at the University of Utah .
The University Seismograph Stations recorded a magnitude - 1.6 event at about 6:39 p.m. local time ( 8:39 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time ) yesterday , which experts say was caused by a " mountain bump , " in which ground shifting sent chunks of rocks from the mine walls .
Characteristics of the seismic waves indicated downward motion , which is consistent with further settling and collapse within the mountain where the Crandall Canyon mine is located .
Seismologists say such a " mountain bump " is also responsible for the collapse that trapped the miners more than three miles down in the central part of the Utah mine .
The earth - shaking that occurred at the time of the original mine collapse ( 2:48 a.m. local , 4:48 a.m. EDT , Aug. 6 ) , as well as " after - events , " also indicate downward motion , which is not characteristic of motion generated by natural or " tectonic " earthquakes , said Relu Burlacu , network manager for the University of Utah Seismograph Stations .
This information backs up what seismologists already call strong evidence pointing to the mine collapse itself causing the seismic spikes and not a natural earthquake .
" These events seem to be related to the ongoing settling of the rock mass following the main collapse on Aug. 6 , " Burlacu said .
Unlike natural earthquakes , the seismic " bump " Thursday night was very shallow .
Initial recordings indicating it was less than one - tenth of a mile deep , but considering uncertainties in determining depths of such seismic events , it is more conservative to say the shaking began less than a mile underground , Burlacu said .
In any case , either depth is quite unlike natural earthquakes , which typically originate deeper .
The number of " after - events " detected within two miles of the mine as of this morning was 22 , of which 12 were recorded on Aug. 6 and Aug. 7 .
The University Seismograph Stations installed five new seismometers near the mine , which now are detecting more of the small seismic after - events and waves .
Walter Arabasz , director of the University of Utah Seismograph Stations , examined years of seismic data in the arc - shaped area in eastern
Utah where coal mining takes place .
His results showed that less than 2 percent of all seismicity in the region can be linked with tectonic earthquakes .
The remaining 98 percent is caused by mining activity .
After last evening 's cave - in , all rescue workers were evacuated from the mine and underground work came to a halt there .
NetEvents
Have you been a Skype user for ages ?
Noticed that it is n't as good as it was ?
Silent moments , repeated sounds , buzzes ?
Here 's the good news : it 's almost certainly fixable .
The bad news ?
You have to lobby your cable company to fix it .
It turns out that a company called Sandvine is now boasting of its ability to " manage " peer to peer traffic over the internet .
What this means , simply , is that if your ISP does n't like what you 're doing with your internet connection , it can slow you down .
Sandvine told delegates to this week 's NetEvents Summit here in Garmisch , Germany , that peer to peer services like BitTorrent and eDonkey - and Skype - were now forcing internet service providers to increase capacity .
" From our survey , we can tell that out of all the traffic coming into the network , 60 per cent is peer to peer ; and 70 per cent of the upstream traffic is also peer to peer , " said the company today .
The number of file sharers has risen dramatically , says Sandvine .
" Users are moving from sharing three meg songs to uploading and downloading 600 gig movies .
That means that service providers have had to apply a lot of traffic assistance for this increased traffic . "
Traffic assistance ?
" Reducing the number of sessions that are allowed .
Nobody wants to control customers and say what they can and cannot do ... but ISPs want some control to reduce the cost . "
This " control " and " traffic assistance " started in the cable sector : cable companies are designed to transmit data out , not receive it in .
It was set up to send TV signals from a central broadcast station , out to all subscribers .
But today 's broadband users want to upload as much as they download .
BitTorrent sends data , not from a central supplier , but from one user to another .
And when the second user has the data , they become a supplier : they start uploading to the next downloader - doubling the capacity ; and soon after , there will be six uploaders .
Peer to peer file sharing is categorised by many ISPs and copyright owners as " wicked " but in fact , it will be used for software distribution - Microsoft itself is trying to set up a peer to peer technology , to take the heavy download work off its expensive servers when releasing new versions .
And Linux releases like Slackware have been freely available since BitTorrent , when they were almost totally unreachable from private servers .
A reader recently forwarded an interesting article to me ( which I encourage everyone to do ) about the real estate generation gap .
This article does a fantastic job in presenting a very real problem with our current real estate situation .
With an already soft real estate market the prospect of even more homes fueling the inventory makes the situation potentially much worse .
The Problem
Baby boomers have fueled the housing market for the past 10 - 15 years as their kids moved out and a strong economy allowed them to buy or build a bigger house .
As retirement draws near , many of these boomers find they no longer need as much house or are possibly looking to move .
Typically that would n’t be a problem , but it is .
The problem is that many of those in Generation X do not seek or have a desire to own a large home , or are n’t even at a stage in their careers where that type of purchase can be made .
As more and more boomers seek retirement and the sale of their homes , who are the buyers ?
A False Sense of Worth
Another big problem with the boomer generation is that many find the bulk of their net worth tied up into real estate .
Many of these individuals purchased or built a new home during the rapid expansion of the 90’s and saw home values double or triple in some places .
This growth fueled the idea of using their homes to fund a large portion of their retirement .
As home prices level off and begin to fall in some areas these people will not be able to get what they want for their home .
Some will simply refuse to sell at the discounted price while others will sell and take a significant hit .
Suddenly they realize that they do n’t have the money they thought they did .
Unfortunately this is all too real .
I met with a woman just this week who was planning on retiring in the coming year and was seeking advice .
Her retirement account was valued at under $ 40,000 and she said she realized it was n’t enough .
So I asked what her plans were , if she was going to continue working part time or had other savings and she said no .
She told me that she had planned on using her home for the majority of her retirement when she sold it and moved , but she was upset because she ca n’t sell it for what she feels it is worth right now and does n’t know what to do .
A very sad story indeed .
How Serious is the Problem ?
Clearly the soft housing market is a cause for concern for these people , but how serious is it ?
According to the article :
If every single member of Generation X wanted to buy one of the baby boomers ’ 34 million homes , and every single boomer wanted to vacate , all the homes would get sold , with 15 million Gen Xers left over .
But the numbers do n’t actually work out like that , since most young would - be buyers are coupled up .
In reality , there are n’t nearly enough Gen X households to go around — and it ’s not a generation that particularly likes the big homes that many boomers have gone for , anyway .
That is a problem .
Clearly not every boomer will sell just like not every
Gen X person will be buying , but the numbers are fairly alarming .
There are many more boomers than our generation and we do n’t even care to live in the houses they do , who is going to buy ?
First - Hand Experience
With my parents being a part of the boomer generation and myself as part of Generation X I have seen this scenario play out almost to the letter .
Growing up we lived in the same home for nearly my entire life .
It was a small single family home with 3 bedrooms and one bath in a somewhat rural setting .
This was my parent ’s first home and they were able to buy it for under six - figures .
As we got older and the surrounding area began to grow the value of the home continued to rise , and they knew they had a nice investment on their hands .
When I went off to college they decided they wanted to upgrade a bit .
Having lived in the same house for nearly 20 years while it nearly tippled in value it seemed like a good time to sell .
Sure enough , this was in the 90’s and they were able to easily fetch the asking price .
In realizing this sizable profit they decided to parcel off some of the land they owned and build a brand new home they have always dreamed of .
The home was built and it was beautiful .
It is everything they wanted and more .
Unfortunately the cost to build a new home in the same area in the late 90 ’s cost a pretty penny .
Having gone through the process of watching their previous home appreciate in value they saw this as a wise investment since they assumed it could be sold when they want to retire for another sizable return .
Unfortunately this is n’t the case .
The area has a depressed economy due to the decreasing manufacturing industry that it relies on in the surrounding area .
As more people are leaving the area than moving in home prices have taken a big hit .
To further compound the problem my parents are reaching retirement and no longer have the desire to continue the long commute to work each day and would like to live closer to work in the last few years .
They are going to try and put the house on the market in a few months but they already realize they are not likely to sell it for what they expect it to be worth and could lose money .
So much for that investment .
Typical Baby Boomer Real Estate Cycle :
Start out with a modest first home to raise a family
As the kids grow old and begin to move out , upgrade to a new and / or larger house
As retirement nears , relocate or move into a smaller home
The problem is that our younger generation does n’t want their McMansions or large homes .
Our generation is waiting longer to get married , having fewer kids and focusing on building careers .
We do n’t have a need for larger homes nor can we afford what our parents are asking for them .
The boomers are left holding the bag , and I ’m not sure how this will ultimately play out .
I encourage you to read the article over at the Boston Globe as it touches on many additional issues that I did not .
It is a very interesting read .

At least one in 10 web pages are booby - trapped with malware , according to Google .
A five - strong Google research team found that 450,000 pages , out of a sample of 4.5 million pages , contained scripts to install malicious code , such as Trojans and spyware on vulnerable PCs , the BBC reports .
This is a conservative estimate - another 700,000 pages given the once - over were thought to be suspicious by Google .
Google 's Ghost in the Browser study ( PDF ) covers the well - understood problem of drive - by - downloads from compromised sites , which are eclipsing virus - infected email as a means to spread malware .
The study takes the debate further chiefly by presenting evidence about the sheer volume of web content on the " dark side " of the net .
As well as hacker - run websites , malware can be injected into otherwise legitimate site via a variety of ruses , the Google team explains .
The tricks include hacking into a web server to plant malware , or planting it within third - party widgets or advertising .
User - generated content also creates a means to upload malware .
The researchers hope to use their findings to " map " the problem and aid the development of a new generation of safe surfing tools that steer users away from harm . ®

In foreground is a System Browser ( what I call a “ code browser ” – the default developer IDE ) , and one of the desktop “ flaps ” on the right ( like a “ quick launch ” bar–it retracts ) .

The bar at the top contains some system menus and desktop controls .

Smalltalk is misunderstood .
It ’s often criticized as one big lock - in platform ( like Microsoft Windows , I guess ) , or as I saw someone say , a “ walled garden ” , or more often a language that ’s “ in its own little world . ”
I think all of these interpretations come about because of this misunderstanding : people think Smalltalk is just a language running on a VM .
Period .
They do n’t understand why it has its own development tools , and its own way of interacting .
That does n’t seem like a typical language to them , but they ca n’t get past this notion .
The truth is Smalltalk is unlike anything most programmers have ever seen before .
It does n’t seem to fit most of the conventions that programmers are trained to see in a language , or a system .
We ’re trained that all an operating system represents to a user or a programmer is a manager of resources , and an interaction environment .
Programs are stored inactive on disk , along with our data files .
We learn that we initiate our programs by starting them from a command line , or clicking on an icon or menu item , through the interaction environment of the OS .
When a program is run , it is linked into the system via .
a loader , assigned an area of memory , and given access to certain OS resources .
Programs are only loaded into memory when they ’re running , or put into a state of stasis for later activation .
We ’re trained that a “ virtual machine , ” in the .
Net or JVM sense , is a runtime that executes bytecodes and manages its own garbage collected memory environment , and is strictly there to run programs .
It may manage its own threads , or not .
It becomes active when it ’s running programs , and becomes inactive when we shut those programs down .
It ’s a bit like a primitive OS without its own user interaction model .
It remains hidden to most people .
We ’re trained that programming languages are compilers or interpreters that run on top of the OS .
Each is a separate piece : the OS , the development tools , and the software we run .
They are linked together only occasionally , and only so long as a tool or a piece of software is in use .
Smalltalk runs against the grain of most of this conventional thinking .
Like its predecessor , Smalltalk - 80 , Squeak functions like an operating system ( in Smalltalk - 80 ’s case , it really was an OS , running on the Xerox Alto a Xerox computer ) .
The reason I say “ like ” an OS , is while it implements many of the basic features we expect from an OS , it does n’t do everything .
In its current implementation it does not become the OS of your computer , nor do any of the other Smalltalk implementations .
It does n’t have its own file system , nor does it natively handle devices .
It needs an underlying OS .
What distinguishes it from runtimes , like .
Net and the JVM , is it has its own GUI –its own user interaction environment ( which can be turned off ) .
It has its own development tools , which run inside this interaction environment .
It multitasks its own processes .
It allows the user to interactively monitor and control background threads through the Process Monitor that also runs inside the environment .
Like Lisp ’s runtime environment , everything is late - bound , unlike .
Net and the JVM .
Everything is more integrated together : the kernel , the Smalltalk compiler , the UI , the development tools , and applications .
All are implemented as objects running in one environment .
Creating a unified language / OS system was intentional .
Alan Kay , the designer of the Smalltalk language , was in a discussion recently on operating systems on the Squeak developers list .
He said that an operating system is just the part that ’s not included in a programming language .
In his opinion , a language should be an integral part of what we call an OS .
His rationale was that in order for a program to run , it needs the facilities of the OS .
The OS governs I/O , and it governs memory management .
What ’s the point in keeping a language separate from these facilities if programs are always going to need these things , and would be utterly useless without them ?
( Update 12-14-2010 : Just a note of clarification about this paragraph .
Though Alan Kay ’s utterance of this idea was the first I ’d heard of it , I ’ve since seen quotes from Dan Ingalls ( the implementor of Smalltalk ) , from material written a few decades ago , which suggest that the idea should be attributed to him .
To be honest I ’m not real sure who came up with it first . )
Another reason that there ’s misunderstanding about Smalltalk is people think that the Smalltalk language is trying to be the “ one language to rule them all ” in the Squeak / Smalltalk environment .
This is not true .
If you take a look at other systems , like Unix / Linux , Windows , or Mac OS , most of the code base for them was written in C .
In some OSes , some of the code is probably even written in assembly language .
What are the C/C++ compilers , the Java and .
Net runtimes , and Python and Ruby written in ?
They ’re all written in C .
Why ?
Is C trying to be the “ one language to rule them all ” on those systems ?
No , but why are they all written in the same language ?
Why are n’t they written in a variety of languages like Pascal , Lisp , or Scheme ?
I think any of them would be capable of handling the task of translating source code into machine code , or creating an interpreter .
Sure , performance is part of the reason .
The main one , though , is that all of the operating systems are fundamentally oriented around the way C does things .
The libraries that come with the OS , or with the development systems , are written in it .
Most of the kernel is probably written in it .
Pascal , assuming it was not written in C , could probably handle dealing with the OS , but it would have a rough time , due to the different calling conventions that are used between it and C. Could Lisp , assuming its runtime was n’t written in C , either , interact with the OS with no help from C ?
I doubt it , not unless the OS libraries allowed some kind of universal message passing scheme that it could adapt to .
A major reason Smalltalk seems to be its “ own little world ” is like any OS , it needs a large variety of tools , applications , and supporting technologies to feel useful to most users , and Smalltalk does n’t have that right now .
It does have its own way of doing things , but nothing says it ca n’t be changed .
As an example , before Monticello came along , versioning used to only take place in the changesets , or via .
filing out classes to text files , and then saving them in a version control system .
Saying Smalltalk is isolating is equivalent to saying that BeOS is a “ walled garden , ” and I ’m sure it would feel that way to most .
Is any OS any less a “ walled garden ” ?
It may not seem like it , but try taking a Windows application and run it on a Mac or Linux without an emulator , or vice versa .
You ’ll see what I mean .
It ’s just a question of is the walled garden so big it does n’t feel confining ?
Having said this , Squeak does offer some opportunities for interoperating with the “ outside world . ”
Squeak can open sockets , so it can communicate via .
network protocols with other servers and databases .
There ’s a web service library so it can communicate in SOAP .
Other commercial implementations have these features as well .
Squeak also has FFI ( Foreign Functionality Interface ) , and OSProcess libraries , which enables Squeak programmers to initiate processes that run on the underlying OS .
As I mentioned a while ago , someone ported the wxWidgets library to it , called wxSqueak , so people can write GUI apps .
that run on the underlying OS .
There ’s also Squeak / .
Net Bridge , which allows interaction with the .
Net runtime , in a late - bound way ( though .
Net makes you work harder to get what you want in this mode ) .
So , Squeak at least is not an island in principle .
Its system support could be better .
Other languages like Ruby have more developed OS interoperability libraries at this point .
The “ C/ C++ effect ” you see on most other systems is the equivalent of what you see in Squeak .
The Smalltalk language is the “ C ” of the system .
The reason most software out there , even open source , ca n’t run on it , is at a fundamental level , they ’re all written in C or C ++.
The system languages are so different .
Smalltalk also represents a very different system model .
What Smalltalk , and especially Squeak , has achieved that no other system has achieved to date , with the exception of the Lisp machines of old , is a symbolic virtual machine environment that is more relevant to its own use than any other runtime environment out there .
In .
Net and the JVM , you just use their runtimes to run programs .
They ’re rather like the old operating systems at the beginning of computing , which were glorified program loaders , though they have some sophisticated technical features the old OSes did n’t have .
With Squeak , you ’re not just running software on it , you ’re using the VM as well , interacting with it .
Squeak can be stripped down to the point that it is just a runtime for running programs .
There are a few Squeak developers who have done that .
In Smalltalk , rather than machine code and C being software ’s primary method of interacting with the machine , bytecode and the Smalltalk language are the basic technologies you work with .
This does n’t mean at all that more languages could n’t be written to run in the Smalltalk environment .
I have no doubt that Ruby or Python could be written in Smalltalk , and used inside the environment , with their syntax and libraries intact .
The way in which they ’d be run ( initiated ) would be different , but at heart they would be the same as they are now .
Both Apple and Microsoft are moving towards the Smalltalk model , with the Cocoa development environment on the Mac , and .
Net / WPF on Windows .
Both have you write software that can run in a bytecode - executing runtime , though the OS is still written in large part in compiled - to - binary code .
If desktop OSes have a future , I think we ’ll see them move more and more to this model .
Even so , there remain a couple of major differences between these approaches : Smalltalk uses a late - binding model for everything it does , so it does n’t have to be shut off every time you want to change what ’s running inside it .
Even programs that are executing in it do n’t have to be stopped .
.
Net uses an early - binding model , though it emulates late binding pretty well in ASP .
Net now .
I ca n’t comment on Cocoa and Objective C , since I have n’t used them .
Another difference is , like Linux , Squeak is completely open source .
So everything is modifiable , right down to the kernel .
As I ’ll get into in my next post , this is a double - edged sword .
Update 7/20/07 : I found this in the reddit comments to this blog post .
Apparently , there is a version of Squeak that IS an operating system , called SqueakNOS , that allows you to boot your computer into Squeak , as if it was an OS .
The name stands for “ Squeak No Operating System ” ( underneath it ) .
It comes in an ISO image that you can burn to CD .
From the screenshot , it shows that it has a concept of devices , displaying tabs for the CD - ROM drive , serial port , and NIC .
I think I had heard the name of SqueakNOS before this , but I did n’t know what it was .
The version of Squeak that most people have is the kind that rides on top of an existing OS , not this , but it ’s nice to know that this is out there .
Personally , I like the kind I have , since it allows me to do what I like doing in Squeak , and if I want resources it does n’t have available , then I can go to the OS I ’m running .
I used to hear about a version of Linux that ran this way , so people did n’t have to dual boot , or use virtualization software .
There ’s no “ dishonor ” in it .
One person in the reddit comments said they wished it had a “ good web browser that supported AJAX . ”
Me too .
There is a HTML browser called “ Scamper ” , available from SqueakMap .
It used to be included in the image , but in the latest version from squeak.org it looks like it ’s been taken out .
It seems that lately , Squeak developers have preferred the idea of having Squeak control the default browser on your system ( IE , Safari , Firefox , etc. ) to using a browser internal to Squeak .
The last I saw Scamper , it was a bare - bones HTML browser that just displayed text in a standard system font .
It could be better .
Update 1/18/20 : I happened to research SqueakNOS last year for a bit , and found out it did n’t technically run as the computer ’s operating system .
It just acted like one .
What actually happened is the computer booted into a stripped down version of Linux , which automatically ran Squeak as its sole application at boot up .
This is how Chromebooks operate .
My guess is the device management in SqueakNOS manipulated drivers in Linux .
NASA Prepares for Performing New Science on the Moon
Press Release From : NASA HQ
Posted : Thursday , June 21 , 2007
WASHINGTON -- NASA has selected proposals for future lunar science activities and established two new programs that will enhance research made possible by the Vision for Space Exploration .
The proposals and programs are part of an effort by NASA to develop new opportunities to conduct important science investigations during the planned renewal of human exploration of the moon .
In a highly competitive selection , NASA chose seven proposals from more than 70 submissions under the Lunar Sortie Science Opportunities ( LSSO ) Program .
These newly funded efforts in the space science community will complement two new programs established in the Science Mission Directorate 's Planetary Sciences Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington : the Lunar Advanced Science and Exploration Research ( LASER ) Program and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) Participating Scientist Program .
The seven selected proposals will result in advanced development for simple , autonomous instrument packages deployed on the lunar surface by astronauts .
Such " suitcase science " packages could open up a wide variety of research applications regarding the moon and the lunar environment .
Some of the funded efforts will help scientists understand the lunar dust that creates problems for astronauts on the moon .
Other studies will provide a better understanding of the moon 's interior , look for natural resources on the lunar surface and use lasers to provide precise information about the position of the moon and its features .
" The proposals we received show that the scientific community is excited about the opportunity to capitalize on the nation 's planned lunar outpost .
The moon has much to teach us about itself , the history of our solar system , and even the history of the sun .
In the future , more and more scientists will be able to participate in lunar research as we focus attention on Earth 's fascinating satellite , " said Alan Stern , associate administrator for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate .
Selected proposals are :
-- Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , William Banerdt , Principal Investigator ( PI ) " Autonomous Lunar Geophysical Experiment Package "
-- Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , Slava Turyshev ( PI ) " Lunar Laser Transponder and Retroreflector Science "
-- Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt , Md. , Daniel Glavin ( PI ) " Volatile Analysis by Pyrolysis of Regolith on the Moon using Mass Spectrometry "
-- Goddard Space Flight Center , Patrick Taylor ( PI ) " Seismology and Heat flow instrument package for Lunar Science and Hazards "
-- Southwest Research Institute , Boulder , Colo. , Donald Hassler ( PI ) " Lunar Radiation Environment and Regolith Shielding Experiment "
-- U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center , Fort Wainwright , Ark. , Jerome Johnson ( PI ) " Lunar Suitcase Science : A Lunar Regolith Characterization Kit "
-- Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp. , Boulder , Colo. , Christian Grund ( PI ) " Autonomous Lunar Dust Observer "
Under the planned LASER program , proposals will be solicited for investigations to increase knowledge of the moon while also providing necessary information for humans to live and work there .
Studies may include simulations and laboratory work to better understand the lunar environment and its hazards , such as dust and radiation .
The program also will support analysis of existing lunar data , including the Apollo and robotic mission data archives , and work to understand the origin and evolution of the moon .
In the upcoming LRO Participating Scientist Program , NASA will select researchers to perform detailed investigations using instruments aboard the LRO spacecraft during its first years in lunar orbit .
Proposals for both programs are due Sept. 7 , 2007 .
LRO is NASA 's next orbital mission to the moon .
Launch is planned in late 2008 .
It will orbit the moon for at least one year , providing data to accelerate opportunities for future science missions and human exploration .
Details on NASA 's lunar research programs are available at :

RIAA Refuses to Share Even After Verdict in Defendant 's Favor
nikiwoods on February 23 , 2007
In a move to alleviate some of the damage done to its future prospects of winning on file sharing infringement cases , the RIAA decided to appeal the attorneys_ fees awarded to the prevailing defendant in a copyright infringement claim .
The RIAA sued Debbie Foster in November 2004 because file - sharing activity was found on an IP address assigned to an internet account in her name .
( Capitol v. Foster )
It was quickly discovered that it was actually Debbie_s adult daughter , Amanda , who was doing the infringing , and Debbie had no knowledge of the activity .
( Ars Technica story ) The RIAA named Amanda as a defendant in the action , which resulted in a default judgment against her when she didn_t answer the complaint .
However , plaintiffs kept Debbie on as a defendant also , claiming that the use of her IP address to file share was enough for her to be held liable .
Debbie filed a counterclaim against the RIAA for a " declaratory judgment of noninfringment " .
The Oklahoma court ruled in July 2006 , however , that Debbie was in no way secondarily or contributorily liable based simply on the fact that her IP address was being used for the infringing activity .
The court ruled that in order for someone to be liable for the copyright infringement of another , in addition to direct infringement by the third party , the person to be held liable would need to both know about the infringement and substantially participate in the infringement .
The court dismissed both claims and declared Debbie the _prevailing party_ .
If other courts take hold of this reasoning , this will make it very hard for the RIAA to go after individuals for file sharing based on the IP address alone .
Evidence of knowledge and participation will become much more important .
In an even bolder move , the court ruled this February 7 that Debbie was also entitled to reasonable attorneys_ fees .
The RIAA filed a motion to appeal those fees .
It argues that even if there is no knowledge of the activity , account owners should be held secondarily or contributorily liable if their IP addresses are being used for infringement .
The RIAA claims she should have known about the activity because her contract with her ISP required her to keep her account clear of copyright infringement .
The RIAA also claimed that the discovery process was cut short , arguing that additional evidence of Debbie_s knowledge might have turned up eventually .
In fact , the RIAA stated , _the computer may well have been in a common area such that defendant heard music coming from the computer when admitted infringer Amanda Foster was using it ._
As Ars Technica puts it , _ That_s right_the RIAA is arguing that [ the ] mere act of listening to music on one_s PC is evidence of copyright infringement ._
This case is a big deal for the RIAA and other plaintiffs alleging copyright infringement through file sharing .
The possibility of successful defendants being awarded attorneys_ fees means they might have to think twice about throwing these types of suits around .

Marek Safar reports on the progress on the C# 3.0 compiler front :
This week : Finished 3.0 type inference .
Next Week : Review and finish the implementation of collection initializers and anonymous types .
They are the only remaining bits to have all LINQ components ready for the integration .
Pretty much all the C# 3.0 features are now completed .
As Marek points out there are a couple of areas that still need some work ( collection initializers and anonymous types ) , but we are in good shape to complete the LINQ support in Mono 's C# compiler .
JB Evain has also been busy creating a new profile of our compiler for developing Silverlight applications .
The new command is smcs and it differs from gmcs in the following ways :
It enables - langversion : linq by default ( so C# 3.0 is the default in the Silverlight profile ) .
Generates assemblies that reference the 2.1.0.0 mscorlib ( as opposed to 2.0 that gmcs does ) .
It references by default all the Silverlight assemblies .
With mcs and gmcs we only reference System and System .
XML by default .
We felt that in the case of Silverlight we could reference all the libraries needed by default .
The majority of our C# 3.0 support will be available in Mono 1.2.5 .
The recent developments ( type inference ) did not make it into the release , so folks will have to wait for 1.2.6 .
As of this month , the German language is officially " reformed . "
After more than a decade of bitter debate , new grammar rules for the world 's 100 million native German speakers are now set in stone .
That may sound like big news , but chances are you have n't heard ein wort about it .
Even in Germany the event has been met with something akin to a news blackout , but then again , the vast majority of Germans detest the reforms .
I learned about them by accident while complaining about the language 's user - unfriendliness .
" No problem , " my bemused German companion assured me , " as of Monday , it will be easier . "
As of Monday ?
" Beginning Monday , the rules will have changed for good , " he continued .
" And everyone must follow them . "
I was already having difficulty putting together simple sentences ; would I now be fined for my ineptitude ?
Thankfully not , I learned ; only children would be penalized !
The government - mandated changes will be incorporated into their textbooks .
To anyone who has suffered through German 's torturous grammar rules , the concept of language reform is probably music to your ears .
Every noun in the German language is deemed masculine , feminine , or neuter and is preceded by its appropriate article .
Depending on a word 's " case , " or construction , Germans have more than a dozen different ways to say " the " and " a . "
Even more mysterious are the verbs , which frequently reside at the end of a sentence or are split in half and placed as far away from one another as possible .
And one must not forget the compoundwordsthatareaboutthislong .
Given these complications , I 've found myself in the unenviable position of trying to communicate without nouns or verbs .
But adjectives get one only so far .
The Germans have known for a long time that their grammar is confusing , even for native speakers .
The first attempts at reforming the language of Schiller and Goethe occurred more than 100 years ago , when grammarians worked to standardize it .
Nearly half a century later , the Nazis planned to institute language reforms , but the war cut those efforts short .
The impetus behind the reform is the German - speaking world 's penchant for grammar rules and the difficulty for students in learning them .
Many of these rules for spelling and punctuation , developed over centuries , have been deemed ambiguous and unsystematic .
The latest reform , begun in the early 1990s and led by expert grammarians from Germany , Austria , and Switzerland , set out to simplify the language : Grammar rules were reduced from 212 to 112 , and those governing commas dropped from 52 to a mere 9 .
The changes mainly addressed written grammar and have little effect on the spoken word .
Nevertheless , the so - called grammar simplification , which was adopted by the three governments ' education ministries in 1996 , faced stiff opposition : Several German states and regional newspapers refused to adopt the measures .
A number of authors , including Günter Grass , rebelled .
Until the German supreme court ruled in favor of the reforms in 1998 , they appeared headed for the big chalkboard in the sky .
But doubts persisted , and yet another group of experts was assembled to " reform the reform . "
As one German friend put it : People wanted their commas back .
The new rules were instituted in 2006 with a one - year grace period that has just ended .
In the meantime , it 's the German schoolchildren who will bear the brunt of the changes .
It is not enough for a child to hand in a well - written essay ; it also must be grammatically flawless .
Teachers are instructed to count every misplaced comma and misspelled word , multiply them by 100 , and then divide the resulting number by the total number of words in an essay .
Enough errors , and one 's grades can drop precipitously .
And I thought I had it bad .

Once a single journalist could speak for the whole of America .
Last week an extraordinary editorial in the New York Times demonstrated the limits of the press in a diffuse media age .
Paul Harris reports
It was a journalistic moment that harked back to an older age of the power of print .
The venerable New York Times , one of the world 's most famous newspapers , was delivering a devastating verdict on the war in Iraq .
American troops should leave , it declared .
In a stark editorial , it called for withdrawal from Iraq , essentially announcing that the war had failed and that the troops needed to come home as soon as possible .
It was a potentially historic stance by the most powerful institution in American print journalism .
In an interview with The Observer , the paper 's Editorial Page Editor , Andrew Rosenthal , laughed when asked how long the decision to call time on the Iraq war had been in the works .
' Four years , ' he said .
The editorial set off a firestorm of debate , prompting both outrage and support .
Some portrayed it as Iraq 's ' Cronkite moment ' , comparing it to the famous broadcast when legendary TV newscaster Walter Cronkite came out against the Vietnam war .
But the real story of the New York Times editorial lies not in what it said about the conduct of the war in Iraq .
It lies in the way it exposed the nature and role of the media in covering that war .
Whereas Cronkite 's huge profile was able to influence the national debate on Vietnam , the modern media world is a far more fractured place .
In fact , the main impact of the editorial was to trigger a fight in the media , not a debate over Iraq policy .
Far more than in the 1960s , the modern American media landscape is divided into warring tribes who seem to spend at least as much time attacking each other as attacking the administration of the day .
The reaction of conservative media was ferocious , with many saying that the paper was embracing American military defeat .
The Washington Times said the paper was part of an ' appeasement caucus ' .
Fox News TV presenter Bill O'Reilly went further .
He lambasted the paper as having ' declared defeat ' in Iraq .
' So there is joy in far Leftville , ' he blustered .
But perhaps nowhere was the venom heaped on the newspaper more poisonous than on right - wing blogs .
' I liked the NYT better when it had a liberal bias , rather than the current bias in favour of the Islamic right , ' one commenter said .
On the floor of the Senate , Republican presidential hopeful John McCain stood up and tried to rebut the editorial point - by - point .
He said that the paper did not understand the purpose of the war .
' According to the New York Times , it is not worth fighting to prevent genocide , ' he said .
For Rosenthal , the reaction was expected and profoundly misplaced , especially the criticism that a withdrawal of American troops would lead to bloody civil war :
' The spin from the right now is that we are aiding and abetting a genocide ... but the fact is that what 's happening in Iraq is not going to be a consequence of America leaving , it is going to be a consequence of the American invasion of Iraq in the first place . '
Neither was it only the right that heaped it on the New York Times .
The attacks from some on the left , especially in the increasingly influential world of liberal bloggers , were equally tough .
Many took the line that the paper was far too late in finally deciding to call for the troops to come home .
Others used it as an excuse to again attack the paper for its coverage of WMD issues before the war , especially by the now discredited reporter Judy Miller .
' A lot of them wrote that all this is because of Judy Miller , which is ludicrous .
The degree to which Judy Miller was responsible for our coverage of the run-up to the war has become just propaganda , ' Rosenthal said .
' It is absurd . '
But there was no doubting the tone of the editorial .
The New York Times was firmly coming down on the anti-war side of the barricades , a place from which there can be no reverse of position .
It basically consisted of a single sentence separated out at the top of the article under the headline : ' The Road Home ' .
It read : ' It is time for the United States to leave Iraq , without any more delay than the Pentagon needs to organise an orderly exit . '
There followed a lengthy piece detailing the analysis behind that simple but devastating indictment .
Rosenthal said the piece had been in the works for at least three weeks , being edited and revised , but that it was the culmination of a much longer process of working out the newspaper 's thoughts on the conflict : ' We have been talking for months about taking the next step . '
The importance of the New York Times 's move was swiftly revealed as a host of other newspapers followed suit .
Alabama 's Tuscaloosa News and the Olympian in Washington State also called for the withdrawal of US troops .
' Americans have had it with the war , ' the Olympian said in its editorial .
An April survey showed that only 28 per cent of Americans approved of the handling of the war .
But , though the New York Times rejection of the war has created the most media heat and light , its influence is far from what it used to be .
The fact is that the paper has come relatively late to the withdrawal position .
Smaller newspapers have previously taken that stance ; in May the Los Angeles Times - one of the biggest papers in America - urged a pullout under the headline ' Bring Them Home ' .
Yet the power of newspapers to influence political policy is greatly decreased in an era where the greatest political pressures seem to come from cable news channels and the internet , via blogs or YouTube .
' The time when you could have a " Cronkite moment " has passed , ' said Professor Jack Lule , a media expert at Pennsylvania 's Lehigh University .
' I think the New York Times would have liked that last week , but that was a very different era . '
The modern media world is one in which no organisation - whether it be a single newspaper or a broadcaster - can make any claims to dominance .
Whereas Lyndon Johnson famously declared that ' If I 've lost Cronkite , I 've lost Middle America ' , George Bush has made a virtue of his self - confessed ignorance about what the media is saying about him , especially newspapers such as the New York Times
Rosenthal thinks that some of that is bluster .
' The White House tells us they do n't read us , but someone in the administration must do , because they always seem to know what we 've been saying , ' he said .
But experts say the media world has changed so much since the 1960s that the White House analysis is largely correct .
The attack dogs of the traditional press have been largely defanged by a new media world .
' Before , this story would have led all the news bulletins for a week , ' said Lule .
' That is not the case now .
The New York Times has become just one voice in the media matrix .'
Even Rosenthal admits that the paper is perhaps not the influential voice it once was .
He acknowledges that in the end it is the White House - not newspaper editorials - which will set future Iraq policy : ' I hope it affects the debate .
But the turning point has to come from the White House , not the New York Times . '
That moment looks as if it could still be a long way off .

The Justice League of America responded today to the accusations of doping leveled by former member The Atom 's new tell - all book , Small - Time Justice .
In it , the diminutive crime fighter accuses his fellow superheroes of various indiscretions and infidelities , but the most controversial chapter in the book deals with steroid abuse .
While he stops short of naming names , the context makes it clear to which leaguer he 's referring .

" Now ask yourself , " he writes .
" How does a guy with absolutely no superhuman abilities get to hang out with the most powerful beings in the solar system ?
When you 're busy learning science and picking up detective skills and custom - building cars and special devices , how are you going to find the time to hit the gym as hard as you need to even sit at the same table with Superman and Wonder Woman ?
Is n't it possible that maybe you 're going to look for a little outside help , maybe of a chemical nature ? "
The Justice League categorically denied these accusations .
Superman , speaking for the group , suggested that The Atom was suffering from an inferiority complex and lashing out .
" I hate to speak ill of any fellow crime fighter , " said the godlike Kryptonian .
" But you have to understand that when a person 's powers are ' being smaller than anyone else , ' that person is going to end up feeling pretty inferior to those who have something to contribute .
This is nothing more than an attempt to raise his own stature , if you will , by diminishing others . "
The press conference was then interrupted by the attack of a dozen of Brainiac 's death bots .

Their hand forced by a wave of bad publicity and brutal congressional hearings , the Justice League of America today agreed to institute steroid testing and other drug testing for all members .
At a press conference , the entire league stood behind Superman as he announced the new policy .
" While we have nothing but confidence in our members , and do not suspect any of them of wrongdoing , we understand the public interest in being sure that the nation's , and indeed the planet 's , guardians are not involved in the use of performance - enhancing drugs , except for the Gingo juice that gives Elongated Man his powers .
Seriously , ' Gingo juice ' ?
" Accordingly , each member of the league will be subject to random , mandatory drug testing .
Any member found using steroids , human growth hormone , Martian growth hormone or similar substances will be given a lifetime ban from the league , and their Rapscallions Brought
In stats will be given an asterisk in the record books .
" I 'm going to have to expose myself to Kryptonite just to get a blood sample , " the deific visitor from the planet Krypton said .
" I hope you 're happy .
It hurts . "
June 13 , 2007 , Metropolis
In a surprise development in the ongoing Justice League drug controversy , the league announced the expulsion of founding member Green Lantern for steroid use .
While the league refused to speak to the press , instead announcing the decision in a press release , Green Lantern himself spoke to reporters outside league headquarters .
" You have to understand here , " he said , visibly weary from the ordeal .
" The rest of the guys , they 're always running and punching and lifting things .
They get a workout just by doing their jobs .
Me , what do I do ?
I think .
I just hover there and whatever I think of , my power ring does .
I may be flying around , but I have the superhero equivalent of a desk job .
If I did n't watch my figure , I 'd end up putting on so much weight I 'd have to change my name to the Green Lighthouse .
Given a choice between spending half my time in the gym and actually , you know , saving the world , yeah , I did a few ' roids . "
All other members of the league , including the Batman , have come out clean in their tests , although it was discovered that what Elongated Man was calling " Gingo juice " is actually 180 - proof grain alcohol , and has nothing to do with his powers .
He is currently in rehab .

It 's not often that Google kills off one of its services , especially one which was announced with much fanfare at a big mainstream event like CES 2006 .
Yet Google Video's commercial aspirations have indeed been terminated : the company has announced that it will no longer be selling video content on the site .
The news is n't all that surprising , given that Google 's commercial video efforts were launched in rather poor shape and never managed to take off .
The service seemed to only make the news when embarrassing things happened .
Yet now Google Video has given us a gift — a " proof of concept " in the form of yet another argument against DRM — and an argument for more reasonable laws governing copyright controls .
How could Google 's failure be our gain ?
Simple .
By picking up its marbles and going home , Google just demonstrated how completely bizarre and anti-consumer DRM technology can be .
Most importantly , by pulling the plug on the service , Google proved why consumers have to be allowed to circumvent copy controls .
A consolation prize
Google contacted customers late last week to tell them that the video store was closing .
The e-mail declared , " In an effort to improve all Google services , we will no longer offer the ability to buy or rent videos for download from Google Video , ending the DTO / DTR ( download-to-own /rent ) program .
This change will be effective August 15 , 2007 . "
The message also announced that Google Checkout would issue credits in an amount equal to what those customers had spent at the Google Video store .
Why the quasi -refunds ?
The kicker : " After August 15 , 2007 , you will no longer be able to view your purchased or rented videos . "
See , after Google takes its video store down , its Internet - based DRM system will no longer function .
This means that customers who have built video collections with Google Video offerings will find that their purchases no longer work .
This is one of the major flaws in any DRM system based on secrets and centralized authorities : when these DRM data warehouses shut down , the DRM stops working , and consumers are left with useless junk .
Furthermore , Google is not refunding the total cost of the videos .
To take advantage of the credit Google is offering , you have to spend more money , and furthermore , you have to spend it with a merchant that supports Google Checkout .
Meanwhile , the purchases you made are now worthless .
To do it right , Google should either provide users with non-DRMed copies of the videos they bought , or they should refund the money entirely .
The current option is hardly acceptable , however .
Would you buy a TV , a car , a book , or anything if the guy who sold it to you could take it back at any moment so long as he offered you a coupon ?
Did you buy Kobe Bryant 's 81 - point game to commemorate that bit of NBA history ?
Enjoy staring at an unplayable file come Wednesday .
But hey , at least you get $ 2 back to go buy underwear !
Copyright Office , here we come
Since the death of the commercial part of Google Video will render thousands and thousands of purchases useless , the Library of Congress will have no choice but to consider the matter when they return to their triennial review of the DMCA .
To date , the Library of Congress has granted exceptions to the anti-circumvention clause of the DMCA in instances where DRM has rendered something completely unusable , such as eBook DRM which can render eBooks useless for handicapped people .
Recent exceptions from the last review are detailed here .
Of note : the right to bypass DRM on products that no longer work properly was considered but rejected last time around .
Now , thanks to Google , we have a case study , a real - world example we can point to and say : " Hey , this is n't right . "
It features one of the world 's most innovative and financially powerful technology companies bagging out on users .
It features thousands of consumers buying DRMed goods in earnest , and it ends with a bang ; Google decides to exit the market , leaving consumers with a load of useless goods .
Needless to say , this could happen with any player .
Google could float its store if it wanted to , but it is exiting the business .
What happens when Amazon does the same ?
Or Apple , or the next guy ?
If this is n't further proof that parts of the DMCA should be gutted , at the very least it is a strong sign that the Library of Congress needs to address this issue .
Congress should be thinking about this brave new world of " unproperty " where you 're charged good money to " buy " products that , in reality , you 're only renting until AverageCorp gets bored of the business .
( From the diaries -- kos )
After a long six and a half years of watching almost helplessly as the Republican Party loots , rapes and pillages everything from the Constitution to the middle class to non-threatening countries overseas , it 's always satisfying to see rats call a spade a spade and jump off the pirate ship known as the modern GOP .
But rarely has the sense of schadenfreude been more poignant to me than when reading the latest Economist article today about the woes of the Republican Party and American conservative movement in general .
The article , titled The American Right Under the Weather , is but one piece in the new overall issue covering the leftward shift of American politics in recent months .
As anyone who has read the magazine knows , the editorial staff of The Economist is certainly no friend to Democrats , favoring a decidedly corporatist agenda valuing " free trade over " fair trade " and a foreign policy usually at odds with progressive values .
As a result , however , they find themselves increasingly at odds with the social conservatives who have all but taken over the Republican party 's activist base : in fact , they say so directly in the cover article :
The Economist has never made any secret of its preference for the Republican Party 's individualistic “ western ” wing rather than the moralistic “ southern ” one that Mr Bush has come to typify .
It is hard to imagine Ronald Reagan sponsoring a federal amendment banning gay marriage or limiting federal funding for stem - cell research .
Yet Mr Bush 's departure hardly guarantees a move back to the centre .
Social liberals like Mr Giuliani and Arnold Schwarzenegger are in a minority on the right .
On the one issue where Mr Bush fought the intolerant wing of his party , immigration , the nativists won — and perhaps lost the Latino vote for a generation .
As a result , The Economist 's temporary post - mortem on the enthusiasm and dynamism of the American right is a strange mix of joy and tears : it contains equal doses of worried regret , tempered with palpable glee at the overreaching failures of the social conservatives whom they blame for much of popular rejection of Republican ideology .
But it 's nothing if not utterly brutal -- and well worth the read .
The sheer numbers are staggering .
Some key statistical points from the article include :
40 % of Republicans think that Democrats will win the next presidential election , compared with only 12 % of Democrats who think the reverse
Q2 money to the Democratic presidential contenders nearly doubled that given to the Republican contenders
As has been frequently mentioned by Markos , the DSCC and D - Trip are vastly outraising the NRSC and NRCC
61 % of Democrats are happy with our choices of candidates , while only 36 % of Republicans can say the same
Young voters and Hispanic voters are trending overwhelmingly Democratic
Registered Democrats and Democratic - leaners are now 50 % of the population , while registered Republicans and Republican - leaners only comprise 35 % - - a strong swing from an equal 43 % - 43 % tie in 2002 .
And the list goes on and on .
Things are so bleak for the pirates on Capitol Hill right now that many prominent Republicans are simply manning the lifeboats and looking for the best way to weather the storm .
This little bit about former RNC chairman and self - hating closet - dweller Ken Mehlman is really poignant :
No wonder Ken Mehlman , a former Republican Party chairman who oversaw George Bush 's 2004 victory , is now advising hedge funds on how to deal with a Democratic - leaning America .
Most intriguing , however , is the article 's nearly ferocious rejection of the idea that GOP woes are entirely the fault of Bush , the occupation of Iraq , or the corruption of specific Republican party officials .
Instead , the Economist is unafraid to lay the blame squarely where it belongs : the embrace of a hyper - conservative agenda of social moralizing , beyond - the - pale cronyism , an unhealthy dose of nativism and racism , corruption so blatant it has become institutionalized , a borrow - and - spend budgetary philosophy , and redistribution of wealth to the very rich that has appalled all but the Christianist right and some very wealthy allies :
In fact , the Republican Party in Congress is just as responsible as Mr Bush for most of the recent troubles .
The Republican majority routinely appropriated more spending than the president asked for .
It also larded spending bills with as much extra pork as possible .
The number of congressional “ earmarks ” for projects in members ' districts increased from 1,300 in 1994 , when the Republicans took over Congress , to 14,000 in 2005 .
The Republican majority also cheered Mr Bush all the way to Baghdad .
Add to this the corruption of congressmen like Tom DeLay , a conservative hero , and the semi-corrupt institutional relationship that the Republicans formed with lobbyists , and you see that Mr Bush was only part of a much bigger problem .
Nor can conservatives claim that Mr Bush is a country - club Republican like his father .
He has devoted his energies to giving “ the movement ” what it wants : the invasion of Iraq for the neoconservatives ( who had championed it long before September 11th ) ; tax cuts for business and the small - government conservatives ; restricting federal funding for stem - cell research for the social conservatives ; and conservative judges to please every faction .
This desire to pander to the conservative movement is partly to blame for the administration 's practical incompetence .
Mr Bush outdid previous Republican presidents in recruiting his personnel from the conservative counter - establishment .
But this often meant choosing people for their ideological purity rather than their competence or intelligence .
Some 150 Bush administration officials were graduates of Pat Robertson 's Regent University , including Monica Goodling , who put on such a lamentable performance before a House inquiry into the firing of nine US attorneys .
A more pragmatic president would surely have sacked many of the neoconservative ideologues who have made a hash of American foreign policy .
And as the editors astutely observe , the Republicans are now locked in a civil war for supremacy between their corporatist paymasters , the closely allied NeoCons , the Christianist base that actually mobilizes the votes , and the few die - hard libertarians who used to make up the bedrock of American conservatism and are the GOP 's only hope of holding onto the rapidly changing West .
Whoever prevails in that fight , however , two things are certain : the party will be weaker than it was before , and the fight will be very , very ugly and very , very public .
After all , there is no honor amongst thieves .
In the end , though , The Economist makes the excellent point that Democrats have yet to convince the American public that we are anything more than the lesser of two evils .
Certainly , failing to stand up for progressive values such as we saw recently the with FISA capitulation wo n't do much to help that .
Further , Republicans have always been more at home and more comfortable as a minority party than they have been in the position of actual governance .
Like the moral and intellectual children they are , it 's far easier to complain and snipe at those attempting to actually govern , than to attempt to put a failing ideology in place that gets the job done .
Still , I would rather be in our shoes than in theirs .
As the article correctly points out :
But even when you enter all the qualifications the right 's situation is dire .
It is a sign of weakness that the conservatives are retreating to their old posture as insurgents , and need a bogeywoman like Mrs Clinton to hold them together .
The Republicans have failed the most important test of any political movement — wielding power successfully .
They have botched a war .
They have splurged on spending .
And they have alienated a huge section of the population .
It is now the Democrats ' game to win or lose .
Indeed .
Things are looking extremely bleak for the GOP pirates , and it 's fun watching the rats jump off the ship .
Now all we have to do is stand for what we believe in and do the difficult work of holding ourselves accountable , standing in the way of Mr. 23 % for the remainder of his term , and passing legislation that will benefit the American People for a change , rather than GOP monied interests .
Personally , I 'm looking forward to the challenge .
Rangers 30 , Orioles 3
BALTIMORE ( ESPN.com news services ) --
Five runs in the fourth inning .
Nine runs in the sixth .
Ten in the eighth .
Six more in the ninth .
The Texas Rangers rounded the bases at a dizzying pace and
became the first team in 110 years to score 30 runs in a game ,
setting an American League record Wednesday in a 30 - 3 rout of the
Baltimore Orioles .
" This is something freaky .
You wo n't see anything like this
again for a long , long time .
I am glad I was on this end of it , "
said Marlon Byrd , who hit one of two Texas grand slams .
Trailing 3 - 0 in the opener of a doubleheader , Texas could n't be
stopped .
At last , the last - place Rangers did something right .
" We set a record for something on the good side of baseball , "
manager Ron Washington said .
It was the ninth time a major league team scored 30 runs , the
first since the Chicago Colts set the major league mark in a 36 - 7
rout of Louisville in a National League game on June 29 , 1897 ,
according to the Elias Sports Bureau .
" It was AMAZING in capital letters , " said Travis Metcalf , who
hit a grand slam after being called up from Triple - A Oklahoma
earlier in the day .
In the second game of the doubleheader , Metcalf drove in four runs and the Rangers scored three runs in the eighth inning for a 9 - 7 win .
Hours after announcing manager Dave Trembley would return for
the 2008 season , the Orioles absorbed the most lopsided loss in
franchise history and set a team record for hits allowed in a game
( 29 ) .
The Rangers had totaled 28 runs in their previous nine games ,
including two runs on seven hits in their last two .
" I knew we'd get the bats going , but I never expected anything
like this , " Washington said .
" When the faucet is on , you want it
to stay on .
You never want to cut it off . "
The Rangers set a team record for runs scored in a doubleheader
-- before the second game even started .
" You do n't want to be the one to make the out .
You feel like
you have to get a hit every time up , " Byrd said .
Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Ramon Vazquez , the bottom two batters
in Texas ' lineup , each homered twice and finished with seven RBIs .
" That was ridiculous .
I have never been in anything like that
in my life , " said Saltalamacchia , who went 4 - for - 6 with a walk and
scored five runs .
He came in batting .179 and finished at .262 .
David Murphy had five of the Rangers ' 29 hits , the most by a
major league team since Milwaukee had 31 in a 22 - 2 victory over
Toronto on Aug. 28 , 1992 , according to Elias .
Texas had 57 at - bats , tying the AL record for a nine - inning game
set by Milwaukee in its 1992 rout of Toronto .
The Rangers added five points to their team batting average ,
raising it to .258 .
They finished with more runs than outs made
( 27 ) .
Baltimore went from seventh in the AL with a 4.39 ERA to 11th at
4.60 .
Asked how to handle such a devastating defeat , Trembley replied ,
" You have a real short memory and you let it go . "
Kason Gabbard ( 6 - 1 ) allowed three runs and seven hits over six
innings .
He is 2 - 1 in six starts since Texas acquired him from
Boston on July 31 .
Even with the one - sided score , there was a save .
Wes Littleton
earned his second career save and first this season by pitching
three scoreless innings .
Texas erased a 3 - 0 deficit by batting around in a five - run
fourth .
A walk to Byrd and an infield hit by Jason Botts preceded a
two - run single by Saltalamacchia .
After a visit from pitching coach
Leo Mazzone , Daniel Cabrera ( 9 - 13 ) gave up a go - ahead , three - run
homer to Vazquez .
Texas made it 14 - 3 by scoring nine runs on 10 hits in the sixth .
The 10 hits matched a club record for one inning and were three
more than the Rangers totaled in their previous two games .
Cabrera left after serving up a home run to Saltalamacchia .
Brian Burres yielded two singles and a walk before Byrd hit his
third career slam .
Saltalamacchia , Vazquez , Frank Catalanotto and
Ian Kinsler added RBI singles .
Texas got seven hits in the eighth .
Metcalf hit his first career
slam and Saltalamacchia added a three - run shot .
Vazquez 's second homer highlighted a six - run ninth .
Game notes Baltimore 's Kevin Millar went 1 - for - 4 , extending his run of
reaching via hit , walk or hit by pitch to 48 games -- one short of
Ken Singleton 's club record set in 1977 .
... Melvin Mora ended an
0 - for - 16 skid with a fourth - inning bunt single .

Dell 's love affair with Linux is a clandestine affair these days , conducted in secret , away from disapproving eyes .
But now the pair have been spotted in China .
When Michael Dell first saw the web - footed beauty , he fell head over heels .
Six years ago Dell pledged a series of strategic investments in Linux companies , including Eazel and Red Hat .
The romance attracted the disapproval of Microsoft however , and barely lasted weeks .
Very quietly , Dell dumped the bird .
It later emerged that Microsoft 's OEM enforcer Joachim Kempin had promised Steve Ballmer that he'd be putting the screws on PC builders , or " hitting the OEMs harder " in his words .
" They should do a delicate dance , " wrote Kempin .
Microsoft 's position was that PC builders should " meet demand but not create demand " for Linux PCs .
In a rush to over - compensate , Dell took the " meet demand " edict to comical extremes .
Fifteen months ago our own Ashlee Vance , who broke the news of the first break - up in 2001 , proved how hard it is to buy a PC from Dell without Windows .
Not pre-loaded with Linux mind you - but simply a bare bones box .
But far away from the prying eyes of Steve Ballmer , romance is blossoming .

Writing in WiReD magazine this month , internet utopian Professor Lawrence Lessig says he now regrets backing antitrust litigation against Microsoft in the 1990s .
Lessig had been appointed " special master " in the DoJ 's antitrust action , but was harshly thrown off the case when Microsoft discovered an aside he'd made in a private email exchange years previously .
Opposing the Beast was " a mistake " , says the Prof. , because Linux has " changed the business model of Microsoft " .

Olbermann : Bush adminstration use of bogus terror threat is ' most overt accusation yet '
David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday September 25 , 2007
Print This Email This Former US Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Fein joined Keith Olbermann to discuss recent charges that the Bush administration employed false intelligence to convince lawmakers they should temporarily expand domestic spying powers under the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
" These charges ... are the most overt accusation yet of a government gone so wrong that it is using the terrorist 's weapon of fear against its own people -- and against other legislators who will not go along with the program , " Olbermann said .
At a forum on FISA hosted by the Center for American Progress , Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) said that on Aug. 2 , word of specific intelligence prompted increased security on Capitol Hill .
The House and Senate passed the FISA expansion bill days later .
In what she called a " Rovian strategy of using terrorism as a wedge political issue , " Rep .
Harman charged that the threat , " it turned out , was bogus ; the intelligence agencies knew that . "
" The President continues to insist ... that he can spy on Americans without warrants irrespective of what a statute says -- that he has constitutional authority to override whatever Congress may do , " said Fine .
" There is no disinclination of this administration , " he continued " to stoop to misrepresentations and omissions to heighten the sense of danger to get whatever they wish in the legislative package . "
Before passage of the FISA expansion , Fein said that " the administration was openly telling members of Congress if they voted against the bill that the administration insisted upon , Americans would die . "
" There was n't any substantiation of that , " he said .
" It was just : ' Trust me , we always tell the truth . "
Fein insisted that the president would continue to " have his way if he continues to frighten the Congress and Congress refuses to demand information and facts rather than just rumor . "
" The mind reels , " Olbermann responded .

Bill Clinton rips GOP with memories of ' swift boat ' campaign David Edwards and Greg Wasserstrom

Print This Email This Former president Bill Clinton passionately shared his thoughts on the House vote to condemn progressive group MoveOn.org ( More at this link ) over a controversial newspaper ad on CNN 's Situation Room .
" There was something completely disingenuous about the feigned outrage of the Republicans and the White House and then the Congress about this .
This was classic bait and switch , " Clinton said , later adding , " focus on that as opposed to focusing on what 's happened [ in Iraq ] . "
Clinton 's charges of political posturing reached a high level of specificity in his discussion of the elections in 2002 and 2004 .
Both years saw the Republicans expand their majorities in Congress and then the re-election of President Bush .
" These are the people that ran a television ad in Georgia with [ former Senator ]
Max Cleland , who lost half his body in Vietnam , in the same ad with Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein .
That 's what the Republicans did , Clinton said .
" And the person that rode to the senate on that ad was there voting to condemn the Democrats over the Petraeus ad .
I mean , these are the people that funded the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth . "
Clinton pointed out that " the President appointed one of the principal funders of the Swift Boat ads to be an ambassador . "
" But they re really upset about Petraeus , " Clinton added .
" But it was ok to question John Kerrys patriotism on the blatantly dishonest claims by people that didnt what they were talking about . "

WASHINGTON —
The resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales is only the beginning of accountability , not the end of it .
His decision to leave underscores the need for a public reckoning of the extent to which the Justice Department was politicized under his stewardship .
But how divisive the coming months will be depends hugely on whom Bush names to succeed Gonzales , and on whether Republicans in Congress are thinking more about Bush ’s legacy or their own .
Gonzales was forced to go not because of Democratic opposition , but because many in President Bush ’s own party — notably and honorably Sen.
Arlen Specter , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee — were appalled by his performance .
The new politics unleashed by Gonzales ’ resignation were clear from the moment that word of his departure began to circulate .
After months of public support , Bush abruptly reversed himself and let Gonzales go in the hope that his allies could now charge that further inquiries into Gonzales ’ Justice Department were politically motivated .
Sen . John Cornyn , R - Texas , set the tone early , telling CNN : “ This will not bring peace .
This will bring more chaos . ”
Note that “ chaos ” will now be the new definition of accountability .
Bush stayed partisan to the end , charging that Gonzales ’ “ good name was dragged through the mud for political reasons . ”
No concessions , no admissions , no regrets .
Democrats , publicly and privately , pledged not to back off on investigating what went wrong on Gonzales ’ watch .
But whether that journey toward the truth occurs in a deliberate or a partisan way depends , in part , on how leading Republican members of Congress judge their current obligations and their long - term interests .
With Gonzales gone and with Bush set to finish his term in less than a year and a half , the GOP could cut itself loose from one of the shabbier aspects of this presidency .
Or the party could fight on for Bush , and hope to bury the issues raised by the attorney general ’s tenure beneath months of angry invective .
Bush could significantly relieve the pressure by making an above - politics choice as Gonzales ’ replacement .
Sen. Charles E. Schumer , D - N.Y. , one of Gonzales ’ sharpest critics , sent a strong signal in an interview , saying that “ if you have an attorney general who puts the rule of law first … you could find out what happened [ under Gonzales ] pretty quickly and move on . ”
Investigations under such circumstances , Schumer said , could be “ much lower key , ” since Congress could have confidence that the Justice Department was on a different course .
However , even the least partisan and most qualified nominee will not escape tough hearings .
Too much damage has been done , and the next attorney general must be committed to a cleanup , not a cover-up .
Bush ’s appointee will need to make an unbreakable commitment not to use prosecutions and investigations — particularly questionable allegations of voter fraud — to influence the outcome of the 2008 elections .
A successor should also pledge to get to the bottom of the unusual firing of nine U.S. attorneys in the middle of the president ’s time in office .
At the same time , the nominee will need to restore faith that the extraordinary powers granted government in the name of fighting terrorism are not abused , and are subjected to serious oversight .
Schumer said that Bush may have let Gonzales go in part because only a fresh attorney general could successfully negotiate a new terrorist surveillance bill with Congress this fall .
The model for President Bush to ponder as Gonzales ’ successor is obvious .
When Gerald Ford took over from Richard Nixon , the Justice Department was a shambles , discredited by political abuse and corruption at the top .
In naming a new attorney general , Ford turned not to a political crony but to Edward Levi , the president of the University of Chicago .
Levi’ s reputation as a man of integrity who despised the abuse of power almost instantly restored the department ’s standing .
Levi understood the danger of seeing all “ human relationships … in terms of power relationships — in terms of the manipulation of power , ” as he put it in a 1976 essay for Newsweek magazine .
“ I really think that ’s one of the most wicked ways of looking at the world , ” Levi went on .
“ It ’s a very incomplete way .
It strips people of their humanness .
It converts all the other good attributes people have into just an ability or a desire to manipulate others . ”
In this polarized time , Justice desperately needs a new Edward Levi .
So does Bush .

James Gee , a professor of learning sciences at the University of Wisconsin , was profoundly humbled when he first played a video game for preschool - age kids called Pajama Sam : No Need to Hide When It ’s Dark Outside .
Gee ’s son Sam , then 6 , had been clamoring to play the game , which features a little boy who dresses up like his favorite action hero , Pajama Man , and sets off on adventures in a virtual world ruled by the dastardly villain Darkness .
So Gee brought Pajama Sam home and tried it himself .
“ I figured I could play it and finish it so I could help Sam , ” says Gee .
“ Instead , I had to go and ask him to help me . ”
Gee had so much fun playing Pajama Sam that he subsequently decided to try his hand at an adult video game he picked at random off a store shelf — an H. G. Wells–inspired sci-fi quest called The New Adventures of the Time Machine .
“ I was just blown away when I brought it home at how hard it was , ” he says .
Gee ’s scholarly interest was also piqued .
He sensed instantly that something provocative was happening in his mind as he struggled to complete the puzzles of the time machine .
“ I had n’t done that kind of new learning since graduate school .
You know , as you get older , you kind of rest on your laurels . ”
Gee ’s epiphany led him to the forefront of a wave of research into how video games affect cognition .
Bolstered by the results of laboratory experiments , Gee and other researchers dared to suggest that gaming might be mentally enriching .
These scholars are the first to admit that games can be addictive , and indeed part of their research explores how games connect to the reward circuits of the human brain .
But they now recognize the cognitive benefits of playing video games : pattern recognition , system thinking , even patience .
Lurking in this research is the idea that gaming can exercise the mind the way physical activity exercises the body :
It may be addictive because it ’s challenging .
All of this , of course , flies in the face of the classic stereotype of gamers as attention deficit–crazed stimulus junkies , easily distracted by flashy graphics and on - screen carnage .
Instead , successful gamers must focus , have patience , develop a willingness to delay gratification , and prioritize scarce resources .
In other words , they think .
The video game Tetris , among the earliest games to launch the industry , involves falling tile - like tetraminoes that a player must quickly maneuver so they fit into space at the bottom of the screen .
In the early 1990s , Richard Haier , a professor of psychology at the University of California at Irvine , tracked cerebral glucose metabolic rates in the brains of Tetris players using positron - emission tomography ( PET ) scanners .
The glucose rates show how much energy the brain is consuming , and thus serve as a rough estimate of how much work the brain is doing .
Haier determined the glucose levels of novice Tetris players as their brains labored to usher the falling blocks into correct locations .
Then he took their levels again after a month of regular play .
Even though the test subjects had improved their game performance by a factor of seven , Haier found that their glucose levels had decreased .
It appeared that the escalating difficulty of the game trained the test subjects to manipulate the Tetris blocks mentally with such skill that they barely broke a cognitive sweat completing levels that would have utterly confounded them a month earlier .
Nearly a decade after Haier ’s study , Gee hit upon an explanation .
He found that even escapist fantasy games are embedded with one of the core principles of learning — students prosper when the subject matter challenges them right at the edge of their abilities .
Make the lessons too difficult and the students get frustrated .
Make them too easy and they get bored .
Cognitive psychologists call this the “ regime of competence ” principle .
Gee ’s insight was to recognize that the principle is central to video games :
As players progress , puzzles become more complex , enemies swifter and more numerous , and underlying patterns more subtle .
Most games do n’t allow progress until you ’ve reached a certain level of expertise .
To understand why games might be good for the mind , begin by shedding the cliché that they are about improving hand - eye coordination and firing virtual weapons .
More than 70 percent of video games contain no more bloodshed than a game of Risk , and are popular because they challenge mental dexterity .
Among the best - selling game franchises , The Sims involves almost no hand - eye coordination or quick reflexes .
One manages a household of characters , each endowed with distinct drives and personality traits , each cycling through an endless series of short - term needs ( companionship , say , or food ) , each enmeshed in a network of relationships with other characters .
Playing the game is a nonstop balancing act .
Even a violent game like Grand Theft Auto involves networks of characters that the player must navigate and master , picking up clues and detecting patterns .
Gee contends that the way gamers explore virtual worlds mirrors the way the brain processes multiple , but interconnected , streams of information in the real world .
“ Basically , how we think is through running perceptual simulations in our heads that prepare us for the actions we ’re going to take , ” he says .
“ By modeling those simulations , video games externalize how the mind works . ”
Even if Gee is right and video games are learning machines , one question remains :
Do the skills learned in the virtual world translate into the real one ?
the answer comes from a slew of recent studies , one of which began when then cognitive sciences research assistant and ardent gamer Shawn Green worked with University of Rochester cognitive sciences professor Daphne Bavelier on a project investigating visual perception in video game players .
On standard tests that measure attention span and information - processing time , Green found that gamers consistently outperformed nongamers .
When Green tweaked the tests to make them challenging enough so the gamers would n’t have perfect scores , the nongamers sometimes performed so poorly that their answers might as well have been random guesses .
The researchers addressed an admitted weakness of the study — that visually intelligent people were more likely to be attracted to video games in the first place — by immersing a group of nonplayers for a week in the World War II game Medal of Honor .
They found that the group ’s skills on the standard visual tests improved as well .
Green did the initial research as part of his honors thesis , and after graduation , he and Bavelier continued the study .
Nature published the results in May 2003 .
Since then the pair has also found that gamers can visually track more objects simultaneously than nongamers and that playing video games improves this ability .
Their latest research on the visual precision of gamers is forthcoming in Psychological Science and the Journal of Experimental Psychology .
Green says his main interest is the brain ’s plasticity , but cautiously concedes there may be practical applications to playing video games .
“ Strong peripheral vision is useful to law enforcement , firefighters , and the military .
They need those enhanced skills , ” he adds .
The notion that video games can develop abilities that apply to real - world situations has been expressed by many and is increasingly being put to the test .
In October 2006 the Federation of American Scientists ( FAS ) endorsed video games as a potential means for teaching “ higher - order thinking skills , such as strategic thinking , interpretive analysis , problem solving , plan formulation and execution , and adaptation to rapid change . ”
They cited “ owners mode , ” a component of the video football game Madden , which lets players manage an NFL team , as teaching basic business skills .
Team games , such as EverQuest and World of Warcraft , develop cooperation and communication skills that the FAS says are useful in business settings .
A prime example of gaming that tangibly improves professional technique comes from James Rosser , director of the Advanced Medical Technology Institute at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City .
He found that laparoscopic surgeons who played games for more than three hours a week made 37 percent fewer errors than their nongaming peers , thanks to improved hand - eye coordination and depth perception .
The Harvard Business School Press published a new book in November 2006 by John Beck , who has looked at three distinct groups of white - ­collar professionals : hard - core gamers , occasional gamers , and nongamers .
The findings contradict nearly all the preconceived ideas about the impact of games .
The gaming population turned out to be consistently more social , more confident , and more comfortable solving problems creatively .
They also showed no evidence of reduced attention spans compared with nongamers .
“ It was n’t surprising that gamers were more competitive , or more strategic , but the social and leadership skills that they exhibit do n’t fit the stereotype of a loner in the basement , ” Beck says .
The U.S. military has long supported the premise that learning through games can prepare soldiers for the complex , rapid - fire decision making of combat .
Since 2002 , they have offered new versions of their own game , America ’s Army , which lets potential recruits play at everything from boot camp to Special Forces missions .
According to the gamemakers at West Point , the purpose of America ’s Army is to “ give the player an idea of what it ’s like for real U.S. Army soldiers to train for duty . ”
More than 4 - and - a - half million registered players have completed the game ’s basic training .
In the fall of 2003 two media researchers at the University of Southern California set up a study to look at the patterns of brain activity triggered by violent video games .
Peter Vorderer and René Weber booked time on an fMRI machine , loaded a popular game called Tactical Ops on an adjoining computer console , and watched one test subject after another pretend to be part of a Special Forces team trying to prevent a terrorist attack .
Before Vorderer and Weber even looked at any of the brain scans , they were surprised by the behavior of the dozen or so adults who volunteered for the test .
Participating in an fMRI study involves lying for extended periods of time in an extremely confined and loud space .
Even a mild claustrophobic will invariably find the experience intolerable , and most people need a break after 20 minutes .
But most of the Tactical Ops players happily stayed in the machine for at least an hour , oblivious to the discomfort and noise because they were so entranced by the game .
The genesis of this reaction may lie in the neurotransmitter dopamine .
A number of studies have revealed that game playing triggers dopamine release in the brain , a finding that makes sense , given the instrumental role that dopamine plays in how the brain handles both reward and exploration .
Jaak Panksepp , a neuroscientist collaborating with the Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics at Northwestern University , calls the dopamine system the brain ’s “ seeking ” circuitry , which propels us to explore new avenues for reward in our environment .
The game world is teeming with objects that deliver clearly articulated rewards : more life , access to new levels , new equipment , new spells .
Most of the crucial work in game interface design revolves around keeping players notified of potential rewards available to them and how much those rewards are needed .
If you create a system in which rewards are both clearly defined and achieved by exploring an environment , you ’ll find human brains drawn to those systems , even if they ’re made up of virtual characters and simulated sidewalks .
It ’s likely those Tactical Ops players in an fMRI machine were able to tolerate the physical discomfort of the machine because the game environment so powerfully stimulated the brain ’s dopamine system .
Of course , dopamine is also involved in the addictiveness of drugs .
“ The thing to remember about dopamine is that it ’s not at all the same thing as pleasure , ” says Gregory Berns , a neuroscientist at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta , who looks at dopamine in a cultural context in his book , Satisfaction .
“ Dopamine is not the reward ; it ’s what lets you go out and explore in the first place .
Without dopamine , you would n’t be able to learn properly . ”
What kind of cognitive skills should we expect to find in the Pokémon generation ?
Not surprisingly , Gee has got a list .
“ They ’re going to think well about systems ; they ’re going to be good at exploring ; they ’re going to be good at reconceptualizing their goals based on their experience ; they ’re not going to judge people ’s intelligence just by how fast and efficient they are ; and they ’re going to think nonlaterally .
In our current world with its complex systems that are quite dangerous , those are damn good ways to think . ”
Gee ’s remarks remind me of an experience I had a few years earlier , introducing my 7 - year - old nephew to SimCity 2000 , the best - selling urban simulator that lets you create a virtual metropolis on your computer , build highways and bridges , zone areas for development , and raise or lower taxes .
Based on the player ’s decisions , neighborhoods thrive or decline , streets get overrun with traffic or remain wastelands , and criminals prosper or disappear .
When I walked my nephew through the game , I gave him only the most cursory overview of the rules ; I was mostly just giving him a tour of the city I ’d built .
But he was absorbing the rules nonetheless .
At one point , I showed him a block of rusted , crime - ridden factories that lay abandoned and explained that I ’d had difficulty getting this part of my city to come back to life .
He turned to me and said , “ I think you need to lower your industrial tax rates . ”
He said it as calmly and as confidently as if he were saying , “ I think we need to shoot the bad guy . ”
In a 20 - minute tour of SimCity , my nephew had learned a fundamental principle of urban economics :
Some areas zoned for specific uses can falter if the zone - specific taxes are too high .
Of course , if you sat my 7 - year - old nephew down in an urban studies classroom , he would be asleep in 10 seconds .
But just like those Tactical Ops players happily trapped for an hour in an fMRI , something in the game world had pulled at him .
He was learning in spite of himself .

Kristján
“ porkbelly ” Jónsson , Senior Software
Engineer for CCP , during one of the company 's " Formal Wednesdays " .
A few weeks ago , CCP Games issued a press release that
announced their successful upgrade of href = " http://www.stackless.com/ "
>Stackless Python
and that this
upgrade would increase the speed of the gameplay for EVE Online
players .
Many players of EVE
Online probably shrugged their shoulders
and continued playing their game , noticing the performance increase but
generally not thinking twice about the upgrade .
However , the staff at Ten Ton Hammer ( we were in San Diego at
the time ) found the press release to be interesting , albeit a bit short
for our tastes .
We wanted to know more , what had actually occurred in
this update and why was it necessary ?
What is Stackless Python ?
Does
anyone else use it besides CCP ?
These were our questions , and ( thanks to Valerie Massey ) we
were able to send those questions to Kristján
“ porkbelly ” Jónsson , Senior Software
Engineer for CCP .
After you read the Q&A , you ’ll know
that Kristján knows his tech and all of his answers are both
informative and honest .
style = " font - weight : bold ; " > Ten Ton Hammer :
To start ,
could you summarize what your high - level programming language ,
Stackless Python , accomplishes within the EVE Online world ?
How does
thread - based programming work ?
In your press releases you
do n’t offer much of an explanation on Stackless Python and
I ’m sure the community would be interested in hearing a
simplified version of what Stackless Python is all about .
Kristján : Python is by now a well - established
programming language .
Being an interpreted dynamic language , it allows
for great expressivity to the programmer and rapid development .
This
makes it easier to focus on the software architecture and the problems
at hand rather than having to deal with the infrastructure of languages
such as C ++.
In addition , the dynamic nature allows a very
high turnaround rate .
We can make changes to the code and see the
effects in the running client or server without restarting them .
It
turns out that performance in terms of programming output by developers
is just as important as the performance of the product they are
developing .
Stackless adds a further twist to this by allowing tasks to be
separated into smaller tasks , Tasklets , which can then be split off the
main program to execute on their own .
This can be used for
fire - and - forget tasks , like sending off an email , or dispatching an
event , or for IO operations , e.g. sending and receiving network
packets .
One tasklet waits for a packet from the network while others
continue running the game loop .
It is in some ways like threads , but is non-preemptive and
explicitly scheduled , so there are fewer issues with synchronization .
Also , switching between tasklets is much faster than thread switching ,
and you can have a huge number of active tasklets whereas the number of
threads is severely limited by the computer hardware .

EVE
Online runs well
on many different types of machines , but upgrading Stackless Python
made it even faster .
Ten Ton Hammer :
What sort of
factors helped push you towards the decision to upgrade Stackless
Python ?
You mentioned some upgrades to Python and the NeedForSpeed
sprint , but why choose to upgrade the client now rather than before
Revelations II or farther down the road ?
Kristján :
Due to various issues , mostly being
swamped with day - to - day development and maintenance of EVE , we
did n’t pay enough attention with keeping the Python part of
the engine up - to - date .
At various points we have attempted to catch up
but we never had the breathing space to do so .
This time we had the
core technology ready and decided to go for it .
It was a question of
reserving a space in the release schedule for it .
We wanted to apply
the change in the breathing room after Revelations II when the initial
flurry of hotfixes had subsided .
The patch went out without any other
change so that we could monitor the effects of this change in
isolation .
Ten Ton Hammer : Honestly ,
the performance improvements with Stackless Python seem to be pretty
substantial and certainly frees up some resources from the users that
you could take advantage of .
Might we see some upgrades to the EVE
client down the line , like improved graphics , more intensive AI , and
other enhancements that would not have been possible without Stackless
Python 2.5 ?
Kristján : Improvements to our graphics are
something we ’ve been working on for quite a while now and
players will begin seeing those this fall .
However , some of the slack
that is generated by improvements such as these is usually taken up
somewhat by something else .
On the client , for instance , the frame rate
may go up to compensate .
On the server side , we have found that
increased responsiveness reduces lag , which again stimulates the users
to place additional load on the servers .
People may be hesitant to give
up the improved responsiveness for more features .
It ’s a
question of balance , I suppose .
April 20 , 2007
Taking a cue from Cold War Soviet policy in Berlin � not to mention the enlightened approach of the Israeli government in the West Bank � the Bush Regime has begun walling off a Sunni enclave in Baghdad , driving a stake into the heart of the flickering reconciliation efforts among the Iraqi grassroots and solidifying the nation 's deadly sectarian divisions -- thus abetting the aims of the violent extremists operating both within and outside the Bush - backed Iraqi government .
The Sunnis of Adhamiya are being sealed into a ghetto by three miles of concrete , 12 feet high , made up of giant 14,000 - pound slabs being installed by monstrous cranes and heavy machinery in the dead of night , the Los Angeles Times reports .
When the enclosure is finished , Adhamiya will be an open - air prison , with access into and out of the ghetto controlled by U.S. and , presumably , Iraqi government forces .
Already the wall is destroying fragile personal and commercial ties between the area 's Sunni population and the surrounding Shiite areas , say residents .
It will also draw even more violence to the area , they add :
" Are they trying to divide us into different sectarian cantons ? " said a Sunni drugstore owner in Adhamiya , who would identify himself only as Abu Ahmed , 44 .
" This will deepen the sectarian strife and only serve to abort efforts aimed at reconciliation . "
Some of Ahmed 's customers come from Shiite or mixed neighborhoods that are now cut off by large barriers along a main highway .
Customers and others seeking to cross into the Sunni district must park their cars outside Adhamiya , walk through a narrow passage in the wall and take taxis on the other side .
Several residents interviewed likened the project to the massive barriers built by Israel around some Palestinian zones .
" Are we in the West Bank ? " asked Abu Qusay , 48 , a pharmacist who said that he would n't be able to get to his favorite kebab restaurant in Adhamiya .
Residents complained that Baghdad already has been dissected by hundreds of barriers that cause daily traffic snarls .
Some predicted the new wall would become a target of militants on both sides .
Last week , construction crews came under small - arms fire , military officials said .
" I feel this is the beginning of a pattern of what the whole of Iraq is going to look like , divided by sectarian and racial criteria , " Abu Marwan , 50 , a Shiite pharmacist , said .
U.S. officials told the Times that the imprisonment of Adhamiya was a unique expedient , and not part of the " surge " strategy .
" Dividing up the entire city with barriers is not part of the plan , " Lt. Col. Christopher Garver said .
But of course , Lt. Col. Christopher Garver was lying -- either knowingly or perhaps unknowingly , as he was doubtless simply parroting what he was told by his superiors .
But as we noted here last week ( Green Zone Down ) , dividing Baghdad into sealed - off ghettos controlled by the military is very much an integral part of Bush 's escalation of the war .
As Robert Fisk noted in the Independent :
Faced with an ever - more ruthless insurgency in Baghdad - despite President George Bush 's " surge " in troops - US forces in the city are now planning a massive and highly controversial counter - insurgency operation that will seal off vast areas of the city , enclosing whole neighbourhoods with barricades and allowing only Iraqis with newly issued ID cards to enter .
The campaign of " gated communities " - whose genesis was in the Vietnam War - will involve up to 30 of the city 's 89 official districts and will be the most ambitious counter - insurgency programme yet mounted by the US in Iraq ...
So far , the Baghdad campaign has involved only the creation of a few US positions within several civilian areas of the city but the new project will involve joint American and Iraqi " support bases " in nine of the 30 districts to be " gated " off .
From these bases - in fortified buildings - US - Iraqi forces will supposedly clear militias from civilian streets which will then be walled off and the occupants issued with ID cards .
Only the occupants will be allowed into these " gated communities " and there will be continuous patrolling by US - Iraqi forces .
There are likely to be pass systems , " visitor " registration and restrictions on movement outside the " gated communities " .
Civilians may find themselves inside a " controlled population " prison .
The Adhamiya ghetto is one of the first fruits of this sinister and doomed - to - failure plan .
Even the most savage pre-war critics of the Bush Faction 's aggression against Iraq -- and I was one of them -- did not foresee that it would come to this : the Iraqis literally being imprisoned in their own cities , walled up behind tons of concrete and bristling concertina wire , forced to run a gauntlet of armed guards and proffer ID cards simply to reach their own homes .
Any sentient being knew that Bush 's bullshit about " liberation " was a transparent hoax to cover a brutal rape of Iraq ; but I never thought he would actually herd the survivors into walled camps and set up ethnic ghettos in the heart of the ancient capital , like the Nazis partitioning Warsaw or Cracow .
But that 's precisely what 's happening now -- to the deafening silence of the American Establishment and the Democratic " opposition . " ***

LAS VEGAS – Some people believe that , right now , a quiet revolution is taking place .
In cities like London , San Francisco , Boston and New York , the ranks of bicycle riders are swelling with the rise of a new breed : the urban biker .
Traffic snarls , soaring gas prices and worries about global warming have prompted a big boost in cycling , affecting even places like Los Angeles – America 's freeway capital – that have traditionally given bicycles the cold shoulder .
" What 's really happened in the past year is a cultural shift , " says Monica Howe , 31 - year - old outreach coordinator for the Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition .
At Interbike 2007 , the bicycle industry 's giant annual trade show , the shift toward the urban rider is loudly evident .
Fancy road and mountain bikes are clearly no longer king of the roost – or road .
It 's the scads of fixed - gear , town , single - speed and other urban bicycles that are drawing the crowds .
The rise of the urban biker is reflected in Specialized 's 2008 catalog , which lists 34 different models of city bike to choose from .
The company is even rolling out six different versions of its ultrapopular single - speed , fixed - gear Langster .
Each model is named after a city that 's on the urban biker radar : the four cities named above , plus Chicago and Seattle .
The New York Langster has narrow handlebars for speeding through ranks of slow - moving cars , while the Seattle model is equipped with fenders .
" People really gravitated toward bikes with that urban feel , " says Travis Widder , an associate production manager at Specialized .
" We wanted to give nods toward cities where that bike sold well , where people really embraced that category . "
Interbike 2007 is a lot less sporty than years past .
Clothing manufacturers have more messenger bags on show .
Jerseys and shorts are more urban , less multi-colored lycra .
Swobo , the trendy clothing maker , recently launched its first line of three city bikes , and is just one of several companies showing new urban rides .
If anyone gave birth to the urban biker movement , it 's probably Sky Yaeger , Swobo 's managing director .
Yaeger was responsible for designing a slew of bikes during her time as production manager at famed Italian manufacturer Bianchi .
Some of her designs , like the fixed - gear Pista , have been elevated to cult status .
Thanks to the bike 's simplicity , it became the favored transport of urbanites like skaters and surfers .
" What happened is we crossed over the bike culture into skate , surf , " she says .
" The kids that are doing it now would n't have bought a bike five years ago .
That 's a huge delight to me – because they 're on bikes . "
In L.A. , the bike revolution is helped by shops like the grassroots Bicycle Kitchen .
" It makes it easy for anyone to put together a bike cheap , " says Howe .
" And it made it hip , which ca n't hurt . "
Volunteers at the Salt Lake City Bicycle Collective , a nonprofit that provides tools and training for riders to maintain their bikes , have experienced a huge bump in visitors .
" It 's gotten out of hand , " says Michael Wise , the collective 's treasurer .
" We do n't have enough volunteers to help the people coming in looking . "
San Francisco 's trendy Mission District is a hotbed of bicycle activity .
A bicycle lane running the length of Valencia Street is a major artery , as hipsters in hoodies and precisely rolled , tight - fitting jeans flow along the street .
At Valencia Cyclery , which is often proclaimed the city 's best bike store , sales associate Babs Brockaway says she 's seen the number of customers leaving with shiny new fixed - gear ( " fixie " ) and single - speed bikes skyrocket .
The store stocks five or six choices , up from a single model two years ago .
The simplicity appeals to neophyte riders overwhelmed by too much technology .
" It 's simple : You just pedal , " she says .
" This is shocking , but there are people who buy bikes with gears , who do n't shift gears . "
Just across from Valencia Cyclery is Ritual Coffee Roasters , a popular coffeehouse often stuffed full of young hipsters glued to their MacBooks .
It 's also a favorite haunt of the urban biker .
Outside , Matt McDonald , a 24 - year - old photographer from Boston , talks about his fixie .
" My friends in Boston were getting into these bikes , and it was just sort of appealing to me .
It 's like there 's nothing to worry about , and they 're just a blast to ride . "

Until now , he 's probably been best - known for one memorably straight - to - the - point quote - " D'oh ! "
But today , we can hail Homer Simpson as he takes his place in the pantheon of the world 's greatest word - weavers .
For the loveable slob from Springfield has secured himself not one , but two listings in the latest edition of the Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations .
The honour of appearing alongside golden - tongued literary luminaries including Winston Churchill and Oscar Wilde would probably sail straight over the yellow head of the pot -bellied hero who heads America 's most dysfunctional family in the celebrated cartoon series .
But in fact it is more of a tribute to Simpsons creator Matt Groening and his talented team .
It was Groening 's scriptwriters who had Homer utter the immortal phrase : " Kids , you tried your best and you failed miserably .
The lesson is never try . "
It appeared in an episode entitled Burns ' Heir , written by Jack Richdale in 1994 .
Another to appear in the dictionary - which is published today - is Homer 's homily to the local Asian shopkeeper : " Kids are the best , Apu .
You can teach them to hate the things you hate .
And they practically raise themselves , what with the internet and all . "
It came in a 1999 episode entitled Eight Misbehavin ' , written by Matt Selma .
Both quotations appear under the entry for 53 - year - old Groening , who is classified by the compilers as an American humorist and satirist .
Homer is not , however , the first character from The Simpsons to find a place in the respected dictionary .
Already there is the much - repeated reference to the French by Scottish caretaker Groundskeeper Willie , who remarked : " Bonjour , you cheese - eating surrender monkeys " in a 1995 episode .
And Homer 's son Bart has entered the hall of fame under a special catchphrase category for his " Eat my shorts ! " and " I'm Bart Simpson .
Who the hell are you ? "
Simpsons fanatics will also note that quotes which have not yet made it into the volume include schoolboy Ralph Wiggum 's comment : " Me fail English ?
That 's unpossible . "
The last edition of the book , which charts the ebb and flow of popular culture and marks some of the key moments in history , was published in 2002 .
The new collection of more than 5,000 quotations paints a vivid picture of our modern world .
From the mouth of Joan Collins there is an insight into love with the utterance : " Older men treat women like possessions , which is why I like younger men . "
Meanwhile , Stephen
Fry gives a take on modern life with the observation that , " The e-mail of the species is deadlier than the mail " .
And there is a rather double - edged comment on the love of money contained in the quote from fallen media tycoon Conrad Black : " Since when was greed a criminal offence ? "
In a reflection of the impact of advertising on the modern world , furniture chain Ikea 's slogan " Chuck out the chintz " joins old favourites such as " It 's good to talk " from BT .
Another slogan that has been a household and media favourite for years also enters the book for the first time : " Naughty but nice " was dreamed up by the National Dairy Council in the 1980s in a bid to sell more cream .
Pamela Anderson and William Hague are others to contribute wise words , along with Gordon Brown and David Cameron and even Kate Middleton .
Dictionary editor Elizabeth Knowles said : " To edit a dictionary of modern quotations is endlessly fascinating - you find yourself looking at today 's world from the perspective of a host of people from past and present , in quotations ranging from the deeply serious to the frivolous and surreal .
" And each time you come back to the book , you see from a new viewpoint , or hear a new voice . "

Soldiers were forced to flee after their vehicles caught fire
Enlarge Image
Brigadier John Lorimer said it was of " deep concern " the men detained by police ended up held by Shia militia .
Basra governor Mohammed al - Waili said the men - possibly working undercover - were arrested for allegedly shooting dead a policeman and wounding another .
The arrests sparked unrest in which Army vehicles were attacked .
In a statement , Brig Lorimer said that under Iraqi law the soldiers should have been handed over to coalition authorities , but this failed to happen despite repeated requests .
" I had good reason to believe that the lives of the soldiers were at risk and troops were sent to the area of Basra near the police station to help ensure their safety by providing a cordon , " Brig Lorimer said .

" Later in the day , however , I became more concerned about the safety of the two soldiers after we received information that they had been handed over to militia elements . "
After troops broke into the police station to confirm the men were not there , they staged a rescue from a house in Basra , said the commanding officer of 12 Mechanised Brigade in Basra .
Brig Lorimer added : " It is of deep concern that British soldiers held by the police should then end up being held by the militia .
This is unacceptable . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
Pulling out at this stage would be irresponsible
Richard , London , UK
Send us your comments
BBC Defence Correspondent Paul Wood said local police revealed the whereabouts of the two men after the station was stormed .
" At the point of a 30 mm cannon - no shots were fired - but at the point of this cannon , the Iraqi police gave away the location of where the two British soldiers had been taken , " he said .
Vehicles set alight
A Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) spokesman earlier said a Warrior armoured vehicle had broken down the perimeter wall at the police station .
Mr al - Waili said more than 10 vehicles and helicopters had been used in an operation that was a " barbaric act of aggression " .
We remain committed to helping the Iraqi government for as long as they judge that a coalition presence is necessary
Defence Secretary John Reid
Timeline : UK troops in Iraq
How events unfolded
Two British armoured vehicles earlier sent to the police station were set alight in clashes .
TV pictures showed crowds of angry protesters hurling petrol bombs and stones , and soldiers in combat gear clambering from one of the flaming vehicles and making their escape .
Reports said two Iraqi civilians were killed and three soldiers injured in the clashes .
In a statement , Defence Secretary John Reid said the soldiers were being treated for minor injuries .
' Police infiltrated '
The BBC's Paul Wood said none of Basra 's 20,000 police officers had helped the UK troops " partly because of reticence by their commanders , partly because , I am afraid , they have been infiltrated by these militants " .
He added : " Now we are in the situation where presumably revenge will be sought by relatives of the dead Iraqis - and our allies in the police , I think there has been a complete breakdown of trust and it's going to be very difficult for British troops to call on them . "
Mr Reid said : " We remain committed to helping the Iraqi government for as long as they judge that a coalition presence is necessary to provide security . "
British officials would not say if the two men were working undercover
" This is bound to be seen as a humiliation by many Iraqis - something the insurgents will use to their advantage . "
Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram called on ministers to explain who would decide when to leave Iraq and on what basis .
Colonel Tim Collins , a former commander of British troops in Iraq , said Monday 's violence did not represent a breakdown of law and order in Basra , which was still a safer city than Baghdad .
On Tuesday a suicide car bombing in the northern city of Mosul killed a US diplomatic security guard and three US private contractors , according to American officials .
The US military also announced that four of its soldiers attached to the Marines were killed in two roadside bombings in the western city of Ramadi on Monday .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 25 — With the 2008 presidential and Congressional elections on the horizon , the Supreme Court agreed today to consider whether voter - identification laws unfairly keep poor people and members of minority groups from going to the polls .
The justices will hear arguments from an Indiana case , in which a federal district judge and a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in January upheld a state law requiring , with certain exceptions , that someone wanting to vote in person in a primary or general election present a government - issued photo identification .
Presumably , the court would rule on the case by June .
Before the law was enacted in 2005 , an Indiana voter was required only to sign a book at the polling place , where a photocopy of the voter ’s signature was kept on file .
Voter - identification requirements have divided Democrats and Republicans , and the courts , for years .
In July , the Michigan Supreme Court upheld that state ’s identification law .
A month earlier , the Georgia high court threw out a challenge to that state ’s identification law .
But last year , the Missouri Supreme Court overturned a state voter - identification statute .
Other states are considering various identification statutes .
Why is the square root of 2 irrational ?
It was one of the most surprising discoveries of the Pythagorean School of Greek mathematicians that there are irrational numbers .
According to Courant and Robbins in " What is Mathematics " :
This revelation was a scientific event of the highest importance .
Quite possibly it marked the origin of what we consider the specifically Greek contribution to rigorous procedure in mathematics .
Certainly it has profoundly affected mathematics and philosophy from the time of the Greeks to the present day .
Specifically , the Greeks discovered that the diagonal of a square whose sides are 1 unit long has a diagonal whose length cannot be rational .
By the Pythagorean Theorem , the length of the diagonal equals the square root of 2 .
So the square root of 2 is irrational !
The following proof is a classic example of a proof by contradiction :
We want to show that A is true , so we assume it 's not , and come to contradiction .
Thus A must be true since there are no contradictions in mathematics !

A few months ago , the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins received an e-mail message from a producer at Rampant Films inviting him to be interviewed for a documentary called “ Crossroads . ”
The film , with Ben Stein , the actor , economist and freelance columnist , as its host , is described on Rampant ’s Web site as an examination of the intersection of science and religion .
Dr. Dawkins was an obvious choice .
An eminent scientist who teaches at Oxford University in England , he is also an outspoken atheist who has repeatedly likened religious faith to a mental defect .
But now , Dr. Dawkins and other scientists who agreed to be interviewed say they are surprised — and in some cases , angered — to find themselves not in “ Crossroads ” but in a film with a new name and one that makes the case for intelligent design , an ideological cousin of creationism .
The film , “ Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , ” also has a different producer , Premise Media .
The film is described in its online trailer as “ a startling revelation that freedom of thought and freedom of inquiry have been expelled from publicly - funded high schools , universities and research institutions . ”
According to its
Web site , the film asserts that people in academia who see evidence of a supernatural intelligence in biological processes have unfairly lost their jobs , been denied tenure or suffered other penalties as part of a scientific conspiracy to keep God out of the nation ’s laboratories and classrooms .

The Sexual Abuse by Women of Children and Teenagers Summary of UK TV programme - Panorama - BBC1 - 10 pm Monday 6th October 1997
The sexual abuse of children by women was once thought to be so rare it could be ignored .
In this programme the victims tell a different story .
Summary
This was a vivid and horrific programme in which the victims of sexual abuse by women told disturbing stories of emotional and physical damage : Rape and attempted murder of a 12 year old boy by a 19 year old girl
Rape and abuse of a 12 year old boy over a two year period by a 28 year old mother of four
Rape and abuse of boys by their mother
Rape and abuse of girls by their mother
Women taking a lead role in pornographic violence and abuse
Children abused by nuns
Children abused at playgroup
Boy abused by lesbians
It was acknowledged that the scale and nature of these attacks had been severely underestimated and there were examples of women using excessive force with implements such as chair legs and cutlery .
A surprising 86 % of survivors of sexual abuse were not believed when they said the abuser was a woman .
Many myths were exposed , such as the one that women only sexually abused when coerced by men - they in fact played the lead part .
Also the myth that women are incapable of cruelty - what was shown was beyond belief .
But despite the seriousness of these offences , women generally escaped custodial sentences .
Statistics
The programme claimed that : Women commit 25 % of all child sexual abuse
250,000 children in UK have been sexually abused by women People find it difficult to believe
The issue strikes at the core of what women perceive themselves to be :
The whole view of women is of nurturers , carers , protectors - people who do anything to look after children
The crime seems so unnatural it offends against all instincts , so society is reluctant to even associate women with sexual abuse
It 's easier to think that it 's men - men the enemy , somehow - but it can't be women - it's one thing women can't do Society excuses female abusers
What tends to happen is that the female sexual abuser is excused in some way .
" She must have been misguided " , or it was a " chronicled affair " .
We would n't have said that about a man .
And what happens is that the sentences are more lenient .
The judges might even think " Well a woman really could n't have done this - it must have been a mistake " .
And they usually get probation or they walk free .
A man doing that would be locked up .
their testimony shatters the myth that women only sexually abuse if coerced by men .
Women are seen as victims Women are seen as victims rather than enemies or perpetrators of any abuse .
Women in our society have been portrayed as victims , but somewhere within their victimisation they have learned that to abuse children gave them a sense of power , control , agency , and therefore they use the abuse of children to gain those things .
Disbelief the biggest trauma
The biggest trauma for some victims is disbelief .
A survey of 127 survivors by the children 's charity Kidscape showed 86 % were not believed at first when they named a woman as their abuser .
The fact that we are not expecting women in our society to do this - not expecting that women our society do this actually has profound effects on the victims , often making the experience go on much longer than it would have done in other cases , but also making them feel more stigmatised , more different , more betrayed , more powerless .
More traumatic to be sexually abused by a woman
It was more traumatic to be sexually abused by a woman - children feel more betrayed , they feel very angry , they feel the woman should have cared for them , should have loved them instead of abusing them .
Violent and sadistic attacks
The violence that often accompanies the abuse is unexpected of a woman .
Victims often report excessive force equivalent to if not greater than that of a man .
Women are supposed to be the gentler sex , women are supposed to be incapable of cruelty in a sense
Many of the abusers have been very sadistic - cruelty that is almost unimaginable .
Half the women in a recent survey of 50 convicted female sexual abusers said they derived sadistic pleasure from inflicting pain on victims .
Across the board
The research showed neither class nor age were barriers to their behaviour .
We can't make assumptions about the type of woman who will sexually abuse a child - sexual abuse is committed by : Women of any age from young teenagers to grandmothers
Women from any class - from women who barely had a house to live in during their life to women with very large houses .
Women from any level of education - women who can barely read and write to women who 've got degrees .
Female abusers acquire positions of trust Some children are n't just at risk from the people they live with ; they are vulnerable targets when they leave their homes .
Out in the community female sexual abusers can manoeuvre with even more ease than men into positions of trust with authority over lost of children .
Eternal victims
Some of those abused become eternal victims and never recover from that .
Other children will mask their confusions and go into adulthood and never really be able to sustain relationships , or have very distorted relationships because of their enormous confusions .
And there are other children who will go on to hurt not only other children in their own childhood but in adulthood .
The need for more work
There 's very very little being done to look at the issue of female sexual abuse .
We have no programmes in this country that are aimed at working with female sexual offenders specifically .
Quite a lot of professionals are picking up women offenders now .
What they 're not doing is having the resources to help them deal with these women offenders .
It 's because so many professionals are now getting to pick up women offenders that we are now getting to realise some of the extent of the problem throughout the country .
Few abusers ever volunteer their guilt , and behind closed doors it is difficult to prove .
A woman 's traditional role in the home as a mother often puts her above suspicion , and medical evidence is hard to obtain .
But as more and more of women 's victims come forward and speak out they may just force us to face up to the ultimate taboo .

On Wednesday September 19 , 2007 the U.S. State Department and United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) announced the provision of $ 496,000 of new funds for wildlife conservation in the Virunga National Park in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo .
According to a State Department press release , poaching , armed conflict and “ demographic pressures ” are justification for the grant .
But investigations in Eastern Congo reported by these authors over the past six months indicate that USAID “ conservation ” funds — millions of taxpayer ’s dollars — have been misappropriated , misdirected , and have disappeared .
Evidence suggests that ongoing guerrilla warfare in Central Africa has and is continuing to receive clandestine financial support in AID - for - ARMS type financial transfers .
Gorilla rangers are outfitted with well - oiled machine guns , courtesy of fundraising campaigns by conservation organizations .
It is historical fact that the U.S. underpinned the rule of Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko by providing more than $ 300 million in weapons and $ 100 million in military training .
Mobutu used his U.S. - supplied arsenal to repress the Congolese people and plunder his nation ’s economy for three decades , until Laurent Kabila ’s forces overthrew his brutal regime in 1997 .
In order to prop up US interests in the strategic resources of Congo , the Clinton administration quickly offered military support to Kabila and developed a plan for new training operations with the armed forces .

The problem is though that it can be hard to sort out who is in this for the money and the fame and who is in it for hip hop .
Its kind of like some of the most famous artists , you know they love hip hop and could live without the expensive toys .
But they do like those toys , so as long as its an option , they will rap and be rich .
Also , just because someone was born a hustler , that does not mean they do not love hip hop .
It kind of leaves the question , we know that most of the recent artists are a bunch of fakes , but what about some of the recent legends ?
Take Sean Carter .
If the money left hip - hop , would he stay ?
Would he still put out new stuff ?
Or just sit back and enjoy ?
I think he would , I know his background and he did not grow up wanting money , he wanted music .
But considering he is the best living example of someone to blend hip - hop and popular styles , its a tough call .
You know Sean Combs would fold , he 's definitely about the money .
Young Joc , Young Dro , this Hurricane Chris guy , yah , they are about money .
But what about TI ?
Is he about money and fame , or hip hop ?
I cannot figure it out , he seems like someone who likes the music but then he goes and tells XXLMag that its just a job .
And he never stops talking about the money , and calls this " a game . "
Seems money , but if we stripped away all the money in the music , would he stay ?
Kanye West ?
You know he could probably produce any music , with his love of sampling popular music like Daft Punk ( most recently ) , and could definitely live as just some kind of urban fashion guru .
So why does he ever release music himself ?
Does he love hip hop , or is it really about the money ?
And then there is the dilemma I hit most often .
Being a college student , I see plenty of " independent " MCs .
There probably are a few out there that really do love the music and just would not compromise for the money , and the money would need to come with no strings if they were to take it .
But then there are the two classes I hate most : the " independent " rapper who says he would never sell out but would at the drop of a dime , and the rapper who only is there so he / she can pretend to love the music , they really just want to seem " alternative " or " underground . "
I hate them the most .
I guess I should not try and tackle so many different problems in the music at once , but who here would vouch for a popular artist in the past 20 years as the real deal ?
And what artist ?
I vote Eminem and Jay - Z , but I do not know .
Posted by : Allen at August 26 , 2007 1:55 AM
And its another thing to wonder about as to who really is killing hip hop .
Some say its snap music , but to say the southern scene is entirely to blame would be stupid .
Lets look at what really brought it to the front page : Nas and " Hip Hop is Dead . "
Thats the album that really kind of announced to the world " yes , its been done . "
But who produced that album ?
will.i.am , Kanye West , Scott Storch , and Dr. Dre. Kanye and Storch are nothing if not pop-hop .
Dre was maybe the first of the most popular " gangsta " rappers , Storch is a admitted pop-hopper , and West , well , " Louis Vitton Don . "
But as I said before , West does not have to be in hip hop , and I do not know enough about will .i.am to say he is in it for the money and fame .
Dre , well he is a legend for sure , but is he in it for the music or not ?
I do not know .
And these are the producers of the main track !
And here is a new track title : " Hip Hop is confusing right now . "
Posted by : Allen at August 26 , 2007 2:22 AM

Now , perhaps the unwashed masses will leave the dead to rest .

I think people have taken the " Hip - Hop is Dead " sloganeering / catchphrase / propaganda / WHATEVER to a point where it's not defined at all , and nothing more than a thing to shout ; a pretentious variant on " G - G - G - G - G - UNIT ! " even .
Hip - hop is n't dying , it does n't need a " savior " , at the most , it 's just shifted away from lyricism in the " mainstream " , which is what most " underground hip - hop heads " associate with good hip - hop .
Honestly , people crying out that " Hip - Hop is Dead " could be a good thing , because it makes rappers want to become " Hip - Hop 's savior " , whether Hip - Hop needs it or not .
At the very least , it can be used as inspiration for rappers to " elevate " .
But man ... would n't it be great just to have hip - hop all to ourselves ?
A vague thought , but I think you know what I mean ...

It 's not that hip - hop is dead .. it 's just that there was the illusion for a while that hip - hop was bigger than it actually was ... now those in it for the fashion are moving on to the next shiny morsel , they like to decry the rich culture they just finished nostril raping as being dead .... it 's human nature ....

Hip Hop , DEAD ?
I do n't think so , the culture itself is alive and well and stronger than any other culture ( ex. punk and rave ) , REAL hip hop in the form of music is mostly an underground sensation , while mainstream " gangsta " rap is the one taking over the radio stations , music channels , and so on .
Those of you who " claim " hip hop is dead are mostly the ones that do n't know shit about the music and culture and are most likely just another hater who can't deal or stand hip hop 's success for the past 30 or so years .
And the one who said " long live hair bands " LOL that was funny , hair metal IS DEAD .
Posted by : Rap lover from the 415 at January 7 , 2008 3:10 AM hip hop is grossly out of style and has been for some time .
do n't you people ever notice the people laughing atyou when you 're trying to be cool ? i used to go to partys where people played hip hop but now people just shake they 're heads and leave when someone fires up a hip hop cd.trying to be black ain't fashionable anymore , i can't understand why it ever was .
but like disco , rap and hip hop will pass just like a hard terd ........... lololololololol

Science reporter , BBC News , Houston
Nasa release on the topography of the south polar region of Mars
The candidate caves are on the flanks of the Arsia Mons volcano and are of sufficient depth their floors mostly cannot be seen through the opening .
Details were presented here at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston , Texas .
Temperature data from Mars Odyssey 's
Themis instrument support the idea .
The authors say that the possible discovery of caves on the Red Planet is significant .
The caves may be the only natural structures capable of protecting primitive life forms from micrometeoroids , UV radiation , solar flares and high energy particles that bombard the planet 's surface .
The spacecraft spotted what seemed to be vertical " skylight " entrances to caves below the surface .
There is a sheer drop of between about 80 m and 130 m or more to the cave floors below .
' Seven sisters '
During the day , one of the features - nicknamed " Annie " - is warmer than surrounding pits and cooler than sunlit areas .
Night time temperatures are warmer than nearly all surrounding areas .
Co-author Glen Cushing , from the US Geological Survey in Flagstaff , Arizona , said this was exactly what would be expected if the feature were a cave .
" Nothing like these features has been seen elsewhere on Mars , " he told BBC News .
The researchers describe the candidate caves as " seven sisters " and have given them all names : Dena , Chloe , Wendy , Annie , Abbey , Nicki and Jeanne .
The cave entrances are between 100 m and 252 m wide ( 330-828ft ) .
Because in most cases the cave floors cannot be seen , only minimum depths are known : the researchers calculated they must extend between 73 m and 96 m ( 240-315 ft ) below the surface .
However , in one image taken of Dena by the Mars Odyssey Camera , a floor can be seen .
Using the data , the authors calculated that this cave must extend 130 m ( 426 ft ) below the surface .
Mars Odyssey was launched in April 2001 to hunt for past or present water on the Red Planet .
Its Themis ( Thermal Emission Imaging System ) instrument uses the visible and infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum to measure the temperature properties of the Martian surface .

Wireless working is becoming more popular
Students at Canada 's Lakehead University have to be careful how they connect to the internet because wi-fi is banned on large parts of the campus .
University president Fred Gilbert , whose academic interests include wildlife management , environmental studies and natural resources science , is worried about the health impact of the 2.4 Ghz radio waves used by wireless networks
Last year he decided to adopt the precautionary principle and refused to allow wi- fi in those areas that have what he calls " hard wire connectivity " until it is proved to be safe .
Mr Gilbert believes that " microwave radiation in the frequency range of wi-fi has been shown to increase permeability of the blood - brain barrier , cause behavioural changes , alter cognitive functions , activate a stress response , interfere with brain waves , cell growth , cell communication , calcium ion balance , etc. , and cause single and double strand DNA breaks " .
Unfortunately the science says he is wrong , and his students are suffering as a result .
Smog talk
While the heating effects of high exposures to electromagnetic radiation can be damaging , the power levels of wireless connections are much lower than the microwave ovens and mobile phones which share the frequency range , and treating them in the same way is the worst sort of scaremongering .
Yet Mr Gilbert is not alone .
While those who want to limit the use of wi-fi argue that they need evidence that is it safe , the problem with trying to prove that something is safe is that you can't .
And there are a number of pressure groups , campaigning organisations and ill - informed individuals who believe that wireless networks pose a threat to health and want to see them closed down .
Now it seems they have been joined by the editor of the UK newspaper the Independent on Sunday , which this weekend filled its front page with a call for research into the " electronic smog " that is permeating the nation 's schools and damaging growing children 's ' brains .
An accompanying editorial with the even - handed headline " high - tech horrors " called for an official inquiry , while the article outlining the perceived dangers asked " Is the wi - fi revolution a health time bomb ? "
The answer , of course , is " no " .
That will not stop the newspaper stoking up a wave of opposition to one of the most liberating technologies to have come out of the hi-tech revolution , limiting children 's access to networked computers at schools and even blocking plans to develop municipal wireless networks in our towns and cities .
Wi -fi has been removed from some UK schools
The modulated frequencies that carry Radio 4 and ITV into our homes are just as powerful as the wireless networks , and a lot more pervasive .
And my wireless network is only carrying data when I 'm online , while Radio 3 burbles all day long , possibly exciting electrons in my brain and causing headaches .
Then there is the danger from photons of visible light streaming down onto us as we work , since these carry more energy than microwaves and could surely do more damage .
Perhaps we should demand that our children work in the dark .

The fuss over wi-fi is the latest manifestation of a general worry about electromagnetic radiation , one whose concerns have ranged over the years from the fields around power transmission lines to the radiation emitted by computer monitors to the microwaves put out by mobile phones .
Campaigners are often supported by those who claim to be so sensitive to electromagnetic radiation that they cannot bear to have a radio turned on in the same room because the fields affect their brains , or those who claim that using a mobile phone gives them headaches .
Science is about proving theories wrong , not right said Karl Popper
There is no evidence that electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies , where the energy levels are too low to dislodge electrons and affect molecular bonding , can cause health effects except by heating tissues .
While those who want to limit the use of wi-fi argue that they need evidence that is it safe , the problem with trying to prove that something is safe is that you can't .
Karl Popper , the great philosopher of science , helped us to understand that science is about falsification , about setting up hypotheses and theories and proving them wrong , because you can never prove them right .
Any theory can be overturned by new evidence , and any claim that wireless networks are completely safe could be thrown out tomorrow if we find good evidence that it is n't .
We may come up with a hitherto unsuspected mechanism that explains a previously disregarded effect , or the evidence may be statistical and require detailed investigation .
Were that to happen we should take it seriously , but it has not happened and there is no reason to believe it will .
The precautionary principle , of avoiding exposure to unnecessary risk , does not apply here because there is no known mechanism by which wireless networks could cause damage .
We have a sound model of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and organic matter that gives us little reason to believe that there will be any dangers .
For William Stewart , chairman of the Health Protection Agency and a former chief scientific adviser to the Government , to argue for an investigation on the basis of no real evidence that there is an effect , and in the absence of any plausible physical mechanism , is indefensible .
Cellphones heat the brain and could cause problems .
Wi - fi does n't , and it is safe .
My daughter is sitting here as I write , her new wireless laptop beside her , and I 'm a lot more worried about the damage she would do if she dropped it on her foot than I am about the impact of the low power radio waves it emits .

Teenage drivers would be prohibited from using their cell phones , iPhones , pagers , laptops or other popular communications gadgets under a new law signed this afternoon by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The legislation would take effect on July 1 for drivers under the age of 18 .
California joins more than a dozen other states with similar laws restricting teens from using cell phones and other " mobile service devices " while driving .
The California law imposes a fine of $ 20 for a first offense and $ 50 each time after that .
Traffic officers will not be allowed to pull over a driver exclusively for the cell phone violation , according to the California Highway Patrol .
Sen .
Joe Simitian , D - Palo Alto , who pushed through legislation last year that would require all drivers to use hands - free communication devices also beginning July 1 , said he believes that cell phones pose the greatest risk to drivers .
" I know that driving and having a cell phone are a rite of passage for our children , but the combination is clearly a deadly one , " he said today .
Simitian has cited a recent survey by the American Automobile Association and Seventeen magazine in which about 30 percent of teens polled admitted to being distracted when driving while either sending text messages or talking on cell phones .
Still , Matt Sundee , transportation analyst with the National Council of State Legislatures , said that there 's no clear data linking cell phone use with traffic accidents .
" There 's usually strong physical evidence at a crash site linking drunk driving or the lack of a seat belt to the accident , " he said .
" It 's really not that way with cell phones .
Cell phones are usually self - reported or by witnesses , so what data there is is controversial . "
Some teens , however , see the need for the new law even without hard numbers , said Craig Cook , an eighth - grade history teacher at a junior high school near Sacramento .
As part of a civics lesson , Cook 's class last spring analyzed Simitian 's bill and argued over its merits .
The result was overwhelming support for the bill , which the students formally submitted to the Legislature during hearings on the measure last spring .
" It surprised me , " said Cook .
" I try as a teacher not to assume too much and you 'd expect most of the kids would think of this as a horrible intrusion in their lives .
But by a two - to one vote , they supported the bill . "
I ’ve recently been exploring the implications of the following mantra :
The truth is in the file .
In this context it refers to a strategy for managing metadata ( e.g. , tags ) primarily in digital files ( e.g. , JPEG images , Word documents ) and only secondarily in a database derived from those files .
Commenting on an entry that explores how Vista uses this technique for photo tags , Brian Dorsey throws down a warning flag :
Many applications are guilty of changing JPEGs [ed : RAW file , not JPEGs , are the issue , see below ] behind the scenes and there is nothing forcing them to do it in compatible ways .
Here is a recent example with Vista .
A cautionary tale , indeed .
This is the kind of subject that does n’t necessarily yield right and wrong answers .
But we can at least put the various options on the table and discuss them .
There is an interesting comparison to be made , for example , between OS X and Vista .
While researching this topic I found this Lifehacker article on a feature of OS X that I completely missed .
You can tag a file in the GetInfo dialog , and when you do , the file will be instantly findable ( by that tag ) in SpotLight .
My purpose here is not to discuss or debate the OS X and Vista interfaces for tagging files and searching for tagged files .
I do however want to explore the implications of two different strategies : “ the truth is in the file ” versus “ the truth is in the database ” .
In Vista , if I tag yellowflower .jpg with iris , that tag lives primarily in the file yellowflower.jpg and secondarily in a database .
An advantage is that if I transfer that file to another operating system , or to a cloud - based service like Flickr , the effort I ’ve invested in tagging that file is ( or anyway can be ) preserved .
A disadvantage , as Brian points out , is that when different applications try to manage data that ’s living inside JPEG files , my investment in tagging can be lost .
Conversely , if I tag yellowflower .jpg with iris in OS X , yellowflower.jpg is untouched , the tag only lives in Spotlight ’s database .
If I transfer the file elsewhere , my investment in tagging is lost .
But on my own system , my tags are less vulnerable to corruption .
Arguably these are both valid strategies .
The Vista way optimizes for cross-system interoperability and collaboration , while the OS X way optimizes for single - system consistency .
Of course as always we ’d really like to have the best of both worlds .
Can we ?
It ’s a tough problem .
Vista tries to help with consistency by offering APIs in the .NET Framework for manipulating photo metadata .
But those APIs do n’t yet cover all the image formats , and even if they did , there ’s nothing to prevent developers from going around them and writing straight to the files .
For its part , OS X offers APIs for querying the Spotlight database .
So an application that wanted to marry up images and their metadata could do so , but there ’s no guarantee that a backup application or a Flickr uploader would do so .
It ’s an interesting conundrum .
Because I am mindful of the lively discussion over at Scoble ’s place about what matters to people in the real world , though , I do n’t want to leave this in the realm of technical arcana .
There are real risks and benefits associated with each of these strategies .
And while it ’s true that people want things to Just Work , that means different things to different people .
If you ’re an avid Flickr user , if you invest effort tagging photos in OS X , and if that effort is lost when you upload to Flickr , then OS X did not Just Work for you .
Conversely if you do n’t care about online photo sharing , if you invest effort tagging photos in Vista , and then another application corrupts your tags , then Vista did not Just Work for you .
I think many people would understand that explanation .
In principle , both operating systems could frame the issue in exactly those terms , and could even offer a choice of strategy based on your preferred workstyle .
In practice that ’s problematic because people do n’t really want choice , they want things to Just Work , and they ’d like technology to divine what Just Work means to them , which it can ’t .
It ’s also problematic because framing the choice requires a frank assessment of both risks and benefits , and no vendor wants to talk about risks .
I guess that in the end , both systems are going to have to bite the bullet and figure out how to Just Work for everybody .
One decision you ’ll have to make about your uISV is where you send all your hard - earned money .
This gets a bit more complicated if you ’ve got an international operation , so hopefully this will be of use to some folks in that circumstance .
Can I Get A US Bank Account Without Residing
In the US ?
This is easily the most frequent question on the Business of Software boards about banking .
The short answer is yes .
The long answer is “ America did n’t become the world ’s largest economy by saying no to greenbacks , and billions of dollars passes through millions of foreigner - controlled accounts every day .
Forget what you ’ve heard about the Patriot Act , if you ’re not on a watchlist this actually is n’t that hard , provided you can find a bank which will let you . ”
The key obstacle you ’ve got to overcome is called Know Your Customer , a regulation that requires that banks know who they are doing business with ( i.e. that their account holders are not fictitious fronts for Bad People ) .
Many banks interpret that as meaning you need a branch visit , but that is hardly universal .
Citibank , for example , will take a driver ’s license number over the phone as sufficient for KYC .
That does n’t help you if you ’re in Romania , of course .
What does is banks which are controlled by a non-banking organization , such as E - Trade Banking , which is a financial services arm of an online brokerage .
You can open an E - Trade investment account from just about anywhere .
Then , if you call their customer support line and ask to have banking services added to your account , they ’ll take the existence of your investment account as sufficient evidence that you actually exist , and you ’ll just have to fax over a copy of your passport to get a checking account , check card , and online banking activated .
E- Trade is n’t the only institution that will do this — many American brokerages have US accounts available worldwide , because one of the biggest reasons to have a US account if you are not US - based is to invest in US assets without paying an intermediary lots of money .
Got a recommendation for a bank for the rest of us ?
Everyone wants different things in a bank .
I like decent interest rates , good online banking , and easy access to ACH payments ( Automated Clearing House — when you receive money from Paypal or pay bills online , that is what you are using ) .
My top recommendation is ING Direct ’s Electric Orange ( its a checking account ) , for three reasons : Paypal and Google ACH payments credit within 1 - 2 business days , which means you get extra interest , you actually do earn interest on the checking account ( 3 % unless you ’re loaded ) , and they have a very responsive website .
They do n’t have branch offices but I could literally go the rest of my life without needing teller help for simple transactions .
You need to have a checking account at a bricks and mortar ( US ) bank to open an Electric Orange account .
I also recommend that all uISVs get a credit card which pays cash back .
There are a billion providers here , take your favorite .
While I do n’t recommend ever carrying a balance on your credit card , paying all of those recurring monthly expenses and software purchases on a credit card makes for easy record keeping , 1 % off your expenses every month , and gives you some protection should a transaction go sour .
If you ’re using Paypal the Paypal debit card gives you 1 % back , but you ’d have to keep sufficient amounts of money in your Paypal account to cover all purchases , and that requirement does n’t sit well with me .

Jon Stewart : Bush says ' in other words ' a lot because we 're all so dumb David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 10 , 2007
Print This Email This On Thursday 's Daily Show , Jon Stewart showed a clip of President Bush responding to a question about criticism from Neil Cavuto of Fox News by saying , " I 've been around long enough to be able to understand how it works .
Nobody likes to be called names .
On the other there 's -- we 've got a bigger enemy than name - callers .
That 's al - Qaeda .
Or people losing jobs . "
" Oh , my god ! " screamed Stewart .
" We 're now fighting al Qaeda and the unemployed !
They 're everywhere ! "
Stewart then showed Bush telling Cavuto , " I mean , if bridges -- if rebuilding bridges is that big a priority , then we ought to prioritize that in the highway monies that we 've already budgeted .
...
In other words , prioritization means real prioritization . "
" A equals A , " commented Stewart .
" It 's what 's known in math as the retardative property . "
Stewart further pointed out that the phrase " in other words " is most commonly used when " the brilliant struggle to bring the complexities of higher thought down to the masses .
The president often has to employ this rhetorical device , what with all of us being so dumb , like that time we could n't understand why we were invading Iraq and Saddam Hussein . "
This was followed by a clip of Bush explaining , " He was a state sponsor of terror .
In other words , the government had declared ' you are a state sponsor of terror . ' "
Stewart went on to show a series of similar clips , ending with Bush saying , " ... in other words , the ability to discuss issues such as -- beef . "
" Here 's the thing , Mr. President , " Stewart concluded .
" People who use the phrase ' in other words ' think you do n't understand what they 're saying .
We understand what you 're saying .
The look on our face is n't confusion .
It 's disbelief .
In other words , we understand , we just do n't fucking get it . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on August 9 .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) -- Iraqi officials Monday condemned the weekend killings of eight civilians during a Baghdad street battle involving American security contractors and said they would shut down Blackwater , the company involved .
A Blackwater helicopter hovers over Baghdad in July 2005 .
Blackwater said its employees acted in self - defense .
The U.S. State Department said it plans to investigate what it calls a " terrible incident . "
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki to express regret for the weekend killings , both governments said .
In addition to the fatalities , 14 people were wounded , most of them civilians , an Iraqi official said .
Sunday 's firefight took place near Nusoor Square , an area that straddles the predominantly Sunni Arab neighborhoods of Mansour and Yarmouk .
The ministry said the incident began around midday , when a convoy of sport utility vehicles came under fire from unidentified gunmen in the square .
The men in the SUVs , described by witnesses as Westerners , returned fire , the ministry said .
Blackwater 's employees were protecting a U.S. official when they were hit by " a large explosive device , then repeated small - arms fire -- and to the point where it disabled one of the vehicles , and the vehicle had to be towed out of the firefight , " said Marty Strong , vice president of Blackwater USA .
A senior industry source said Blackwater guards had escorted a State Department group to a meeting with U.S. Agency for International Development officials in Mansour before the shootings .
A car bomb went off about 80 feet ( 25 meters ) from the meeting site and the contractors started evacuating the State Department officials , he said .
A State Department report on the attack said the convoy came under fire from an estimated eight to 10 people , some in Iraqi police uniforms .
The guards called for backup , at one point finding their escape route blocked by an Iraqi quick - reaction force that pointed heavy machine guns at one vehicle in the convoy .
A U.S. Army force , backed by air cover , arrived about half an hour later to escort the convoy back to the Green Zone , the report states .
A team from another security company passed through the area shortly after the street battle .
" Our people saw a couple of cars destroyed , " Carter Andress , CEO of American - Iraqi Solutions Groups , told CNN on Monday .
" Dead bodies , wounded people being evacuated .
The U.S. military had moved in and secured the area .
It was not a good scene . "
An Interior Ministry spokesman , Brig .
Gen. Abdul Kareem Khalaf , said , " We have revoked Blackwater 's license to operate in Iraq .
As of now they are not allowed to operate anywhere in the Republic of Iraq .
The investigation is ongoing , and all those responsible for Sunday 's killing will be referred to Iraqi justice . "
Watch why the Interior Ministry revoked Blackwater 's license »
Company and State Department officials said they had not been notified of any order to that effect .
Rice and al - Maliki agreed to conduct " a fair and transparent investigation into this incident " and punish those responsible , the prime minister 's office said .
The Diplomatic Security Service has launched an official investigation , a review that will be supported by the Multi-National Forces - Iraq , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said .
" The secretary wants to make sure we do everything we possibly can to avoid innocent loss of life , " he said .
McCormack said that while the United States tries to avoid innocent casualties , " we are fighting people who do n't play by any rules " and have no problem killing innocent civilians .
The weekend 's incident raised concerns in the U.S. Congress about the use of private security guards .
Rep. Henry Waxman , whose House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held hearings on contractor operations in February , said he will hold new hearings into the issue in light of Sunday 's shootings .
" The controversy over Blackwater is an unfortunate demonstration of the perils of excessive reliance on private security contractors , " said Waxman , D - California .
Blackwater , founded in 1997 and based in Moyock , North Carolina , is one of many security firms contracted by the U.S. government during the Iraq war .
An estimated 25,000 employees of private security firms are working in Iraq , guarding diplomats , reconstruction workers and government officials .
As many as 200 are believed to have been killed on the job , according to U.S. congressional reports .
Some Blackwater personnel died in a grisly attack in Iraq more than three years ago that sparked shock and outrage in the United States .
Four Americans working as private security personnel for Blackwater , all of whom were military veterans , were ambushed , killed and mutilated in March 2004 in Falluja , west of Baghdad .
People close to the company estimate it has lost about 30 employees during the war .
Iraqi authorities have issued previous complaints about shootings by private military contractors , the Congressional Research Service reported in July .
" Most recently , a news article discussing an incident in which a Blackwater guard shot dead an Iraqi driver in May 2007 quoted an Iraqi official 's statement that the Iraqi Interior Ministry had received four previous complaints of shootings involving Blackwater employees , " the congressional service report said .
The Congressional Research Service report cited other concerns , such as " the apparent lack of a practical means to hold contractors accountable under U.S. law for abuses and other transgressions and the possibility that they could be prosecuted by foreign courts . "
The reported added , " Iraqi courts do not have jurisdiction to prosecute contractors without the permission of the relevant member country of the Multi- National Forces in Iraq . "
Contractors fall under Justice Department and FBI jurisdiction for alleged crimes , said a Pentagon official , who confirmed the accuracy of the congressional report .
Other developments
Seven people were killed and 31 others were detained Monday in U.S. - led coalition raids across Iraq , the U.S. military said .
The fatalities occurred west of Yusufiya , southwest of the capital , as coalition forces targeted two buildings used by al Qaeda in Iraq militants , who organize suicide attacks .
Troops arrested other suspects in regions north of the capital -- north of Taji , near Balad , in Baiji and near the Syrian border .
Three people were killed and 11 others were wounded Monday in Baghdad when a parked car detonated near a Shiite mosque on the edge of a densely populated Shiite neighborhood , an Interior Ministry official said .
CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh , Elise Labott , Cal Perry , Suzanne Simons , Barbara Starr and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .
All About Blackwater USA • Iraq • Al Qaeda in Iraq
The officials said the plan to bolster the militaries of Persian Gulf countries is part of an American strategy to contain the growing power of Iran in the region and to demonstrate that , no matter what happens in Iraq , Washington remains committed to its longtime Arab allies .
Officials from the State Department and the Pentagon agreed to outline the terms of the deal after some details emerged from closed briefings this week on Capitol Hill .
The officials said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , who are to make a joint visit to Saudi Arabia next week , still intended to use the trip to press the Saudis to do more to help Iraq ’s Shiite - dominated government .
“ The role of the Sunni Arab neighbors is to send a positive , affirmative message to moderates in Iraq in government that the neighbors are with you , ” a senior State Department official told reporters in a conference call on Friday .
More specifically , the official said , the United States wants the gulf states to make clear to Sunnis engaged in violence in Iraq that such actions are “ killing your future . ”
In addition to promising an increase in American military aid to Israel , the Pentagon is seeking to ease Israel ’s concerns over the proposed weapons sales to Saudi Arabia by asking the Saudis to accept restrictions on the range , size and location of the satellite - guided bombs , including a commitment not to store the weapons at air bases close to Israeli territory , the officials said .
The package and the possible steps to allay Israel ’s concerns were described to Congress this week , in an effort by the administration to test the reaction on Capitol Hill before entering into final negotiations on the package with Saudi officials .
The Saudis had requested that Congress be told about the planned sale , the officials said , in an effort to avoid the kind of bruising fight on Capitol Hill that occurred in the 1980s over proposed arms sales to the kingdom .
This post is derived from an interesting conversation I had several years ago with my friend Jason Newquist on trying to find some intuitive analogies for the non-classical nature of quantum mechanics .
It occurred to me that this type of informal , rambling discussion might actually be rather suited to the blog medium , so here goes nothing …
Quantum mechanics has a number of weird consequences , but here we are focusing on three ( inter - related ) ones :
Objects can behave both like particles ( with definite position and a continuum of states ) and waves ( with indefinite position and ( in confined situations ) quantised states ) ;
The equations that govern quantum mechanics are deterministic , but the standard interpretation of the solutions of these equations is probabilistic ; and If instead one applies the laws of quantum mechanics literally at the macroscopic scale , then the universe itself must split into the superposition of many distinct “ worlds ” .
In trying to come up with a classical conceptual model in which to capture these non-classical phenomena , we eventually hit upon using the idea of using computer games as an analogy .
The exact choice of game is not terribly important , but let us pick Tomb Raider – a popular game from about ten years ago ( back when I had the leisure to play these things ) , in which the heroine , Lara Croft , explores various tombs and dungeons , solving puzzles and dodging traps , in order to achieve some objective .
It is quite common for Lara to die in the game , for instance by failing to evade one of the traps .
( I should warn that this analogy will be rather violent on certain computer - generated characters . )
The thing about such games is that there is an “ internal universe ” , in which Lara interacts with other game elements , and occasionally is killed by them , and an “ external universe ” , where the computer or console running the game , together with the human who is playing the game , resides .
While the game is running , these two universes run more or less in parallel ; but there are certain operations , notably the “ save game ” and “ restore game ” features , which disrupt this relationship .
These operations are utterly mundane to people like us who reside in the external universe , but it is an interesting thought experiment ( which others have also proposed :-) ) to view them from the perspective of someone like Lara , in the internal universe .
( I will eventually try to connect this with quantum mechanics , but please be patient for now . )
Of course , for this we will need to presume that the Tomb Raider game is so advanced that Lara has levels of self - awareness and artificial intelligence which are comparable to our own .
Imagine first that Lara is about to navigate a tricky rolling boulder puzzle , when she hears a distant rumbling sound – the sound of her player saving her game to disk .
Let us suppose that what happens next ( from the perspective of the player ) is the following : Lara navigates the boulder puzzle but fails , being killed in the process ; then the player restores the game from the save point and then Lara successfully makes it through the boulder puzzle .
Now , how does the situation look from Lara ’s point of view ?
At the save point , Lara ’s reality diverges into a superposition of two non-interacting paths , one in which she dies in the boulder puzzle , and one in which she lives .
( Yes , just like that cat . )
Her future becomes indeterministic .
If she had consulted with an infinitely prescient oracle before reaching the save point as to whether she would survive the boulder puzzle , the only truthful answer this oracle could give is “ 50 % yes , and 50 % no ” .
This simple example shows that the internal game universe can become indeterministic , even though the external one might be utterly deterministic .
However , this example does not fully capture the weirdness of quantum mechanics , because in each one of the two alternate states Lara could find herself in ( surviving the puzzle or being killed by it ) , she does not experience any effects from the other state at all , and could reasonably assume that she lives in a classical , deterministic universe .
So , let ’s make the game a bit more interesting .
Let us assume that every time Lara dies , she leaves behind a corpse in that location for future incarnations of Lara to encounter .
( This type of feature was actually present in another game I used to play , back in the day . )
Then Lara will start noticing the following phenomenon ( assuming she survives at all ) : whenever she navigates any particularly tricky puzzle , she usually encounters a number of corpses which look uncannily like herself .
This disturbing phenomenon is difficult to explain to Lara using a purely classical deterministic model of reality ; the simplest ( and truest ) explanation that one can give her is a “ many - worlds ” interpretation of reality , and that the various possible states of Lara ’s existence have some partial interaction with each other .
Another valid ( and largely equivalent ) explanation would be that every time Lara passes a save point to navigate some tricky puzzle , Lara ’s “ particle - like ” existence splits into a “ wave - like ” superposition of Lara - states , which then evolves in a complicated way until the puzzle is resolved one way or the other , at which point Lara ’s wave function “ collapses ” in a non-deterministic fashion back to a particle - like state ( which is either entirely alive or entirely dead ) .
Now , in the real world , it is only microscopic objects such as electrons which seem to exhibit this quantum behaviour ; macroscopic objects , such as you and I , do not directly experience the kind of phenomena that Lara does and we cannot interview individual electrons to find out their stories either .
Nevertheless , by studying the statistical behaviour of large numbers of microscopic objects we can indirectly infer their quantum nature via experiment and theoretical reasoning .
Let us again use the Tomb Raider analogy to illustrate this .
Suppose now that Tomb Raider does not only have Lara as the main heroine , but in fact has a large number of playable characters , who explore a large number deadly tombs , often with fatal effect ( and thus leading to multiple game restores ) .
Let us suppose that inside this game universe there is also a scientist ( let ’s call her Jacqueline ) who studies the behaviour of these adventurers going through the tombs , but does not experience the tombs directly , nor does she actually communicate with any of these adventurers .
Each tomb is explored by only one adventurer ; regardless of whether she lives or dies , the tomb is considered “ used up ” .
Jacqueline observes several types of trapped tombs in her world , and gathers data as to how likely an adventurer is to survive any given type of tomb .
She learns that each type of tomb has a fixed survival rate – e.g. a tomb of type A has a 20 % survival rate , while a tomb of type B has a 50 % survival rate – but that it seems impossible to predict with any certainty whether any given adventurer will survive any given type of tomb .
So far , this is something which could be explained classically ; each tomb may have a certain number of lethal traps in them , and whether an adventurer survives these traps or not may entirely be due to random chance .
But then Jacqueline encounters a mysterious “ quantisation ” phenomenon : the survival rate for various tombs are always one of the following numbers :
;
in other words , the “ frequency ” of success for a tomb is always of the form 1/n for some integer n .
This phenomenon would be difficult to explain in a classical universe , since the effects of random chance should be able to produce a continuum of survival probabilities .
Here ’s what is going on .
In order for Lara ( say ) to survive a tomb of a given type , she needs to stack together a certain number of corpses together to reach a certain switch ; if she cannot attain that level of “ constructive interference ” to reach that switch , she dies .
The type of tomb determines exactly how many corpses are needed – suppose for instance that a tomb of type A requires four corpses to be stacked together .
Then the player who is playing Lara will have to let her die four times before she can successfully get through the tomb ; and so from her perspective , Lara ’s chances of survival are only 20 % .
In each possible state of the game universe , there is only one Lara which goes into the tomb , who either lives or dies ; but her survival rate here is what it is because of her interaction with other states of Lara ( which Jacqueline cannot see directly , as she does not actually enter the tomb ) .
A familiar example of this type of quantum effect is the fact that each atom ( e.g. sodium or neon ) can only emit certain wavelengths of light ( which end up being quantised somewhat analogously to the survival probabilities above ) ; for instance , sodium only emits yellow light , neon emits blue , and so forth .
The electrons in such atoms , in order to emit such light , are in some sense clambering over skeletons of themselves to do so ; the more commonly given explanation is that the electron is behaving like a wave within the confines of an atom , and thus can only oscillate at certain frequencies ( similarly to how a plucked string of a musical instrument can only exhibit a certain set of wavelengths , which incidentally are also proportional to 1/n for integer n ) .
Mathematically , this “ quantisation ” of frequency can be computed using the bound states of a Schrödinger operator with potential .
( Now , I am not going to try to stretch the Tomb Raider analogy so far as to try to model the Schrödinger equation !
In particular , the complex phase of the wave function – which is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics – is not easy at all to motivate in a classical setting , despite some brave attempts . )
The last thing we ’ll try to get the Tomb Raider analogy to explain is why microscopic objects ( such as electrons ) experience quantum effects , but macroscopic ones ( or even mesoscopic ones , such as large molecues ) seemingly do not .
Let ’s assume that Tomb Raider is now a two - player co-operative game , with two players playing two characters ( let ’s call them Lara and Indiana ) as they simultaneously explore different parts of their world ( e.g. via a split - screen display ) .
The players can choose to save the entire game , and then restore back to that point ; this resets both Lara and Indiana back to the state they were in at that save point .
Now , this game still has the strange feature of corpses of Lara and Indiana from previous games appearing in later ones .
However , we assume that Lara and Indiana are entangled in the following way : if Lara is in tomb A and Indiana is in tomb B , then Lara and Indiana can each encounter corpses of their respective former selves , but only if both Lara and Indiana died in tombs A and B respectively in a single previous game .
If in a previous game , Lara died in tomb A and Indiana died in tomb C , then this time round , Lara will not see any corpse ( and of course , neither will Indiana ) .
( This entanglement can be described a bit better by using tensor products : rather than saying that Lara died in A and Indiana died in B , one should instead think of dying in , which is a state which is orthogonal to . )
With this type of entanglement , one can see that there is going to be significantly less “ quantum weirdness ” going on ; Lara and Indiana , adventuring separately but simultaneously , are going to encounter far fewer corpses of themselves than Lara adventuring alone would .
And if there were many many adventurers entangled together exploring simultaneously , the quantum effects drop to virtually nothing , and things now look classical unless the adventurers are somehow organised to “ resonate ” in a special way .
One might be able to use Tomb Raider to try to understand other unintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics , but I think I ’ve already pushed the analogy far beyond the realm of reasonableness , and so I ’ll stop here . :-)
Hand Over Your Wallet and Bend Over For the Corporation
It would appear that Bush believes that corporations can defraud the public with impunity .
Now to be honest I always felt that was Bush 's position but I did n't expect him to be so open about it .
Robert Borosage has the details .
The Stoneridge v. Scientific - Atlanta case is currently before the supreme court and the decision in this case will directly impact the victims of Enron .
The Securities and Exchange Commission recommended that the Justice Department support defrauded investors in their appeal to the Supreme Court .
In addition , briefs in support of the defrauded investors were filed by dozens of state attorneys general , by the Council of Institutional Investors and some of the nation ’s largest pension funds .
However , the U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement has decided not to support the investors .
And this spear carrier for the right got his marching orders from the top .
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson called directly and arranged for President Bush to weigh in personally .
The intervention of the treasury secretary and the president is hardly business as usual — particularly since neither Paulson nor President Bush are neutral observers either .
Paulson is the former chairman of Goldman Sachs , a named defendant on the Enron case .
And Enron and CEO “ Kenny Boy ” Lay were George Bush ’s leading supporters , contributing cash , the corporate plane and fundraising energy to Bush ’s rise .
The president , according to his chief economic advisor , Al Hubbard , '' believes that it 's important to make certain that we reduce the unnecessary lawsuits because that 's a very big burden to the economy , which adversely impacts investors . ”
Clearly , we are just here to provide funds and cheap labor to the elite who are in turn exempt from all regulatory action .
These guys make Jesse James and Al Capone look like amateurs .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Vice President Dick Cheney will serve as acting president briefly Saturday while President Bush is anesthetized for a routine colonoscopy , White House spokesman Tony Snow said Friday .
Bush is scheduled to have the medical procedure , expected to take about 2 1/2 hours , at the presidential retreat at Camp David , Maryland , Snow said .
Bush 's last colonoscopy was in June 2002 , and no abnormalities were found , Snow said .
The president 's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years .
The procedure will be supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda , Maryland , Snow said .
A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer , rectal cancer and polyps , small clumps of cells that can become cancerous , according to the Mayo Clinic .
Small polyps may be removed during the procedure .
Snow said that was the case when Bush had colonoscopies before becoming president .
Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver .
Snow told reporters he had a chemo session scheduled later Friday .

" The president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance , " Snow said .
The American Cancer Society recommends that people without high - risk factors or symptoms begin getting screened for signs of colorectal cancer at age 50 .

What people know , think , say , and feel about Beloit College comes from a wide range of sources , experiences , and interactions .
The college ’s faculty , curriculum , website , social media , publications , events , facilities , signage , staff , and the countless other ways people observe and interact with Beloit all shape the college ’s brand .
THE “ Atlas of Creation ” runs to 770 pages and is lavishly illustrated with photographs of fossils and living animals , interlaced with quotations from the Koran .
Its author claims to prove not only the falsehood of Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection , but the links between “ Darwinism ” and such diverse evils as communism , fascism and terrorism .
In recent weeks the “ Atlas de la Création ” has been arriving unsolicited and free of charge at schools and universities across French - speaking Europe .
It is the latest sign of a revolt against the theories of Darwin , on which virtually the whole of modern biology is based , that is gathering momentum in many parts of the world .
The mass distribution of a French version of the “ Atlas ” ( already published in English and Turkish ) typifies the style of an Istanbul publishing house whose sole business is the dissemination , in many languages , of scores of works by a single author , a charismatic but controversial Turkish preacher who writes as Harun Yahya but is really called Adnan Oktar .
According to a Turkish scientist who now lives in America , the movement founded by Mr Oktar is “ powerful , global and very well financed ” .
Translations of Mr Oktar 's work into tongues like Arabic , Urdu and Bahasa Indonesia have ensured a large following in Muslim countries .
In his native Turkey there are many people , including devout Muslims , who feel uncomfortable about the 51 - year - old Mr Oktar 's strong appeal to young women and his political sympathies for the nationalist right .
But across the Muslim world he seems to be riding high .
Many of the most popular Islamic websites refer readers to his vast canon .
In the more prosperous parts of the historically Christian world , Mr Oktar 's flamboyant style would be unappealing , even to religious believers .
Among mainstream Catholics and liberal Protestants , clerical pronouncements on creation and evolution are often couched in careful — and for many people , almost impenetrable — theological language .
For example , Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the world 's 80 m Anglicans , has dismissed literal readings of the Creation story in Genesis as a “ category mistake ” .
But no such highbrow reticence holds back the more zealous Christian movements in the developing world , where the strongest religious medicine seems to go down best .
In Kenya , for example , there is a bitter controversy over plans to put on display the most complete skeleton of a prehistoric human being ever found , a figure known as Turkana Boy — along with a collection of fossils , some of which may be as much as 200 m years old .
Bishop Boniface Adoyo , an evangelical leader who claims to speak for 35 denominations and 10 m believers , has denounced the proposed exhibit , asserting that : “ I did not evolve from Turkana Boy or anything like it . ”
Richard Leakey , the palaeontologist who unearthed both the skeleton and the fossils in northern Kenya , is adamant that the show must go on .
“ Whether the bishop likes it or not , Turkana Boy is a distant relation of his , ” Mr Leakey has insisted .
Local Catholics have backed him .
Rows over religion and reason are also raging in Russia .
In recent weeks the Russian Orthodox Church has backed a family in St Petersburg who ( unsuccessfully ) sued the education authorities for teaching only about evolution to explain the origins of life .
Plunging into deep scientific waters , a spokesman for the Moscow Patriarchate , Father Vsevolod Chaplin , said Darwin 's theory of evolution was “ based on pretty strained argumentation ” — and that physical evidence cited in its support “ can never prove that one biological species can evolve into another . ”
A much more nuanced critique , not of Darwin himself but of secular world - views based on Darwin 's ideas , has been advanced by Pope Benedict XVI , the conservative Bavarian who assumed the most powerful office in the Christian world two years ago .
The pope marked his 80th birthday this week by publishing a book on Jesus Christ .
But for Vatican - watchers , an equally important event was the issue in German , a few days earlier , of a book in which the pontiff and several key advisers expound their views on the emergence of the universe and life .
While avoiding the cruder arguments that have been used to challenge Darwin 's theories , the pope asserts that evolution cannot be conclusively proved ; and that the manner in which life developed was indicative of a “ divine reason ” which could not be discerned by scientific methods alone .
Both in his previous role as the chief enforcer of Catholic doctrine and since his enthronement , the former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger has made clear his profound belief that man has a unique , God - given role in the animal kingdom ; and that a divine creator has an ongoing role in sustaining the universe , something far more than just “ lighting the blue touch paper ” for the Big Bang , the event that scientists think set the universe in motion .
Yesterday America , today the world
As these examples from around the world show , the debate over creation , evolution and religion is rapidly going global .
Until recently , all the hottest public arguments had taken place in the United States , where school boards in many districts and states tried to restrict the teaching of Darwin 's idea that life in its myriad forms evolved through a natural process of adaptation to changing conditions .
Darwin - bashers in America suffered a body - blow in December 2005 , when a judge — striking down the policies of a district school board in Pennsylvania — delivered a 139 - page verdict that delved deeply into questions about the origin of life and tore apart the case made by the “ intelligent design ” camp : the idea that some features of the natural world can be explained only by the direct intervention of a ingenious creator .
Intelligent design , the judge found , was a religious theory , not a scientific one — and its teaching in schools violated the constitution , which bars the establishment of any religion .
One point advanced in favour of intelligent design — the “ irreducible complexity ” of some living things — was purportedly scientific , but it was not well - founded , the judge ruled .
Proponents of intelligent design were also dishonest in saying that where there were gaps in evolutionary theory , their own view was the only alternative , according to the judge .
The Seattle - based Discovery Institute , which has spearheaded the American campaign to counter - balance the teaching of evolution , artfully distanced itself from the Pennsylvania case , saying the local school board had gone too far in mixing intelligent design with a more overtly religious doctrine of “ creationism ” .
But the verdict made it much harder for school boards in other parts of America to mandate curbs on the teaching of evolution , as many have tried to do — to the horror of most professional scientists .
Whatever the defeats they have suffered on home ground , American foes of Darwin seem to be gaining influence elsewhere .
In February several luminaries of the anti-evolution movement in the United States went to Istanbul for a grand conference where Darwin 's ideas were roundly denounced .
The organiser of the gathering was a Turkish Muslim author and columnist , Mustafa Akyol , who forged strong American connections during a fellowship at the Discovery Institute .
To the dismay of some Americans and the delight of others , Mr Akyol was invited to give evidence ( against Darwin 's ideas ) at hearings held by the Kansas school board in 2005 on how science should be taught .
Mr Akyol , an advocate of reconciliation between Muslims and the West who is much in demand at conferences on the future of Islam , is careful to distinguish his position from that of the extravagant publishing venture in his home city .
“ They make some valid criticisms of Darwinism , but I disagree with most of their other views , ” insists the young author , whose other favourite cause is the compatibility between Islam and Western liberal ideals , including human rights and capitalism .
But a multi- layered anti-Darwin movement has certainly brought about a climate in Turkey and other Muslim countries that makes sure challenges to evolution theory , be they sophisticated or crude , are often well received .
America 's arguments over evolution are also being followed closely in Brazil , where — as the pope will find when he visits the country next month — various forms of evangelicalism and Pentecostalism are advancing rapidly at the expense of the majority Catholic faith .
Samuel Rodovalho , an activist in Brazil 's Pentecostal church , puts it simply : “ We are convinced that the story of Genesis is right , and we take heart from the fact that in North America the teaching of evolution in schools has been challenged . ”
Even in the United States , defenders of evolution teaching do not see their battle as won .
There was widespread dismay in their ranks in February when John McCain , a Republican presidential candidate , accepted an invitation ( albeit to talk about geopolitics , not science ) from the Discovery Institute .
And some opponents of intelligent design are still recovering from their shock at reading in the New York Times a commentary written , partly at the prompting of the Discovery Institute , by the pope 's close friend , Cardinal Christoph Schönborn , the Archbishop of Vienna .
In his July 2005 article the cardinal seemed to challenge what most scientists would see as axiomatic — the idea that natural selection is an adequate explanation for the diversity and complexity of life in all its forms .
Within days , the pope and his advisers found they had new interlocutors .
Lawrence Krauss , an American physicist in the front - line of courtroom battles over education , fired off a letter to the Vatican urging a clarification .
An agnostic Jew who insists that evolution neither disproves nor affirms any particular faith , Mr Krauss recruited as co-signatories two American biologists who were also devout Catholics .
Around the same time , another Catholic voice was raised in support of evolution , that of Father George Coyne , a Jesuit astronomer who until last year was head of the Vatican observatory in Rome .
Mr Krauss reckons his missive helped to nudge the Catholic authorities into clarifying their view and insisting that they did still accept natural selection as a scientific theory .
But that was not the end of the story .
Catholic physicists , biologists and astronomers ( like Father Coyne ) insisted that there was no reason to revise their view that intelligent design is bad science .
And they expressed concern ( as the Christian philosopher Augustine did in the 4th century ) that if the Christian church teaches things about the physical world which are manifestly false , then everything else the church teaches might be discredited too .
But there is also a feeling among Pope Benedict 's senior advisers that in rejecting intelligent design as it is understood in America they must not go too far in endorsing the idea that Darwinian evolution says all that needs to be , or can be , said about how the world came to be .
The net result has been the emergence of two distinct camps among the Catholic pundits who aspire to influence the pope .
In one there are people such as Father Coyne , who believe ( like the agnostic Mr Krauss ) that physics and metaphysics can and should be separated .
From his new base at a parish in North Carolina , Father Coyne insists strongly on the integrity of science — “ natural phenomena have natural causes ” — and he is as firm as any secular biologist in asserting that every year the theory of evolution is consolidated with fresh evidence .
In the second camp are those , including some high up in the Vatican bureaucracy , who feel that Catholic scientists like Father Coyne have gone too far in accepting the world - view of their secular colleagues .
This camp stresses that Darwinian science should not seduce people into believing that man evolved purely as the result of a process of random selection .
While rejecting American - style intelligent design , some authoritative Catholic thinkers claim to see God 's hand in “ convergence ” : the apparent fact that , as they put it , similar processes and structures are present in organisms that have evolved separately .
As an example of Catholic thinking that is relatively critical of science - based views of the world , take Father Joseph Fessio , the provost of Ave Maria University in Florida and a participant in a seminar on creation and evolution which led to the new book with papal input .
As Father Fessio observes , Catholics accept three different ways of learning about reality : empirical observation , direct revelations from God and , between those two categories , “ natural philosophy ” — the ability of human reason to discern divine reason in the created universe .
That is not quite intelligent design , but it does sound similar .
The mainly Protestant heritage of the United States may be one reason why the idea of “ natural philosophy ” is poorly understood by American thinkers , Father Fessio playfully suggests .
( Another problem the Vatican may face is that Orthodox Christian theologians , as well as Catholic mystics , are wary of “ natural philosophy ” : they insist that mystical communion with God is radically different from observation or speculation by the human brain . )
The evolution of the anti-evolutionists
Whatever they think about science , there is one crucial problem that all Christian thinkers about creation must wrestle with : the status of the human being in relation to other creatures , and the whole universe .
There is no reading of Christianity which does not assert the belief that mankind , while part of the animal kingdom , has a unique vocation and potential to enhance the rest of creation , or else to destroy it .
This point has been especially emphasised by Pope Benedict 's interlocutors in the Orthodox church , such as its senior prelate Patriarch Bartholomew I , who has been nudging the Vatican to take a stronger line on man 's effect on the environment and climate change .
For Father Coyne , belief in man 's unique status is entirely consistent with an evolutionary view of life .
“ The fact we are at the end of this marvellous process is something that glorifies us , ” he says .
But Benedict XVI apparently wants to lay down an even stronger line on the status of man as a species produced by divine ordinance , not just random selection .
“ Man is the only creature on earth that God willed for his own sake , ” says a document issued under Pope John Paul II and approved by the then Cardinal Ratzinger .
What is not quite clear is whether the current pope accepts the “ Chinese wall ” that his old scientific adviser , Father Coyne , has struggled to preserve between physics and metaphysics .
It is in the name of this Chinese wall that Father Coyne and other Catholic scientists have been able to make common cause with agnostics , like Mr Krauss , in defence of the scientific method .
What the Jesuit astronomer and his secular friends all share is the belief that people who agree about physics can differ about metaphysics or religion .
Critics like Father Fessio would retort that their problem was not with the Chinese wall — but with an attempt to tear it down by scientists whose position is both Darwinist and anti-religious : in other words , with those who believe that scientific observation of the universe leaves no room at all for religious belief .
( Some scientists and philosophers go further , dismissing religion itself as a phenomenon brought about by man 's evolutionary needs . )
The new book quoting Pope Benedict 's contributions to last year 's seminar shows him doing his best to pick his way through these arguments : accepting that scientific descriptions of the universe are valid as far as they go , while insisting that they are ultimately incomplete as a way of explaining how things came to be .
On those points , he seems to share the “ anti- Darwinist ” position of Father Fessio ; but he also agrees with Father Coyne that a “ God of the gaps ” theory — which uses a deity to fill in the real or imagined holes in evolutionary science — is too small - minded .
Only a handful of the world 's 2 billion Christians will be able to make sense of his intricate intellectual arguments , and there is a risk that simplistic reporting and faulty interpretation of his ideas could create the impression that the pope has deserted to the ranks of the outright anti-evolutionists ; he has done no such thing , his advisers insist .
Not that the advocates of intelligent design or outright creationists are in need of anyone 's endorsement .
Their ideas are flourishing and their numbers growing .
As Mr Krauss has caustically argued , the anti-evolution movement is itself a prime example of evolution and adaptability — defeated in one arena , it will resurface elsewhere .
His ally Father Coyne , the devoted star - gazer , is one of the relatively few boffins who have managed to expound with equal passion both their scientific views and their religious beliefs .
He writes with breathless excitement about “ the dance of the fertile universe , a ballet with three ballerinas : chance , necessity and fertility . ”
Whether they are atheists or theists , other supporters of Darwin 's ideas on natural selection will have to inspire as well as inform if they are to compete with their growing army of foes .
Diagram showing the parts of the kidney and the nephron
If you were to cut a kidney in half , you would see the following parts :
Renal capsule - a thin , outer membrane that helps protect the kidney
Cortex - a lightly colored outer region
Medulla - a darker , reddish - brown , inner region
Renal pelvis - a flat , funnel - shaped cavity that collects the urine into the ureters
" "
If you look closely at the cortex and medulla , you can see many tiny , tubular structures that stretch across both regions perpendicular to the surface of the kidney .
In each kidney , there are one million of these structures , called nephrons .
The nephron is the basic unit of the kidney .
It 's a long , thin tube that is closed at one end , has two twisted regions interspaced with a long hairpin loop , ends in a long straight portion and is surrounded by capillaries .

The parts of the nephron are as follows :
Bowman 's capsule -
This closed end at the beginning of the nephron is located in the cortex .
Proximal convoluted tubule or proximal tubule -
The first twisted region after the Bowman 's capsule ; it 's in the cortex .
Loop of Henle - A long , hairpin loop after the proximal tubule , it extends from the cortex down into the medulla and back .
Distal convoluted tubule or distal tubule -
This second twisted portion of the nephron after the loop of Henle is located in the cortex .
Collecting duct -
This long straight portion after the distal tubule that is the open end of the nephron extends from the cortex down through the medulla .
Each part of the nephron has different types of cells with different properties -- this is important in understanding how the kidney regulates the composition of the blood .
The nephron has a unique blood supply compared to other organs :
Afferent arteriole - connects the renal artery with the glomerular capillaries
Glomerular capillaries - coiled capillaries that are inside the Bowman 's capsule
Efferent arteriole - connects the glomerular capillaries with the peritubular capillaries
Peritubular capillaries - located after the glomerular capillaries and surrounding the proximal tubule , loop of Henle , and distal tubule
Interlobular veins - drain the peritubular capillaries into the renal vein
The kidney is the only organ of the body in which two capillary beds , in series , connect arteries with veins .
This arrangement is important for maintaining a constant blood flow through and around the nephron despite fluctuations in systemic blood pressure .
Regulating the composition of the blood involves the following :
Keeping the concentrations of various ions and other important substances constant
Keeping the volume of water in your body constant
Removing wastes from your body
Keeping the acid / base concentration of your blood constant
The kidney does this by a combination of three processes :
It filters 20 percent of the plasma and non-cell elements from the blood into the inside of the nephron ( the lumen ) .
It reabsorbs the components that the body needs from the lumen back into the blood .
It secretes some unwanted components from the blood into the lumen of the nephron .
Anything ( fluid , ions , small molecules ) that has not been reabsorbed from the lumen gets swept away to form the urine , which ultimately leaves the body .
Through these processes , the blood is maintained with the proper composition , and excess or unwanted substances are removed from the blood into the urine .
Next , we 'll look at how the kidneys regulate blood composition by three main processes :
