The torrent of earnings releases set to hit this week could only exacerbate volatility moves , analysts say .
Volatility has knocked around stocks on Wall Street in record ways .
Buckle up for the coming week .
News and concern over inter - bank lending , credit spreads and declining oil prices , the major averages managed to piece together a strong week that built on the lowest levels in five years .
So far in October , each day the Dow in ranges of no less than 250 points .
In fact , the index saw the first 1,000 - point swing in its history just over a week ago on Oct. 10 .
Most of this volatility has been blamed on the liquidation of assets of hedge funds and mutual funds .
Rumors of poor performance at major players intensified the effect .
“ No doubt the indiscriminate selling we ’ve seen has been liquidation , no doubt .
Everything is for sale , ” says Art Hogan , chief market analyst with Jefferies .
Hogan points out that all the indexes have fallen by roughly the same percentage , which indicates that funds are not selling stocks in one industry to invest in another .
The news about the deleveraging of the hedge fund industry is already behind the event , to a certain extent .
A lot of hedge funds have a very high level of cash right now .
As we come into next week , the question now is whether cash levels are high enough for everyone ’s comfort and is the indiscriminate selling is behind us or not , and can we start focusing on fundamentals .

What also hangs over the market is the health of credit markets .
Credit markets have loosened slightly , investors however have been fearful of entering back into equities , driving the yield of the three - month U.S. Treasury note below 1 % .
Optimism is also being fueled by an article Warren Buffett , in which he said he has been buying American stocks for his personal account .
If prices keep looking attractive , Buffett said he would swap his whole portfolio , made up entirely of U.S. government bonds , for U.S. equities .
Market observers believe Buffett ’s op - ed piece could rally buyers and bring cash in from the sideline .
In order to succeed , your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure .
People are still hesitant to exit out of that trade , get back into the market and put some risk on the table .
Hopefully , that will continue to loosen , yields will back up a bit and some money will come back into the market .
A much needed shot in the arm is a burst of earnings reports in the coming week , to provide a boost to the equity markets .
What the companies say about future earnings and expectations will ultimately drive the market .
The fears however are , that those companies will not offer the clarity many are hoping for .
The bar has been set so low it should n’t be hard for corporate America to beat expectations , but it is also hard for executives to say anything with certainty about the fourth quarter or 2009 .
There are a lot of companies with a lot of guidance that will come out , and that ’ll continue to lead the market around by the nose .
I ’d like to think that volatility will go away sometime soon but I doubt it ’ll happen .
People are too nervous .
If people come to their senses they ’ll realize what Buffett is saying is historically true .
“ You should be fearful when people are greedy , and you should be greedy when people are panicking .
We ’ve seen panic selling and that ’s when people should be buying .
Another positive for traders is the economic calendar is lighter than it has been in previous weeks .
Aside from weekly jobless claims that are released every Thursday , traders will only have to contend with a report on leading economic indicators on Monday as well as the latest read on existing home sales , which are expected to rise slightly , on Friday .
Investors will also be watching testimony from Ben Bernanke , who will offer his economic outlook on Monday to the House of Representatives , although no surprises are expected .
She said : " When I found out he had been found all that way out , I felt frightened .
I worried about what state he would be in .
He looked like a drowned rat when they found him . "
No one really liked Martin P .
This is not to say that Martin was unlikeable per se , it ’s just that everyone seemed to have a hard time getting over his unofficial title : the CEO ’s sycophant .
In all fairness to Martin , he never really aspired to become the CEO ’s sycophant .
Or anyone ’s sycophant for that matter .
He simply saw a job advertisement – Windows Software Engineer – applied for it , interviewed , and accepted the offer .
Little did he know that he’d be the company ’s first non-UNIX developer .
Or that he ’d report directly to the Head of Research & Development instead of one of the several development managers .
Or that the Head of Research & Development also happened to be the CEO .
Martin ’s workspace certainly did n’t help , either .
While most of the company ’s employees worked in moderately - sized cubicles , Martin had a sprawling 25 ' x 25 ' office all to himself .
Of course , the six - hundred and twenty - five square feet was technically for the entire Windows development team , but the company was n’t in any rush to expand the team beyond him .
For nearly eight months , Martin did his best to put up with the collective disdain .
He ignored the snide remarks and Windows - based pejoratives like softie , IDE - boy , and short - stuff ( which referred to , of course , the DOS filename limit of 8+3 characters ) .
The CEO certainly helped Martin throughout all this , reassuring him that “ people hate change ” and that “ it was all temporary until the Windows group was established . ”
And just when Martin felt like he could n’t take it anymore , he got some good news : they were planning on doubling size of the Windows development team .
After a few rounds of interviews , Jim was hired as the company ’s second Windows Software Engineer .
He had a bit more experience than Martin , especially in low - level , protocol development .
The software that the Window ’s group was developing communicated with all sorts of different hardware devices , so Jim seemed to be a great fit .
Plus , Martin figured , at least there ’d be someone else who the other developers could despise .
As the months passed , Martin and Jim developed a pretty solid working relationship .
They shared the large office , but stayed in their respective corners as not to distract one another .
Although Jim tended to deliver his code much slower , he did have to talk with a lot of hardware device vendors and would often spend three - quarters of his days on one conference call or another .
In fact , he chatted so much that they decided to leave the shared phone on his desk instead of the shared table in the middle of the room .
It seemed the only person who ever called Martin was his wife .
It did n’t take too long for the other benefit of having Jim around kick in : people actually started to respect Martin .
So much so that he only heard “ that little sycophant ” once in an entire week .
It was a far cry from actually being liked , but Martin appreciated it nonetheless .
The only person who seemed to like Martin even less , however , was the receptionist .
Over the past several weeks , the receptionist ’s dirty looks degraded from the Stink Eye to the Crook Eye , all the way down to the Evil Eye .
Martin had no idea why , was a bit afraid to find out , and did his best to smile and walk past without making eye contact .
One day , as Martin was leaving for lunch , he saw the Human Resources Director chatting with the receptionist and gave the usual courtesy nod and smile .
The pair returned his gesture in unison with furled lips and the Angry Eye .
Unable to hold herself back , the Human Resources Director grumbled at Martin , “ that ’s it !
You and I really have to talk . ”
Shortly thereafter , Martin found himself in the HR director ’s office , sitting across from a very annoyed woman .
“ You know , ” she opened with , “ we all have a serious problem with you .
You have no supervisor and you clearly can’t handle not being supervised . ”
Martin felt like he stepped in the wrong employee ’s lecture .
“ I ’m sorry , ” he softly responded .
“ Is the pay not good enough ? ” she snapped back , “ do n’t you feel it ’s kinda time for you to move on to another company ? ”
“ I don’t , ” Martin paused , totally confused , “ wait , what ? ”
“ We know you receive half a dozen personal phone calls per day , ” she scowled , “ and these easily take up four - to - six hours of your day .
Do you have any idea how much time of the company ’s time you ’re stealing ? ”
Martin just stared blankly .
“ You ’re lucky that you ’re the CEO ’s little sycophant , ” the HR director scoffed , “ he refuses to let us officially act on this matter .
So , I ’m asking you : please resign .
And if you insist upon sticking around , at least stop abusing the company ’s resources ! ”
“ Look , ” Martin responded .
He thought of the two or three times each week that his wife would call , but that certainly did n’t even add up to four - to - six minutes .
“ I do n’t really use the phones here – maybe a few times a week , tops .
That ’s it . ”
“ The log certainly says different , ” she snidely responded , dropping down a stack of papers with call dates , times , and duration , “ thanks to Caller - ID , we can tell what ’s personal and what ’s business .
And from what I can see — ”
The HR director ’s ringing phone cut her off .
She briefly took the call , muttering one “ uh huh ” after another .
She hung the phone up and glared back at Martin .
“ Looks like one of the ‘ personal calls ’ you do n’t ‘ really ’ receive is on the line .
How about we take that in here , on speaker phone ? ”
“ Hello , ” Martin slowly answered .
“ Heya Jimbo ! ” the voice on the line said , “ so I ’ve got the RS - 232 interface that you sent over , but I ca n’t seem to get a DCD . ”
“ Err , ” Martin said , “ this is Martin . ”
“ Oh , ” the voice responded , “ oh …. ohhhhhh .
Okay , I ’ll , uh , call back .
See ya ! ”
The line dropped shortly after that .
Moments later , Martin had an “ ah - ha ” moment : Jim had never left his consulting business .
He simply decided to move his calls to their office and take a second paycheck , working on the Windows software between the calls from his clients .
To avoid getting caught , Jim told his clients to simply “ ask for Martin ” at the receptionist desk .
Since the phone was shared between the two Windows software engineers at Jim ’s desk , Jim was guaranteed to be the one who would answer .
The HR director profusely apologized to Martin ( being the CEO ’s sycophant does have some advantages ) and soon thereafter went to Jim for an explanation .
Within a couple weeks , Jim was fired , leaving Martin as the sole member of the Windows team .
While that certainly meant that he ’d have to put up with a whole new round of disparaging remarks form the other developers , at least the receptionist seemed to no longer hate him .
She even starting giving him the Cute Eye .

Your Comments :
Wilmington , Delaware experienced the loss of many jobs after World War II , mostly due to it becoming less utilized as a shipping location .
To address this matter , the state legislators sought a way to bring new business into the state , starting in the late 1970s .
Led primarily by the Governor Pierre DuPont , in the early 1980s , Delaware attempted to lure large banks away from New York and other large financial companies by dramatically redrafting tax laws for banking industries .
Laws also changed to allow banks to charge any interest they wished on credit cards .
Several major credit card companies moved to Wilmington , Delaware , for the advantageous tax laws offered there .
Several banks , among them Bank of America and Chase , were inspired by Wilmington ’s flexible laws to relocate at least their credit card companies to Wilmington .
The ability to charge more interest meant that they could offer credit to less credit - worthy customers .
Though big banks moved their credit card offices , the response was even greater than DuPont at first estimated .
Many smaller banks also set up shop in Wilmington , to take advantage of being able to charge much higher interest rates , while paying lower taxes on their profits .
Since the enactment of liberal interest rate laws and low taxes , Wilmington has become one of the most attractive cities in the US to set up credit card companies .
Other states and cities may have caps on interest charged , and in fact the US congress has even attempted to create lower interest rates , and cap fees and interest .
This strategy has not worked , and Congress ’ response was lukewarm at best , placing the interest cap at no more than 30 % .
In 1988 , laws in Delaware protecting companies were made even stronger .
During a period where hostile takeovers were becoming standard , Delaware changed its laws to make sure that most Delaware companies would not be subject to this process .
The new laws meant any one attempting to take over a company would have to own 85 % of its stock , or with a majority of stock holding would have to wait three years before initiating takeover proceedings .
Companies stationed in Delaware were thus better protected than in other states , strengthening the position of any bank or credit card companies that created their charters within the state .
Today , there are several major credit card companies stationed in Wilmington .
These include Bank of America , Chase , Barclays ( which used to be Juniper ) , and ING Direct .
A number of smaller companies also have their home base in Delaware .
What this means for the consumer , especially if you ’re sifting through a lot of credit card offers , is that you ’ll find numerous ones coming from Delaware .
If you do decide to apply for a credit card that is from a company in Delaware , it ’s important to read all fine print carefully .
You may pay higher interest rates , especially if your credit is not solid .
With the luxury of good credit , you may want to shop around for the best credit card offers , especially those from states with laws less likely to favor the credit card industry .
Today ’s guest blogger is Daniel Alpert , a managing director at Westwood Capital , whom I ’ve quoted quite a bit in my column the last few months .
Why ?
Because he has been dead spot on in anticipating virtually every iteration of this crisis .
Last night he sent me ( and others ) this note about the testimony of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke .
It aptly sums the current the state of play .
I asked him if I could reprint his note here at Executive Suite .
Happily , he agreed .
Secretary Paulson has told us since last week that he ’s late , he ’s late for a very important date and has no time for a reasonable legislative debate ( although willing to indulge in the “ hello / goodbyes ” of Congressional testimony , provided it does n’t take too long ) .
But instead of following him through the looking glass , like naïve and curious Alice , let ’s pause and take a peek though the glass before taking the leap of faith the Treasury and Fed are asking of us .
As with Alice ’s Wonderland , a lot of what Bazooka Hank and Helicopter Ben are saying is lacking in detail or simply does n’t make much sense :
1 . We were told today in the testimony , among other things , that private risk capital had withdrawn to the sidelines throughout global markets , on the very same day ( albeit later in the day ) that Warren Buffett signed up to a brilliant and opportunistic $ 5 billion investment in the newly chartered Bank of Goldman ( the secretary ’s former firm ) at essentially a discount to market ( a combination of preferred shares and warrants for common shares ) .
Furthermore , Goldman apparently feels comfortable enough with market liquidity to announce an additional $ 2.5 billion offering of its common shares .
2. Chairman Bernanke is using the argument that there is a meaningful valuation differential between hold to maturity values and market values of troubled securities .
When management of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac tried to advance that very same logic to the government a few short weeks ago , the government said “ no sale ” and within days they were under conservatorship .
There is no objective way to compute so - called “ hold to maturity value ” in an environment where ultimate cash flows from such securities are in serious doubt .
3 . We are being told that the purpose of the $ 700 billion request is to recapitalize distressed institutions that so desperately need to sell us their sludge , in order that that the system may survive .
But we are also told that those same institutions will back away from participating if we dare to ask for equity participation .
We are essentially being asked to believe that if we throw a lifeline to a drowning man , he will refuse it because we want to be paid for the rescue ( as the boards of AIG , FNM , FRE , and BSE proved , right ? — um , not ) .
4 . On the other side of the looking glass is a world in which taxpayers recover their handout ( or maybe even profit handsomely ) after buying impaired securities at higher than the values they have been marked to by financial institutions to date ( which , in some cases may not even be adequate markdowns , as the government found out when teams from the Fed and Treasury went into other institutions and ultimately recommended that the government take them over or shut them down ) .
This scenario can be based only on the recovery of the assets underlying those securities – American homes – to levels approaching their bubble - era value .
Note that the secretary never uses the word “ bubble ” — always preferring the milder description of the decline in value as a “ correction . ”
Well , on our side of the looking glass we still see a bubble having burst — no different from that of the property bubble in Japan 18 years ago ( although mercifully to a lesser degree , we will see declines of about 30 % from peak , whereas the Japanese experienced nearly an 80 % decline ) – and no reason why values should “ recover ” to anywhere remotely near the debt - driven bubble levels during the lifetimes of our Treasury secretary and Fed chairman ( and we wish them a long and happy life for all the suffering they have endured these past months ) .
5 . A number of comments by the secretary and the chairman , during today ’s hearings , hinted that ownership of the impaired securities might result in the ability to restructure underlying mortgages .
While wholesale takeovers of actual mortgages and securities in certain classes , such a subprime mortgages , may result in the Treasury having some potential ability to restructure underlying debt , the fact is that with regard to C.D.O. ’s , C.D.S. ’s and subordinate tranches of Alt - A and prime mortgage securitizations , there would normally be zero access by the Treasury to the underlying mortgage collateral .
Such toxic paper , where the bulk of the write - downs have been experienced to date , is specifically designed to grant control of the mortgages to the senior - most classes of the securitizations , many of which senior tranches are still performing .
The securitizations were designed to pass risk to the subordinate tranches for precisely this reason .
The fact is that much of the subordinate M.B.S. classes , C.D.O. ’s and C.D.S. ’s were never really “ money good ” because existence of a bubble that everyone chose to ignore given the quick profits to be made by flipping out of that paper .
The Treasury is asking us to step into a distorted world that makes little sense , based on trust and fear .
We endorse the authorization of financing to enable the government to save any institution that it judges is systemically critical ( and on that judgment , we actually WOULD trust the secretary and chairman , although we think there should be some sensible minimum institutional size limit ) .
That alone is enough — it tells the market that the world will not be coming to an end , that the banking establishment ( now , just banking , no I.B. ’s anymore ) will survive intact ( albeit with , hopefully , better regulation ) , and that it will be sufficiently well capitalized to do what it is supposed to do .
The notion of doing all of that without taking over whatever portion of the equity of the troubled institutions that is commensurate with the aid being given ( and , as Senator Dodd has suggested perhaps a bit more for safety ’s sake ) is indefensible ….and , in fact , the testimony given today could n’t defend it .
What would Warren Buffett have said to Lloyd Blankfein if we were asked to take the preferred shares he bought today without the equity warrants he received ?
He would have said “ no deal ! ”
And that is what Congress must say as well in defense of the American people .
Do n’t worry about what the administration asked for , just pass a bill that works along the lines suggested by Dodd ( although we really think some of the help to homeowner protection measures suggested are ineffective – for something we think really works , see the second half of our report from Friday , Sept. 19 .
It ’s even possible that our two exhausted leaders are secretly hoping Congress does the right thing to give them the political cover they need to be able to explain to the financial establishment that they simply had n’t any choice but to take equity .
The world wo n’t come even remotely crashing down if the Dodd proposal , or something like it , is passed …. and the president will surely sign it .
Note , we said nothing so far here about executive pay .
While we appreciate the outrage and certainly believe that , merely as a business matter , management of institutions should refrain from drawing anything other than very reasonable base salaries if they are rescued , that is really a matter between management and their boards / shareholders .
If shareholders are heavily diluted by a rescue , we imagine that there will be an outcry heard all the way to the “ C - suite ” that will sufficiently influence that issue .
In any case , the matter is of far lesser import than the key issues above .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Capitalism as we used to know it is on its deathbed .
And those who predicted that the old brand , the unfettered , American - promoted system , was a danger to the world , are being vindicated .
They include Karl Marx , whose thinking on banks seems oddly contemporary these days .
The credit crisis that began in August last year and turned into near - catastrophe this month is not over , despite the hundreds of billions of dollars that governments are spending to save banks in the United States and Europe from collapse and thereby prevent a global depression .
But there is an emerging consensus that capitalism needs a 21st century overhaul , not just emergency rescues , to save it from itself .
When that will happen is not clear .
“ What we are seeing right now looks like a very slow train wreck , ” says James Boughton , the historian of the International Monetary Fund , or IMF .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has suggested an international meeting on the pattern of the 1944 Bretton Woods conference that resulted in the post - World War II financial order and created the IMF and the World Bank .
That system was dominated by Washington .
The United States , from where the credit crisis spread like a virulent epidemic , is not likely to play as large a role in whatever new “ financial architecture ” world leaders construct .
As Peer Steinbrueck , the German finance minister , put it : “ One thing seems probable ... The U.S. will lose its status as the superpower of the global financial system . ”
“ The world is at risk of losing its anchor ... the United States , ” U.S. financial strategist David Smick writes in his just - published book on financial globalization , The World is Curved : Hidden Dangers to the World Economy .
The opening chapter is darkly entitled The End of the World .
Smick said in an interview he thought a global depression was still possible despite the steps taken by the United States and Europe to restore confidence .
Those measures included buying stakes in major banks - in effect partial nationalization - and would make Marx smile if he could rise from his grave .
In the Communist Manifesto he and his collaborator Friedrich Engels published in 1848 , Marx listed government control of capital as one of the ten essential steps on the road to communism .
Step five : “ Centralization of credit in the hands of the state ... ”
There are not many Marxists left in the industrialized world and not even the most fervent expect the revival of an ideology that failed so dismally in the Soviet Union .
MOMENTOUS BREAK
But as far as the United States is concerned , the events of the past few weeks represent a momentous break with decades of a free market philosophy that abhorred government intervention in ( and regulation of ) financial markets .
“ There is little question that making the government a major investor in American banks raises thorny questions ... about the role of the public sector in private markets , ” Sen .
Charles Schumer , a member of the Senate finance and banking committees , wrote in the Wall Street Journal the day the government announced it was planning to take equity stakes worth up to $ 250 billion in American banks .
It will take time for questions about the public sector in private markets to be answered .
But it looks likely that some things will never be quite the same , no matter who wins the presidential election on November 4 .
For one , the control center of the financial market has already begun shifting from New York to Washington .
The “ big government ” that free marketeers identified as something evil is almost certain to make a comeback , although spending on America ’s crumbling infrastructure , its inefficient health care system , and environmental programs will be limited by the Everest - sized public debt .
The U.S. national debt has increased by an average of $ 3.34 billion a day over the past year and now stands at more than $ 10 trillion .
Both in the United States and in Europe , officials have stressed that government intervention in the banks will be temporary but whether they will be able to stuff that genie back into the bottle remains to be seen .
And “ temporary ” has not been defined .
“ We will not stand down until we have achieved our goal of repairing and reforming our financial system and thereby restoring prosperity to our economy , ” said Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve .
Amid the gloom and anxiety of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , which started in the United States in 1929 and then spread to the rest of the world , there are hopes that Capitalism 2.0 ( if it ever comes about ) will result in a more equal society .
“ There is a tremendous opportunity now to narrow the income gap , ” says Sam Pizzigati of the Institute for Policy Studies , a Washington think tank .
That gap resembles the top - to - bottom income distribution just before the Great Depression , according to the Washington Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
Then as now , the top 1 percent of households accounted for around one fifth of the national income .
In 1980 , their share was 8 percent .
History shows that deep financial crises have helped spur public policy reforms and those pending include legislation that would make it easier for American workers to join labor unions .
At present , 7.5 percent of private sector workers are union members , the lowest percentage in the industrialized world .
U.S. unions say they are close to reaching a goal of collecting , by election day , one million signatures supporting the legislation .
If passed , it would be part of what some have already started calling the new world financial order .

Campaign Rhetoric As An Invitation To Violence
A Word From Afar : Campaign Rhetoric
As An Invitation To Violence A Word From Afar is a regular column that analyses political / strategic / international interest .
By Paul G. Buchanan
Heading into the homestretch of the 2008 US presidential elections , there is an elephant in the room that few want to speak about .
It occasionally appears as a topic of political gossip , in foreign press editorials , on the web and in US newspaper back pages , but it is not confronted as a topic of mainstream interest .
The subject is ugly , unthinkable in polite society , and impolitic to mention .
That is the possibility of political assassination , specifically that of Barack Obama .
Let us discuss it here .
The issue is one of electoral context and demeanor .
The contrast between the moods of both campaigns is remarkable .
Increasingly confident of a decisive victory , Barack Obama and Joe Biden focus their speeches on what they will do in office , specifically concentrating on the immediate challenges of providing remedies for the national economic crisis and addressing the disarrayed state of US foreign policy in the wake of the W .
Bush years .
In contrast , the Republican ticket of John McCain and Sarah Palin focus their energies on issuing dire warnings as to what will happen should Obama become president .
The language used by Republicans is provocative : Obama is a socialist ( because he believes in using tax policy to redistribute wealth ) , he is a friend of terrorists , black separatists and criminals ( because he worked with a community activist who once was a anti-Vietnam War militant , worshipped in a church led by a strident preacher and had a professional relationship with a convicted influence - peddling property developer ) , he is not a “ normal ” American ( because of his name , mixed race and background ) , he is elitist ( because of his education ) , he will steal the election ( because of his ties to grassroots voter registration efforts ) , he will cut and run in Iraq and will make the US more vulnerable to attack by Islamicists ( either because he is sympathetic to them or because he is soft - spined ) .
In short , he is painted as the enemy within .
The reason for this is clear .
Devoid of substantive policy options and facing the prospect of a massive defeat , the Republicans hope to scare undecided American voters into rejecting the change — or better said , the uncertainty -- which an Obama presidency represents .
They pander to ignorance and fear rather than optimism and hope in order to encourage voters to turn their backs on uncertainty and embrace something that offers the appearance of familiarity and tradition .
“ Country First ” is the rhetorical cover for this counter - reformist message , even if the Republicans appear to care less about country than they do about holding onto the presidency .
Yet , in an election in which a person of colour has the possibility of becoming Commander in Chief during a time of national crisis , it remains to be seen if the majority of the electorate will want to be on the side of those who prefer to reject history rather than help make it .
From early voting polls , most will not .
The Republicans have had some success in their project .
The rage at McCain / Palin rallies is palpable .
In contrast to the giddy ( delusional ? ) displays at the GOP convention , they have become anger fests punctuated by boos and jeers as the specter of nuclear attacks , communism , terrorism and the loss of Christian values under an Obama - led democratic administration are invoked as reasons to vote Republican .
The prospect of national collapse is held to be imminent otherwise .
In their negative campaigning , in the tone of their vitriol , in the repetition of false accusations and smears that lead their followers to believe that Obama is un-American , treasonous ( for which the penalty under US federal statutes includes death , particularly in wartime ) , that he is a closet Arab , disguised Muslim , foreign born , etc. , what the Republican campaign managers and their media surrogates are doing is something much more dangerous than trying to win an election .
Elementary discursive analysis reveals the not - to - subtle cues to direct action embedded in the Republican campaign rhetoric .
Put bluntly : by demonising Barack Obama , it is a subliminal invitation to murder .
From the day Obama announced his campaign for the presidency , black Americans and white liberals have worried that he would get killed .
They have historical reason to believe so .
Modern prophets of change in the US such as Martin Luther King , Bobby Kennedy and Malcolm X were all murdered .
The modern record for presidential shootings is equally alarming .
John Kennedy was murdered 45 years ago , Gerald Ford shot at in 1975 and Ronald Reagan wounded in 1981 ( president George H.W. Bush claimed an assassination plot by Saddam Hussein as well ) .
In terms of statistical probability , the US is overdue for a presidential homicide , especially if the person targeted is an agent of change that discomfits unhinged sectors of the conservative population .
Given the historical and contemporary complexion of US politics , the target for assassination in all probability is Barack Obama .
With the Republican campaign rhetoric of the moment , that probability increases .
This is why the Obama demonisation project is dangerous .
Words have consequences beyond their original meaning , however unintended .
The venom directed at Obama is exactly the type that touches the nerve of extremist elements in the American polity .
Neo -Nazis , xenophobes , anti-communists , Christian fundamentalists , assorted right - wing militia groups , anti-abortionists , Klansmen and racists of various stripes — the number of potentially dangerous individuals incited by the Republican campaign discourse is large .
Such people have proven records of murderous violence against those they despise .
To pour fuel on the fires of their visceral hatred is to encourage someone to take matters into their own hands in order to prevent Obama from winning the presidency or , if he does , prevent him from either assuming office or serving out his term .
The warning signs are there .
An alleged white supremacy plot against Obama ’s life was disrupted the week before the Democratic National Convention in Denver .
Shouts of “ kill him ” and “ traitor ” greeted Sarah Palin ’s invocation of his name at Midwestern campaign rallies .
A uniformed police officer referred to him as Hussein Obama at a Florida rally .
Although Senator McCain meekly attempts to restore some civility to his campaign , Governor Palin continues to question Obama ’s patriotism and associations ( at the same time refusing to label abortion clinic bombers as “ terrorists ” or repudiate the openly racist chants from her audiences ) .
As many have said , the atmosphere in the Republican camp is toxic .
It could well be lethal .
The real threat does not come from incompetent skinheads , redneck sheriffs or the intellectual midgets who shout epithets from the rafters at Palin rallies and on cable TV shows .
It comes from those with some measure of acumen and skill who interiorize their rage and plot silently .
They could be military , ex-military , former or active duty law enforcement personnel , with knowledge and access to the tools required to undertake a targeted assassination .
They may know how to hunt , so understand basic issues of cover and position .
Given the security measures in place and need for corresponding secrecy , they would likely undertake an assassination “ mission ” as a loan wolf or decentralized small group operation .
All it takes is preparation and a triggering event to precipitate the plan into action .
The Republican campaign rhetoric could be the trigger .
After all , by their implicit logic it is a patriotic duty to prevent , by force if necessary , the collapse of the American way of life .
The unwitting incitement to murder is one - sided .
The Democrats engage in personal attacks on Senator McCain and Governor Palin , but none of these reach the level of calling them “ treasonous ” or anti-American .
No mainstream Democrat feverishly predicts the end of the American way of life should McCain and Palin win , and most of their criticism of McCain and Palin comes in the form of ridicule .
The Democratic rallies are love fests when compared to those of the Republicans , with less energy put into critiquing the opponents than of offering hope for a better future under Obama ’s leadership .
John McCain and Sarah Palin consequently have little to fear from Obama supporters when it comes to their personal safety , win or lose .
The same is not true the other way around .
The Secret Service recognized the problem early when it assigned the largest security detail ever for a party candidate to Senator Obama early in the primary season .
That detail has been reinforced since his nomination , with the Secret Service concerned about the vulnerabilities inherent in the mass gatherings and “ press the flesh ” opportunities staged by his campaign .
In recent weeks law enforcement agencies in the localities in which Obama appears have expanded their intelligence and surveillance gathering efforts as well as security around campaign sites .
The FBI has increased its scrutiny of right wing extremists , and both the CIA and FBI are on alert for foreign - originated threats ( which the Department of Homeland Security has been obsessively focused on to the exclusion of domestic terrorism ) .
Senator McCain and Governor Palin have their own Secret Service details and have the protection of both federal and local security agencies when out on the campaign trail , but none of this comes close to that accorded to Senator Obama .
The reason is simple : the danger to Obama is imminent and real .
This is a delicate moment in the US presidential campaign .
Unless the Republicans explicitly call on their supporters to reject the use of violence regardless of the election outcome , and unless they moderate their rhetoric so that an electoral loss is not seen as the end of the world by their most zealous supporters , then the possibility of an assassination attempt on Barack Obama can not be discounted .
More than any US political figure of the last two decades , he is the one who has most inflamed desperate ( as well as hopeful ) passions , and he is consequently the most likely to be targeted .
It is important to understand the seriousness of the threat posed by Republican demonisation of Barack Obama .
An attempt on his life , especially if successful , could spell the terminal rupture of the US political consensus and a descent into open social conflict .
Recognising this fact is not being alarmist .
It is being coldly realistic .
It just takes someone outside the US to say so .

The no-short - selling list created by the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to change , as do the rules themselves .
On Monday Diamond Hill Investment Group pulled itself off the list .
Yesterday JMP
Securities also exempted itself .
Today Greenlight Capital Re , Ltd. , a reinsurance holding company whose Chairman is David Einhorn , the most prominent critic of Lehman Brothers , yanked itself from the list .
Why would a firm remove itself from the list ?
Len Goldberg , the CEO of Greenlight Capital , told us it was n't a tough decision .
" It 's prety simple really .
We believe our shareholders are better off by having the market determine our stock price , " Goldberg said .
He added that the company had n't suffered since coming off the list .
" In the extreme short - term , we certainly have n't suffered .
Today we 're up 2 % . "
But even as these firms have come off the list , the number of companies protected the shorting restrictions continues to grow .
A great number of financial firms and banks have applied to be on the list , as have IBM General Electric , General Motors and the Ford Motor Company .
The SEC delegated the responsibility for deciding which companies should be protected to the stock exchanges , and the exchanges are actively soliciting listed companies who might want to be protected from short sellers , Michael de la Merced of the New York Times reported .
So far as many as 900 companies are on the list .
Meanwhile , the rules themselves keep changing .
Originally , the SEC had declared that complete fatwa against short - selling the stocks on the list .
As many market participants pointed out , this would have been a disaster .
Market makers , arbitrageurs and long - short market neutral funds would have found themselves needing to scramble to undo positions that could no longer be hedged .
Preferred shares and bonds would have faced a sell - off as investors discovered themselves unable to hedge their positions by shorting common stock of the issuers .
A few days later , the SEC changed its mind and announced it would permit short sales from genuine hedges .
This two creates a strange situation in the market , where investors who diversify holdings between hedge funds , investing in both net long and net short funds , rather than hedging through a single fund taking a market neutral position , are disadvantaged .
The disclosure rules also shifted .
At first , shorts were required to publicly disclose short positions on the Monday following the trade .
Now the SEC has promised to not disclose these filings for two weeks .
Interestingly , this could mean that the disclosures never become public , as the current “ emergency rule ” is scheduled to expire next week .
It will probably be extended , of course .
But we ’ll only have a few weeks of disclosure before the 30 - day extension expires and the SEC is required to enter the formal rule making process .
It ’s hard not to think that this regulatory chaos must be contributing more uncertainty to the markets .
Is Chris Cox even talking to market participants and other regulators ?
Or is he just tossing these rules off into the night after huddling with a few close advisers ?
Is there anyway we can draft Paul Atkins , the eminently sensible retired SEC commissioner , back into service ?
Warren Buffett has gotten greedy too quickly while everyone else takes too long to become fearful , suggests the Wall Street Journal in today 's " Heard on the Street " column .
Under the headline Even the Oracle Didn't Time It Perfectly , Peter Eavis writes that while Buffett has won " plaudits for some canny deals , " there 's also an " unnerving pattern emerging . "
" Mr. Buffett looks to be committing his capital too early .
On some bets , waiting might have gotten him better terms or more attractive entry prices . "
" Time for the Oracle to get a new crystal ball , " according to Eavis .
He acknowledges that Buffett does n't try to time his investments too closely , and says he's not launching a " cheap gibe " based on the S&P 's 7 percent decline since Buffett 's ' I'm Buying U.S. Stocks ' op - ed piece in the New York Times on October 17 .
Instead , Eavis focuses on two bets Berkshire Hathaway has placed on derivatives .
In one , Berkshire received large payments to provide default protection for " certain junk - rated corporations " in North America .
The company has already booked hundreds of millions of dollars in mark - to - market losses on its exposure to these credit default swaps .
" Berkshire more than doubled it notional exposure on these CDS to $ 8.8 billion between the end of 2006 and the middle of this year . "
REYKJAVIK , Iceland  Iceland ’s financial system collapsed Thursday , and analysts said it was probably only a matter of time before the country would have to turn to the International Monetary Fund for help .
Such a move , which would make this small island nation the first sovereign state to fall victim to the credit squeeze that began last year , would require it to accept harsh measures to restore fiscal and monetary stability .
Iceland has tried desperately to avoid such a step .
But the odds against it grew worse on Thursday when the government took over the last of three major banks and shut down the stock exchange .
Trading in the Icelandic krona ceased , with foreign banks no longer willing to take the currency  even at what seemed like bargain rates .
Financial workers at Wall Street 's top banks are to receive pay deals worth more than $ 70bn ( £ 40bn ) , a substantial proportion of which is expected to be paid in discretionary bonuses , for their work so far this year - despite plunging the global financial system into its worst crisis since the 1929 stock market crash , the Guardian has learned .
Staff at six banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are in line to pick up the payouts despite being the beneficiaries of a $ 700 bn bail - out from the US government that has already prompted criticism .
The government 's cash has been poured in on the condition that excessive executive pay would be curbed .
Pay plans for bankers have been disclosed in recent corporate statements .
Pressure on the US firms to review preparations for annual bonuses increased yesterday when Germany 's Deutsche Bank said many of its leading traders would join Josef Ackermann , its chief executive , in waiving millions of euros in annual payouts .
The sums that continue to be spent by Wall Street firms on payroll , payoffs and , most controversially , bonuses appear to bear no relation to the losses incurred by investors in the banks .
Shares in Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have declined by more than 45 % since the start of the year .
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have fallen by more than 60 % .
JP MorganChase fell 6.4 % and Lehman Brothers has collapsed .
At one point last week the Morgan Stanley $ 10.7 bn pay pot for the year to date was greater than the entire stock market value of the business .
In effect , staff , on receiving their remuneration , could club together and buy the bank .
In the first nine months of the year Citigroup , which employs thousands of staff in the UK , accrued $ 25.9 bn for salaries and bonuses , an increase on the previous year of 4 % .
Earlier this week the bank accepted a $ 25 bn investment by the US government as part of its bail - out plan .
At Goldman Sachs the figure was $ 11.4bn , Morgan Stanley $ 10.73bn , JP Morgan $ 6.53bn and Merrill Lynch $ 11.7bn .
At Merrill , which was on the point of going bust last month before being taken over by Bank of America , the total accrued in the last quarter grew 76 % to $ 3.49 bn .
At Morgan Stanley , the amount put aside for staff compensation also grew in the last quarter to the end of August by 3 % to $ 3.7bn .
Days before it collapsed into bankruptcy protection a month ago Lehman Brothers revealed $ 6.12 bn of staff pay plans in its corporate filings .
These payouts , the bank insisted , were justified despite net revenue collapsing from $ 14.9 bn to a net outgoing of $ 64 m .
None of the banks the Guardian contacted wished to comment on the record about their pay plans .
But behind the scenes , one source said : " For a normal person the salaries are very high and the bonuses seem even higher .
But in this world you get a top bonus for top performance , a medium bonus for mediocre performance and a much smaller bonus if you do n't do so well . "
Many critics of investment banks have questioned why firms continue to siphon off billions of dollars of bank earnings into bonus pools rather than using the funds to shore up the capital position of the crisis - stricken institutions .
One source said : " That 's a fair question - and it may well be that by the end of the year the banks start review the situation . "
Much of the anger about investment banking bonuses has focused on boardroom executives such as former Lehman boss Dick Fuld , who was paid $ 485 m in salary , bonuses and options between 2000 and 2007 .
Last year Merrill Lynch 's chairman Stan O'Neal retired after announcing losses of $ 8bn , taking a final pay deal worth $ 161 m .
Citigroup boss Chuck Prince left last year with a $ 38 m in bonuses , shares and options after multibillion - dollar write - downs .
In Britain , Bob Diamond , Barclays president , is one of the few investment bankers whose pay is public .
Last year he received a salary of £ 250,000 , but his total pay , including bonuses , reached £ 36 m .
Today 's guilty plea by Richard Jackson , to a single offence under the Official Secrets Act 1989 section 8 Safeguarding of information
The BBC reports Official fined over missing files
A senior civil servant has been fined after pleading guilty to leaving top secret documents on a train .
Richard Jackson admitted negligence by losing the files on a service from London Waterloo to Surrey on 10 June .
City of Westminster Magistrates Court heard the documents " had the potential to damage national security and UK international relations " .
Cabinet Office official Jackson , 37 , of Yateley , Hampshire , was fined £ 2,500 and will have to pay £ 250 costs . [...]
See also the report in The Guardian Civil servant fined £ 2,500 for leaving secret al - Qaida files on train
[...]
A member of the public found them inside an orange cardboard envelope on a train from Waterloo station to Surrey and passed them on to the BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner .
Would this scandal have been covered up if the member of the public had simply not returned the documents , or had not used the BBC to do so ?
One of the documents was a seven - page report by the joint intelligence committee entitled Al - Qaida Vulnerabilities .
Classified as top - secret , the intelligence assessment on al - Qaida was so sensitive that every document was numbered and marked " for UK / US / Canadian and Australian eyes only " .
It is understood the assessment also contained reports on the state of the Islamist terror network in Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan .
The document reportedly contained names of individuals or locations that might have been useful to Britain 's enemies .
The second document , commissioned from the committee by the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , contained an analysis of Iraq 's security forces .
It included a top - secret and in some places " damning " assessment of Iraq 's security forces .
Jackson was on secondment to the Cabinet Office from the MoD at the time the documents were lost .
The court heard that the intelligence files " had the potential to damage national security and UK international relations " .
This is an extraordinarily lenient " punishment " for potentially tipping off terrorists and foreign intelligence agencies to the UK intelligence communities highest level strategic intelligence assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of our enemies .
What assurance is there that the Cabinet Office , the Ministry of Defence , the Joint Intelligence Committee , and their Assessments Staff , have made it physically and culturally impossible for such highly classified documents to actually be printed out and taken physically out of a secure reading room in Whitehall ?
Why are there no airport style , pat down searches , " see through your clothes " body scanners and physical searches of bags and briefcases , on every one of the small number of people who are handling such top secret documents , without exception , to physically prevent them from ever taking such unencrypted documents home , either deliberately or by accident ?
Unless and until , the Labour Government and the Whitehall bureaucracy , at the senior level at which Richard Jackson worked at , can demonstrate a real change in attitude and culture to our data security and privacy concerns , they simply cannot be trusted with national scale databases of our personal data .
This case contrasts sharply with the Official Secrets Act trial of Corporal Daniel James , a foreign born interpreter who worked for General David Richards in Afghanistan , who has now been promoted to be head of the British Army .
Despite the much more severe risk to UK anti-terrorism and national security , which Richard Jackson 's negligence or arrogance put at risk , he has not been vilified in the mainstream media or by the prosecution , in court , like the Iranian born Corporal Daniel James has .
It is worth reading the blog articles by Michael James Smith , who has an insider 's perspective of machinations in such Official Secrets
Act cases , having served time in prison after having been convicted of passing technical defence contractor documents to the KGB in 1993 , which he is trying to have overturned .
He has actually visited and interviewed Daniel James in Wandsworth prison ( what are the chances that this prison visit was electronically snooped on ? )
See Daniel James - the sacrificial lamb
The prosecution case against Corporal Daniel James appears to rest on 7 unencrypted emails between Daniel James and the Iranian military attache in Kabul , Afghanistan , which must have been intercepted whilst he was back in the United Kingdom , awaiting a return to duty .
Presumably these are therefore US government intercepts of UK email communications , being used in a British civilian court case , something which is forbidden by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 section 17 Exclusion of matterd from legal proceedings ,
This has implications for the ongoing Chilcot Review of Intercept Evidence - see the Spy Blog article Privy Council Chilcot Review report on Intercept Evidence - more ***
It also has implications for Home Secretary Jacqui Smith 's totalitarian Communications Data Bill and her attempts to piggyback a secret centralised communications data traffic database onto the GCHQ Intercept Modernisation Programme .
Meanwhile , there does not appear to be any prosecution over the incident which emerged a few days after the Richard Jackson stupidity , also involving HM Treasury and sensitive terrorist financing and money laundering documents , also left on a train :
See the previous Spy Blog article : Terrorist financing and money laundering Treasury documents left on a train - time for Whitehall mandarins and Ministerial heads to roll
Is this because a favoured political apparatchik was the culprit ?
Two planets about 300 light years from Earth have slammed into each other recently , US astronomers say , the first time evidence of such a catastrophic collision has been seen by scientists .
Astronomers from the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) and the California Institute of Technology ( CALTECH ) said the crash involved two planets orbiting a star in the Aries constellation .
The collision was uncovered while astronomers were attempting to measure the star 's age , and found an unusually large amount of dust orbiting the star .
" It 's as if Earth and Venus collided with each other , " said Benjamin Zuckerman , UCLA professor of physics and astronomy .
" Astronomers have never seen anything like this before .
Apparently , major catastrophic collisions can take place in a fully mature planetary system . "
Big Three to Get Check From Government
Just do n't call it a " bailout , " Detroit says of $ 25 billion loan .
Sept. 28 , 2008 --
It 's been an expensive month for taxpayers , with a succession of Wall Street institutions seeking government help .
And now , add Detroit 's Big Three to the list of those in line for a bailout .
" It 's a reflection of how far the mighty have fallen , " said auto analyst John Casesa , managing partner of the Casesa Shapiro Group .
After years in the red , General Motors , Ford and Chrysler are now betting on green technology .
The automakers hope by 2010 to replace their current losing lineup of gas - guzzlers with next - generation hybrids and electric plug-ins .
It 's no small feat .
Factories will have to be retooled , and that requires time , money and good credit -- three big things the Big Three lack -- and so , for the past 18 months , Detroit has been lobbying Congress for up to $ 50 billion in loan guarantees .
Loans of $ 25 billion were budgeted in last year 's energy bill , and this weekend Congress cut the check -- a move separate from the massive Wall Street bailout effort .
But " bailout " is n't the word automakers are using .
A greener Big Three , the automakers argue , will reduce the country 's dependence on foreign oil .
" It 's not a bailout , " said Chrysler Vice Chairman Jim Press .
" It 's a good investment between industry and government . "
But critics of the loan plan disagree .
" Oh , I 'd call it a bailout , " said Peter Morici , economics professor at the University of Maryland .
" [ The Big Three ] are having increasing difficulty borrowing money in the private credit markets because there 's a high risk of default .
In that environment , giving them a government loan is a bailout . "
The $ 25 billion in loans dwarfs the $ 1.2 billion Chrysler bailout of 1979 and the $ 15 billion in direct payments and loans the airlines received after the Sept. 11 attacks .
And as with the airlines , there is no guarantee the loans will save auto industry jobs or improve sales for the Big Three .
" This is a lot of money , and it will help , but this wo n't save Detroit , " said Casesa .
" Only Detroit can save itself . "
With Michigan up for grabs in November , both Barack Obama and John McCain have voiced support for the loans as part of an overall investment in green technology .
And the automakers say the issue goes beyond politics .
" Are we going to keep [ green ] technology , the core technology , here ?
Or are we going to start depending on somebody else ? " said Press .
" We are worried about being dependent on foreign sources of oil , so what about dependence on foreign sources of batteries ?
It 's the same thing . "
But others say subsidizing the Big Three , after years of the companies ' persisting in building SUVs and other non-fuel - efficient vehicles despite environmental and market warnings , sends the wrong message to corporate America .
" Well , it means belly up to the bar in Washington , and they 'll give you some cash too after you 've made foolish decisions , " said Morici .
" I do n't buy the notion that [ the Big Three ] are so vital in their present form that we can't let them fail . "
Private George Ellison , the last British soldier to die
By John Hayes - Fisher
Producer , Timewatch
In the closing minutes of World War I , the ceasefire within touching distance , a handful of troops died .
As the 90th anniversary of the Armistice approaches , who were these men ?
Just after 5 o'clock on the morning of 11 November , 1918 , British , French and German officials gathered in a railway carriage to the north of Paris and signed a document which would in effect bring to an end World War I .
Within minutes , news of the Armistice - the cease fire - had been flashed around the world that the war , which was meant to " end all wars " , was finally over .
And yet it was n't , because the cease - fire would not come into effect for a further six hours - at 11 am - so troops on the frontline would be sure of getting the news that the fighting had stopped .
That day many hundreds died , and thousands more injured .

The respected American author Joseph E Persico has calculated a shocking figure that the final day of WWI would produce nearly 11,000 casualties , more than those killed , wounded or missing on D - Day , when Allied forces landed en masse on the shores of occupied France almost 27 years later .
What is worse is that hundreds of these soldiers would lose their lives thrown into action by generals who knew that the Armistice had already been signed .
The recklessness of General Wright , of the 89th American Division , is a case in point .
Seeing his troops were exhausted and dirty , and hearing there were bathing facilities available in the nearby town of Stenay , he decided to take the town so his men could refresh themselves .
" That lunatic decision cost something like 300 casualties , many of them battle deaths , for an inconceivable reason , " says Mr Persico .
Final fallen
So who were the last to die ?
New research by the BBC's Timewatch tells the story of some of the last to fall in WWI .
The final British soldier to be killed in action was Private George Edwin Ellison .
At 9.30 am Pte Ellison of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers was scouting on the outskirts of the Belgian town of Mons where German soldiers had been reported in a wood .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Aged 40 , Pte Ellison was not the typical conscript , says military historian Paul Reed .
" He was a pre-war regular soldier ; we can tell this by his number ( L / 12643 ) which is consistent with a man who enlisted in the early years of the 20th Century .
He may even have been a Boer war veteran , considering his age . "
It must have been odd for Pte Ellison to be back in Mons again .
This is where his war started four years earlier when he was part of the British Expeditionary Force retreating from Mons in August 1914 , just weeks after the outbreak of the war .
" During his four years at the front , George saw every type of warfare , " says Mr Reed .
" He went into the first trenches as the war became deadlocked .
He fought in the first gas attack , and on the Somme in 1916 , watched the first ever tanks go up to the front . "
Almost a million British soldiers had been killed in those intervening years , yet almost miraculously Pte Ellison had so far escaped uninjured .
In just over an hour the ceasefire would come into force , the war would be over and Pte Ellison , a former coal miner , would return to the terraced street in Leeds to see his wife Hannah and their four - year - old son James .
Remembering the fallen
And then the shot rang out .
George was dead - the last British soldier to be killed in action in WWI .
Although the last British soldier to die , Pte Ellison would not be the last to be killed that morning .
As the minutes ticked towards the 11 o'clock ceasefire , more soldiers would fall .
At 10.45 another 40 - year - old soldier , Frenchman Augustin Trebuchon , was taking a message to troops by the River Meuse saying that soup would be served at 11.30 after the peace , when he too was killed .
Astonished enemy Augustin Trebuchon 's grave - along with all those French soldiers killed on 11 November 1918 - is marked 10/11/18 .
It is said that after the war France was so ashamed that men would die on the final day that they had all the graves backdated .
Just minutes before 11 am , to the north around Mons , the 25 - year - old Canadian Private George Lawrence Price was on the trail of retreating German soldiers .
It was street fighting .
Pte Price had just entered a cottage as the Germans left through the back .
On emerging into the street he was struck by the bullet which killed him .
But Pte Price 's death at 10.58 was not the last .
Further south in the Argonne region of France , US soldier Henry Gunther was involved in a final charge against astonished German troops who knew the Armistice was about to occur .
What could they do ?
He too was shot .
The Baltimore Private - ironically of German descent - was dead .
It was 10.59 and Henry Gunther is now recognised as the last soldier to be killed in action in WWI .
Ninety years later , George Ellison 's granddaughters Catherine and Marie make an emotional first visit to the cemetery where their grandfather lies .

Advertisement Catherine knows he died just five days short of her own father 's ( George 's only son James ) 5th birthday .
" It must have been terrible for my grandma " she says .
It 's the first time anyone from the family has seen George 's grave .
As the two sisters lay white lilies beneath their grandfather 's headstone , Marie echoes what many families in Britain today still feel about those who gave their lives in that war .
" We are very proud . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
My father was the doctor serving with the 2nd Kings African Rifles in the bush on the Mozambique border on 11/11/18 .
It took three days for the armistice message to get through ( via the Germans ) and there were several serious skirmishes in the meanwhile killing a British officer and several askaris .
Antony Murphy , Birmingham
My gratitude is extended to all those brave men and women who gave their lives so that we can live in relative peace .
However , does it really matter that soldiers were killed one minute before or after the end of the war ?
Surely what matters is that from the first to the last soldier to be killed in any conflict is a waste of life .
All politicians who engage in war should be arrested and jailed for crimes against humanity .
David Small , Pendlebury , Manchester
My grandfather survived WWI serving as a volunteer in the Royal Artillery .
Subsequently , alert to the threat that Hitler posed , he joined the territorials .
When WWII broke out , I understand that he suffered a breakdown brought on by memories of what he'd experienced in the first war .
His death certificate says he died of pneumonia in hospital , in 1943 .
Mark , London
Many also fell after the armistice , news of this agreement to cease hostilities took time to reach to the frontline in the far reaches .
My great grandfather was killed in Palestine after the 11/11/1918 armistice .
I 'm sure he was not alone , sad but true .
Matthew , Swindon Matthew , my grandfather was a Lewis gunner in the Machine Gun Corps ; initially on the Western Front but then in Palestine .
I recall him telling me , during my childhood , that he fought on for several days after 11/11/18 and that British soldiers were killed beyond Armistice Day .
David , Douglas
This is a tragic tale but let 's also remember those who died in the years after the end of WWI whilst clearing the battlefields of the Western Front .
There are many war graves to be found that are dated post 1918 , many of them are Royal Engineers who were killed by unexploded ordinance .
Simon Kirby , Melbourn , Cambridgeshire
In the same cemetery as Pte Ellison 's grave are also the graves of the first British soldier to be killed in the war , the first VC awarded during the war , and Pte Price , who , until I read this article , I thought was the last person to be killed , being shot when breaking cover to accept flowers from a local .
Outside Mons there is a memorial to mark the spot where the first skirmish of the war took place .
For anyone interested in the history of the Great War , Mons & the surrounding area is well worth a visit .
An ex-soldier , Wales I will be visiting St Symphorien Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Sun 9 Nov 08 to attend the Act of Remembrance .
The British Forces based in Mons will remember Pte Ellison and the other British and Canadian soldiers who lie at peace .

On the eve of this 90th anniversary of the end of the Great War , the last Italian survivor , the " Bersagliere " and Kight of Vittorio Veneto Delfino Borroni , passed away aged 110 .
In remembrance .
Andrea Porretta , Milano , Italia
As an ex-soldier I am filled with deep sadness for all those who died , especially these last few .
It 's all too easy to forget and repeat mistakes .
Remember remember should be the national refrain .
Steve , Iraq , England Fighting was going on across many sectors of the Western Front right up to the Armistice at 11 am , with Royal Artillery expending as much ammunition as they could before the cease - fire .
Many soldiers thought the armistice was a sell - out , and wanted to press on into Germany as the German army was beaten , and they knew it .
John Austin , London , England
My great uncle died in France a few weeks before the Armistice .
He was in the Argonne - Meuse campaign , which had heavy losses in early September when the American Expeditionary Force advanced perhaps too fast .
I was able to get an idea of his actions by looking at military reports and maps .
His body was returned to the US and buried in Dunn County , Wisconsin .
I believe that he died in a military hospital behind the lines , as his body would not have been returned if he died on the front .
What a bloody war .
Karen Ranney , Brooklyn , NY , USA
The armistice was for aesthetics and symbolism of 11 am on the 11th day of the 11th month .
An immediate ceasefire could have been ordered , instead we had the incidents you name .
I am sure there would have been others , even at 5:30 am , but the stories of men taking pot shots to relieve their bitterness before the ceasefire and the casualties these caused would not have happened .
I believe the statistics show a large increase in casualties on the final day as men tried to enact a futile revenge before it was too late .
The 11 am ceasefire was the final example of the donkeys leading the lions .
A disastrous end to a disastrous war .
Ceri Davies , Cardiff Anyone interested in WWI should read Mud , Blood and Poppycock which debunks some of the images we have about the Great War .
The donkeys were not so much donkeys after all and did the best that they possibly could in the circumstances they had been dealt .
As for sitting the war out , if we had done that Germany would have won because of the destruction of morale and then mutiny in the French army that happened in either 1916 or 1917 - I can't remember .
Some of the battles that the British had to fight were only to keep pressure off the French and divert German forces away to fight the British so as to hide the shocking situation that France 's armed forces were close to collapse .
Steve , Ipswich A family story is that my grandfather 's cousin was killed on the Western front at about 11.20 am on 11 November - after the formal Armistice , because word had n't reached the front .
I do n't know many details but I think he might either have had the surname Taunton - Read ( or Reid ) or be of that family .
My grandfather 's family were from Coventry .
Geraldine , London I have often wondered how many men died while they waited for 11 am .
War is such a tragic waste and these stories are particularly poignant .
Whyvonnie , Crediton , Devon Very sad .
We owe a huge debt to these soldiers who suffered terribly in horrific conditions .
It may be a long time ago but our gratitude should never fade .
Trevor , Limoges , France
As an historian who has studied World War I , and a former U.S. Marine , I am no longer shocked by the stupidity of the leaders of the various countries and their willingness to sacrifice the the lives of the young .
I do remain saddened by the senseless slaughter and wonder if it will ever change .
David , San Miguel de Allende , Mexico My Dad's Uncle died in Northern France two weeks after the end of the war having served with the Royal Garrison Artillery .
He died as a result of the atrocious conditions , in his case pneumonia .
Many thanks to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission for their help when we were tracing what happened to him .

What strikes me most profoundly is how strongly the gratitude and appreciation persists in the minds and memories of the local people of these places of the sacrifices made by British and Commonwealth servicemen and women [ many nurses were killed tending those brought back to the dressing stations behind the front lines ] .
It is possible , due to the superiority of the Royal Navy , that Britain could have sat out WWI , certainly until the entry into the conflict of the US .
But the people of France & Belgium , with Holland , Norway , Greece and countries of eastern Europe , have a deep respect for Britain 's commitment from the start of the two World Wars to free their countries of the invader .
I believe that if more British people realised with how great a respect and affection their Armed Services are held by those we went to help , more appreciation would be shown in our own country for the great sacrifices of 1914 - 18 & 39 - 45 .
It is time we commemorated the 11th of the 11th with a national holiday , as they do in France .
Lest we forget .
Chris Nation , Bristol Chris Nation writes about gratitude of local people .
All you need to do is go to Ypres / Ieper , Belgium and attend the daily ceremony at Menin gate to see what it means on daily basis to the townspeople of Ieper .
Traffic stops , people get out of their cars for this ceremony .
Cannot see that happening in London .

Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil emulated BP today by revealing record quarterly profits .
Royal Dutch
Shell , the biggest oil company in Europe , beat City expectations with third - quarter current - cost - of - supply profits — which strip out unrealised inventory gains and losses — up 74 % to $ 10.9 bn ( £ 6.7bn ) .
Exxon Mobil , the world 's largest oil company , smashed its own record for the highest quarterly earnings by a US firm by delivering a profit of $ 14.83bn .
Despite the better - than - expected figures , Royal Dutch Shell shares fell more than 3 % , in part because of lower - than - expected production .
" Overall , this is a good outcome , " said Tony Shepard , an analyst at stockbroker Charles Stanley .
" But some investors will be disappointed by the sluggish production volumes . "
Shell said it had benefited from higher oil and gas prices .
Crude prices were more than 50 % higher and gas realisations were about 48 % ahead of the same quarter last year .
Oil prices have fallen by about half from their peak in July when they reached $ 147 a barrel but the continued scale of oil company profits have prompted calls for lower prices for consumers and the imposition of a windfall tax .
" We are steering the Shell ship through rough waters and so far OK , " said the chief executive , Jeroen van der Veer .
" Yes , we are generating large profits .
Yes , we have the largest investment programme in Shell 's history to create value for shareholders and to play our part in providing safe and cost competitive energy for consumers . "
He said that , as well as its investment programme to secure energy supplies , his company 's strategy remained to pay " competitive and progressive dividends " .
The combination of a commitment to investment and dividend pay - outs
echoed BP 's response this week to questions about the scale of its earnings .
Chief financial officer Peter Voser , who will take over from Van der Veer next summer , said the company was on track to reach its target of asset sales of $ 5 bn this year , although he acknowledged the credit crunch was curbing the number of buyers .
" We are in no rush to sell assets .
It 's not a fire sale , " he said .
Like Shell and BP , Exxon benefited from the high price of crude oil .
Its profits amounted to $ 162 m a day or $ 113,000 a minute , despite disruption caused to offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico by two hurricanes — Gustav and Ike .
" Despite the continuing uncertainty in world financial markets , ExxonMobil has maintained a strong financial position , " said the chairman , Rex Tillerson .
Capital investment of $ 19.3 bn this year had made " a substantial contribution to employment and economic activity in the countries in which we operate , " he said .
The figures are likely to raise hackles among critics of the oil industry .
Exxon 's previous quarter yielded profits of $ 11.6bn , which was itself a US record .
The presidential candidate Barack Obama branded the company 's earnings as " outrageous " at a time when US motorists were " paying record prices at the pump " .
Exxon has been attacked by the environmental movement for its reluctance to invest in alternative energy sources .
At the company 's annual meeting in May , a significant minority of investors backed resolutions demanding limits on the company 's greenhouse gas emissions and a shift towards renewable energy .
The Texas - based company 's upstream businesses , comprising exploration and production , enjoyed a 48 % surge in earnings to $ 9.35 bn as commodity prices soared , despite an 8 % fall in output .
Downstream , Exxon 's refineries saw profits rise by $ 1bn to $ 3.01bn .
The figures comfortably beat analysts ' expectations and Exxon 's shares rose in early trading on Wall Street .
" US downstream was up from last year , so that was a positive surprise , " said Gene Pisasale , an energy analyst at PNC Capital Advisers .
" They have the strongest balance sheet in the business . "
I have been more than a tad concerned about near - paralysis in the money markets and imploding equity prices .
But this e-mail , from a well connected international investor not prone to alarm or ( normally ) the use of capital letters says that the banking crisis is staring to bring international shipping to a halt .
By way of background , letters of credit of various sorts are essential for trade .
For instance , imagine the difficulty if you are , say , a Chinese manufacturer who wants to sell his wares to buyers overseas .
How can he be sure the goods he ships will ever be paid for ?
Imagine the considerable difficulty and cost of chasing a deadbeat in a foreign country .
Letters of credit .
issued by banks , assure payment .
They can also serve to finance the shipment ( ie , fund the inventory while it is in transit ) .
Not only are banks now leery of lending to each other for much longer than overnight , they are also starting to refuse to honor letters of credit from other banks .
From the above - mentioned reader :
At the end of the day , if every counterparty is bad then you do n’t have a market and you do n’t have an economy .
I spoke to another friend of mine this afternoon , whose father has been in the shipping business forever .
Pristine credit rating , rock solid balance sheet .
He says if he takes his BNP Paribas letter of credit to Citi today for short term funding for his vessels , they wo n’t give it to him .
That means he can’t ship goods , which means that within the next 2 weeks , physical shortages of commodities begins to show up .
THE CENTRAL BANKS CAN’T LET THAT HAPPEN OR WE HAVE NO ECONOMY , LET ALONE A CREDIT SYSTEM .
We spoke later in the evening and said he had heard of another instance of a trade transaction failing , different parties entirely , this a shipment of coal , again due to the unwillingness of the seller ’s bank to accept an LC from the buyer .

The UK government is poised to announce details of a £ 50bn rescue package for the banking system , the BBC 's business editor has learned .
It will include a proposal to use taxpayers ' money to invest in banks - in effect part nationalising them .
The dramatic initiative is aimed at stabilising the financial system and making sure banks have enough cash .
The news comes after a day of steep falls in UK banking stocks and a high - level Downing Street summit Chancellor Alistair Darling said he would make a statement before financial markets opened on Wednesday morning and address the House of Commons later in the day .
It matters to all of us that the ambitious plan works - not least because the reluctance of our banks to lend to companies and households is sending the economy into recession .
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog Prime Minister Gordon Brown earlier held talks with Bank of England Governor Mervyn King .
Mr Darling and the chairman of the Financial Services Authority , Lord Turner , also took part in the discussions .
The announcement comes amid a series of dramatic developments in the world financial system : US President George W Bush called for co-ordinated action by leading industrialised countries to tackle the credit crunch Bush urges joint response
UK bank shares took a big pounding .
HBOS dropped 42 % , Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) fell 39 % , Barclays shed 9 % and Lloyds TSB was down 13 % .

The British Chamber of Commerce said that the UK was already in recession UK economy ' already in recession '
The International Monetary Fund warned the economic downturn in many countries was likely to worsen as the financial crisis continued IMF warns of ' severe downturn ' ' Big moment '
The BBC 's business editor Robert Peston said the Treasury had been working on the plan for weeks .
" In a UK context , this is a very big moment , " he said .
It will involve investing taxpayers ' money in banks , which should make them stronger and more confident to lend , he said .
To address the collapse of confidence in money markets , the standby facility should ensure big banks have enough cash to fund day - to - day operations .
" We need a full and comprehensive plan .
We do n't need any more step - by - step measures , " said Peter Hahn , a banking expert at the Cass Business School .
" Markets should react positively but we need to know what the details are . "
' Day of reckoning ' Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said Wednesday would be a " real day of reckoning for the whole British economy " .
He said the announcement needed to restore certainty and confidence to get banks lending to each other , and to customers , again .
The government also needed to explain how taxpayers ' interests would be safeguarded if the government was going to take stakes in UK banks , he added .
The shadow chancellor , George Osborne , said it was important that the government allayed the public 's fears about their savings and their jobs .
" If the taxpayer is providing support to the banks then that should be used to help small business stay afloat , help the family struggling at the moment with rising bills and should n't be used to pay the bonuses of bankers , " he said .
Shares hit Banking shares dropped after the bosses of the biggest UK banks met at the Treasury on Monday evening - raising fears that the sector needs government intervention .
Monday 's meeting was attended by Mr Darling , Mr King and Lord Turner , as well as representatives of RBS , Barclays and Lloyds TSB .
Meanwhile , customers of the Icesave internet bank have been warned they will probably have to claim compensation for money held in their savings accounts .
UK authorities are preparing for the bank 's parent in Iceland , Landsbanki , to be declared insolvent and the bank is not allowing savers to withdraw their cash .
Icesave has 350,000 savers in the UK and Netherlands , with about £ 4.5 bn of deposits .

What are these ?
On 10/26/08 , ara.t.howard [ email protected ] wrote :
equivalent methods only manipulating the syntax tree seems like a real advantage from
here , generating a dsl is already as nearly painless as it could be in
ruby , and methods do in fact have access to local variables and other
caller context
Sorry for the late reply …
I thought this thread had died .
You seem to have left out inline methods , for whatever they ’re worth .
Yes , DSLs in ruby are currently very easy to create and use ; I
anticipate that macros will make DSLs slightly harder to write , but
easier to use .
Ruby DSLs tend to be very natural looking to users , but
there are often small compromises to usability that wo n’t make much
sense to domain users , such as the need to begin some words with a
colon and the need to use ‘ do ’ at certain places in the language for
no apparent reason .
If you use macros to define your DSL , it should be
possible to rid oneself of those features .
The situation is already
pretty good , but macros will make it slightly better .
I say “ will ” ,
because , to be honest , at the moment most of the sugary convenience
features needed for nicer DSLs are not present .
As an example of a DSL ( perhaps the wrong word in this case … ) that
could be written in macros , there is iterate for common lisp :
http://common-lisp.net/project/iterate/doc/index.html
Iterate is a looping mini-language with special syntax for many common
looping tasks .
It looks kind of like what list comprehensions do for
you in python , but more powerful .
Now I imagine that something like
this could be written entirely with methods … but it would be too
slow .
( I admit , tho , that I do n’t understand iterate – or lisp in
general – very well .
If someone out there wants to correct my
misapprehensions , please feel free . )
cfp :~ > cat a.rb
def context &block
eval ‘ a += 40 ’ , block
block.call
end
This is a slick way of getting to your caller ’s lvars .
I would have
passed in a Binding myself , but this way is probably a little cleaner .
But , the caller must pass a block ( or binding ) in order to make this
work .
Sometimes , that ’s not a problem .
Sometimes it is .
For instance
( I ’ve run into this ) if you want to create an api that works exactly
like Regexp #match , you ’ll find that it ca n’t be done .
# match sets its
caller ’s $ ~ ( a local variable ) ; methods ca n’t do that .
In the past ,
I ’ve passed in an optional Binding to handle this case , but
practically speaking , it was a little too clumsy .
Using a block
instead is a better idea , but you ’re still changing the interface used
by your custom #match .
The whole point is to re-use your user ’s
existing knowledge about # match … if he has to remember , “ oh yeah ,
and if you use $ ~ or other matching variables , you have to pass an
extra block to # match ” , then that ’s not an effective re-use of
existing knowledge ; it might as well be a new interface .
can you show us something that cannot be done using ruby currently ,
which macros make possible ?
A recently requested new feature on ruby - core was DIR , which acts
like FILE , but returns the directory containing the current source
file .
As a macro , that is :
macro DIR
File.dirname FILE )
end
Now maybe ( now that I ’ve seen your block - as - binding trick ) you can
actually write this as a method , something like ,
def DIR ( &ctx )
File.dirname( eval ( “ FILE ” , ctx ) )
end
I have no ruby ATM , and ca n’t check if that works or not , sorry .
But
if it does , it will have to be called like DIR{} , instead of
DIR .
I ’d find that a little jarring .
Another recent request was a ‘ with ’ keyword , which operates like
instance_eval , but only changes the default receiver for code in the
block passed in , and not self as seen by instance variables .
I have an
implementation of this as well ( in the example directory of
RubyMacros ) , but for various reasons I ’m unsatisfied with it right
now , so I ’d rather not post it .
I ’m not claiming that either of these macros is actually a good idea ;
I ’m just trying to illustrate the possible .
It ’s likely that quite a few of the features for ruby that get
requested could actually be implemented by macros .
It ’s probably
appropriate that most of these requests are rejected ; we do n’t really
need a lot of global changes to the language .
However , if users can
write their own macros to scratch some of these itches , that ’s a
better solution .
They get the feature they want in just the program
that needs it , and the rest of us get a stable , predictable language
without a lot of weird new features in all other ruby programs .
( CNN ) --
A moving graph at the bottom of the CNN screen during Tuesday night 's presidential debate measured the reactions of uncommitted voters in the swing state of Ohio , and it seemed to bear out the theory that negative campaigning draws negative voter reactions .
Analysts say undecided voters do n't like negative attacks , from either side .

Nearly every time one candidate threw a jab at the other , the voter reaction dipped measurably .
The dips were minor for small digs but slipped further if a candidate continued criticizing his opponent .
For instance , reactions of both men and women voters slid into negative territory when Republican Sen.
John McCain said that trying to nail down Democratic Sen. Barack Obama 's tax policies is like " nailing Jell - O to the wall . "
Watch the criticism and the reaction »
Similarly , the reaction line took a dive when Obama discussed McCain 's votes in the Senate against alternative fuels .
Watch the graph go down at this point »
Such negative reactions are typically seen in voters who are undecided , said Merle Black , professor of politics and government at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia .
" They do n't like negative campaigning , " he said .
" It does n't matter whether it 's one side or the other . "
But while each candidate saw dips when criticizing his opponent , voters ' reactions were more positive when each began talking about specific plans and ideas regarding the national economy , the war in Iraq , the environment and other issues .
Voters are " worried about real issues , " Black said .
" They want the candidate to address that .
...
That 's what the voters are interested in .
They know it 's a big mess out there , and they want to know what the alternatives are . "
See scenes from the debate »
With less than a month to go before the general election , McCain 's campaign said before Tuesday 's debate that he planned to " take off the gloves . "
In addition , both campaigns have launched negative advertising campaigns against the opponent in an effort to win over undecided voters .
The stakes for McCain are high , as most polls show him trailing Obama .
" When you are down to crunch time and it's win or lose , you throw niceties out the window , " Bruce Vanden Bergh , a professor of advertising at Michigan State University , told CNN before the debate .
And on CNN's " American Morning " on Wednesday , Ben Jones , a former Democratic representative from Georgia , said , " At this point , it appears because the McCain campaign is behind , they think that 's the only shot they got left is to bring ( negativity ) -- but when they do those negative campaigns and negative attacks , it also brings them down .
" So it really does n't do any good , and people are sick and tired of it . "
Both McCain and Obama took numerous opportunities in Tuesday 's debate to point out the other 's voting record .
Obama noted that McCain voted against a program to provide government health insurance for children .
Watch Obama slam McCain on health insurance »
For his part , McCain pointed to Obama 's vote on a pork - laden energy bill .
Watch the dig and the reaction »
Both instances caused voters ' reaction to head toward negative territory .
The only voters who like to hear the jabs , Black said , are " the strong partisans .
They like to see the other candidate , the other side , criticized . "
But those voters , he noted , have already made up their minds , and in criticizing their opponent , candidates are " not persuading anybody that 's persuadable . "
Meanwhile , pointing out opponents ' shortcomings is a risky strategy , analysts have said , and one that could easily backfire on a campaign .
" Whenever the campaign takes a negative turn , independent voters notice , and they 'll punish the candidate that takes it too far , " John Avlon , author of " Independent Nation : How Centrists Can Change American Politics , " told CNN prior to the debate .
However , voters on some level have come to anticipate a certain level of criticism and jabs in a debate , which may be one reason that campaigns persist with negativity even though voters are known to dislike it , experts said .
" Both of them are probably irritated at each other and want to get the digs in , " Black said .
" It just kind of goes with the territory . "

Wal - Mart has downsized its decision to shutter its DRM key servers after transitioning to a DRM - free music store .
Wal - Mart Music customers began receiving e-mails today from the company saying that feedback from customers has prompted Wal - Mart to keep the DRM servers online a bit longer , allowing people to continue transferring their purchased music to other computers as usual .
Wal - Mart did not indicate , however , that the servers would remain online forever , and it continued to advise customers to burn their music to CDs .
" Based on feedback from our customers , we have decided to maintain our digital rights management ( DRM ) servers for the present time , " reads the e-mail sent to customers .
" While our customer support team is available to assist you with any issues , we continue to recommend that you back up your songs by burning them to a recordable audio CD .
By backing up your songs , you insure access to them from any personal computer at any time in the future . "
The decision comes only a couple of weeks after Wal - Mart originally announced that it planned to turn off the servers , and only a day after the servers were scheduled to be pulled offline .
Wal - Mart had fully transitioned away from DRM in February of this year , meaning that its previously - DRMed music was no longer important to the company .
Customers , if they had purchased the copy - protected WMA files , would no longer be able to authorize new computers or operating systems to play the music once the servers went offline .
If this all sounds familiar as a pop song , it should .
Both Yahoo Music and MSN Music have tried to pull the same stunt , almost leaving old customers out in the cold after the companies moved on to greener pastures .
However , both decided later to help out their customers — MSN decided to leave its DRM key servers up until 2011 , and Yahoo gave coupons to its music captives so that they could re-purchase their music , DRM - free , through Rhapsody .
The decisions made by all three of these music retailers — Wal - Mart , Yahoo , and MSN — shows that , if enough customers complain about the issue on the Internet , companies will listen .
Back in the day , writing a letter might net you a form response along with a coupon , and that 's only for the hardy souls who bothered with pen and ink and paper and envelope and stamp .
Today , the Internet lets customers tweet their bile to the world at a moment 's notice , actually yielding results in the process .
NO MONEY DOWN
by Douglas Rushkoff
from Arthur Magazine No. 31 , Oct 2008
I poked my head up from writing my book a couple of months ago to engage with Arthur readers about the subject I was working on : the credit crunch and what to do about it [ see “ Riding Out the Credit Crisis ” in Arthur No. 29 / May 2008 ] .
I got more email about that piece than anything I have written since a column threatening to defect from the Mac community back in the Quadra days .
Many readers thought I was hinting at something under the surface — a conspiracy , of sorts , to take money from the poor and give it to the rich .
It sounded to many like I was describing an economic system actually designed — planned — to redistribute income in the worst possible ways .
I guess I ’d have to agree with that premise .
Only it ’s not a secret conspiracy .
It ’s an overt one , and playing out in full view of anyone who has time ( time is money , after all ) to observe it .
The mortgage and credit crisis was n’t merely predictable ; it was predicted .
And not by a market bear or conspiracy theorist , but by the people and institutions responsible .
The record number of foreclosures , credit defaults , and , now , institutional collapses is not the result of the churn of random market forces , but rather a series of highly lobbied changes to law , highly promoted ideologies of wealth and home ownership , and monetary policies highly biased toward corporate greed .
It all started to make sense to me when I attended Learning Annex ’s Wealth Expo earlier this year — a seminar where teachers of The Secret , the hosts of Flip This House , George Foreman , Tony Robbins and former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan [ pictured above in banner from Learning Annex website ] purportedly taught the thousands in attendance how to take advantage of the current foreclosure boom .
Using language borrowed from today ’s more money - centric New Age spiritualists , as well as the get - rich - quick books of the early 1900s “ New Thought Movement ” on which these pyramid schemes are based ( such as Elizabeth Towne ’s The Science of Getting Rich or Napoleon Hill ’s Think and Grow Rich ) , they encouraged their mostly black audience to get on the ladder to success by purchasing educational DVDs and wealth - building “ systems . ”
These courses all promised to teach the properly motivated American how to find homeowners down on their luck and approaching foreclosure , as well as how to buy those homes from under them and resell them at a great profit .
What made the spectacle doubly outrageous were not the dancing girls or indoor fireworks ; it was the fact that most of the participants were themselves desperate former homeowners , whose illnesses , divorces , fires , and floods had put them in to foreclosure , too .
Get it ?
They were paying to learn how to feed on people just like themselves .
While most of the speakers and seminar leaders might be expected to show up at a Learning Center pyramid scheme convention , what the hell was Alan Greenspan doing there ?
First off , he was trying to make some money .
He had a new book out , and this was a good way to pitch it to a few thousand potential buyers at once .
On a deeper level , though , we can only assume he was there to pump some much - needed air into the collapsing real estate balloon .
These poor folks might just be dumb enough to try to borrow some money to purchase foreclosed properties from banks and other lenders that had themselves made disastrous investments during Greenspan ’s tenure .
His presence lent credibility to the current , lowbrow version of the same scam over which he presided as Fed Chair .
The whole show was a fitting metaphor for the credit crunch , a misnamed sabotage of the credit system by institutions with the problem of too much , not too little , money to put to work .
As I explained in my last column , banks and credit institutions simply had more money on hand than they had people who were qualified to borrow it .
So they changed the law to create more demand for the money they had in oversupply .
The banking industry lobbied to reduce the remaining regulations on its lending practices .
They won a repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act , a law enacted just after the depression as a way to prevent regular savings banks from doing risky things with depositors ’ money .
A “ Chinese Wall ” was put in place between banks and investment brokerages , preventing conflicts of interest and limiting financial institutions ’ power over both the lending and borrowing sides of the same transactions .
With the repeal of the Act in 1999 , banks were now free use their capital to lend money to unworthy borrowers , package those loans , and then underwrite the sale of those loans to other institutions — such as pension funds .
Meanwhile , the credit industry spent over $ 100 million lobbying to change bankruptcy laws .
Although a corporation in bankruptcy still has its debts erased , the regulations surrounding personal bankruptcy were changed so that personal debts stay on the books forever .
The logic they used to argue for the change was that debtors are smart , gaming the system to buy beyond their means and then declaring bankruptcy at the last minute .
But the very same creditors knew that just the opposite was true — as evidenced by their sales tactics and marketing campaigns .
They turned to a social science known as behavioral finance — the study of the way people consistently act against their own best financial interests , as well as how to exploit these psychological weaknesses when peddling questionable securities and products .
These are proven behaviors with industry - accepted names like “ money illusion bias , ” “ loss aversion theory , ” “ irrationality bias , ” and “ time discounting . ”
People do not borrow opportunistically , but irrationally .
As if looking at objects in the distance , they see future payments as smaller than ones in the present — even if they are actually larger .
They are more reluctant to lose a small amount of money than gain a larger one — no matter the probability of either in a particular transaction .
They do not consider the possibility of any unexpected negative event occurring between the day they purchase something and the day they will ultimately have to pay for it .
Credit card and mortgage promotions are worded to take advantage of these inaccurate perceptions and irrational behaviors .
“ Zero percent ” introductory fees effectively camouflage regular interest rates up to 20 or 30 percent .
Lowering minimum payment requirements from the standard 5 percent to 2 or 3 percent of the outstanding balance looks attractive to borrowers .
The corresponding increase in interest charges and additional years to pay off the debt will end up costing them more than triple the original balance .
It is irrational for them to make purchases and borrow money under these terms , or to prefer them to the original ones .
But they do .
We do .
This behavior is not limited to the trailer park renters of the rural south , but extends to the highly educated , highly leveraged co-op owners of the Northeast .
Combine this with George Bush ’s campaign to convince Americans that home ownership is a virtue — itself a revival of a strategy intended to assuage the resentment of veterans returning from World War II — and you end up with a population willing to do almost anything to “ get into ” a house , and a mortgage lending industry ready to provide the instruments capable of doing it .
Once the mortgage rates shifted and homeowners began to default , the people who created the mess were largely safe .
Bankers and high - salaried directors received their bonuses for a job well done , and the only people who lost money were the hapless shareholders — people like you and me — who might own some supposedly low - risk bank stocks .
And , of course , all the people who were holding mortgages bigger than the total value of their homes .
The fiction is that the money just “ vanished . ”
Financial newspapers and cable TV business channels say that the value of holdings has been “ erased ” by market downturns , but it has n’t been erased at all .
It ’s on the negative side of one balance sheet , and the positive side of someone else ’s .
While Goldman Sachs was underwriting mortgage - backed securities of dubious value , it was simultaneously selling them short .
Take the example of John Paulson , a trader who earned himself $ 4 billion and his funds another $ 15 billion in one year by betting against the housing market .
For help predicting the extent of the downturn , Paulson hired none other than Alan Greenspan as an advisor to his hedge fund .
The Fed Chairman who encouraged the housing bubble even after it began to crash is now cashing in on the very devastation his policies created .
The money did not disappear at all .
It merely changed hands .
People ’s homes were just a medium for the redistribution of wealth .
That ’s because the biggest industry in America — maybe the only real industry left — is credit itself : money is lent into existence by the central bank , and then lent again to regional banks , savings and loans , and eventually to you and me .
Each bank along the way takes its cut ; the final borrower is the only one who has to figure out how to pay it back , with interest , by the close of the contract .
The problem is , in order to pay back three or four dollars on every one dollar borrowed , someone else has to lose .
Our monetary system is itself a shell game , with losers built into the very rules .
The more the credit industry dominates our economy , the more losers there will inevitably be .
As anyone in any business at all well understands — even the editor of this magazine , I ’m sure — one has to borrow money to do almost anything real in this society .
Anything that requires a resource , a supply , an office , a piece of ground , transportation , also requires a bit of capital .
That capital has to be borrowed .
And if it ’s not coming from a friend or from mom or dad , it ’s being borrowed from an institution that borrowed from another institution that borrowed it , and so on , and so on .
Participation in business or , in most of our cases , land or home ownership , means helping put those wheels of the credit industry in motion .
And the more we push , the more momentum they gain , and the more influence they have over an increasingly large portion of our experience .
Reality becomes defined by credit sectors , and our time is consumed more each day with wondering how we ’re going to pay back what we ’ve borrowed .
Every once in a while , though , we break the rules and get to see the possibility for another kind of economy .
Whether it ’s an alternative currency , an open source software solution , or the simple good faith gifts we make to one another for creating value in each other ’s lives .
It ’s the way Arthur readers bailed out the magazine a few months ago , within a few hours of when creditors would have turned off the lights in the editor ’s apartment bedroom ( which doubles as the Arthur office ) .
Or the way Robert Anton Wilson ’s fans came to his rescue via Paypal to let the ailing writer die at home in his bed rather than a free city hospital ( thus saving the taxpayers a whole lot more money than we raised and spent ) .
Without getting spiritual or mushy , we can agree that there are self - perpetuating cycles of greed and generosity in which we can participate .
The more we commit to one or the other , the more of the world conforms to its rules .

comment : Firefox has been warning for several months ( today is 2019 - 08 - 25 ) that one of my servers is preferentially offering connections via TLS - 1.0 ( the lock icon is closed but is orange ) .
Chrome and IE11 each present a green lock icon .
Overview : comparing y2 k to y2k20
Y2 K ( in the year 2000 ) was a problem related to old technology ( both hardware and software ) where it was not certain if internal clocks would know how to handle these two problems : would clocks properly roll over from 1999 to 2000 or would they wrap back to 1900 ?
would the year 2000 be a leap year or not ?
( it was a leap year according to rule - 3 ) notice that these human - caused problems where caused by : a lack of coordination in the computer industry ( caused by companies competing with each other rather than working together ) businesses and governments refusing to upgrade egotistic programmers doing their own thing rather than calling the operating system
( in the year ) was a problem related to old technology ( both hardware and software ) where it was not certain if internal clocks would know how to handle these two problems : Y2k20 ( in the year 2020 ) is a potential problem where : security changes in client browsers ( which are usually auto - upgraded ) may not be able to communicate with web servers ( which are not auto - upgraded ) this is a client - server problem security changes in web servers ( depending upon how they are implemented ) may not accept connections from customers unwilling or unable to update this is a B2B ( business to business ) problem where third party software ( usually linked to older OpenSSL libraries ) is used to initiate a web connection .

Why is 2020 going to be a problem ?
y2 k was ( perhaps ) so overblown that many people assumed that a whole lot of money had been spent but nothing happened .
This assumption is faulty because the problem was largely averted

This assumption is faulty because the problem was largely averted y2k20 does not appear to be taken seriously by anyone back during Y2 K , not very many people relied on browsers twenty years later , almost everyone relies upon browsers for something email clients have gone the way of the dodo ( Microsoft will not allow you to install Windows Mail on a new Windows - 10 platform ) ; most companies tell you to read mail using a browser many people uses browsers for online banking ; online investing ; online purchases ; online entertainment ( eg. youtube ) programmers aside , anyone who used a terminal emulator back in 2000 will most likely be using a browser today .
to save money , many companies are not patching internal web - servers which are only accessed by internal employees on their internal intranets .
But their employees are still agreeing to upgrade their own browsers .
Kaboom !
does not appear to be taken seriously by anyone Do n't think this will affect you ?
An unexpected change to OpenSSL in CentOS - 7.3 on January of 2018 broke some things for me as I have documented here
Good News from Microsoft
There are a lot of desktops in the world still running Windows - 7 and those users were either unwilling or unable to upgrade to Windows - 10
Windows - 10 was rolled out with two browsers , IE11 ( Internet Explorer 11 ) and Microsoft Edge .
Customers were instructed to begin using the new browser but many refused
and .
Customers were instructed to begin using the new browser but many refused Microsoft Edge was not available on older platforms which left those Windows desktops exposed to security exploits ( appeared to be happening daily if not weekly )
was not available on older platforms which left those Windows desktops exposed to security exploits ( appeared to be happening daily if not weekly )
Since the customer adoption of Microsoft Edge was n't successful , in 2019 Microsoft decided to partner with Google by replacing Microsoft Edge with a newer variation called Microsoft Chrome Edge .
Google 's Chrome browser is based upon similar technology Microsoft Edge version numbers run from 12 to 18 ( EDGE - 12 to EDGE - 18 ) Microsoft Chrome Edge is currently at version 80 ( comment : Windows users should update to this browser ASAP )
.
This new variation was only available to WIndows - 10 users but it needed to be downloaded manually ( was never part of an automated patch kit ) .
This is still the case on 2020 - 04- 10
In 2020 - 02 - xx Microsoft announced that Microsoft Chrome Edge would be available to older platforms , including Windows - 7 , even though that OS is no longer officially supported by them ( Kudos to Microsoft for doing the right thing ) Download link for Chrome Edge ( Windows 7-10 ) : https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge
Microsoft announced that Microsoft Chrome Edge would be available to older platforms , including Windows - 7 , even though that OS is no longer officially supported by them ( Kudos to Microsoft for doing the right thing ) comment : we have got to convince people ( friends , family , employers , customers ) to abandon IE11 as soon as possible because it is holding back evolution of the internet .
IE11 is the only popular - use browser that does not properly implement HTML5 ( see : https://html5test.com/compare/browser/ie-11/firefox-60/chrome-68.html ) IE11 is the only popular - use browser that does not support JavaScript - 1.6 ( a.k.a. ECMAScript -6 or ECMAScript - 2015 ) see : https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_versions.asp
IE11 is the only popular - use browser that does not support Angular2 or higher ( see : https://angular.io/guide/browser-support )
IE11 is the only popular - use browser that does not support jQuery2 ( see : https://jquery.com/browser-support/ )
we have got to convince people ( friends , family , employers , customers ) to abandon IE11 as soon as possible because it is holding back evolution of the internet .

note : Firefox - 74 was supposed to be released in March without default support for legacy protocols " TLS 1.0 " and " TLS 1.1 " but COVID - 19 ( amongst other things ) changed that .

2020-08 - 20
Two different people told me today that a recent Windows - 10 update just killed their " Windows Live Mail " client .
( I have not seen anyone else on the internet crabbing about this - yet )
Like IE11 , Microsoft no longer supports the Windows Live Mail client ( IIRC , the last version came out in 2012 ; if it was on Window - 7 when you updated to Windows - 10 then you were allowed to keep it ; you were not allowed to install it onto a new version of Windows - 10 ) Non-Microsoft software , like Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome , had the SSL and TLS protocols built into their stand - alone programs .
Microsoft software ( at least the stuff published ten years ago and older ) relied heavily upon a large number of DLL files which were shared by many Microsoft applications in the Windows ecosystem .
SPECULATION : it is entirely possible that the latest Windows - 10 update deleted DLL files required by the " Windows Live Mail " client .
Those people will either need to get a third - party email reader ( here are two : thunderbird and emclient ) or sign up for an annual Microsoft subscription to Office 365 ( in this new marketing paradigm , software will be rented rather than purchased )
UTC ( Universal Time Coordinated )
Before the age of internet connectivity , most non-military computers were set to the local time of their operators .
When the local time zone would change between Standard Time and Daylight Savings Time , either the computer clock was changed on the fly ( on systems that allowed it ) , or it was changed during a reboot .
These two methods have short comings which became more apparent after computers were connected to the outside world for the following reasons :
many systems needed to be up 24/7 ( 24 hours a day , 7 days a week ) which morphed into 24/365 ( 24 hours a day , 365 days a year ) .
Think bank machines and air - line scheduling systems for example .
computer programs that needed to record elapsed time would have to compensate for the missing hour when measuring across the change boundary
possible problem scenario # 1 : Your computer is in location where the time zone changes between EST ( Eastern Standard Time ) and EDT ( Eastern Daylight - Savings Time )
You have a user in who creates a file ( with a time stamp ) at 1:45 AM EDT on the morning that the clock will fall back .
15 minutes later at 2:00 AM ( EDT ) you move the clock back to 1:00 AM ( EST ) by either changing it or rebooting .
Ten minutes later at 1:10 ( EDT ) local time , a second user connects to the system and updates the file in question .
This file now has a creation time stamp that is before the modification time stamp .
If the second user is smart enough not to mess around with the original file , then the second file will still have a creation date which is before the creation date of the first file
possible problem scenario # 2 : The same computer is on the Internet A technical support person FTPs a file from the client system in Canada to a support system in Germany , works on the file , then FTPs it back to Canada .
The Canadian system clock changes in between FTPs Which file is the new one ?
Are we sure that no German time stamps will end up on the Canadian system ?
As long as the files in questioned are never accessed by anyone but the German Tech support person , everything should be all right .
But , if another person becomes inadvertently involved , a real mess could ensue .
When properly implemented , file creation and modification dates are stamped in a UTC time format .
Also , the system clock no longer changes twice a year .
However , user processes are able to display a shifted " local clock " if desired .
NTP ( Network Time Protocol )
an NTP stratum # 1 source is a computer " running NTP software " and is receiving real time information from one of the following : an Atomic Clock a GPS ( Global Positioning System ) Radio receiver which derives it 's signal from at least 2 GPS satellites which then derive their clocks from a military source ( usually an Atomic Clock ) another ( peer ) stratum # 1 NTP server
" and is receiving real time information from one of the following : any other computer that is running NTP software will have three types of NTP connections , SERVER , PEER , or CLIENT .
any time a computer receives time information from any source , it must do at least 2 things : make up to 5 network transactions per query in order to compute the average transaction time ( distance ) between itself and it's next higher stratum source it must increment the stratum number so that connected computers are aware of the quality of the time ( a higher number means lower quality )

Daylight Savings Time ( this was a dumb idea )
DST History
All my life , people have told me that DST ( daylight savings time ) was created to help farmers .
Anyone who knows any farmers already knows that farmers ignore clocks so this has to be a myth .
In fact , the ( mostly ) farming province of Saskatchewan in Canada never adopted DST .
The truth of the matter is this : DST was popularized by Germany after World War
One where the use of DTS aided the German war efforts by extending the working length of the military day https://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/history.html
Now here 's a smart idea .
The European Parliament ( EU ) just voted to end daylight savings time in 2021
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/world/europe/daylight-savings-time-european-union.html
https://www.npr.org/2019/03/27/707179979/european-parliament-moves-toward-ending-daylight-saving-time
The main reason given was that Europe 's closest trading partners , China and Russia , do not shift their numerous number of time zones , and having Europe change its clocks twice annually was bad for business between all .
But as a computer programmer and system admin , I can tell you that not having your computer systems change their internal clocks is a huge advantage .
Solaris ( a flavor of Unix created by SUN Microsystems )
Solaris System Time Zone : is defined for your system in file " / etc / TIMEZONE " and must be one of the zones defined in directory " /usr / share/lib / zoneinfo " general notes : TIMEZONE can contain something like " TZ=Canada / Eastern " but " TZ=UTC " or " TZ=GMT " are better choices even if TIMEZONE contained something like " TZ=Canada / Eastern " the system clock does not actually change but " time displays " with the " date " command would contain the correct EST / EDT suffix .
Use the " date - u " command to see universal time
If you change this file then you 'll need to reboot because almost everything in Unix is cached by default
This file is not a script technical notes : many hardware clock chips ( BIOS ) do not know about time zones .
This means that most Unix systems will run a cron job at 2:01 everyday in March and October to execute the " rtc " command which will make sure the hardware clock contains the correct time zone interpretation .
If you do n't do this then the system might not have the correct time if rebooted .
This hack is not required when the system time is sent to a non-changing time zone like GMT or UTC .
( but be sure to read the next note ) many hardware clock chips ( BIOS ) are not accurate and may drift over time .
But in most cases the Unix system clocks have been synchronized to an atomic clock by NTP .
If your version of NTP does not update the hardware clock , then it is a good idea to run a cron job every day of every month which will run the " rtc " command
Solaris Process Time Zone : by default , all processes see the system time zone setting unless shell variable " TZ " is defined in a common login script called " /etc / profile " or an optional user login script called " .profile " either one of the scripts could set a local environmental variable called " TZ " which must be one of the time zones defined in directory " /usr / share/lib/zoneinfo "
Example Unix Commands :
Legend : sr = system response ur = user response
------------------------------------------- < sr> ( see your shell prompt ) < ur > date < sr > Wednesday January 24 07:34:11 EST
2007 ( see your prompt ) < ur > date -u < sr > Wednesday January 24 12:34:13 GMT
2007 your prompt
Update : 2020.04.03
Oracle acquired SUN Microsystems in 2010 which means the a lot of older platforms running SunOS and / or Solaris now needed to purchase annual support agreements for patches that used to be provided for free .
Our platforms were purchased with higher up - font fees ( so the patches were really not free ) but there was no way we were going to pay twice so a decision by head office to not purchase additional support .
I just noticed that one of our Solaris boxes ( Solaris - 8 ; just a sever with no users ) was not changing over to DST properly .
From what I can see , they were missing the DST rules assigned by the US Energy Policy Act of 2005 which went into effect in March of 2007 .
Since no one complained this was not something that needed to be fixed but I decided to do so anyway .
First off , the size of the time zone files under " /usr / share / lib/ zoneinfo " is much larger than they need to be so I decided to investigate the man pages .
Here you will learn that zdump is used to view the contents of the zone files and zic ( zone information compile ) is used to modify them
su - # this must be done from root cd /usr / share / lib / zoneinfo # navigate here zdump -v Canada / Eastern # see a detailed dump for the desired zone
" is much larger than they need to be so I decided to investigate the man pages .
Here you will learn that is used to view the contents of the zone files and ( zone information compile ) is used to modify them
It turns out that the zone files contain DST rules going back many decades before the UNIX epoch ( 1970.01.01 ) and that OS and C/C++ libraries call these files when doing date - time calculations .
If this is not a requirement for your system then it might be better to set your system clock to UTC then add this command to your system wide profile .
TZ=EST5EDT , M3.2.0 , M11.1.0 Caveat : any user still using a definition like this " TZ=Canada / Eastern " will not see the correct time .
Caveat : any user still using a definition like this " TZ=Canada / Eastern " will not see the correct time .
The ZIC command allows you to add new rules to individual zone files .
To fix my problem I added EDT for 2007 - 03 - xx and an EST rule for 2007 - 11 - xx but the procedure is dangerous ( unless you backup your zone files first ) so I am not going to document it here .
Best to leave this to your local friendly uber -nerd .
VAX / VMS System Time

TOY ( Time - Of - Year Clock )
Info derived from P.254 of :
Version 4.4 VAX / VMS Internals and Data Structures

TOY Clock Notes :
based upon a 32 bit unsigned register
the least significant bit represents a resolution of 10 milliseconds
initialized to 10000000 base 16 which represents 00:00:00.00 on January 1
if a booting system sees an empty register , it assumes that the TOY clock has lost power and ignores it
counts up , and only holds about 15 months of time ( 440 days ) so requires external information from a file
to prevent overflow the system must be either be rebooted
or the SYS$ SETIME system service must be invoked within the first 3 months of the new year from a privileged account e.g. the system manager needs to execute the DCL command $ SET TIME
What does this do aside from setting the time ?
It writes current date information to files read by the VMS system during boot .

TIMEKEEPING in VAX/VMS
Info derived from P.255-256 of :
Version 4.4 VAX / VMS Internals and Data Structures
( c ) 1988 by Digital Equipment Corporation .
If the test failed , then SYSINIT assumes that the clock lost power ( or had no battery backup ) and then prompts the operator
If the test passed , then SYSINIT runs EXE$ GQ_SYSTIME and uses the value of the Time - Of - Year ( TOY ) Clock as an offset ( in milliseconds ) from a value that is stored in the system image file ( SYS$ SYSTEM:SYS.EXE ) to determine the correct date and time .
This value is converted into a 64 bit number which represents the number of 100 nanosecond intervals that have elapsed since 00:00 on November 17 , 1858 ( the base time for the Smithsonian Institution astronomical calendar ) .
VMS now uses this internal 64 bit clock .
What 's up with " November 17 , 1858 " ?
PRODUCTS : OpenVMS VAX , All Versions OpenVMS Alpha , All Versions VAX VMS , All Versions COMPONENT : System Time SOURCE : Digital Equipment Corporation QUESTION :
Why is Wednesday , November 17 , 1858 the base time for OpenVMS ( VAX VMS ) ?
ANSWER : November 17 , 1858 is the base of the Modified Julian Day system .
The original Julian Day ( JD ) is used by astronomers and expressed in days since noon January 1 , 4713 B.C.
This measure of time was introduced by Joseph Scaliger in the 16th century .
It is named in honor of his father , Julius Caesar Scaliger ( note that this Julian Day is different from the Julian calendar named for the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar ! ) .
Why 4713 BC ?
Scaliger traced three time cycles and found that they were all in the first year of their cyle in 4713 B.C.
The three cycles are 15 , 19 , and 28 years long .
By multiplying these three numbers ( 15 * 19 * 28 = 7980 ) , he was able to represent any date from 4713 B.C. through 3267 A.D.
The starting year was before any historical event known to him .
In fact , the Jewish calendar marks the start of the world as 3761 B.C. Today his numbering scheme is still used by astronomers to avoid the difficulties of converting the months of different calendars in use during different eras .
So why 1858 ?
The Julian Day 2,400,000 just happens to be November 17 , 1858 .
The Modified Julian Day uses the following formula : MJD = JD - 2,400,000.5
The .5 changed when the day starts .
Astronomers had considered it more convenient to have their day start at noon so that nighttime observation times fall in the middle .
But they changed to conform to the commercial day .
The Modified Julian Day was adopted by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory ( SAO ) in 1957 for satellite tracking .
SAO started tracking satellites with an 8 K ( non-virtual ) 36 - bit IBM [ R ] 704 computer in 1957 , when Sputnik was launched .
The Julian day was 2,435,839 on January 1 , 1957 .
This is 11,225,377 in octal notation , which was too big to fit into an 18 - bit field ( half of the IBM standard 36 - bit word ) .
And , with only 8 K of memory , no one wanted to waste the 14 bits left over by keeping the Julian Day in its own 36 - bit word .
However , they also needed to track hours and minutes , for which 18 bits gave enough accuracy .
So , they decided to keep the number of days in the left 18 bits and the hours and minutes in the right 18 bits of a word .
Eighteen bits would allow the Modified Julian Day ( the SAO day ) to grow as large as 262,143 ( ( 2 ** 18 ) - 1 ) .
From Nov. 17 , 1858 , this allowed for seven centuries .
Using only 17 bits , the date could possibly grow only as large as 131,071 , but this still covers 3 centuries , as well as leaving the possibility of representing negative time .
The year 1858 preceded the oldest star catalog in use at SAO , which also avoided having to use negative time in any of the satellite tracking calculations .
This base time of Nov. 17 , 1858 has since been used by TOPS - 10 , TOPS - 20 , and VAX VMS and OpenVMS .
Given this base date , the 100 nanosecond granularity implemented within OpenVMS and the 63 - bit absolute time representation ( the sign bit must be clear ) , OpenVMS should have no trouble with time until : 31 - JUL - 31086 02:48:05.47
At this time , all clocks and time - keeping operations in OpenVMS will suddenly stop , as system time values go negative .
Note that the OpenVMS time display and manipulation routines allow for only 4 digits in the ' YEAR ' field .
We expect this to be corrected in a future release of OpenVMS sometime prior to 31 - DEC - 9999 .
Calendar Evolution ( how the Y2 K problem came to be )
Executive Summary During the time of Caesar Augustus , Roman astronomers thought the length of year was 365.25 days so instituted a leap year every four years
comment : Leap
Year seems to be a misnomer since that year is a little longer ( we did n't leap over anything ; we extended )
so instituted a leap year every four years Leap Year seems to be a misnomer since that year is a little longer ( we did n't leap over anything ; we extended )
The actual length of the year is 365.2425 days which means the primary leap year rule ( year is evenly divisible by 4 ) is wrong
comment : well , the Roman calendar was good enough for farmers and sailors but not for academics jump to : jump to : Gregorian Calendar

Nicaea - 325 AD
Rome - 523 AD ( years change from AUC to AD )
conveniently restarted near the birth of Christ
mathematical beauty
near the birth date of Jesus Christ
Superscripts :
The variation of the Metonic Cycle works like this : 19 years ( the Metonic Cycle )
4 years ( the Callipic Cycle helps to account for leap years )
7 days in a week ( Easter must fall on a Sunday )
532 years = 19 x 4 x 7
The beginning of this cycle falls on January 754 AUC which Dionysius renamed to 1 AD ( " anno domini " meaning " year of our Lord " ) .
According to the Gospel of Luke ( 3:1 & 3:23 ) Jesus was " about thirty years old " shortly after " the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar " .
Tiberius became emperor in AD 14 .
If you combine these numbers you reach a birth year for Jesus that is strikingly close to the beginning of our year reckoning .
This may have been the basis by Dionysius ' argument .
( on the flip side , the Gospel of Luke mentions a Roman Census which historical records say is the Census of Quirinius which occurred in 6/7 AD ) .
The Gospel of Matthew tells us that Jesus was born under the reign of king Herod the Great
Since Herod died in 4 BC .
It is likely that Jesus was actually born between 5 BC and 7 BC .
Today it is commonly believed that Dionysius made a mistake in determining the exact date of Christ 's birth but this was not his intention .
In 523 only pagans celebrated birthdays meaning that those Christians had no intention of celebrating Christ 's birth .
Rome - 1582 AD ( the calendar moves to ~ 365.2425 days )
Easter was originally linked to Passover , but in the year 325 AD at the council at Nicaea , it was decided that Easter would be celebrated on the first Sunday following the first full moon on , or after , the vernal equinox ( the passing from winter into spring ) .
In the year 325 , the vernal equinox was assumed to be fixed at March 21 .
Due to inaccuracies in the calendar , by the 16th century the vernal equinox was occurring on March 11 .
This caused problems for the church in Rome because most Christians outside of Rome were using the date " March 21 " to calculate the day of Easter rather than the " vernal equinox " event .
( sometimes bad weather combined with a lack of local astronomers made " the calendar option " the only choice ) .
This had the effect of pushing the day of Easter celebration closer to the summer months .
Pope Gregory XIII assigned the problem to a Jesuit astronomer named Christopher Schlussel ( a.k.a. Clavius ) who suggested that the Easter / equinox problem could be solved by removing 10 days from the current year ( shifting the vernal equinox back to March 21 ) but from that time forward the Christian world should adopt the idea proposed by Aloysius Lilius .
The plan was approved by Pope Gregory approved the plan in 1582 and decreed that October 4 was followed by October 15 .
The peasants revolted thinking that their lives had been shortened by that much .
The new calendar was named the Gregorian Calendar after the pope who approved the changes .
This so - called " continental calendar " was n't adopted by England , or its colonies including America , until 1752 .
At that time , 11 days needed to be removed .
( 10 for the original correction , 1 for the century following )
Facts :
The Earth requires 365.2425 mean solar days ( averaged over 4 years ) for one revolution around the sun , not 365.25 as is commonly believed
This difference translates into ~ 648 seconds per year which needed to be removed to correct for Easter as defined in 325 AD Computations :

Computer Calendar Bugs
Year 2000 Problem ( a.k.a. the Y2K Problem )
Part 1 : Short Field Storage ( a.k.a. lazy programming )
God hits the RESET button .
( but the problem was caused by man )
When dealing with dates , many programmers decided to only code for , and store , the least two significant digits of the year .
This started with early mainframe programmers ( 1950s - 1970s ) who only had 80 columns of storage on each punched card .
This tradition was continued on minicomputers ( 1970s - 1980s ) and PCs because memory and storage were still very expensive .
There is no need to do this now .
True Fact :
In 1989 a woman in who was born in 1884 was placed on a Kindergarten enrollment list because her 2 - digit birthday ( 89 ) indicated that she was 5 years old .
Now imagine the problems on January 1 , 2000 when automated programs ...
decide to purge seemingly stale records decide to compute negative interest values decide to lock - out seemingly expired credit cards ?
Although most currently supported operating system software has been fixed , much application software , and firmware associated with old harware , are still broken .
Unsupported software ( like MS - DOS ) and obsolete firmware ( like PC BIOS before 1995 ) will probably never be fixed .
Furthermore , application software that makes direct BIOS calls to check the date instead of calling a similar routine in the operating system is at great risk since the application software will only fail on certain platforms .
If ( for productivity reasons ) your users only enter 2 digit years , programmers should translate these dates to 4 digits for storage .
Failure to do this means this problem will be back in the year 2100 .
Part 2 : Is 2000 AD a Leap Year ?
( Yes )
Leap Year
Rules Rule Name
( Informal ) Description Remark 1 divide by 4
If a year is evenly divisible by 004 , then that year is a leap year .
Using this rule , 2000 AD is a leap year .
Everyone knows this rule 2 divide by 100
If a year is evenly divisible by 100 , then that year is not a leap year .
Using this rule , 2000 AD is not a leap year .
Many people seem to
know this exception 3 divide by 400
If a year is evenly divisible by 400 , then that year is a leap year .
Using this rule , 2000 AD is a leap year ( which is true ) .
Few people seem to know this
exception to the exception 4 divide by 4000
If a year is evenly divisible by 4000 , then that year is not a leap year Proposed
Y2004 Problem
http://news.com.com/2100-7355-5129875.html
( Software glitch in 2004 brings Y2 K déjà vu )
Y2010 Problem
It 's only 10 years since Y2 K and some bozo programmers did n't learn the lesson .
Now we 've got problems with portable devices running WindowsCE along with other stuff .
Y2038 Problem ( and Y2106 Problem )
If the 32 - bit clock location was treated as a signed integer , then there are only ( 2^31 = 2,147,483,648 seconds ) ~ 68.051 years of range before we overflow .
1970 + 68 = 2038 .
BTW , the exact rollover date is : 3:14:08 AM ( GMT ) on January 19 , 2038 caveat : some older user software depends upon the fact that negative numbers can be used to represent a limited number of dates before the Unix epoch .
This stuff must be renovated ASAP
If the 32 - bit clock location was treated as an unsigned integer , then there are only ( 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 seconds ) ~ 136.103 years of range before we overflow .
1970 + 136 = 2106 .
I am convinced that " C " libraries and related OS calls will be modified to either 32 - bit unsigned or 64 - bit before 2038 .
According to this article , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem
Linux already has fixed this problem which is probably one reason why Linux is found in the datacenters of most banks and insurance companies .
I wonder how much embedded " C " software will still be working in bank machines , credit card readers , and PC BIOS firmware ?
Y4K Problem ?
Never take chances .
Always call operating system routines rather than doing the date calculations yourself .
The operating system software designers have consulting astronomers on staff to assist in this sort of thing .
They will almost always do a better job of this stuff than the little guy .
BIOS routines are written in firmware .
Operating Systems are written in software .
Since the BIOS routines may be broken but the operating system may be fixed , never call the BIOS directly , Always call the operating system routines .

Date / Time Stamps ( and displays )
1. the most significant field ( year ) appears first while the least significant field ( day ) appears last .
Similar to the odometer in your car .
2 . By removing any slashes , everyone will automatically know which time format is being used .
The lack of slashes will also allow the string to be used in computer file names .
Some computer file systems ( Unix ) will allow more than one period in the file name .
3 . Leading zeros must always be used to pad fields ( e.g. month must be 05 not just 5 )

13 Month Calendar ?
7 days * 4 weeks = 28 days per month 28 days * 13 months = 364 days per year
With a standard 28 days per month it would be easier for businesses and governments to do monthly economic forecasts .
Since western workers usually skip between 2 - 4 work days near the end of December ( Christmas , Boxing Day , etc. ) , this month would be the best candidate to extend by one or two days .
The 13 month calendar would be better for anyone paid once or twice monthly .
DST07 ( Daylight Savings Time 2007 )
Java Libraries
C/C++ Libraries
Oracle Database
Some Messaging Systems with links into PDAs like the Blackberry
Some Application Software ( containing baked - in DST code )
To add insult to injury , since those Y2 K days many North American computer professionals have been let go and their jobs have been outsourced to India where people do n't observe DST because they live so close to the equator .
Oh well , just another mess linked to the effects of extreme market capitalism .
DST07 and UNIX
To the best of my knowledge , no RTC ( real time clock ) chips save the time zone .
This means that just after a computer 's local time has changed , a BIOS call must be made to save the new time to the RTC chip .
Failure to do this means that a rebooted computer may come up with the wrong time .
For the past 20 years most UNIX systems updated the RTC from root 's crontab by calling /usr / sbin /rtc every morning in APRIL and OCTOBER like so .
% crontab -l # #
This is root 's crontab #
The rtc command is run to adjust the real time clock if and when daylight savings time changes .
# 10 3 * * 0,4 /etc/cron.d/logchecker
10 3 * * 0 /usr/lib/newsyslog 15 3 * * 0 /usr/lib/fs/nfs/nfsfind # run task every day in April at 3:01 AM 1 3 * 4 * [ -x /usr / sbin/rtc ] && /usr/sbin/rtc -c > / dev/null 2>&1 # run task every day in October at 2:01 AM 1 2 * 10 * [ -x /usr / sbin/rtc ] && /usr/sbin/rtc -c > /dev/null 2>&1 %
To fix your system you 'll need to implement one of the following two suggestions .
If you do n't know how to make these changes then you 'll need to contact your local UNIX guru .
# # The two red lines above could be replaced with the following ( suggestion # 1 - preferred ) # # run task every day at 3:01 AM 1 3 * * * [ -x /usr / sbin/rtc ] && /usr/sbin/rtc -c > /dev/null 2>&1
# # The two yellow lines above could be replaced with the following ( suggestion # 2 - alternate ) # # run task every day in March + April at 3:01 1 3 * 3,4 * [ -x /usr / sbin/rtc ] && /usr/sbin/rtc -c > / dev/null 2>&1 # run task every day in October +
November at 2:01 1 2 * 10,11 * [ -x /usr / sbin/rtc ] && /usr/sbin/rtc -c > /dev/null 2>&1
You should to stick with database support
A good way to avoid future date - time problems is to stick with products with built - in support .
For example , there a datetime object built into most databases .
Look at these two examples from MySQL + MariaDB .
The second example is a hack to magically return the data in ISO - 8601 format
MariaDB [ ( none ) ] > select now ( ) ; +---------------------+ | now ( ) |

If your car ’s sunroof lived up to its name it could be doing a whole lot more for you .
That ’s the idea Sunrise Solar has with its new Solar Roof , a set of photovoltaic cells integrated into a car ’s sunroof .
By swapping out the boring tinted glass and putting in a solar - powered replacement , your car could charge its batteries and power the AC to keep your car cool .
Details on the San Antonio , Texas - based company ’s roof design and intended customers are scant .
Is this an after - market item for DIYers to add to their cars or something aimed at automotive OEMs ?
Sunrise Solar has n’t responded to multiple requests for comment .
The company , which is traded on the over - the - counter market , says it also intends to sell a number of consumer - facing solar products , including panels , a cell - phone charger and solar - powered light - up bricks .
We know some vehicle manufacturers are already thinking about putting solar panels on the roofs of their next - gen vehicles .
Japanese newspaper Nikkei and Reuters have both reported that the 2010 Prius would sport solar panels that would help power the air conditioning system .
Electric car startup Fisker Automotive also intends to use a solar roof to run a cooling system .
Fisker , through its powertrain maker and investor Quantum , is having Asola design its roof ; the company says solar roofs will be on the first Karmas , due out at the end of the 2009 .
However , a solar roof does not a solar - powered car make .
The trickle charge coming off of the several square feet of PV cells would be enough to keep some ventilation fans going , but they would n’t be able to fully recharge your car ’s battery over the course of a day .
But it would be nice to find your car comfortably cool after a day of baking in a sunny parking lot .

Paraguay 's president says he turned down offer to meet Palin Steve Clemons
Published : Friday September 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Apparently not everyone wants to have their photograph taken with Sarah Palin .
Paraguay President Fernando Lugo , while attending both the UN General Assembly meetings and the Clinton Global Initiative , shared with friends over dinner some of the other meetings he had been having in New York .
After enumerating the various heads of state he'd met with , the room went silent and then laughed a bit when he confided that he was approached about meeting with GOP Vice Presidential candidate and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin .
President Lugo said he turned the meeting down .
The 57 - year - old left - leaning former Catholic bishop known locally as " bishop of the poor , " was elected to office in April .
His swearing in marked the first time in Paraguay 's history since the country gained independence that an opposition party turned over power peacefully to a candidate elected from the other party .
Lugo has also refused his presidential salary , saying it " belongs to more humble people . "
He joined the priesthood in 1977 and was ordained a bishop in 1994 before resigning in 2006 to run for office .

Authorities probing into truck load of steel boxes unloaded into hotel in secret by marines
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Wednesday , Sept 24 , 2008
Pakistani authorities investigating last Saturday ’s huge bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad are looking into evidence that US marines were occupying two floors just days prior to the blast and were witnessed unloading a truckload of steel cases inside .
“ The authorities want to ascertain if it was a routine exercise or part of some special mission that does not have the approval of the government of Pakistan , ” Pakistan ’s largest newspaper The News reported .
The reports of the mysterious activity first surfaced in the Pakistani media on Sunday .
According to the accounts , several witnesses , including Pakistani government officials , described seeing a US embassy truckload of steel boxes unloaded while all entrances to and from the hotel were locked down at around midnight on the 16th September .
The cases were not taken through security scanners in the hotel ’s lobby , but were shifted directly to the fourth and fifth floors , the same floors that fire broke out on after the truck bombing on Saturday .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Already , the government has got information that several rooms on the fourth floor of the Marriott were in permanent use of the US authorities .
Three of these rooms were said to be inter-connected and contained some intelligence equipment and other material allegedly used for espionage , ” The News also reported .
The reports have also been picked up in the press in Saudi Arabia and Qatar .
( Article continues below )
A US embassy statement said that the marines were a routine team of support personnel that often precede and / or accompany certain US government officials , and that the cases contained communication equipment .
Further rumours that several senior officers of the CIA were staying at the hotel at the time of the attack were also strenuously denied by the US embassy statement as “ inaccurate , irresponsible , baseless and completely without any foundation whatsoever . ”
“ Al Qaeda ” was quickly portioned with the blame once more just hours after the dust had settled , while the Taliban have also been touted as suspects .
Meanwhile new claims have surfaced linking the bombing to an Islamic fundamentalist group based in Iran .
In our leading article earlier this week which has since been picked up by the Pakistan Daily , we detailed how Pakistan ’s new leadership were due to dine at the hotel , but changed the venue at the last minute , according to a senior government official .
This raises the question , whether it be “ Al Qaeda ” , the Taliban or some other group of anti-American “ terrorists ” , why would they want to decapitate the new anti-US administration of Pakistan ?

Scripts were written to reassure the public the BBC was " still there " A script written by the BBC and the government to be broadcast in the event of a nuclear attack has been published .
The script , written in the 1970s and released by the National Archives , included instructions to " stay calm and stay in your own homes " .
It said communications had been disrupted , and the number of casualties and extent of damage were not known .
Other papers reveal debates about how to ensure the person reading the script was authoritative and comforting .
The script was discussed from 1973 to 1975 , during the Cold War . ' Voice of the BBC '
It was released along with letters between government departments and BBC executives .
The BBC had previously made some of the documents public under the Freedom of Information Act , but this is the first time they have been made widely available .

In a letter from June 1974 , Harold Greenwood from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications discussed who should read the announcement to give it an authoritative and comforting tone .
" During the Second World War we came to recognise the voices of Stuart Hibberd , Alvar Lidell and other main news readers , " he wrote .
" I would expect that in the period of crisis preceding an attack a similar association of particular voices with the authoritative ' voice of the BBC ' would develop . "
Mr Greenwood said recorded announcements by an unfamiliar voice would not reassure listeners .
" Indeed , if an unfamiliar voice repeats the same announcement hour after hour for 12 hours , listeners may begin to suspect that they are listening to a machine set to switch on every hour ... and that perhaps after all the BBC has been obliterated , " he said .
Adding in live local commentary would reassure listeners they were not listening to a cassette recorder , the Cabinet Office said .
' Conserve water '
The script said : " This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons .
Communications have been severely disrupted , and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known . "
It instructed the public to turn off fuel supplies , ration food to last 14 days , and conserve water - with a warning not to waste it by flushing the lavatory .

There was nothing to be gained by trying to get away , it warned .
" By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourselves to greater danger .
If you leave , you may find yourself without food , without water , without accommodation and without protection . "
Those in a radioactive fall - out area were told to wait in a fall - out room until a siren sounded or the " all clear " message was given over the airwaves .
The announcement was intended to be repeated every couple of hours .
It has previously been revealed the BBC stockpiled entertainment programmes to boost public morale in the event of a war .
In the event of a nuclear attack , staff were told to stay in hiding for 14 days , when it would be safe to leave .

What are these ?
Via Playbook , a brutal side - by - side yesterday in New Mexico :
Crowd for Senator Obama in Albuquerque , N.M. , last night : 35,000 inside the venue and another 10,000 - 15,000 outside .
Crowd for Senator McCain in Albuquerque , N.M. , yesterday : 1,400 according to the McCain campaign , 1,000 or less according to reporters .
What 's interesting here is how , as Election Day nears , enthusiasm for McCain as judged by crowd size is seeming to wane .
He had more than five times this number in the same city the weekend after the GOP convention .
Yes , that was with Palin in tow and , yes , that was immediately after a convention that energized the base of the party and sparked interest among independents .
But , 10 days out from Election Day , McCain should be able to at least approach the crowd he had in September .

Clark Sorensen , famed floral urinal designer , has apparently gone political !
He 's made a Presidential Urinal , the likeness of George W. himself !
Sorensen , who will have a sneak pee-view of George at his San Francisco studio on election night , says he designed the Presidential Toilet so that he could express his appreciation for the last eight years .
Visitors to his studio on election eve will be encouraged to give the urinal what it deserves -- " A Good Flush ! "
Following the sneak pee-k at his studio , Sorensen will have a one - man show entitled " Down The Drain - The Legacy of George W. Bush . " at Ruby 's Clay Studio and Gallery in San Francisco .
The show will run from January 17 to February 16 , 2009 .
For more information , visit ClarkMade .
If you would like to attend the sneak pee-k , get a reservation by emailing him at clark@clarkmade.com .

The Final 100 Days of the Bush Presidency
This Blog will chronicle the final 100 days of the Bush Presidency .
After 7 years and 265 days in office the Bush Legacy is all but complete .
The question is will he use his final days in office to repair any of the damage he has caused , or will it be more of the same ?
In his new book to be released next week , Van Jones lays out a sensible roadmap to solve our long - term economic problems .
How ?
By making sustainability the centerpiece of a national renewal .
And , if we justify spending hundreds of billions on an economic solution no one completely understands , why ca n’t we make it an even greater priority to create a sustainable economy that will last us the next thousand years or more ?
Let me start with the obvious : these are some wild times .
Since this whole financial mess began to unfold , we ’ve learned a lot about what ’s possible .
Although I knew how much we ’ve borrowed to pay for the Iraq war , I never really understood that we could just up and borrow upwards of a trillion dollars in one fell swoop .
Ever since I became aware of the possibility , I ’ve been telling people that Obama should hit back .
“ $ 700B ?
Why not borrow a trillion and solve our energy dependence , and fix health care to boot ? ”
Of course , that was before the bailout bill failed in the House .
[ social_buttons ]
As we face the potential for a new depression , along with the potential stresses caused by global climate change , possibly the greatest immediate need we have is for people to show us Americans the difference between what we know the present looks like and what we know is possible .
Faced with a national hopelessness during the ( first ? )
Great Depression , FDR was masterful at connecting our greatest problems to our greatest opportunities in speeches like his 1933 inaugural address :
Our greatest primary task is to put people to work .
This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously .
It can be accompanied in part by direct recruiting by the government itself , treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war , but at the same time , through this employment , accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our national resources .
Barack Obama has been almost FDR - like at inspiring people to believe at a gut level that in the face of a new depression , a national renewal is possible .
However , it ’s people on the ground like Van Jones who light the way for exactly how it could happen .
Which is why I ’m advocating a campaign to draft Jones into the ( hopefully ) coming Obama Cabinet , ideally as the new “ Secretary of Prosperity . ”
Hillary Clinton proposed a ‘ Poverty Czar ’ earlier this year , but I think that ’s terrible framing ; someone in that position should be creating solutions , not ruling over problems .
Ever since I ’ve talked about the potential to draft someone like Jones into a bold new position , people have told me that a Secretary of Prosperity could never happen .
My response ?
Who cares ?
Just adding Van ’s perspective to the conversation about the need to take bold leadership of the great problems of our time would be a great accomplishment .
Over the last couple years , I ’ve watched Jones relentlessly turn years of experience pursuing social justice and shared prosperity into a credible case for the win - win - win green collar economy of the future .
I ’m a huge fan of solving problems that occur in patterns by addressing their underlying roots , and that ’s what his ‘ green collar ’ approach does .
Let ’s look at the variables .
We have a society with quickening energy and economic insecurity , and flagging international leadership .
We have inner cities and rural communities in need of jobs .
We have a capital base in need of sustainable returns .
And we do n’t take no for an answer when we rally around a national imperative .
All we need is for someone to take the lead and inspire us to connect the dots .
The “ Green Collar Economy ” may sound like a grandiose , unachievable vision , especially in a financial situation where capital for any purpose is and will be increasingly hard to come by .
But Jones knows how to put these issues in perspective :
There ’s no way to get changes big enough to solve these problems without creating pathways out of poverty for millions of new green - collar workers .
The renewable economy is more labor - intensive , less capital - intensive ; therefore , there should be a net increase in jobs ( 1 ) .
BONUS CHALLENGE
Jones ’ new book is a start , but I ’d also like to issue an open challenge to Netizens to start a grassroots campaign to ‘ Draft Van . ’
I will give the DraftVan.org domain to anyone who wants to take the project on , and have started a Facebook group for people who might be interested to congregate and brainstorm .
Do America a favor and get this post out there as widely as possible in the hopes that someone who ’s looking for a way to make a difference will take up my challenge .
Let ’s bring the renewable economy into the national conversation .
Trust me , most people do n’t even realize that it ’s possible .

From Stephanopoulos at ABC :
The McCain campaign is definitely demoralized right now .
The blame game has begun .
There is no question that there is a rift between Sarah Palin ’s camp and that of John McCain inside the Republican campaign , sources tell ABC News .
And you are seeing people within the McCain campaign starting to look to the future .
Not only Palin , but many of the McCain staffers , as well , are circulating their resumes and pointing the finger .
Whenever people in the campaign are starting to worry more about their own reputations rather than whether they ’re going to win in seven days , there is a significant problem .
Mandriva and Turbolinux Join Moblin , Create Manbo Labs
by Ostatic Staff - Oct. 20 , 2008
A press release issued by Mandriva and Turbolinux today announced they are joining the Moblin project and continuing their collaboration through Manbo Labs .
Manbo Labs employs Mandriva and Turbolinux engineers to develop the core components of a Linux distribution tailored for Atom processors .
What 's particularly interesting about this announcement is once the Manbo engineers create these core components , they are delivered to the two sponsoring projects for further development , add - ons , and customizations .
Mandriva and Turbolinux have hinted that more partnerships in Manbo Labs are on the horizon .
Mandriva has a strong presence in the European open source market , and Turbolinux is the leading Linux vendor in the Chinese and Japanese language markets .
These companies working together in the mobile / Atom - powered processor market is not only signficant because of the engineering and development services they can offer , but also due to the vast userbase they have already -- and can potentially reach .
Though the press release specifically mentions the Atom - based netbook market , Manbo Labs is looking at other areas of mobile computing , such as in -vehicle information / entertainment markets , as expansion possibilities .
Economics may not be the favorite subject of most techies , but it is an important one .
Especially after the up - and - down series of events that have transpired in the markets this week .
Two of the last four independent investment banks are gone .
The world 's largest insurer is now a government entity .
The stock market has simultaneously suffered its largest one - day loss and its largest one - day gain in the last six years .
Not even the tech industry is immune to the insanity that has occurred this week .
Here are just a few of the effects the Wall Street meltdown will have on the tech industry :
1 ) A loss of large technology buyers
Businessweek 's Heather Green outlines it simply enough .
Some of the biggest spenders of technology are financial institutions .
Blackberries , servers , software .
They will all take a hit without Lehman and Merrill Lynch buying technology and the possible acquisitions of
Washington Mutual and Morgan Stanley .
With the financial firms consolidating and shrinking , there will simply be less buyers available for software , computers , web services , servers , and mobile phones .
And make no mistake - the effect will be felt throughout the technology industry .
2 ) Money 's going to be tighter at the big tech companies
A huge chunk of hardware and software purchased from companies like Dell , IBM , and Microsoft comes from loans .
Essentially , they loan companies the money needed to buy their products .
Now with financial companies cash - strapped , these loans have only increased .
The Dells and HPs of the industry run a huge risk of their purchasers defaulting on their loans .
This is no small matter .
These loans add up to be billions of dollars each year .
Whether or not companies should take on this risk during a credit crunch is n't the only issue .
The pinch companies will feel in defaults and increased loans will likely eat into budgets , share prices , and salaries .
3 ) Tech companies will have fewer underwriters for their IPOs
Issue : IPOs are complex events that require investment banks to underwrite the process .
Problem :
We 've lost two investment banks in the last week with another in jeopardy .
The first thing most companies do when they want to go public is hire an investment bank .
Now the number of options available has dropped significantly .
Lehman Brothers was a major underwriter of IPOs before its collapse .
Companies with Lehman Brothers now are probably scrambling to figure out their options .
When all is said and done , Goldman Sachs is likely to be the only independent investment bank left standing .
That 's quite a difference from a year ago , and that ( along with the bear market ) will hurt the number of IPOs that occur and change the players involved .
4 ) A weaker merger , acquisition , and IPO market
The market for technology start - ups to be acquired was already weaker than a year ago .
With investors having the jitters , credit tightening , and cash becoming more scarce , the future of the M&A and IPO market is uncertain .
I can't predict what will happen overall - my guess is that cash - rich companies such as Google will be able to buy companies at a premium - but what is certain is that the numbers show that the number of mergers , acquisitions , and IPOs in the technology sector has dropped in the last year .
It will probably not recover until the market itself recovers .
5 ) It 's cheaper to start a tech start - up , so expect more of them
You did n't think it was all bad , did you ?
As housing prices and property values plummet , rent drops as well .
Great talent is also readily available as they no longer have skyrocketing stock options to entice them to stay .
Bear markets are a time when many people take the risk of starting their own company .
Start - ups are the fuel that drive the tech industry .
Like I said , it 's not all bad .
6 ) Tech Shares are in for a bumpy ride
As the market continues to correct itself and financial firms grow and collapse , tech stocks are going to ride the ups and downs .
Apple shed nearly 20 % of its market value before its stock bounced back .
That type of volatility happens in the markets , but usually not in the span of four days .
If you 're a shareholder or if you 're an employee with options at a tech company , brace yourself for several rounds of extreme price fluctuation .
It 's important to know what 's going on in the markets , especially if you have investments .
Markets are self - healing entities that find a way to get back on their feet .
It 's important not to panic when markets go down .
However , given the events of the last week , being apprehensive may simply be smart economics .
Yesterday I wrote about the Wedge strategy of the intelligent design ( ID ) movement – namely to undermine and replace the materialist basis of modern science with something that conforms to their ideological spiritual beliefs .
This anti-materialist agenda has been primarily targeted against evolution , but now seems to be shifting its attention to neuroscience .
An Unholy Alliance
The Wedge strategy of the Discovery Institute ( DI ) and other ID proponents is largely a Christian movement .
It is interesting that they have found common ground with others who have a very different ideology but share in common a distaste for strict materialism because it is inconvenient to their spiritual agenda .
For example , the New Scientist article discussing this topic quotes Jeffrey Schwartz as saying :
“ YOU cannot overestimate how threatened the scientific establishment is by the fact that it now looks like the materialist paradigm is genuinely breaking down .
You ’re gonna hear a lot in the next calendar year about … how Darwin ’s explanation of how human intelligence arose is the only scientific way of doing it …
I ’m asking us as a world community to go out there and tell the scientific establishment , enough is enough !
Materialism needs to start fading away and non-materialist causation needs to be understood as part of natural reality . ”
Jeffrey Schwartz is a psychiatrist and a fellow of the International Society for Complexity , Information and Design ( ISCID ) , which is an ID think tank and also has as fellows prominent IDers Michael Behe and William Dembski .
Schwartz , however , also relates that his dualist epiphany came from his study of Buddhism – an ideology incompatible with Christianity .
The Buddhist connection perhaps explains Schwartz ’s predilection for abusing quantum mechanics to “ justify ” his claims for dualism .
Eastern spiritual philosophies have taken a liking to quantum mechanics , or at least to twisting this scientific theory so that it seems to support some Eastern notions .
This puts Schwartz in the same camp as Deepak Chopra and his “ quantum healing ” popular nonsense , although Chopra is a far less serious intellectual than Schwartz .
Another Buddhist and quantum mechanics abuser is B. Allan Wallace ( see here for my discussion of Wallace and why the quantum mechanical arguments for dualism are fatally flawed . )
A third faction in the anti-materialist camp are the purveyors of New Age mysticism and pseudoscience .
This camp , while distinct , has some overlap with the Buddhists , but is largely incompatible with Christian creationists .
An example of this philosophy is Rustom Roy , who began his career ( like Schwartz ) as a legitimate scientist , but has recently been spending his time supporting demonstrably absurd notions like homeopathy with “ water memory ” pseudoscience .
During a debate on homeopathy which I attended with Roy , he declared that “ the materialist paradigm is dead . ”
At the time he justified that bold statement by referencing the abilities of John of God – a charlatan faith healer who had apparently bamboozled Roy with his slight of hand .
Materialism
With all this discussion of materialism I guess I should define it .
Put simply , it is the philosophical position that all physical effects have physical causes .
There are no non-physical or non-material causes of physical effects .
Historically materialism has been defined as the philosophical belief that matter is all there is – the only type of substance that can be said to exist in nature .
Materialism stands specifically in opposition to dualism and other philosophies that posit a spiritual or non-material aspect of existence .
Any viable modern definition of materialism , however , must also include energy , forces , space - time – and anything else discovered by science to exist in nature .
In this way materialism is really just a manifestation of naturalism – the philosophy that says that nature ( in all of its aspects ) is all that there is – there is nothing supernatural .
In fact , the term materialism as broadly defined does not have much applicability today .
We know that there is more to the universe than ordinary matter , and if you include everything in nature in your philosophy then you have naturalism .
Materialism is mostly used in its narrow sense as it applies specifically to consciousness ( that consciousness is what the brain does ) and stands in opposition to dualism ( the belief that consciousness is a non-physical thing unto itself ) .
Therefore , the broader “ anti-materialist ” movement of ID , dualism , and various healing pseudosciences is more accurately defined as anti-naturalism .
But I guess for propaganda purposes it is better to be against “ materialism ” than against nature .
The real debate is whether or not science is required to follow methodological naturalism ( which it clearly does ) .
Philosophical naturalism is the metaphysical belief that nature is all there is .
Methodological naturalism is proceeding as if nature is all there is while remaining agnostic toward the deeper metaphysical question .
Another way of looking at it is that methodological naturalism posits that nature is all the we can know , regardless of whether or not it is all that there is ( which by definition we cannot know ) .
Does science require methodological naturalism ?
Yes .
This is the real debate going on between mainstream science and various ideological groups who wish to promote a non-naturalist belief system .
But this philosophical fight was fought in centuries past – and the naturalists won .
The fight is over .
But the anti-materialists ( really anti-naturalists ) want to resurrect this fight , and since they cannot win it in the arena of science they want to fight it in the arena of public opinion and then the legal and academic realms .
Science is dependent upon methodological naturalism because a necessary feature of any scientific hypothesis is that it is testable .
Non-natural causes are by definition non-falsifiable , and therefore scientific methods cannot act upon them .
It is like the now famous cartoon of the mathematician writing out a very complex equation , but in one part simply writes “ and then a miracle happens . ”
His colleague points out that , “ I think you need to be a little more explicit in this section . ” ( I may be paraphrasing . )
Science cannot say , “ and then a miracle happens . ”
There is no way to do an experiment or make an observation that can test a miracle .
Miracles , by definition , defy natural forces or explanations .
They cannot be constrained , which is a necessary feature of any hypothesis that can be falsified .
ID had this very problem .
The notion of an intelligent designer that created life by top - down fiat is not falsifiable because proponents can always argue ( and do ) that whatever we find in nature was what the designer intended – no matter what it is .
The designer is not constrained in any way – not by the laws of physics nor by human logic .
To be clear – science does not say , and cannot say , that all life on earth was not created in an instant by an all powerful designer .
It is agnostic towards such a belief .
It can only say that such a hypothesis is outside the realm of science because it cannot be tested scientifically .
That is methodological naturalism .
As evidence that this is the real issue at stake here is the Kitzmiller v Dover trial involving the teaching of ID in public science classes .
Here is a long excerpt from the decision , which makes it clear .
NAS is in agreement that science is limited to empirical , observable and ultimately testable data : “ Science is a particular way of knowing about the world .
In science , explanations are restricted to those that can be inferred from the confirmable data – the results obtained through observations and experiments that can be substantiated by other scientists .
Anything that can be observed or measured is amenable to scientific investigation .
Explanations that cannot be based upon empirical evidence are not part of science . ” ( P - 649 at 27 ) .
This rigorous attachment to “ natural ” explanations is an essential attribute to science by definition and by convention .
( 1:63 ( Miller ) ; 5:29 - 31 ( Pennock ) ) .
We are in agreement with Plaintiffs ’ lead expert Dr. Miller , that from a practical perspective , attributing unsolved problems about nature to causes and forces that lie outside the natural world is a “ science stopper . ” ( 3:14 - 15 ( Miller ) ) .
As Dr. Miller explained , once you attribute a cause to an untestable supernatural force , a proposition that cannot be disproven , there is no reason to continue seeking natural explanations as we have our answer .
Id .
ID is predicated on supernatural causation , as we previously explained and as various expert testimony revealed .
( 17:96 ( Padian ) ; 2:35 - 36 ( Miller ) ; 14:62 ( Alters ) ) .
ID takes a natural phenomenon and , instead of accepting or seeking a natural explanation , argues that the explanation is supernatural .
( 5:107 ( Pennock ) ) .
Further support for the conclusion that ID is predicated on supernatural causation is found in the ID reference book to which ninth grade biology students are directed , Pandas .
Pandas states , in pertinent part , as follows : Stated another way , ID posits that animals did not evolve naturally through evolutionary means but were created abruptly by a non-natural , or supernatural , designer .
Defendants ’ own expert witnesses acknowledged this point .
( 21:96 - 100 ( Behe ) ; P - 718 at 696 , 700 ( “ implausible that the designer is a natural entity ” ) ; 28:21 - 22 ( Fuller ) ( “. . .
ID ’s rejection of naturalism and commitment to supernaturalism . . . ” ) ; 38:95 -96 ( Minnich ) ( ID does not exclude the possibility of a supernatural designer , including deities ) .
It is notable that defense experts ’ own mission , which mirrors that of the IDM itself , is to change the ground rules of science to allow supernatural causation of the natural world , which the Supreme Court in Edwards and the court in McLean correctly recognized as an inherently religious concept .
Edwards , 482
The last paragraph is key – the anti-materialist / naturalist movement is really about changing the ground rules of science ( re-fighting the fight they lost in the past ) to include supernatural explanations , but this is impossible within the necessary framework of science .
There is a further hypocrisy in the anti-materialist / naturalist agenda .
They accuse scientists ( and me personally ) of being “ materialist ideologues . ”
However , science does not profess philosophical materialism or naturalism ( of course , individual scientists may ) – science only professes methodological naturalism , a necessary prerequisite to science as a method of investigation .
Science is agnostic toward the deeper philosophical or ideological question ( and , for the record , I am personally as well ) .
Therefore science is non-ideological .
It is they who are anti-materialist and anti-naturalism ideologues – they who are professing an anti-scientific ideology .
Materialism and Neuroscience
ID proponent William Dembski wrote an interesting review of Schwartz ’s book The Mind and the Brain called Challenging Materialism ’s “ Chokehold ” on Neuroscience .
The article is a good indication of the “ unholy alliance ” I discussed above – Dembski is trying to praise Schwartz for his attack on materialism as it applies to consciousness , without endorsing his Buddhist or quantum mechanical notions .
We also see in this essay an interplay between the two main lines of argument for dualism .
Schwartz ’s essential argument for a non-materialist interpretation of mind is the phenomenon of plasticity .
This is the ability of the brain to change its own hard - wiring in response to use .
Incidentally , this is identical to the argument put forward by Deepak Chopra .
Schwartz calls this phenomenon “ self - directed neuroplasticity . ”
Neuroplasticity is well established , and researchers in the last 10 years have discovered that even adults retain significantly more plasticity than previously thought .
We have also discovered at least one mechanism of this plasticity – adults also retain neural stem cells is larger numbers than previously thought .
This is not controversial .
The dualism argument derives from the fact that we can change our brain activity by thinking .
Dembski writes :
From brain scans , Schwartz found that certain regions in the brain of OCD patients ( the caudate nucleus in particular ) exhibited abnormal patterns of activity .
By itself this finding is consistent with a materialist view of mind ( if , as materialism requires , brain enables mind , then abnormal patterns of brain activity are likely to be correlated with dysfunctional mental states ) .
Nonetheless , having found abnormal patterns of brain activity , Schwartz then had OCD patients engage in intensive mental effort through what he called relabeling , reattributing , refocusing , and revaluing ( the 4 Rs ) .
In the case of compulsive hand - washing , this would involve a patient acknowledging that the hands are in fact clean ( relabeling ) ; attributing anxieties and doubts about the hands being dirty to a misfunctioning brain ( reattributing ) ; directing thoughts and actions away from handwashing and toward productive ends ( refocusing ) ; and , lastly , understanding at a deep level the senselessness of OCD messages ( revaluing ) .
Schwartz documents not only that patients who undertook this therapy experienced considerable relief from OCD symptoms but also that their brain scans indicated a lasting realignment of brain - activity patterns .
Thus , without any intervention directly affecting their brains , OCD patients were able to reorganize their brains by intentionally modifying their thoughts and behaviors .
The important point for Schwartz here is not simply that modified thoughts and behaviors permanently altered patterns of brain activity , but that such modifications resulted from , as he calls it , “ mindful attention ” — conscious and purposive thoughts or actions in which the agent adopts the stance of a detached observer .
Schwartz ’s technique is really just a form of cognitive therapy .
Interestingly he equates an alternate approach of behavioral therapy ( making OCD patients keep their hands dirty , for example ) as a manifestation of the materialist view of mind , while his cognitive therapy is more compassionate and spiritual .
This is a non sequitur , however .
Many therapists use both cognitive and behavioral techniques , and assessments of their effectiveness are independent of materialist philosophy , as is the ethics surrounding specific behavioral techniques .
But to the anti-materialists everything is about materialism .
The core argument is that the mind ( a non-physical substance ) is changing the physical brain .
But his is just a circular argument – because if the mind comes from brain , than this is just the brain changing the brain .
You can only interpret this as a non-physical cause changing the brain if you assume that the mind is non-physical in the first place .
Even Dembski has to admit this weakness of Schwartz ’s argument , writing :
“ If you want a knock - down argument against materialism and materialist accounts of mind , this wo n’t do it . ”
But Dembski then goes on to argue ( absurdly ) that even though this argument by itself is worthless , it is still compelling when combined with other ( worthless ) arguments against materialism , such as the strong anthropic principle .
As further evidence for the “ unholy alliance ” he even cites Dean Radin ’s The Conscious Universe – that ’s pretty desperate for a movement trying to grasp at scientific respectability .
The second type of argument used for a non-material interpretation of mind is nothing more than a god - of - the - gaps argument .
This is the type of argument favored by Michael Egnor , with whom I have sparred numerous times in the past .
Egnor essentially argues that the modern tools of neuroscience do not conform precisely to mental activity , and this discrepancy ( gap ) is due to the non-material part of the mind .
Of course , the far simpler explanation is that MRI ’s and EEG ’s have limited resolution , and our models of brain anatomy and function are incomplete ( gaps ) .
Egnor sees dualism in the current gaps in neuroscience in the exact same logically fallacious way that creationists see God ( or ID ) in the gaps of the fossil record .
Of course , any science could be targeted with the same god - of - the - gaps strategy , and such arguments have been lampooned , as in this “ intelligent falling ” article in The Onion , by inserting ID into the gaps in our current theories of gravitation .
So , why attack neuroscience and not Newtonian mechanics ?
I think there are two primary reasons .
The first is that some findings in science are more emotionally disagreeable than others .
Evolution tells us that humans are animals , and neuroscience tells us that all of our hopes and fears are just chemicals and electrical signals in that lump of meat that sits in our skulls .
Evolution and neuroscience are more personal than gravity .
The second reason is that these sciences deal with very abstract and difficult to imagine natural processes .
Evolution unfolds over millions of years , a time scale that is beyond human experience and therefore difficult to fathom .
Consciousness arises from brain function as an emergent phenomenon of a very complex system .
It is difficult even for scientists to fully wrap their imaginations around the concepts involved .
These sciences are therefore vulnerable to ideological attack .
Their science is solid and progressing nicely ( which is a testament to their underlying assumptions ) but there are gaps in our current understanding , they are conceptually very challenging , and they potentially strike at our self - image .
The anti-materialists offer in their place a simple and self - affirming ideology .
Forget all the nuances about punctuated equilibrium – you were created by a loving parent - figure .
Forget emergence and neurons – you are a luminous and immortal being .
Conclusion
This all get ’s back to the Wedge strategy – the anti-materialists cannot win ( and in fact have already lost ) in the arena of science .
Science requires methodological naturalism .
All this talk about “ materialist ideology ” is all a diversion from the truth , which is that creationists , dualists , and proponents of various kinds of woo want to change the fundamental and necessary rules of science to allow their religious beliefs to pass as science .
They are doing this for purely ideological reasons , and they do n’t care if they have to destroy modern science in the process .
Yet , they have the gall to accuse scientists of being “ materialist ideologues ” when they are just defending of method of inquiry from ideological assault .
I ’ve finally weaned myself off Komodo , since the vim bindings had just enough tiny errors to annoy me , and I was never satisfied with how long it took to find and open a file inside the project .
The one thing I was really missing in vim , though , was solid code - completion feature .
After much haranguing , I finally figured out how to enable omnicomplete with django .
Download and install vim for OS X
By far the easiest way to get a version of vim that has python compiled is through macports .
sudo port install vim + python
.
Now replace your old version of vim in your default path ( useful for when a shell command calls vim as the editor ) sudo cp /usr / bin / vim /usr / bin/ vim7.0 sudo cp /opt/local/bin/vim /usr/bin/vim
Verify that you have python compiled by typing : python print " Hello " while in vim
Enable omnicompletion
I ’ve enabled omnicomplete for a bunch of different different completers .
Add these lines to your .vimrc : autocmd FileType python set omnifunc=pythoncomplete #Complete autocmd FileType javascript set omnifunc=javascriptcomplete#CompleteJS
autocmd FileType html set omnifunc=htmlcomplete#CompleteTags autocmd FileType css set omnifunc=csscomplete#CompleteCSS
Run vim so that you can actually complete django files
Omnicomplete imports the modules behind the scenes to help you with completion .
Problem is , it wo n’t be able to import django. db since you do n’t have a settings module specified … so any module that imports models wo n’t work .
Not very useful .
DJANGO_SETTINGS_FILE=myapp.settings vim
Verify that imports will work by typing : python from django import db
Now you can just press < C - X >< C - O > to omnicomplete !
I also highly recommend the rope plugin for vim .
It simplifies opening files within your project , and even will organize your imports ! for you !

One week ago , Joe Wurzelbacher was just another working man living in a modest ranch house near Toledo thinking about how to expand his plumbing business .
But when he stopped Senator Barack Obama during a visit to his block this weekend to ask about his taxes , he set himself on a path to being the newest media celebrity — and , like other celebrities , found himself under scrutiny .
Turns out that “ Joe the Plumber , ” as he became nationally known when Senator John McCain made him a theme at Wednesday night ’s third and final presidential debate , may run a plumbing business but he is not a licensed plumber .
His full name is Samuel J. Wurzelbacher .
And he owes a bit in back taxes .
The premise of his question to Mr. Obama about taxes may also be flawed , according to tax analysts .
An official at Local 50 of the plumber ’s union , based in Toledo , said Mr. Wurzelbacher does not hold a license .
He also has never served an apprenticeship and does not belong to the union .
( The national plumber ’s union , the United Association of Plumbers , Steamfitters , and Service Mechanics , endorsed Mr. Obama , it should be noted . )
“ He ’s basically playing games with the world , ” Thomas Joseph , the local ’s business manager , said in a telephone interview Thursday morning .
Just five days ago , Mr. Wurzelbacher , 34 , lived in anonymity , a single father who worked all day at his plumbing business and came home to fix dinner and help his son with his homework , as he said on national television .
But he became the hero of conservatives and Republicans when he stopped Mr. Obama , who was campaigning on Shrewsbury Street on Sunday , and asked whether he believed in the American dream .
Mr. Wurzelbacher said he was concerned about having to pay taxes as he reached a point where he could afford to buy his own plumbing business , one he said would draw income of $ 250,000 a year .
“ I ’m getting ready to buy a company that makes $ 250,000 to $ 280,000 a year , ” he told Mr. Obama during an exchange that was filmed and later showed up on YouTube .
“ Your new tax plan is going to tax me more , is n’t it ? ”
That encounter led to New York Post headlines , appearances on the Fox News Channel and interviews with conservative groups , who seized on part of Mr. Obama ’s reply .
“ I think that when you spread the wealth around , it ’s good for everybody , ” Mr. Obama had said .
When Mr. McCain invoked Mr. Wurzelbacher in Wednesday ’s debate — some version of “ Joe the Plumber ” was mentioned two dozen times during the 90 minutes — as a way to criticize Mr. Obama ’s tax plan and wealth - sharing argument , Mr. Wurzelbacher suddenly found camera crews outside his home , Katie Couric on the phone , and himself in the full glare of the media spotlight .
Mr. Wurzelbacher did not respond to a message left on his home phone and there was no answer at his plumbing business .
On Thursday , he told the Associated Press that he felt like Britney Spears .
“ I ’m kind of like Britney Spears having a headache , ” he said .
“ Everybody wants to know about it . ”
Unlike some other states , Ohio does not have a formal statewide licensing system for plumbers .
But the city of Toledo and other municipalities do , Mr. Joseph said , and Mr. Wurzelbacher has not met those requirements .
“ All contractors are licensed , and he does not have a license , either as a contractor or a plumber , ” the union official said , citing a search of government records .
“ I ca n’t find that he ’s ever even applied for any kind of apprenticeship , and he has never belonged to local 189 in Columbus , which is what he claims on his Facebook page . ”
According to public records , Mr. Wurzelbacher has been subject to two liens , each over $ 1,000 , one of which — a personal tax lien — is still outstanding .
And his question to Mr. Obama about paying taxes ?
According to some tax analysts , if Mr. Wurzelbacher ’s gross receipts from his business is $ 250,000 — and not his taxable income — then he would not have to pay higher taxes under Mr. Obama ’s plan , and probably would be eligible for a tax cut .

Mr. Wurzelbacher is registered to vote in Lucas County under the name Samuel Joseph Worzelbacher .
“ We have his named spelled W - O , instead of W - U , ” Linda Howe , executive director of the Lucas County Board of Elections , said in a telephone interview .
“ Handwriting is sometimes hard to read .
He has never corrected it in his registration card . ”
The records , she said , showed he voted Republican in the March primary .
Mr. Wurzelbacher told Ms. Couric that his encounter with Mr. Obama was a matter of impulse .
“ Neighbors were outside asking him questions , and I did n’t think they were asking him tough enough questions , ” he said .
He went on , “ You know , I ’ve always wanted to ask one of these guys a question and really corner them and get them to answer a question , ” he said , “ for once instead of tap dancing around it , and unfortunately I asked the question , but I still got a tap dance . ”
He added , “ Almost as good as Sammy Davis Jr . ”
Five days later his decision to confront Mr. Obama has spawned a line of novelty T - shirts sold on the Internet .
“ Vote Joe the Plumber ’ 08 , ” one shirt reads , with the tag : “ No More Drips in the White House . ”
Fox host berates ' Joe the Plumber ' after McCain surrogate says Obama vote means ' death to Israel ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday October 28 , 2008

The all - out effort from John McCain 's presidential campaign to scare voters into backing the Republican candidate continued apace on Tuesday as McCain surrogate Joe the Plumber agreed that a Barack Obama presidency would mean the " death of Israel " and end democracy in America .
The Ohio plumber , who has no license and is actually named Samuel Wurzelbacher , spoke at a McCain campaign event in Columbus Monday .
A McCain supporter asked if " a vote for Obama is a vote for the death of Israel . "
JTP hardly batted an eye .
" I 'll go ahead and agree with you on that , " Wurzelbacher said .
The push - back against Wurzelbacher 's comments began , somewhat unexpectedly , at Fox News .
The network noted that the McCain campaign seemed hesitant to distance itself from Wurzelbacher .
Correspondent Carl Cameron said that the McCain campaign was going to put out an ad today criticizing Obama policies on Israel .
" Just a coincidence ? " he asked .
" We report you decide . "
Later Tuesday afternoon , Shepard Smith pressed Wurzelbacher on his comments , reminding the woefully misinformed McCain backer that Obama has consistently voiced support for Israel .
Pressed several times to explain how he could agree with the conclusion that Obama would lead to the death of the Jewish state , Wurzelbacher was unable to come up with any good reasons aside from Obama 's position in favor of negotiating with rogue regimes such as Iran .
" You do n't want my opinion on foreign policy , " Wurzelbacher said .
" I know just enough to kind of be dangerous . "
Smith seemed to agree with that assessment , implying that the only source for Wurzelbacher and the supporter 's concern was " hateful things spread on the Internet . "
The host clearly worried that Wurzelbacher 's endorsement of such a view might inspire violence against the candidate .
Why , Smith asked , would Wurzelbacher believe Obama was lying when he spoke of the importance of Israel 's relationship with the United States .
Wurzelbacher was flummoxed .
All he could offer was an appeal for people to " go out and find their own reasons ... go out and get informed . "
If only the " plumber " had bothered to take his own advice before jumping onto the national stage .
Smith , for his part , made sure to set his audience straight on the facts .
" I just want to make this 100 percent perfectly clear , Barack Obama has said repeatedly and demonstrated repeatedly that Israel will always be a friend of the United States , no matter what happens once he becomes President of the United States , his words , " Smith said after the interview ended .
" The rest of it , man , it just gets frightening sometimes . "

In Ohio , Wurzelbacher went on to reiterate McCain 's attempts to paint Obama as a socialist , The Associated Press reports .
" I 'm honestly scared for America , " Wurzelbacher said .
He later said Obama would end the democracy that the U.S. military had defended during wars .
" I love America .
I hope it remains a democracy , not a socialist society .
...
If you look at spreading the wealth , that 's honestly right out of Karl Marx 's mouth , " Wurzelbacher said .
" No one can debate that .
That 's not my opinion .
That 's fact . "
McCain 's campaign has used the " spread the wealth " line to attack Obama ever since the Democratic candidate used it to inartfully describe his tax proposals .
The attempts to compare Obama 's relatively modest restructuring of the progressive tax system to Marxism strikes most reasonable observers as patently absurd , but the attack seems to be all the foundering McCain campaign has left .
Obama 's proposal would raise the tax rate on income above $ 250,000 from 36 to 39 percent and lower taxes for middle - class Americans .
McCain 's campaign also has heavily courted Jewish voters , who will be a crucial voting bloc in Florida and other swing states .
Wurzelbacher 's agreement that Obama would portend the death of Israel , though , seems to go beyond rhetoric the McCain campaign has employed so far .
Until Tuesday , that kind of fear - mongering was mostly limited to right - wing blogs .
The McCain campaign said Wurzelbacher and the supporter 's views were there own regarding Israel , but they did not forcefully repudiate the attack , Fox News 's Carl Cameron reported just after the rally .
A Republican National Committee spokesman later gave
Fox a longer statement that largely skirted the issue .
" While he 's clearly his own man , so far Joe has offered some penetrating and clear analysis that cuts to the core of many of the concerns that people have with Barack Obama 's statements and policies , " RNC spokesman Jeff Sadosky said .
" Whether it is Obama 's willingness to sit down unconditionally with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , or his plans to redistribute the paychecks of hardworking Americans , there is good reason to question the judgment that Obama would bring to the Oval Office . "
Cameron noted the statement " does n't say whether or not McCain agrees " with Wurzelbacher and the supporter and said McCain " wo n't go too far " to distance himself from the man who 's become a campaign centerpiece .

As America descends into anarchy and destruction , the Russian president has declared the era of the U.S. over .

Casey Anthony Case Latest in Florida 's History of Unusual News Florida may be leader in peculiar crimes per capita .
Oct. 20 , 2008  --
When 22 - year - old Orlando resident Casey Anthony , mother of 3 - year - old Caylee Anthony , reported on July 15 that her daughter had been missing for a month , officer Carlos Padilla of the Orange Co. Sheriff 's Department knew something was off .
" We knew then that we were met with something , " Padilla told ABC News .
" Of course , we did n't know the magnitude of the case at the time . "
In the weeks and months that followed , Padilla watched the case ramble through the unusual to the absurd and eventually towards tragedy when , on Tuesday , Casey Anthony was formally charged with the little girl 's murder .
Through its course , the meandering and unwieldy investigation soon racked up a cast of characters that would seem more at home on the silver screen than in Florida 's suburbia .
There was Pete Benevides , the Orlando exotic car rental company owner , who put up $ 100,000 of a $ 125,000 reward for information leading to Caylee 's rescue simply because , as he told ABC News , " It 's sad . "
There was Leonard Padilla , the mustached bounty hunter out of California , who appeared on the scene in a cowboy hat and paid half a million dollars to bail Casey out of jail when she was being held on charges including child neglect .
When Casey failed to be as helpful to the investigation as Padilla hoped , he publicly changed his mind three times as to whether his company would revoke the bail .
And playing the lead was the most befuddling character of them all , Casey Anthony .
In an interview with ABC News on July 25 , officer Carlos Padilla said Casey Anthony " has shown no emotion . "
" That 's unusual , " he said .
" At the time of the interviews ... she did n't seem concerned and that made this case this much stranger .
She spoke to deputies like she was talking about baseball . "
Padilla told ABC
News that , early in the investigation , when Casey took police officers to Universal Studios , where she claimed to work , she waited until they got there , walked in " like she owned the place " and then suddenly turned and said , " You got me .
I do n't work here . "
But while Padilla said the Anthony case is the most bizarre he has ever seen in his 18 - year career at the Sheriff 's Department , the rest of Florida can not boast the same .
Florida 's Bizarre News , From Comic to Tragic
For Florida , odd and sometimes grievous news just seems to be part of daily life .
Just last week there was a story about peacocks going on " the pill , " one about police unsuccessfully attempting to tase a 450 - pound boar into submission and another about a mother and son who allegedly tried to put a " hit " on two men and offered to pay the would - be killer in anti-anxiety pills .
" Florida is messed up , " Drew Curtis wrote in his 2007 book " It 's Not News , It 's Fark . "
" Whatever the reason , Florida is without a doubt the No. 1 state for weird news . "
Though there is hardly a way to quantify the " weirdness " of a state , the fact that the oddities of the Florida news have inspired multiple books , at least one daily blog and the only state - related tag on Fark -- a site dedicated to absurd news -- seems to support Curtis ' claim .
When Tom Scherburger , Metro editor and 16 - year employee of the St. Petersburg Times , decided to take all the weird news he had seen over the years and begin a blog called " Bizarre Florida , " he knew it would be quite an undertaking .
" We knew when we started Bizarre Florida near the end of November [ in 2007 ] that the challenge would n't be finding strange stories , " the blog states .
" Rather , it simply would be keeping up with all the bizarre events -- large and small -- that occur daily in the Sunshine State . "
" We 're a content provider for the rest of the country , if not the world , " the 28 - year Florida resident told ABC News .
" The material 's there . "
That material is sometimes a sort of oddball humor -- like when a Tampa man was arrested for riding his bike in a batman costume -- and other times intensely grotesque -- like when a man from Winter Haven allegedly beat his baby daughter to death for not being a boy .
For Scherberger , knowing the difference between the comic and tragic can be difficult .
" There 's a fine line there , " he said .
" Some tragedies are funny , to anyone it 's not happening to .
It 's on a case - by - case basis .
It 's a gut feeling . "
By walking that fine line , a gaggle of comedy writers who make their home in Florida have become successful by looking to the day 's headlines for inspiration .
" For a novelist , it 's such fertile ground , " said Paul Levine , a best - selling fiction author who came to Florida originally in 1969 and has reported for the Miami Herald .
" In my books ... people think that the main story I 'm writing about is true and all the odd cases that form the subplot , people think I made those up . "
Levine said that the opposite is usually true .
Blame
It on the Heat , or the People , or the Newspapers , or Nothing at All
While some , like Levine , are quick to say stories out of Florida are " undoubtedly " more bizarre than other states , few claim to know exactly why .
" The heat leading to sunstroke and leading to dementia among so many people creates a weirder , wacky environment , " Levine theorized .
Drew Curtis wrote in " It 's Not News , It 's FARK , " that the Florida " weirdness " was " diverse , and seems to be endemic of the population . "
" Part of the reason Florida is such a magnet for bizarre stories is that so many people are rootless , " Sherburger agreed .
" It 's a land of refugees .
People will literally get on a bus with no job , no money and land in Florida looking for something to do .
This is a good place to start over . "
In the " land of refugees , " nearly half of Florida 's residents were born out of state , according to the 2000 Census .
" Sometimes I think that Florida , being sort of the end of the road , is where all these cracked marbles kind of roll and now they come to a stop in the sand , " Levine said .
" When you 're there , there 's no place left to go . "
For others , like Clifton Bryant , author of the " Encyclopedia of Criminology and Deviant Behavior , " there is a far simpler reason Florida seems more bizarre than other states : people are paying more attention there .
" I do n't think it 's just Florida , " Bryant told ABC News .
" Sometimes the press and law enforcement are more attentive to certain kinds of things and certain kinds of places .
Maybe living in Florida is like living under a microscope .
Maybe this extra scrutiny may reveal more warts than would otherwise be seen . "
According to Scherberger , the fact that Florida 's books are more open than most also helps .
" There 's a lot of aggressive newspapers and we have access to virtually every arrest record , " he said .
" They say that in New York they 'll tell you anything , but they wo n't give you records .
In Florida , they wo n't tell you anything , but we have all the records . "
Thus stories like the one about a woman stealing guitars from a dead man and then going on a " sex rampage " are reported more regularly than they might be elsewhere .
" We are a blessed people , but nevertheless , ours is a complex society , " Bryant said .
Or , maybe , it is not so complex after all .
" These are all theories though , " Scherberger said .
" I do n't know why Florida is weird .
It must have something to do with the heat . "
Oct. 6 , 2008  --
Sikh groups are decrying the treatment of a Florida inmate who was forced into the cutting of his hair , a revered symbol of piety .
The Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is considering legal action against the Jacksonville Sheriff 's Office , saying that cutting Jagmahon Ahuja 's hair after he entered the jail system violated the state 's statute on religious freedom .
And for devout Sikhs , Ahuja 's haircut represents hundreds of years of persecution .
" It 's essentially like saying , ' I do n't care about your religion .
I do n't care about who you are , ' " said Rajbir Datta , national director of the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund , which has been following Ahuja 's case .
Ahuja , 36 , was jailed April 29 , charged with a probation violation and an order of protection related to a domestic violence case .
He was convicted , sentenced to 714 days in jail and is expected to be released in May 2010 , according to the Jacksonville Sheriff 's Office 's Department of Corrections Web site .
Court documents show Ahuja has filed an appeal .
His hair was cut and his face shaved in July .
Jacksonville Sheriff John Rutherford declined to comment to ABCNews.com , with a spokeswoman in his office citing possible litigation .
And the Department of Corrections did not respond to a request for a telephone interview with Ahuja .
Datta has n't spoken to Ahuja directly , but said the effect of such an event for a Sikh would be devastating .
" For a lot of people , it is essentially akin to death , " Datta said today , noting that his own hair falls to his waist .
Sikhs do not cut their hair , including facial hair , for the duration of their lives , a tradition stemming from the early 18th century guru Gobind Singh .
Hair , Datta said , is " given by God . "
Back in the days of Gobind Singh , turbans were worn by men of wealth and status , and the Sikhs adopted the turban for all men , poor and rich alike , to reject the idea of a caste system .
The long hair , he said , also signifies Sikhs ' not being focused on their outward appearance .
Historically , Datta said , opposing religious groups and governments persecuted Sikhs by cutting off their hair .
The United Sikhs New York - based U.S. division , which is spearheading the protest on Ahuja 's behalf , staged a peaceful demonstration in Jacksonville Sunday with about 80 protestors , most of them Sikhs .
Jaspreet Singh , the group 's lawyer , said he has met with Ahuja , who he said is divorced with two young daughters , twice , and described him as being " very distressed , " even more so after his second haircut and shave Sept. 28 .
" He was very happy to hear the people were taking concern over this issue , " Singh said today .
Singh noted that to Sikhs , the hair is like a limb .
Uncut hair is one of Sikhism 's five articles of faith , along with a small wooden comb , an iron bracelet , a short steel or iron blade and an article of clothing similar to boxer shorts .
" Their reasoning for cutting the hair in the jail is you can hide contraband ... or if you were to escape , you could shave yourself and alter your appearance quickly , " Singh said .
The state of Florida -- whose policy is closely adhered to by the Jacksonville Sheriff's , Singh and Datta said -- states that the government shall not " substantially burden " a person 's right to religious exercise and must find the least restrictive means of accomplishing the government 's interest -- the safety and security of the jail in Ahuja 's case .
Glenn Katon , an ACLU lawyer in Florida and director of the Religious Freedom Project , today said that cutting Ahuja 's hair as a security issue is hard to justify when the Federal Bureau of Prisons and several state corrections departments have already adopted policies allowing inmates to keep certain grooming practices for religious reasons .
" I think we have a pretty good case , " Katon said today , adding , however , that the ACLU has not yet committed to legal action .
There are several inmate grooming cases involving hair on the law books across the country , involving Hasidic Jews , American Indians and Rastafarians , but not Sikhs , Katon said .
The outcomes of the cases were fairly mixed between rulings in favor of the inmates and the prison systems , he said .
Singh noted the 2006 case of Satnam Singh , a Florida state inmate who was moved to Vermont after the Sikh community protested the impending cutting of his hair while in prison .
That , Jaspreet Singh said , was a reasonable accommodation .
But United
Sikhs did n't hear about Ahuja 's case until three weeks after his hair had been removed .
His mother , who lives in the United Kingdom , contacted the group after getting a letter from her son saying that he was depressed and did n't recognize himself in the mirror .
Datta noted that Ahuja had been imprisoned in Jacksonville in 2006 and his hair was not cut then because of the short duration of his stay in the jail .
Datta said there are about 500,000 Sikhs living in the United States .
He estimated there are fewer than two dozen Sikhs imprisoned across the country .
Worldwide , Sikhs number about 25 million , Singh said , with the biggest population in India , followed by the United Kingdom , Canada and the United States .
It ’s not hard to find someone who delights in attacking the show Family Guy .
Which is n’t a criticism , per se .
Much of the animated sitcom ’s purpose seems to be to stoke the opposition , to offend the easily offended .
But that ’s not the only reason it annoys people .
There is a school of thought that says the show is hackish — crudely drawn and derivative of its cartoon forebears .
Members of this school would include , most prominently , Ren & Stimpy creator John Kricfalusi , and Trey Parker and Matt Stone , the fathers of South Park , which is probably the only show on television that rivals Family Guy for objectionable content per half hour .
South Park has devoted entire episodes to attacking Family Guy , portraying the show ’s writers as manatees who push “ idea balls ” with random jokes down tubes to generate plotlines .
Kricfalusi has said , “ You can draw Family Guy when you ’re 10 years old . ”

What does Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane — who earlier this year inked a $ 100 million - plus contract with Fox , followed by a breakthrough deal involving Google — have to say about that ?
“ I would say , ‘ How many violas do you have ? ’ ” MacFarlane is hovering over the soundboard in the control room of the Newman Soundstage on the 20th Century Fox lot in Los Angeles .
Various engineers twiddle knobs and adjust levels as he looks out on a gymnasium - size room full of classically trained musicians tuning their instruments .
Every piece of music on every episode of Family Guy is recorded live by an orchestra that on this day numbers 56 .
The only music that ever repeats , even once , are the opening and closing themes , and those too are frequently updated , just because .
Now , it is not unprecedented to use a live orchestra in today ’s TV world .
But it is highly unusual .
“ All the shows used to do it , ” laments Walter Murphy , one of Family Guy ‘s two composers .
“ It ’s mostly electronic now — to save money . ”
The Simpsons , he says , still uses an orchestra , as does Lost .
King of the Hill has a small band .
And , of course , there ’s an orchestra on American Dad , the other show created by MacFarlane , who is now the highest - paid writer - producer in the history of TV .
MacFarlane , despite being 35 and looking like an average dude , possesses the musical inclinations of a septuagenarian drag queen .
A significant percentage of Family Guy episodes feature extravagant Broadway - inspired song - and - dance numbers ( because , really , why have the cartoon doctor tell his patient he has end - stage AIDS when a barbershop quintet can break the news via song ? ) , and only some of them are sacrilegious or scatological .
Among the features of his new contract with Fox is a Family Guy movie he imagines as “ an old - style musical with dialogue ” in the vein of The Sound of Music , a poster of which hangs above his desk .
“ We ’d really be trying to capture , musically , that feel , ” says MacFarlane , whose father moonlighted as a folk singer .
“ Nothing today feels like it ’ll play 50 years from now , like Cole Porter or Rodgers and Hart . ”
If you ’re waiting for the punch line here , there is n’t one .
Critics may dismiss MacFarlane ’s show for being vulgar , but when he writes a song , it ’s going to be lush and jazzy and , at least musically , exactly as you might hear in something by Irving Berlin .
It ’s all part of a manic attention to detail that not only gives the show its layered humor but also has made MacFarlane a massive multiplatform success .
MacFarlane is more than just an eclectic entertainer .
Stripped of its crude facade , Family Guy — indeed , all of MacFarlane Inc. — exposes itself as a quintessentially modern business with lessons that extend far beyond TV land .
MacFarlane has divined how to connect with next - generation consumers , not simply through the subject of his jokes but by embracing a flexibility in both format and distribution .
He has also stepped outside the siloed definitions of a single industry ( Hollywood ) and exploited opportunity wherever he could find it ( Silicon Valley ) .
And perhaps most instructive , his success is not predicated on his product being all things to all people .
He has bred allegiance from his core customers precisely because he ’s been willing to turn his back on ( and even offend ) others — a model of sorts for how to create a mass - market - size niche business in our increasingly atomized culture .

MacFarlane is a fairly unassuming young man .
He is partial to long - sleeve T - shirts , fraying jeans , and laceless black Chuck Taylors .
Various stories have described him as prematurely graying , but today his hair is convincingly black and lightly gelled , and he ’s wearing wire - rimmed glasses .
Beard stubble is a staple .
The net effect is the look of a full - grown , thinking man ’s frat boy , which also pretty well sums up the target of his comedy ( minus , perhaps , the full - grown part ) .
His show concerns the Griffins of Quahog , Rhode Island , whose patriarch is Peter , voiced by MacFarlane .
Like Homer Simpson , he is lovable but bumbling , overweight , and a little slow - witted ( a recent plot development is that he ’s mentally retarded , but just barely ) .
His wife is Lois , cartoon sexy and much sharper ; she adores him despite his flaws .
They have three children : Chris , overweight and dim , in so many ways his father ’s son ; Meg , smart but underappreciated and ever the butt of jokes about her homeliness ; and Stewie , the infant pedant with the football - shape head who secretly wishes to murder his mother .
Rounding out the clan is Brian the talking dog .
He lusts after Lois , drinks martinis , and has been known to snort the occasional line of blow .
( MacFarlane also voices both Brian and Stewie . )
Back in the soundstage control room , with the orchestra on the other side of the glass , a bank of flat screens are frozen on an image of Stewie staring out a window , forlorn .
MacFarlane tells me that in this future episode , Stewie has been left home alone while the family goes on vacation .
“ Let ’s try it once with the dialogue , ” Murphy says to his musicians .
Stewie ’s quasi-British voice — inspired by Rex Harrison , MacFarlane says — booms through the control room .
“ Oh , Mommy !
Thank God you ’re home !
I promise with all my heart that I ’ll never say or do anything bad to you for the rest of the evening . ”
Comedic pause .
“ By the way , I disabled the V - chip and watched so much porn . ”
Out in the orchestra room , trombonists erupt in laughter .
It is a violent collision of high and low — classical musicians accustomed to the Hollywood Bowl recording music for a show heavy on poop jokes — and a perfect lens for examining why this man sipping coffee from a paper cup emblazoned with the Fox logo has such an enormous and perpetual grin .

*****
It would be fair , at this point , to call Family Guy a juggernaut .
If you ’re looking to get acquainted , it airs Sunday evenings at 9 , just after The Simpsons , which it has surpassed as the most - popular animated show on TV .
Among males 18 to 34 , often cited as the most desirable demographic in advertising , Family Guy is the highest - rated scripted program in all of television ( American Dad ranks sixth ) .
It is the second - highest - rated show among males 18 to 49 .
It is among the most - downloaded shows on iTunes and the most - watched programs on Hulu , and it was the eighth most - pirated show of 2007 on BitTorrent sites .
Next spring , MacFarlane will introduce The Cleveland Show , a spin - off starring the Griffins ’ African - American neighbor .
The show will be MacFarlane ’s third in prime time and the first new product of his megadeal with Fox .
( He is also prepping a live - action movie , but no title or dates have been announced . )
A common complaint about MacFarlane ’s shows is that they are random and disjointed , with episodes that veer wildly off course for no apparent purpose .
A human - size chicken , for example , has been known to show up and battle Peter , apropos of nothing , in elaborate fight scenes that mimic movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark and stretch for more than a minute .
The show ’s tangents are intentional , but in no way intended to advance plot .
MacFarlane admits that sometimes vignettes are inserted into an episode just to fill time , or just because they ’re good for a laugh , regardless of plot relevance .
As a result , Family Guy is easily digested in bite - size portions — the breakout gags , like the musical numbers , can be watched in isolation , at any time , and still work .
This makes MacFarlane ’s show especially well suited to the Internet and mobile devices — perfect for viewing during a boring history lecture or on the dreary commute home on the 5:07 to Ronkonkoma .
Easily masticated comedy — plus a fervent audience of college kids in baggy cargo shorts bursting with disposable income and electronics — also made MacFarlane a natural fit for Google .
In September , the first of 50 bizarro animated shorts by MacFarlane appeared online .
Seth MacFarlane ’s “ Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy , ” distributed by Google via its AdSense network , is a series of Webisodes that MacFarlane describes as edgier versions of New Yorker cartoons come to life .
Running from 30 seconds to just over two minutes , the shorts are sponsored by advertisers and noteworthy for a host of reasons .
For fans , they are MacFarlane ’s first non-TV venture and so exist outside the reach of censors and network suits and introduce a universe of entirely new characters .
For the entertainment industry , they mark the first experiments with a bold new method of content distribution ( and the entry of the beast Google into its world ) .
This purportedly unsophisticated hack comic now finds himself , in some ways by accident , at the intersection of advertising , television , and the Web — all of which are blurring together .
advertisement
Perhaps it ’s not surprising , then , that while a MacFarlane product like Family Guy may seem slapdash when you ’re watching it , the creative process behind it is decidedly sophisticated .
“ He ’s kind of a modern - day cross between George Lucas and Norman Lear , ” says his manager , John Jacobs .
“ He thinks on a big canvas . ” Says Norman Lear himself , a man who was once also the highest - paid creator on TV : “ I ’m crazy about him and his work .
I ca n’t think of anybody doing a better job right now of mining the foolishness of the human condition . ”
***** A Family Guy episode is more or less a nine - month undertaking , from first script to finished animation .
All episodes take shape in the writers room on the third floor of an unremarkable office building on Wilshire Boulevard , home to MacFarlane ’s Fuzzy Door Productions .
It ’s pretty much as you ’d imagine : a conference table surrounded by rolling chairs and covered in computer monitors , action figures , and the assorted detritus of the comedy writer ’s diet : soft - drink cans , candy wrappers , half - finished bags of beef jerky .
MacFarlane takes a chair in front of a dry - erase board as his 16 writers stagger in drinking coffee and stabbing at cups of fruit .
One of them asks the boss how a concert he ’d seen the night before had gone , and when MacFarlane complains about the bathroom lines , the guy suggests he stick to “ lesbian shows , like the Indigo Girls . ”
The typical episode begins with a single writer producing a script , but then the whole team gets involved , dissecting each scene and line to decide if a ) it ’s actually funny and b ) it can be made funnier .
In a loose but laborious process , each gag gets chewed over ad infinitum in this peanut - gallery forum .
The goal is to produce an episode overstuffed with jokes — something that gives fans plenty to discuss late at night on bulletin boards .
“ I think we ’re the most joke - per - minute show on television , ” asserts executive producer David Goodman .
This late - summer afternoon , the challenge is to fill out a scene in which Stewie and some friends are at nursery school .
Ideas are tossed out in various impressions of Stewie ’s voice :
There ’s a molestation joke , some poop jokes , a joke about a rogue chicken because , according to the writer who pitches it , “ chickens just wander around the yard at some schools . ”
advertisement
“ Is that safe ? ” MacFarlane asks .
“ Are n’t chickens aggressive and , like , poke your eyes out ? ”
Anyone can speak , and jokes are called out with no introduction .
MacFarlane sits up front , along with Goodman , reclining in his seat and appearing in no way dictatorial .
He ’ll chime in , but his input seems no more or less important than anyone else ’s .
“ If the writers in that room do n’t laugh — it ’s not going on , ” says Goodman .
“ That ’s a tough room .
If we laugh , it ’s probably funny . ”
The prevailing meta - joke about Stewie is that , despite being an infant , he is the most intellectual character on the show , even if the only family member who can hear him speak is Brian the dog .
“ Stewie could wear a cop hat and go up to a white girl standing with a black kid and say , ‘ Are you okay , miss ? ’ ” one writer suggests .
Awkward , almost embarrassed laughs break out around the table .
It ’s a joke that could be viewed as offensive , or as fairly pointed social criticism .
A digression on race follows , before everyone moves on to another idea , about toddlers as obnoxious art critics picking apart one another ’s finger paintings .
There is n’t a comedy writers room in America where the banter does n’t often veer toward extreme subjects .
The difference with this crew is that the extremes are the goal .
Watch enough Family Guy and you ’ll almost certainly see something that makes you cringe ; it might not offend you personally , but you can imagine how someone wo n’t find it funny .
Family
Guy savages politicians and celebrities , and is more than willing to tackle all manner of touchy subjects in the name of comedy — race , Islam , Christianity ( Jesus is a recurring character , because FCC rules stipulate you cannot use “ Jesus Christ ” as an exclamation unless the deity himself is present ) , homosexuality , bestiality , pedophilia , the physically impaired .
A favorite example tossed out by opponents is a sight gag that involved a JFK Pez dispenser in which the candy emerged from a hole in the president ’s head .
( MacFarlane later admitted that maybe , just maybe , that one crossed the line . )

MacFarlane does n’t argue with the notion that many of his jokes border on offensive , but the notion that the content is actually offensive irks him .
Each episode is vetted by a team of Fox censors editing with the FCC in mind .
But beyond that , he contends , “ There ’s an enormous amount of self - policing that goes on and a lot of intelligent conversations about whether a show is worth doing .
I would stack the ethics of one of my writers up against the average Washington bureaucrat on censorship any day . ”
MacFarlane is mystified in particular by the two things that most upset the FCC — two basic elements of human life that , in his view , are far less sensitive than , say , religion .
“ For the FCC , it ’s sexual references , ” he says .
“ But even more than that , shit jokes .
Any time we even show somebody on a toilet , we get in trouble . ”
MacFarlane does n’t argue with the notion that his jokes border on offensive .
But the notion that they are actually offensive irks him .
Which brings us back to the writers room .
A source of ongoing consternation is Stewie ’s inability to master the commode .
MacFarlane assumes the child ’s erudite voice and says , speaking in character to his fellow children , “ I ’d like to make an announcement :
It ’s the elephant in the room .
I made a stool .
Now let ’s just all go about our business as if nothing happened , and it ’ll take care of itself in due time . ”
Most everyone in the room laughs .
The joke is in .
***** Seth MacFarlane was basically fated to this life .
His middle name , Woodbury , was chosen by his mother as an homage to the town drunk back in Kent , Connecticut .
“ Some of the foulest jokes I ’ve ever heard , ” he has said , “ came from my mother . ”
MacFarlane started drawing at 2 and published his first cartoon , “ Walter Crouton , ” in a local paper at the age of 8 .
At 18 , he left for the Rhode Island School of Design and , after his adviser sent his thesis film , “ Life of Larry ” ( starring a lovable schlub with a tolerant wife and a talking dog ) , off to Hanna - Barbera , he was hired to work as an animator and writer on shows like Dexter ’s Laboratory and Johnny Bravo .
In 1996 , he created a sequel to “ Life of Larry ” that aired in prime time on the Cartoon Network .
Fox development executives took notice and hired him away to work on interstitials to run between sketches on Mad TV .
A few years later , Fox asked MacFarlane , then 25 , to develop an animated pilot , giving him a scant $ 50,000 to do it .
MacFarlane emerged three months later with a nearly completed pilot , for which he had drawn every frame and voiced every character .
advertisement
Fox bought the show , gave MacFarlane a reported $ 2 - million - per - season contract , and premiered Family Guy in the highest - profile slot possible , following the 1999 Super Bowl .
He was the youngest person ever to be given his own primetime network show .
It drew 22 million viewers but then became a sort of network foster child .
For the next two years ,
Fox execs moved the show all over the schedule , trying it in 11 time slots , including in the death zone opposite Friends .
Despite the fact that Family Guy tracked well with young men , the show ’s ratings were low .
Fox canceled it in 2000 , revived it briefly the next year , then canceled it again .
But a funny thing happened .
The show lived on over at the Cartoon Network , with even edgier versions specially edited by MacFarlane .
Regard for the show was so low that Fox essentially gave the Cartoon Network the first 50 episodes for free ;
Fox simply asked for promotion of the show ’s DVD in exchange .
( They were having trouble persuading retailers to stock it — another in a list of miscalculations that seems inconceivable in retrospect . )
Family Guy ‘s audience , ignored at every turn , followed the show to the Cartoon Network , dug in , and swelled , regularly beating both Letterman and Leno in the desirable young - male demographic .
When
Fox released the first 28 episodes on a series of DVDs in 2003 , it sold more than 2.5 million copies .
( In 2005 , a straight - to - DVD movie called Stewie Griffin : The Untold Story sold about 3.5 million copies , bringing in almost $ 80 million . )
Twentieth Century Fox TV president Gary Newman ( now chairman ) summoned MacFarlane to his office in 2004 and did the unthinkable :
He asked him to restart production .
“ I had gone into the meeting not knowing why I was going in there , ” MacFarlane recalls .
“ He said , ‘ We ’d like to put this back into production , ’ and I almost fell out of my chair . ”
David Goodman says that when Family Guy was initially canceled , MacFarlane told him Goodman ’s job would be safe if it ever returned .
“ I ’d been on 14 canceled TV shows , ” Goodman recalls .
“ They never come back .
It ’s never happened before — ever . ”
Fox brought the show back in a big way , ordering 35 episodes ( 22 is typical ) and handing over the Sunday - at - 9 slot , where it boomed .
The 100th episode aired in November of 2007 , pushing the show into syndication .
Though schedules vary , Family Guy airs up to 27 times a week in a single market , with reruns on Fox , TBS , the Cartoon Network , and in 20 major markets on channels owned by Tribune Broadcasting .

“ Animation is something that , if it works , it ’s more profitable for a studio than any other show , ” MacFarlane says .
People do n’t buy Everybody Loves Raymond T - shirts , but they do buy shirts bearing the devious visage of Stewie , as well as action figures , stickers , posters , and video games .
Increasingly , they also buy song clips and ring tones .
And Fox , which owns the show , also owns the intellectual property ( but kicks a percentage of sales back to MacFarlane ) .
Reports have valued the Family Guy franchise at as much as $ 1 billion .
Though neither Fox nor MacFarlane ’s team would confirm that number , a little back - of - the - envelope math indicates that it is overly conservative .
At a reported $ 2 million per episode , Family Guy has garnered at least $ 400 million up front from syndication .
DVD sales have totaled almost another $ 400 million , while 80 licensees have contributed at least $ 200 million from sales of various clothing and baubles , actual and digital .
Fox ’s ad revenue off Family Guy can be estimated at at least $ 500 million over the years .
“ Suffice it to say , with it being a studio - owned show , and being on the Fox network , it ’s of substantial value , ” Newman told me .
And none of this figures in revenue from MacFarlane ’s other hit product , American Dad .
Team MacFarlane , of course , also recognized the value of what MacFarlane has brought to the network .
By the time negotiations on a new contract began more than two years ago , the challenge for both sides was how to put a number on MacFarlane ’s worth , considering that he is n’t just a writer - producer but also an animator and actor .
MacFarlane ’s team felt the need to let his contract expire , “ to have him on the open market , ” explains one of his representatives .
For more than two years , MacFarlane worked on Family Guy in good faith , without a contract .
“ There were a couple days when I was ‘ sick , ’ ” MacFarlane says .
“ At times , that helps bring the negotiations back when they ’re stalled . ”
When the writers strike broke out last year , he sided with the guild and walked off the set .
Fox decided to go forward and edit episodes without MacFarlane ’s participation — they did own them , after all .
MacFarlane called it a “ colossal dick move . ”
When asked about it now , he says it ’s a sore that ’s been salved ( $ 100 million has a way of doing that ) .
“ They gave us money to go back and edit the shows the way we wanted , and we made nice . ”
One Fox - inflicted bruise that has yet to fade involves shots taken at Family Guy by The Simpsons , a show that MacFarlane says he admires greatly .
Most famously , in an episode called “ Treehouse of Horror , ” Homer creates a sea of clones even dumber and more dim - witted than himself .
One of these is Family Guy‘s Peter Griffin .
MacFarlane decided to return fire .
He wrote a joke in which Peter ’s perverted friend Quagmire attacks and molests Marge Simpson .
Fox , he says , nixed the idea .
“ They said , ‘ We want the feuds to end . ’
I thought it was very conspicuous that this came about only when we decided to hit them back . ”
What did he do ?
He left it in anyway , and delivered the edit to Fox , which then edited it out .
“ It ’s still a sore point , ” MacFarlane says .
“ It ’s still this wound that has never quite healed that says , ‘ We do n’t value you quite as much , ’ which I ca n’t imagine is true , but … ”
The thought trails off and , perhaps realizing that it ’s best not to follow this logic , he turns a corner .
“ To be fair to Fox — for the most part , creatively they have been a very easy company to work with .
This was kind of a rare lapse in judgment . ”

MacFarlane ’s contract hiatus did n’t just buy him leverage with Fox ; it was an expansion opportunity .
While the studio was noodling on the deal , MacFarlane ’s management team went out and signed him up with Google .
The resulting “ Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy ” is outside the bounds of the Fox relationship .
“ In a completely perfect world , ” Dana Walden , chairman of 20th Century Fox Television , has said , “ he would n’t be able to do that . ”
He did .
The idea stemmed from conversations between MacFarlane ’s lawyer and agent and representatives of Media Rights Capital , an L.A. - based multimedia financier .
Loosely tied to the talent agency Endeavor ( which reps MacFarlane , naturally ) , MRC partners with content creators — whether that ’s director Alejandro González Iñárritu on Babel ; or Sacha Baron Cohen on his next film , Bruno ; or MacFarlane — giving them funding and a share in ownership , plus creative control .
MacFarlane produced the Cavalcade shorts with a team of six writers .
The animation is instantly recognizable as his , as is the humor .
The shorts lean heavily on pop culture ( say , “ Fred and Barney Try to Get Into a Club , ” which is fairly self - explanatory ) ; they ’re rude ( in one , Tara Reid ’s grotesque belly flab talks ) ; and of course , they ’re crude ( a boy is told he is adopted by two parents with nipples that stick out of their chests like javelins ; his name , they tell him , is not Michael Sticknipples but rather Albert Horsefeet Turdsneeze — whereupon the boy sneezes a turd that sprouts horse feet and gallops off ) .
The Cavalcade shorts are also distributed in an innovative way : targeting young males where they lurk by popping up in ad windows on sites such as Maxim.com and Fandango.com ( while simultaneously appearing on YouTube ) .
“ The idea is not to drive someone to a Web site but to make content available wherever the audience will be , ” explains Dan Goodman , president of digital at MRC .
Also unprecedented is the way MacFarlane is being paid .
MRC is not Fox ; it ca n’t just write him a nine - figure check .
Instead , MacFarlane ’s status as an equity partner in the deal entitles him to split the ad revenue with Google and MRC .
Because the whole idea is new , it ’s hard to draw parallels to current entertainment and marketing models but , essentially , MRC provides the funding and sells the ad partnerships , MacFarlane provides the content , and Google serves as distribution outlet , providing the “ broadcast ” via its AdSense network .
Then all three split the proceeds .
It can , and will , be replicated with other content providers .
Already , MRC is working with the Disney Channel ’s Raven - Symoné on kids - targeted programming .
You could easily imagine it with , say , Rachael Ray .
Each Cavalcade short carries a single advertiser .
The first 10 were bought by Burger King , and — in yet another unprecedented move — MacFarlane animated the company ’s ads for them .
It ’s an option available to any of the sponsors if they choose to pay extra for it .
advertisement
For Burger King , the appeal was obvious .
“ Seth ’s fan base intersects squarely with our audience of young men and women , ” says Brian Gies , vice president of marketing impact for Burger King .
In other words , MacFarlane ’s comedy provides a very powerful and friendly connection to a very targeted audience , one that tends to get the munchies .
Says Google ’s Levy : “ We know where to find them , and we ’re putting the advertising in an environment they ’re comfortable in . ”
“ The idea is to take the TV experience and provide it on the Web , ” says Alex Levy , Google ’s director of branded entertainment .
“ But brought to the people you want to reach , when , where , and how you want to reach them . ”
For a company that likes to say it ’s not in the content business , that ’s a remarkable statement .
Google , in essence , is trying to use its ad- distribution network to turn content distribution upside down .
( Google calls it the Content Network . )
There ’s no guarantee the new model is going to stick , of course — advertisers could decide they get as much value by just buying regular Web ads and avoid paying extra .
But early returns showed viewers were responding well to the shorts .
In its first days , Cavalcade was the most - watched channel on YouTube , and the videos racked up 5.5 million views across the various sites running them .
And MacFarlane wins no matter what .
Unlike his Family Guy characters , every horny frog and lusty princess and sarcastic talking bear created for Cavalcade is owned by him , and can be deployed for future revenue .
And for all this , he has zero financial risk .
*****
A couple of years ago , MacFarlane nearly worked himself to death .
He collapsed at his desk and was rushed to the hospital .
He was sick , he says , and “ did n’t have the time to stop . ”
So he passed out right there under the Sound of Music poster .
He ended up spending , as he tells it , “ a lovely afternoon at the emergency room . ”
“ We ’ve been behind schedule on Family Guy since day one , ” he explains .
“ In reality , you ca n’t do a prime - time animated show in the time allotted , so that always puts a glaze of stress over the whole process . ”
He takes a breath .
“ I refuse to let that control my life .
I did that in my twenties .
Now I insist on a balance . ”

MacFarlane has handed off the day - to - day control of both American Dad and The Cleveland Show , and he is increasingly delegating on Family Guy .
He reviews all the drawings and obsesses more than a little over the music — there is some stuff he just ca n’t give up .
And what ’s easy to forget is that MacFarlane is also the star of Family Guy .
Actually , several stars of Family Guy .
He voices three of the six main characters , and is in virtually every scene , sometimes playing several parts at once .
He ’s also the voice of Quagmire , a major secondary player , and hundreds of ancillary characters and one - timers .
And , of course , he ’s the voice of Stan , the lead on American Dad , and almost certain to guest - star often on The Cleveland Show .
This summer , he showed up as a voice actor in Guillermo del Toro ’s Hellboy II and is very soon planning to step in front of the camera in live - action projects .
He also intends to direct movies .
One afternoon in August , MacFarlane and two sound engineers are in the tiny control room outside the recording booths in the Family Guy offices .
In strolls the actor Gary Cole wearing shorts and sunglasses .
For a show that likes to pick on celebrities , Family Guy has little trouble attracting them , especially those whose résumés include the kind of wonderfully awful performances that ultimately get embraced as cult in - jokes : Drew Barrymore , Haley Joel Osment , Gene Simmons , Bob Costas , Phyllis Diller … Michael Clarke Duncan was in earlier this morning .
Richard Dreyfuss is due to arrive this evening .
Cole has done the show 23 times .
Today , he ’s doing Mike Brady , reprising a role he played in The Brady Bunch Movie .
In this script , Mr. Brady is verbally abusing Mrs. Brady in one of those trademark pop-culture tangents .
“ You know , you can really go as loud as you want , ” MacFarlane says in director mode .
“ We ’ve never heard Mike Brady yell before , so this is new territory . ”
He then assumes the role of Carol Brady .
“ Huh , I do n’t remember asking for a warm beer , ” Cole says , his voice quiet but seething .
MacFarlane , as Carol , flips out : “ I did n’t want to quit working — you made me ! ”
advertisement
Five minutes later , Cole exits and MacFarlane is off to the next thing , laying down lines in furious fashion , typically in three or four takes , which he then selects from on the fly .
His sound engineers tag his favorite takes and move on .
He swaps from voicing Stewie to Peter to Quagmire to various odd parts , including a bit as Paul McCartney and another as Vince Vaughn .
Next up : A writer is doing Patrick Swayze , who is not , as you might expect , the butt of a cancer joke , but rather a tight - jeans joke followed by repeated takes of the writer growling , as throaty redneck Swayze , “ Roadhouse ! ”
It ’s another one of those cult jokes , a little snippet of Dada theater .
“ Even a hair more badass , ” MacFarlane directs , and over and over they go until that one simple word becomes absurd in its own right .
You can already hear it as a ring tone .

GRANADA , Spain , Oct. 27 ( UPI ) --
Spanish physicists say they have discovered unequivocal evidence of electrical activity in the atmosphere of Saturn 's largest moon , Titan .
Physicists at the University of Granada and the University of Valencia say their analysis of data from the Huygens space probe proves " in an unequivocal way " the existence of natural electric activity in Titan 's atmosphere .

Huygens , a joint mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency , was launched in 1997 and landed on Titan in January 2005 , sending data for 90 minutes after it reached the surface .
The electric field was measured by a sensor on the Huygens probe .
Juan Antonio Morente of the University of Granada said Titan has been considered " a unique world in the Solar System , " since a Spanish astronomer discovered in 1908 that it had an atmosphere -- something non-existent elsewhere in the solar system .
" In this moon there are clouds with convective movements and therefore there can be static electric fields and stormy conditions , " said Morente , noting electrical activity significantly increases the likelihood organic molecules that are precursors to life could be formed in the atmosphere .
The study appears in the journal Icarus .
Fox News labels McCain a Democrat RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday October 29 , 2008
Print This Email This Fox News has delivered a grave insult to presidential nominee John McCain : the conservative cable network has labeled the Arizona Republican a Democrat .
Jed Lewison caught the mistake Tuesday .
Fox News has been reliably boosting McCain 's foundering presidential bid throughout the campaign , but the latest slight , while probably a copy editing error , could be more evidence of the network preparing to turn on its nominee .
The slip - up follows a segment Tuesday in which anchor Shepard Smith became so incensed with McCain surrogate " Joe the Plumber " he was forced to issue an on -air disclaimer correcting Joe 's false attacks on Obama .
The network has a history of mislabeling politicians ' political parties , typically Republicans who are under investigations or being accused of wrongdoing .
This screen grab was first published on the Jed Report .

“ We ’ve been designing and we ’ve been engineering and we ’ve been at the drawing board and we ’ve been tinkering , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ Now , it ’s time to just take it for a drive .
Let ’s see how this baby runs . ”
One piece of this effort can be found in a former beauty school here along South Washington Street in the suburbs of the nation ’s capital .
No cable television is blaring .
Mr. McGowan and his team need to know only one piece of strategy : If Mr. Obama wins Virginia , a Democratic feat not achieved in 44 years , he may well win the White House .
These satellite offices , a campaign trademark that contributed to Mr. Obama ’s first victory in Iowa , have been set up with the swiftness of a Starbucks franchise .
While local buy - in is encouraged at the more than 700 field offices across the country , the uniformity is remarkable , down to the cardboard cutout of Mr. Obama near the front door in many locations .
What started out organically  campaign officials saw organizational promise in Virginia last year , when 20,000 signatures were gathered to make Mr. Obama the first candidate to qualify for the primary ballot  has come full circle .
Now , people driving by the storefront offices are drawn in by their visibility and put to work .
The Obama campaign has broken the country into a collection of battleground states , which are dissected into precincts that are parceled one more time into neighborhood teams .
( Ohio , for example , is divided into 1,231 neighborhoods . )
And each of these teams , if the recruiting is up to speed , has a leader who , ideally , lives just down the block from all those doors that need to be knocked on .
The concept could well be called the 2.0 version of President Bush ’s effort from his 2000 and 2004 campaigns , which outclassed Democrats and left them determined not to be out - organized again .
It is supplemented by get - out - the - vote efforts from unions and other groups backing Mr. Obama , and it is benefiting from national trends , like growing anxiety over the economy , that favor Democrats nationwide .
On Wednesday , October 29 bloggers will unite in support of marriage equality for same - sex couples and against California ’s Proposition 8 .
The Write to Marry Day campaign is an effort to shore up support and show the power of politics amidst the blogosphere .
All bloggers are encouraged to write about why they support marriage equality , why they are against the marriage amendments , and share what they have done or intend to do to fight the propositions , such as 8 in California and others .
To participate , post on your own blog against Prop 8 on or before October 29 , 2008 , then submit the link to your post by clicking here .
Links to your own videos on YouTube or other video sites are also accepted .
Not only that , but all participants who leave a valid e-mail address will be entered into a drawing for a $ 50 gift certificate to Amazon.com .
The BBC has found evidence that Georgia may have committed war crimes in its attack on its breakaway region of South Ossetia in August this year .
The evidence obtained by the BBC's Newsnight programme suggests Georgia used indiscriminate force and may have targeted civilians .
Georgia 's president Mikhail Saakashvili reacted and said " we strongly deny any accusation of war crimes " .

The one thing that keeps me from doing a lot more with Ruby ( or Python , for that matter ) on the web is that I have n't found a decent way to run lots of little " play " applications on a server without stuffing it full of memory .
I 'm having a play today , trying to see if it would be feasible to run Ruby the way PHP works - embed everything into Apache and recompile all user scripts on the fly .
The Ruby interpreter seems to start reasonably quickly .
In a fork and exec loop on my laptop , I can spawn Ruby and run a nearly - empty script 54 times per second , compared with 154 and 22 times for Lua and Python respectively .
I had a quick try with embedding the Ruby interpreter , and found that forking and running ruby_init ( ) and rb_eval_string ( " load ' myscript.rb ' " ) gave about the same performance ( 50 - 65 repetitions / s ) .
Running ruby_init ( ) then forking and running the script worked much better , as expected , consistently running slightly over 400 repetitions / s.
Here 's the code : embed.cc .
This is promising .
If I can code up my library functions tightly enough that recompiling them on every hit would n't hurt too much , it should work .
An alternative is to write all library functions in C++ and load them as one big module , as with PHP .
Second test : instead of a test.rb that just sets a variable , I added a require ' mysql ' .
This brought the speed down to 100 repetitions per second , but this is still respectable , considering that I can precache important libraries like this with a rb_eval_string ( " require ' mysql ' " ) line before the fork ( i.e. somewhere in the Apache init process , if this were an Apache module ) .
Trying this brought the speed back to 350 or so repetitions /s .
After initializing Ruby and loading the MySQL library , then forking and running the test script 1000 times , the parent process is sitting at around 6 M memory usage , which is fine .
For comparison at this point , I tried creating two Rack " hello world " apps , setting PassengerMaxPoolSize to 1 , and repeatedly hitting one , then the other .
This forces Passenger to unload one app and load the other on every hit .
This managed about 11 requests per second ( compared to about 100 - 250 per second for a single app ) .
My impression so far is that keeping an initialized Ruby interpreter sitting around , then forking on every request to compiling and running the app code , feels feasible .
It will probably slow down rapidly as the app gets bigger , but hopefully there will be a natural point where it makes sense to switch from using this environment to using Passenger and keeping the loaded app in memory between requests .
(... which uses an extra 20 M or so of memory but lets you more or less forget about the startup time . )
I wonder if economics is making war obsolete , at least for the larger countries .
Waging war is just too damned expensive , even if your enemy lives in mud huts .
If you ’re looking for the silver lining to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , here it is :
They prove once and for all that the occupier does n’t come out ahead even by “ winning . ”
It makes more sense to turn off the economic spigot to any country that starts to look threatening to its neighbor .
Arguably , the United States is already in a war with Iran , but it takes the form of developing alternative fuels .
When Iran can no longer find much of a market for its oil , it will have to start being a lot friendlier .
The same goes for the United States .
The next President of The United States ( probably Obama ) will be projecting a new humility thanks to a crippled economy .
North Korea has been defeated economically , for all practical purposes .
So was the Soviet Union .
Venezuela is getting less cocky as the price of oil plummets .
China has become zero threat to the U.S. because of economic interests .
Terrorism is still the wild card .
But the end of oil will put more of a dent in terrorism than any war could .
In the old days you could make a profit from a good war , thanks to pillaging and slavery .
Those days have passed .
Switzerland has one of the highest standards of living in the world .
I think the age of big war has passed .
You may have heard a story in which we are told , and with a straight face , that the word " sh*t " originated as the acronym of " Ship High in Transit " ( or " Stow High in Transit " ) , a supposed nautical phrase .
Here 's one chain e-mail that describes a compelling , but false , story about the etymology of the S - Word :
In the 1800's , cow pie 's were collected on the prarie and boxed and loaded on steam ships to burn instead of wood .
Wood was not only hard to find , but heavy to move around and store .
When the boxes of cow pie 's were in the sun for days on board the ships , they would smell bad .
So when the manure was boxed up , they stamped the outside of the box , S.H.I.T.... which means Ship High In Transit .
When people came aboard the ship and said , " Oh what is that smell ! "
They were told it was sh*t .
Clever as all that may be , whoever came up with it does n't know sh*t about " sh*t . "
In fact , the word is much older than the 1800s , appearing in its earliest form about 1,000 years ago as the Old English verb scitan .
That is confirmed by lexicographer Hugh Rawson in his bawdily edifying book , Wicked Words , where it is further noted that the expletive is distantly related to words like science , schedule and shield , all of which derive from the Indo - European root skei- , meaning " to cut " or " to split . "
You get the idea .
For most of its history " sh*t " was spelled " sh*te " ( and sometimes still is ) , but the modern , four - letter spelling of the word can be found in texts dating as far back as the mid-1700s .
It most certainly did not originate as an acronym invented by 19th - century sailors .
Apropos that false premise , Rawson observes that " sh*t " has long been the subject of naughty wordplay , very often based on made - up acronyms on the order of " Ship High in Transit . "
For example :
In the Army , officers who did not go to West Point have been known to disparage the military academy as the South Hudson Institute of Technology ....
And if an angelic six - year - old asks , " Would you like to have some Sugar Honey Iced Tea ? " , the safest course is to pretend that you have suddenly gone stone deaf .
Lastly , all these stories are reminiscent of another popular specimen of folk etymology claiming that the f-word ( another good old - fashioned , all - purpose , four - letter expletive ) originated as the acronym of " Fornication Under Consent of the King " ( or , in another version , " For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge " ) .
Suffice it to say , it 's all C.R.A.P .
Nissan GT - R is a very efficient car even as stock and , therefore , many tuners prefer to work only with Japanese design model .
The same did the tuners from Branew , a Japanese company that launched a package of styling for the new Nissan GT - R .
The kit contains an extension for front spoiler , side thresholds , rear spoiler , aileron , 23 inches rims and an exhaust system that is “ signed ” with three drums exhaust positioned centrally .
For those interested , the new styling kit can be seen at SEMA .

Using data from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope , Dr Massimo Marengo — from the Harvard - Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics — and Dr Dana Backman — from the SETI Institute — are claiming that there 's a solar system which is a younger twin of our own , just 10.5 light - years from us .
Nothing surprising , really , until they tell you that the star is called Epsilon Eridani .
Which just happens to be , hold your tinfoil hats on , the legendary home star of a certain Mr. Spock .
According to Marengo , they have a pretty good idea of how it looks like :

Studying Epsilon Eridani [ artist representation above ] is like having a time machine to look at our solar system when it was young .
This system probably looks a lot like ours did when life first took root on Earth .
Epsilon Eridani looks a lot like the young solar system , so it 's conceivable that it will evolve similarly .

Looking at the Spitzer data , the Epsilon Eriadni solar system should have at least three planets in orbit .
At least , Marengo and Backman are saying this is the only way to explain its asteroid belt configuration , which is very similar to our own , but in a more primitive state .
These include one inner asteroid belt which is a virtual duplicate to the one between Mars and Jupiter .
There 's also an outer ring similar to the Kuiper Belt .
The latter holds 100 times more material than ours because it has n't go through a process called the Late Heavy Bombardment yet .
In theory , this happened when our solar system 's planets attracted much of the Kuiper belt into the inner orbits .
Finally , there 's a third belt located in the equivalent orbit of Uranus , with as much mass as our Moon .
According to Marengo , " planets are the easiest way to explain what we 're seeing . "
We believe you , Dr Marengo Sir .
Of course , it could all just be a huge scam , a deception , a camouflage system designed to hide one of the largest starship construction facilities in the Federation from our puny telescopes .
And yes , right there I just became the nerdiest Gizmodo editor second only to Jason Chen .

Do you remember when the Bin Laden tape in 2004 was spun by Fox News and the right - wing as a Bin Laden endorsement of John Kerry ?
If – as Charlie Black , a top Washington lobbyist unti McCain put him on his payroll , admitted – it is the conventional wisdom that a terrorist attack before the election would “ be a big advantage ” for McCain in the election and help get him elected …
And as McCain ’s policies of military over - extension , fiscal irresponsibility , and continued occupation and war in the Middle East fit nicely into Al Qaeda ’s master plan …
Would n’t that logically make any terrorist attack on American soil , or any surprise videos putting Bin Laden front - and - center , an effective endorsement of McCain ?
Just asking …

Many atheists care deeply about maintaining the separation of church and state , promoting atheist equality , correcting popular misconceptions about atheists , and all sorts of other important goals .
The number of worthy causes may even seem overwhelming at times .
How can one person with limited time and resources hope to make a meaningful difference ?
Fortunately , one can be an effective atheist activist by investing merely 30 minutes a week .
Maximizing the impact of a limited time investment requires a little preparation .
After all , one must know where best to direct one 's efforts .
Therefore , I recommend using your first 30 minute period to do the following , each of which will make future efforts even easier :
Now that you are set up , it is time to figure out how best to use your 30 minutes a week for the good of atheists everywhere .
In no particular order , here are several things you can do on a regular basis to benefit the atheist movement : Just imagine what could happen if even 25 % of atheists wrote one letter to the editor of their local newspaper once a month !
We would be impossible to ignore .
Atheist activism does not have to be arduous .
Together , we can do amazing things in only 30 minutes a week .
Bad news for electric car fans and the guys who build 'em .
Tesla has let go 90 % of their Detroit staff in the interest of " consolidating " their workforce in San Jose .
The lucky remainder gets to relocate to California , no expenses paid , to keep their jobs .
Then again , the economy is bad and Tesla is n't exactly raking in piles of cash .
We understand downsizing if it keeps the business afloat .
But sometimes it 's not what you say but how you say it .
Tesla fired notified the employees their office was closing down through a cryptic post on their blog , and fired them two days later in person .
There will also be some headcount reduction due to consolidation of operations .
In anticipation of moving vehicle engineering to our new HQ in San Jose , we are ramping down and will close our Rochester Hills office near Detroit .
Good communication , tightly knit engineering and a common company culture are of paramount importance as Tesla grows .

Two Americans , and one Japanese scientist , ( Martin Chalfie , Roger Tsien and Osamu Shimomura ) recently won a share of the Chemistry Nobel Prize for “ borrowing ” the glowing jellyfish trait and putting it to use .
[ social_buttons ]
Well , we ’re at it again , “ borrowing ” the magical and bizarre wonders offered up by the natural world , and using these wonders to make humans healthier and happier .
This time , we ’ve isolated that strange trait that makes jellyfish glow in dark waters , and we ’re using this trait for everything from cancer research to GMO’s .
They call it green fluorescent protein or GFP .
Scientists can use what makes jellyfish glow , to show how brain cells develop or how cancer spreads .
The glowing trait has also become important in biological engineering .
When scientists are trying to change an animal or a plant , oftentimes they will use the gene responsible for GFP as part of the change .
The “ glow ” will let them know whether the change has been successfully incorporated into the organism or not .
Scientists have learned how to produce this “ glowing ” gene in many different colors .
Last year a team led from Harvard University used different fluorescent proteins to color brain cells ( neurons ) in up to 90 different colors .
They called the image the “ brainbow , ” and published it in the journal Nature .

Using a lump of graphite , a piece of Scotch tape and a silicon wafer , Cornell researchers have created a balloonlike membrane that is just one atom thick -- but strong enough to contain gases under several atmospheres of pressure without popping .
And unlike your average party balloon -- or even a thick , sturdy glass container -- the membrane is ultra-strong , leak - proof and impermeable to even nimble helium atoms .
The research , by former Cornell graduate student Scott Bunch ( now an assistant professor at the University of Colorado ) , Cornell professor of physics Paul McEuen and Cornell colleagues , could lead to a variety of new technologies -- from novel ways to image biological materials in solution to techniques for studying the movement of atoms or ions through microscopic holes .
The work was conducted at the National Science Foundation - supported Cornell Center for Materials Research .
Graphene , a form of carbon atoms in a plane one atom thick , is the strongest material in the world , with tight covalent bonds in two dimensions that hold it together even as the thinnest possible membrane .
It 's also a semimetal , meaning it conducts electricity but changes conductivity with changes in its electrostatic environment .
Scientists discovered several years ago that isolating graphene sheets is as simple as sticking Scotch tape to pure graphite , then peeling it back and re-sticking it to a silicone dioxide wafer .
Peeled back from the wafer , the tape leaves a residue of graphite anywhere from one to a dozen layers thick -- and from there researchers can easily identify areas of single - layer - thick graphene .
advertisement
To test the material 's elasticity , the Cornell team deposited graphene on a wafer etched with holes , trapping gas inside graphene - sealed microchambers .
They then created a pressure differential between the gas inside and outside the microchamber .
With a tapping atomic force microscope , which measures the amount of deflecting force a tiny cantilever experiences as it scans nanometers over the membrane 's surface , the researchers watched the graphene as it bulged in or out in response to pressure changes up to several atmospheres without breaking .
They also turned the membrane into a tiny drum , measuring its oscillation frequency at different pressures .
They found that helium , the second - smallest element ( and the smallest testable gas , since hydrogen atoms pair up as a gas ) , stays trapped behind a wall of graphene -- again , even under several atmospheres of pressure .
" When you work the numbers , you would expect that nothing would go through , so it 's not a scientific surprise , " said McEuen .
" But it does tell you that the membrane is perfect " -- since even an atom - sized hole would allow the helium to escape easily .
Such a membrane could have all kinds of uses , he added .
It could form a barrier in an aquarium - like setup , for example , allowing scientists to image biological materials in solution through a nearly invisible wall without subjecting the microscope to the wet environment .
Or , researchers could poke atomic - sized holes in the membrane and use the system to study how single atoms or ions pass through the opening .
" This could serve as sort of an artificial analog of an ion channel in biology , " McEuen said -- or as a way to measure the properties of an atom by observing its effect on the membrane .
" You 're tying a macroscopic system to the properties of a single atom , " he said , " and that gives opportunities for all kinds of single atom sensors . "
The paper 's co-authors are Cornell physics graduate students Arend van der Zande and Jonathan Alden ; postdoctoral researcher Scott Verbridge ; and professors Jeevak Parpia and Harold Craighead .
Anyone happen to know where this gem is from ?
It ’s pure genius .

We need Dojo , especially parts of dojox , for pretty interface and graphics drawing ; a lot of work has already been put in .
We need Prototype for RJS and AJAX in an already well - established Rails project .
iframes
UPDATE 1 ( 10/22/08 )
object
Imagine the surprise I felt when I realized that our pretty Dojo applications were breaking as soon as we were putting them into the Ruby on Rails project .
Then it became clear , some parts of Dojo do n't play well with Prototype .
A Google search on Dojo + Prototype will give you muffled and possibly not applicable information .
This provides a huge dilemma : I know some of you purists out there think we should use one and not the other .
My response to you : No .
It came to me in the shower : .
The fundamental problem is that we can't load both Dojo and Prototype in the same page without consequences in our Dojo graphics code .
But what if we loaded an iframe that only had Dojo references into a Rails page which had Prototype loaded .
It works !
At least in Safari and Firefox , our main development platforms , the competing javascripts are kept separate .
I have n't tested in IE .
I realize this is n't the ideal solution people want to hear .
But in the end , communication between pages / iframes with separate javascript technologies is a much easier problem to deal with than getting two complex javascript technologies to function together in the same page .
Actually , I 'm now an advocate of using thetag as opposed to the iframe tag .
It validates as valid xhtml 1.1 , strict , with the same effect .
It also sounds better than using frames .
In 1929 , Edwin Hubble and Milton Humason reported on over a decade 's worth of observations and concluded that galaxies further away from us were receding faster than those close to us — observations that suggested an expanding universe .
In 1998 , while making observations of Type Ia supernovae ( SNe ) , a team of astronomers discovered that not only is the universe expanding , but the expansion is accelerating .
The common explanation for this acceleration is that some sort of exotic " dark energy " is acting on the universe .
The current standard model of cosmology ( ΛCDM ) postulates that 74 percent of the universe 's total mass - energy is comprised of this dark energy , while the remaining 26 percent is dominated by dark matter ( with normal matter comprising less than five percent of the total ) .
The existence of dark matter is supported by a wealth of experimental evidence , though its makeup is unknown .
Dark energy , on the other hand , has precisely one piece of experimental evidence : the accelerating expansion of the universe .
Now , a paper set to be published in an upcoming edition of Physical Review Letters ( arXiv pre-print available now ) by a trio of Oxford astrophysicists suggests a different explanation for the accelerating expansion .
In their proposal , dark energy does not exist at all and the supernovae data that led to scientists to propose it was improperly interpreted .
In coming to this conclusion , however , the three researchers have to throw out a philosophical principle that has guided astronomy for over 450 years .
Challenging Copernicus
In 1543 , Nicholas Copernicus ' revolutionary tome
De revolutionibus orbium coelestium ( On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres ) was first printed .
In the book , Copernicus put forth a heliocentric theory that eventually overthrew the Ptolemaic idea that the Earth stood at the center of the universe .
This single book produced modern astronomy and is credited with kick - starting the scientific revolution .
In it , Copernicus ( among other things ) put forth the concept that the Earth is not unique and does not occupy any sort of special position within the solar system .
A generalization of this principle — the earth does not occupy a favored position within the universe — has , along with Einstein 's equations , become the founding assumption of modern cosmology .
In the upcoming PRL paper , the authors postulate that we are indeed in a special location within the universe , specifically , " near the centre of a void where the local matter density is low . "
This is n't exactly a small void — it would need to be on the order of the size of the visible universe to get the new model to work .
Still , the earth would be near its center , which is a vaguely pre-Copernican notion and , as a side effect , the model does away with dark energy .
Unfortunately , it also does away with the notion that we can infer universal properties from local observations .
To flesh out this idea , the authors worked out the equations that would describe this sort of universe .
By examining the various properties predicted by the two universe models — the standard ΛCDM and the new smooth void model — they found that the two models would differ significantly in the region of the universe between a redshift of 0.5 and 0.1 .
The authors suggest that using a " Bayesian information criterion as a figure of merit , " could help determine whether reality is better described by one model or the other .
For real world data , the authors use the information returned from the first - year SNe Legacy Survey , a survey that consisted of 115 distinct supernovae .
Carrying out the Bayesian analysis to see how well each model fit the data obtained by the survey , the researchers found that neither of the two options was decisively favored , although the ΛCDM model was found to be slightly more accurate .
The authors note that current surveys focus on supernovae that existed at either a low redshift or very high redshift , not in the range where the authors predict large differences between the two models .
Upcoming Joint Dark Energy Mission ( JDEM ) surveys are expected to examine over 2,000 supernovae with redshifts between 0.1 and 1.7 .
By simulating data in this redshift range , the team decided that JDEM data will eventually allow scientists to distinguish between the models through the Bayesian analysis .
This work represents a major departure from the currently accepted model of the universe , and it rejects a long - held tenet of astronomy and cosmology .
Using the currently available data , the authors were unable to show that their model is closer to reality than the commonly accepted ΛCDM description of the universe .
Perhaps one of the biggest repercussions of this work , if correct , would be that we could no longer rely on our local measurements to describe the universe as a whole .
New ideas
In addition to the concepts put forth , this paper illustrates nicely how science works .
Pseudoscience often argues that controversial or contrarian papers and ideas never get published , suggesting that the " establishment " wo n't listen to new ideas .
But this paper puts forth a completely novel idea , and in the process overturns a long held philosophical pillar of astronomy , and yet it is set to be published in one of the top - tier physics journals .
The main idea put forth here is vastly different from the generally - held consensus of how the universe works ; however , as in all of science , every idea is tentative .
Future surveys of supernovae may tell us whether or not we are special in relation to the rest of the universe .

Rep. Thaddeus G. McCotter , Michigan Republican , has no problem dividing the world into twos : globalist and traditionalist Republicans , optimists and Irish Catholics .
And when it comes to Democrats , pacifists and hawkish Jews .
“ Despite some of the neoconservative Jewish members that they have that are very hawkish , ” he said , “ they generally tend to be more of a pacifist , multilateral party . ”
In a 90 - minute interview Wednesday with The Washington Times , Mr. McCotter displayed the kind of bluntness that brought him attention during the recent debate over the Wall Street rescue plan .
The chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee criticized the plan as a “ $ 700 billion bag of dung [ left ] on taxpayers ’ doorsteps . ”
Yesterday , he said of his fellow Republicans : “ What you really have are globalists versus traditionalists .
Globalists tend to view America as an economy , not a country .
The traditionalists tend to view it as a country : a very delicate microcosm , a collection of individuals with different hopes , dreams , aspirations . ”
He depicted himself as a traditionalist .

Optimism is n’t necessarily ingrained in the Celtic mind . ”
In addition , when discussed the other party , he referred to “ the Jewish coalition within the Democratic Party . ”
That group , he explained , was “ the Lantos school of foreign policy , [ the ] more hawkish ” branch .
Rep . Tom Lantos of California , who was Jewish , was chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
Mr. Lantos , who died in February , initially supported the war in Iraq .
Asked whether he meant “ pro-Israel ” rather than “ Jewish , ” Mr. McCotter said he did not .
Mr. Lantos , he said , “ was n’t just pro-Israel . …
Tom was anti-communist . ”
And then he went on .
“ Their support for Israel … also tends to make them more hawkish on foreign affairs than the vast majority of their Democratic colleagues , ” he said .
“ A large part of the Jewish Democrats tend to be more hawkish in terms of representing the interests of the United States in dealing with terrorism than do the progressive caucus of the Democratic Party . ”
He contrasted his own love of labels with other lawmakers who display an inordinate fear of the word “ communist . ”
“ I sit with people in the United States Congress that have told me to use the phrase ‘ communist China ’ is offensive and ridiculous and no longer appropriate .
I then point out to these people that they call themselves communists . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Governments and central banks of the world 's leading nations have taken unprecedented coordinated actions in the past month to help out battered financial markets and economies around the globe .
Yet , the global meltdown in stocks continued Friday .
And this lack of confidence and sense of panic has left experts wondering what can be done next to assure investors and get banks to operate normally once again .
" They 've already thrown the kitchen sink at the problem , " said Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute .
" I guess the next step is the bathroom sink . "
Rates going to zero ?
More rate cuts by central banks seem to be almost a certainty at this point .
But there 's only so much farther the Federal Reserve can go .
The federal funds rate is now 1.5 % and many investors think the Fed will lower it to 1 % after its two - day meeting that ends next Wednesday .
Some investors are even betting the Fed will cut rates by three - quarters of a percentage point to 0.75 % , which would mark the first time rates were ever below 1 % .
There is also more talk than ever before of the U.S. central bank lowering rates to 0 % if financial markets do not improve soon .
But economists suggest that a cut to 0 % would do little to get credit flowing when compared to the moves already made by the Fed .
" The Fed 's intention is very clear .
They 're prepared to flood the economy with money , " said Sung Won Sohn , economics professor at Cal State University Channel Islands .
The Bank of Japan cut its benchmark rate to just about zero and left it there for much of the 1990s .
But that did little to end a decade - long economic slump there .
Rates in Japan today are 0.5 % so Japan also has little room to cut .
The European Central Bank 's rate is 3.75 % , while the Bank of England 's rate stands at 4.5 % .
If both cut rates next week in coordination with the Fed , it 's possible they could follow with additional cuts of their own the following week .
More loans to businesses
The Fed has stepped up its lending to banks through a relatively new program known as the term auction facility and is now allowing Wall Street firms to borrow directly from the Fed through its discount window .
It has also tried to get credit flowing by announcing plans to lend perhaps $ 1 trillion or more to major businesses through the use of commercial paper , the primary form of borrowing those large companies use to fund their day - to - day operations .
Some economists say what 's needed next are direct Fed loans to an even broader range of businesses that are not large enough to issue commercial paper .
Former Federal Reserve Governor Lyle Gramley has suggested the Fed could do so by guaranteeing a wide range of loans to small and large businesses with liberal underwriting standards .
Robert Brusca of FAO Economics said the Fed 's district banks could make their own direct loans to businesses .
" When you tell businesses you 're going to be there for them , you 're also telling banks ' There 's not that much risk for you , ' " said Brusca .
Of course , the Fed alone can't fix the struggling U.S. economy .
Congress is holding hearings to discuss a new round of economic stimulus , which could include loans or other help to state and local governments that are facing layoffs due to sudden budget short falls .
The Treasury Department has authority from Congress to pump $ 700 billion into the financial sector and it has already used that newly - passed law to make $ 125 billion in investments in nine of the nation 's largest banks .
According to published reports Friday , the Treasury Department is close to announcing that other banks will soon receive investments and is also said to be considering taking equity stakes in insurance companies .
Other experts argue that the government will also soon have to bail out the nation 's cash - starved automakers in order to save that industry .
Weaker economies will need help
American banks , insurers and other industries are n't the only ones around the world in need of assistance either .
The credit crisis is now clearly a global phenomenon .
The International Monetary Fund , which is essentially funded by the United States , Europe and Japan , is in talks to provide loans to help prop up the currencies and economies of Hungary , Iceland , Pakistan , and Ukraine .
The IMF also disclosed Wednesday that it was about to start discussions with Belarus .
Jay Bryson , international economist at Wachovia , said more countries are likely to need help from the IMF .
And he added that the size of these rescues are also probably going to be much greater than in the past .
" [ The IMF has ] already said [ it ] would allow countries to borrow up to four times their previous quotas , " he said .
Time for a market holiday ?
One of the most radical ideas to help end the credit crisis was suggested by Nouriel Roubini , professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University .
Roubini gave a speech in London Thursday suggesting that world financial markets might need to be shutdown for a week or two to stem the ongoing panic .
On Friday morning , he added that Russia 's decision on Friday to shut down the Moscow stock market until Tuesday was a sign that shutting markets was no longer an unthinkable option .
" We have reached the scary point where the dysfunctional behavior of financial markets has destructive effects on the financial system and - much worse - on the real economies , " he wrote in a note Friday morning .
" So it is time to think about more radical policy actions and government interventions . "
Other experts said such a step is unlikely to be taken .
But they conceded it was far more of a possibility than they would have thought until very recently .
" If you had said this four weeks ago , we all would have laughed .
But clearly a lot of things have happened over the last four weeks , " said Bryson .
" Now the most I can say is it 's a measure of last resort . "
But other economists say it's not clear the fall in global stocks and problems in financial markets can be stopped any time soon , regardless of what actions the Fed and other central banks take in the next few days .
That 's because the damage already done by the credit crisis will lead to tighter credit and a drop in corporate earnings and stock prices .
Further declines in U.S. home prices are also likely , which will only create more losses in the financial sector .
" There 's room for another 30 % fall in the stock market given the forecasts on earnings , " said Christian Nenegatti , lead analyst for RGE Monitor , a New York economic research and analysis firm .
" It does n't look like you can be bearish enough in this environment . "
China has fuelled fears over a global recession by warning that the financial crisis is damaging its economic growth , as South Korea became the latest government to launch a banking rescue .
Data released today showed that China 's gross domestic product expanded by 9 % in the third quarter of 2008 , down from 10.1 % for the second quarter .
Although this is still extremely healthy compared with other major economies , it is below analyst expectations - and the first time GDP growth has dipped below 10 % in almost three years .
China 's government blamed the lower growth on the world economic slowdown , which means less demand for Chinese exports .
" The growth rate of the world economy has slowed down noticeably .
There are more uncertain and volatile factors in the international economic climate , " said spokesman Li Xiaochao of the National Bureau of Statistics .
" All these factors have started to release their negative impact on China 's economy . "
After years of boom , there are signs that the Chinese economy may now be suffering from the fallout from the credit crunch .
GDP growth has now slowed for the last five consecutive five quarters .
The country is a huge consumer of raw materials , and last week Rio Tinto spooked the mining sector by warning that demand from China was slowing down .
Analysts believe that GDP growth will slow further in the fourth quarter , as the impact of the financial crisis bites .
" A gloomy outlook lies ahead after the third quarter , and concerns about the slowdown now outweigh concerns about inflation , " said Chen Jinren , an analyst at Huatai Securities .
China 's toymaking industry is under particular pressure , following a series of safety scares last year .
Last week more than 6,000 employees lost their jobs when Smart Union , a major toy manufacturer in Dongguan , closed .
It blamed a fall in demand from the US .
$ 100 bn Korea move welcomed
Stockmarkets across Asia recorded gains overnight - after a week of volatility - as traders welcomed a $ 130 bn bail - out ( £ 74.32bn ) of South Korea 's banking sector .
Yesterday , the South Korea government announced it would take fresh action to support its banks ; $ 30 bn of fresh liquidity is on offer , plus loan guarantees totalling $ 100bn .
The move came just days after ratings agency Standard & Poor 's put the country 's five biggest banks on a ratings watch .
S&P warned that they could struggle to repay foreign loans , as the South Korean won has fallen by a third against other currencies since January .
Finance minister Kang Man-soo told reporters in Seoul that the measures would " allay fears in the financial market , " and " avoid placing domestic banks at a competitive disadvantage in terms of overseas funding " .
The news sent the country 's stockmarket , the Kospi , up by over 2 % in late trading .
Japan 's Nikkei index closed 3.6 % higher , recovering some of its recent losses .
But in a further sign that the crisis is far from over , ING has received a € 10bn ( £ 7.7 bn ) injection from the Dutch government to shore up its capital ratios .
The bank denied it was in financial trouble , insisting that the recapitalising of UK and US banks meant it had to follow suit .
New iJET Solar Cell is as Easy to Make as Pizza
October 5th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
An Australian scientist has developed a new method of manufacturing solar cells using nothing more than some nail polish remover , a pizza oven and a standard inkjet printer .
The iJET technique is so easy and cheap to carry out that it could revolutionize access to solar technology in the developing world .
In a recent radio interview ( audio ) , Nicole Kuepper , a 23 year - old PhD student at the University of New South Wales , explained the process .
Firstly , she takes a standard silicon solar cell and sprays it with a substance similar to nail polish .
Then , she inkjet prints something like nail polish remover onto the wafer in a set pattern in the same way that you ’d print a normal photo .
This enables the creation of high - resolution patterns on the cell at a very low cost .
The cell is then metallized with an aluminum spray and baked at a very low temperature of around 550 fahrenheit in “ something like a pizza oven . ”
Kuepper went on to explain how solar cells are currently manufactured using expensive “ high - tech , high - cleanliness equipment , ” too costly for many countries in the developing world , adding , “ we ’re trying to do away with all of that so that so we can ensure that these solar cells can actually be manufactured in a developing country ’s environment that you might find in say Ghana or Laos for example . ”

Voters in Detroit on Election Day 2008 .
That huge voter turnout ?
Did n't happen
Despite widespread predictions of record turnout in this year ’s presidential election , roughly the same portion of eligible voters cast ballots in 2008 as in 2004 .
Between 60.7 percent and 61.7 percent of the 208.3 million eligible voters cast ballots this year , compared with 60.6 percent of those eligible in 2004 , according to a voting analysis by American University political scientist Curtis Gans , an authority on voter turnout .

He estimated that between 126.5 million and 128.5 million eligible voters cast ballots this year , versus 122.3 million four years ago .
Gans said the gross number of ballots cast in 2008 was the highest ever , even though the percentage was not substantially different from 2004 , because there were about 6.5 million more people registered to vote this time around .
The historic candidacy of President - elect Barack Obama , as well as the emphasis his campaign put on early voting and Election Day turnout , led many media and academic pundits to speculate that voter turnout this year would increase dramatically .
In the run-up to the vote , even John McCain ’s top pollster , Bill McInturff , joined other experts in predicting that turnout might surpass 130 million .
In 2004 , turnout was 6 percentage points higher than in 2000 .
But Gans said he believed it did not spike more this year because fewer Republicans went to the polls .
While it may be premature to draw conclusions , Gans said , it appeared that Republican voting declined 1.3 points , to 28.7 percent of the electorate , while Democratic turnout rose from 28.7 percent to 31.3 percent of the electorate .
The Democratic increase struck some analysts as modest , considering the party ’s immense get - out - the - vote operation , strong anti-Bush sentiment and Obama 's popularity .
“ It sort of calls into question some of the vaunted ground game discussion , the whole turnout machine , ” said a Democratic strategist who did not want to be quoted by name criticizing Obama ’s campaign .
“ The GOTV effort was redoubled in 2008 compared to 2004 , but it did not seem to make that big of a difference . ”
Gans said that record disapproval of President Bush , the global financial crisis and surveys showing that three in four Americans believe the nation is on the “ wrong track ” contributed to the relatively high turnout this year .
“ When you have that backdrop , you will get a rise in turnout , but it ’s not durable , ” Gans said .
“ We have a long - term disengagement problem that will not be solved by a singular election . ”
But Obama 's historic candidacy probably was responsible for bringing more youths to the polls this year , and it also helped explain what Gans said was the apparently significant rise in African - American turnout .
Exit polls found that blacks constituted 13 percent of the electorate , a 2 percentage - point gain over 2004 , Gans said ; the increase may be even more than that , he said .
Still , some key states saw a decline in overall voter participation .
In Ohio , which has had aggressive GOTV campaigns in the past two presidential cycles , the number of voters appeared to decline from 5,722,443 in 2004 to 5,595,966 in 2008 , according to the final but unofficial tally by the Ohio secretary of state .
Turnout in those years dropped from 72 percent to 67 percent .
In Pennsylvania , 5,851,730 voters cast ballots with 99.8 percent of votes counted — a rise of nearly 690,000 voters over 2004 , according its secretary of state .
But due to higher registration , the percent of eligible voters who cast ballots dropped from 68.96 in 2004 to 66.8 this year .
Official turnout numbers are not yet available .
Gans , whose calculations were based on the AP ’s unofficial vote count and actual votes certified by a state ’s chief election official , said that 22 states posted an increase in turnout .
The largest increases were in North Carolina , where turnout rose 9.4 points , and Georgia , where it rose 6.7 points , he said .
Both states have large black populations .
The highest turnouts overall occurred in Minnesota , where nearly 76 percent of eligible voters cast ballots , and in Wisconsin , where 71 percent of those registered voted .
Voting in the past two presidential elections topped 60 percent — higher than in many previous cycles .
The last time voter participation routinely broke 60 percent was in the 1950s and '60s .
In 1996 , barely half of voters cast ballots .
Nationally , the 2008 voter turnout was roughly equivalent to 1968 in percentage terms .
Gans said that when taking into account the disenfranchisement of blacks , this year ’s turnout was below the 1960 and 1964 presidential campaigns .
For example , if blacks had been allowed to vote in the 1960 Kennedy - Nixon race , he said , turnout probably would have reached about 67 percent , as opposed to the official Federal Election Commission tally of about 63 percent .
Interestingly , Gans found that state efforts to make voting more convenient — for instance , through programs for early or mail - in voting — did not significantly boost turnout .
Of the 14 states with the largest turnout increases , only six had so - called convenience voting initiatives , while in the 13 states with the greatest decline in voting , 12 had some form of convenience voting .

Eric Raymond , editor of the [ Computer ] Jargon File and author of The Cathedral and The Bazaar and a number of well - used but little - known pieces of software , is working on a book , putatively titled Why C++
Is Not Our Favorite Programming Language .
In his recent announcement , he lays out why he wants to “ harpoon the Great White Whale of programming languages ” :
C++ is an overcomplexity generator .
It was designed to solve what turned out to be the wrong problems ; as a result , it lives in an unhappy valley between two utility peaks in language - design space , with neither the austere elegance of C nor the expressiveness and capability of modern interpreted languages .
The layers , patches , and added features designed to lift it out of that valley have failed to do so , resulting in a language that is bloated , obfuscated , unwieldy , rigid , and brittle .
Programs written in C++ tend to inherit all these qualities .
In the remainder of this paper we will develop this charge into a detailed critique of C++ and the style it encourages .
While we do not intend to insult the designers of C++ , we will not make excuses for them either .
They repeatedly made design choices that were well - intentioned , understandable in context , and wrong .
We think it is long past time for the rest of us to stop suffering for those mistakes .
C++ is my own favourite programming language , not that I am any great expert , given that the only other language in which I have brought any other project to fruition is Java , and that was in 2004 .
This is not to say that C++ does not have its fair share of annoyances , but as the title is not Why C++
Sucks but simply why it ’s not their favourite , I will lay out why it remains mine , and more to the point , why it endures despite the existence of alternatives such as Java .
To be fair , I do n’t know if Raymond and his friend Rob Landley have the same bugbears about C++ as the people who have put out various “ reformed ” object - oriented C- derived programming languages , but the results usually involve the stripping out of not only the irritating features and bloat , which may be a consequence of layering object - oriented features onto an existing language , but a whole lot of useful features as well .
The usual suspects are operator overloading , multiple inheritance and the macro preprocessor .
Java got rid of all three , C# and D , a more recent attempt , get rid of all but the first .
( Note : I will attempt to explain the terminology in layman ’s terms . )
Operator overloading is programming an operator ( i.e. a mathematical symbol or brackets ) to do what you want them to .
This means that , when you ’re writing code to handle lists or other data structures , you can use symbols , or allow the programmers who use your code to use them , to manipulate or chop up their data by using the plus sign to add a bit onto the end of the string or list , to use an equals sign to test for whether two strings are identical , and to use square brackets ( as was common in C ) to identify a particular item in the list .
You can not do any of this in Java , so to identify item three in a list , you have to type something like “ list.item ( 3 ) ” , rather than simply “ list [ 3 ] ” .
The reason commonly given for stripping out this feature is that it facilitates obfuscated code ( i.e. code whose meaning cannot be easily discerned when another person takes over its maintenance or wants to use it to build something for himself ) .
However , they are also commonly given perfectly sane and logical meanings , such as + for adding and = for testing sameness .
Multiple inheritance is described here ; it means that your class ( a sophisticated type of data structure , which includes functions as well as data ) can include the features of two or more classes , rather than just one .
A common criticism of it is that nobody ever uses it ; Jesse Liberty , in his book on C# , had said that in years of teaching C++ , he never used it other than to demonstrate to students that it could be done , and he ’s never missed it as a C# programmer .
The toolkit I use to write the blogging client I used to write this article offers multiple inheritance as one way of implementing forms designed in their form designing program , Qt Designer , and I use it myself ( not all the time , but some of the time ) .
So there goes the claim that multiple inheritance has no uses or that nobody uses it .
Finally , the macro preprocessor .
This is a means of getting the compiler to substitute one piece of text for another when the program is built .
What use could that possibly be ?
For one thing , you might just want to have to save a regular long bit of typing , but macros have other uses .
Suppose you do n’t know which version of a particular library your end user will be using , and perhaps a given class will be present in a later version but not an earlier one ; you might want to allow the newer class to be used if it ’s there , and the older one if it ’s not , and use the same word to refer to them both because they have similar interfaces , and perhaps the library tells you ( via a macro ) which version is present , which enables you to exclude bits from your program which only pertain to the newer library .
I use this feature myself in QTM ; newer versions have a lightweight plain - text editor while older ones do n’t .
I can do this in C++ because of its preprocessor , and more to the point , I can exclude bits that are not needed from the finished product , which makes things a bit more efficient .
The preprocessor even allows for features to be added to C++ , such as the “ signals and slots ” feature in Qt ( signals and slots means pre-arranging for one thing to be done when another thing happens , such as a web page to be loaded when you type in an address and press Enter ) .
Most of the methods I have seen for implementing this feature in C++ use macros , and although there are alternatives , the macro - based system used in Qt is the cleanest and least complicated I have come across .
The Jargon File has an entry for what he calls a “ bondage and discipline languages ” , which is a language “ that , though ostensibly general - purpose , is designed so as to enforce an author ’s theory of ‘ right programming ’ even though said theory is demonstrably inadequate for systems hacking or even vanilla general - purpose programming ” .
A typical example is Pascal , about which Brian Kernighan , co-originator of the Unix operating system and documentor of C , wrote an essay entitled Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language , the reasons essentially being that it is a teaching language unsuited for serious programming , lacking an awful lot of functionality that C programmers ( C++ had not yet been invented then ) take for granted .
Kernighan noted that Pascal had been extended in various ways , but that these extensions resulted in various incompatible versions of Pascal ; one criticism of C++ is that , because of its complexity , different programmers learned different subsets of it , such that these programmers have difficulty working together on a project in the same language .
C++ is the opposite of Pascal ; it gives you everything that C does ( and Pascal does n’t ) , and layers object oriented features on top of it , basing them on C ’s existing data structure syntax ( rather than a bolted - on one , as in Objective - C ) .
Perhaps some might say “ C++ has the exact opposite problems to Pascal ” , but others might say it gives you freedom , treats you like a proper programmer rather than like a student , and allows you to program “ straight to the metal ” .
Many of the “ C++ replacements ” are not designed for the last purpose ; they are designed for programming virtual machines , i.e. other computer programs , rather than actual computers , and often for less serious applications , such as in - house database front - ends .
There are very few proper applications , especially commercial applications , written in Java or C# , simply because they are not as fast as any program which actually runs on your computer .
Java and C# are a step away from the freedom of C and C++ towards a dictated programming style ; they hide features of C++ , such as pointers , to make it less easy to make mistakes , when the ability to use or not use pointers is power and flexibility , even if there are more pitfalls .
Java makes it easy to “ finalise ” a class , meaning anyone who wants to use the class in their own programs cannot build their own classes on top of it .
This is possible in C++ as well , but it does not seem to be as common .
Java ’s string class is final , for example , as is the window class in the Standard Widget Toolkit ( SWT ) used in Eclipse .
Of course , some might say it ’s not good programming practice to put all your application ’s functionality into the window class , but it ’s a programmer ’s choice .
If I pay money for a class library , I do not wish to be dictated to how to use it ; if it ’s free , it is hardly logical that you can freely redistribute or modify a class , but you cannot subclass it !
( Perhaps this is compensated by the fact that in C++ , any function in a class can be declared virtual , meaning that it can be overridden by having a function of the same name in a subclass , but the default is that it is not ; by contrast , all functions in Java classes are virtual . )
Then there is the added verbosity of Java : the fact that you cannot put all your public , protected or private functions or data in a list , with “ private : ” or whatever at the top , as you can in a C++ class header , for example .
You have to put public or private next to each item .
Your “ main ” function has to be “ public static void Main ” , when in fact Main is always “ public static void ” , so why can you not just put “ Main ” ?
Why does Main have to be void anyway , preventing you returning an exit value ( to tell whichever program called yours how it finished , i.e. whether the job got done or not ) ?
Why does Main have to be in a class at all ?
Bjarne Stroustrup , the inventor of C++ , is quoted as saying that “ within C++ , there is a much smaller and cleaner language struggling to get out ” , and Raymond adds that many hackers would say that this language was Java .
However , Java is a stripped - down language intended for programming a closed system in a specific style , while C++ gives you the computer , allowing you to manipulate objects as flexibly as C allows with raw data .
Perhaps somebody can come up with a new language which does all these things as well as C++ does now , with all the power that C++ has and Java takes away , and none of the annoying features .
Otherwise , we will end up with yet another stripped - down C - like object - oriented language , probably with yet another standard library with a different vocabulary , and which is incompatible with all the others - a problem which C++ , despite its groups of programmers who learn different subsets of C++ , does not have : they can all at least use what others develop .
I find some of the complaints about C++ to be petty .
One complaint was that , on encountering the “ < <” symbol used in a “ Hello world ” program in a popular C++ tutorial , he “ got lost ” .
This is the fault of that one book ( my tutors at Kingston University did not explain it all that well , either ) , not the language ; it is a function disguised by a symbol .
He also mentions that he asked “ what ’s with the colons ? ” , presumably meaning the “ : : ” operator , known as the scope resolution operator .
This actually makes it clear whether what is to the right of it pertains to the class itself ( like a public static method ) , or to an object of a class ; why would anyone want to get rid of an operator which makes this explicit ?
A few years ago , in response to a question I posed at a Linux Expo in London , I was told that C++ sucked , and was for programmers who could not implement object - orientation in C , as the GTK + graphical toolkit supposedly does .
Matthias Warkus , in The Official Gnome 2 Developers ’ Guide , notes that “ to put it bluntly , defining a class in GObject [ the basis for GTK ’s so - called object orientation ] is n’t easy ” and that the procedure would “ look quite awkward ” to anyone used to C++ or any other object - oriented language .
The FAQ for GTKmm , the C++ interface to GTK , claims that “ the derivation of new widgets in GTK +
C code is so complicated and error prone that almost no C coders do it ” .
However , C++ offers a ready interface to a C - based graphical library .
It , and not Java or C# , let alone Python , is the logical choice for developing non-trivial , object - oriented graphical applications .
Yet another complaint , from this article ( not by Eric Raymond , who says that the author “ understands that C++ sucks , but he ’s enumerating symptoms rather than dissecting causes ” ) also entitled Why C++
Is Not My Favorite Programming Language , gives the example of a Perl script which manages to grab content off the web and output it in five lines , while the equivalent in the C++ library he chooses to use as an example takes twenty .
Qt can do the same in considerably fewer lines ( note that SomeClass can be any subclass of QObject , which provides Qt ’s signals and slots , http is an object of class QHttp and textBrowserObject is an object of class QTextBrowser , both of which are QObject subclasses ) :
SomeClass:: someFunction ( ) { http = new QHttp ( " www.demiurgestudios.com " ) ; connect ( http , SIGNAL ( done ( bool ) ) , this , SLOT ( handleDone ( bool ) ) ) ; http->get ( " / blog/2007/10/why-c-is-not-my - " " favorite - programming.html " ) ; } SomeClass : : handleDone ( bool error ) { if ( !error ) { textBrowserObject->setHtml( QString ( http->readAll( ) ) ) ; } }
That ’s twelve lines ( excluding whitespace and with the connect and get calls each reduced to one ; they have been split to fit them on the page ) , and five of actual tests or calls to functions .
Why does the result of the GET request have to be in another method ?
Because Qt ’s HTTP requests are asynchronous , meaning that they do not block a graphical user interface ’s operations ( i.e. make it look like it ’s crashed ) , so your program can keep working while the page is loading .
However , even though this shows that it ’s possible to write a C++ library to get an HTML document from a website and display it in less than 20 lines , the fact is that Perl does this in five lines because it ’s a scripting language , and is thus necessarily a high - level language which takes care of the low - level business for you , while C++ is a low - level programming language , or rather a potentially multi - level one .
Someone , somewhere , wrote the code ( in C ) that ’s behind those five lines of Perl , and there is probably more than twenty lines of it , just as someone wrote what ’s behind the five lines of C++ by which you can do it in Qt .
The reason the author of that essay was frustrated is that nobody did , in the case of the library in his example .
To conclude , if C++ is to be overhauled , it needs to be in favour of something as powerful as it is , and not yet another stripped - down object - oriented language like Java .
It needs to provide ready access to the C library and all the things the “ safe ” C++ derivatives lack .
It needs to treat me like an adult , giving me the world inside my computer , not a walled garden .
Can Raymond and Landley come up with an alternative that fits this bill ?
Then again , perhaps I am reading too much into all this , because in my experience , Qt demonstrates that producing a library which offers a sane C++ programming environment is possible .
If I were to go inside the former Trolltech offices ( now the Qt Software unit of Nokia ) and repeat the claim , which originates here but cited in a comment on Eric Raymond ’s blog entry , that there “ is no reason to use C++ for new projects ” , I would be presumed drunk and escorted out of the building .
I would like to know what the developers of Qt would change , if anything , about C ++.

New marijuana rules dismay officials
Posted Thursday , November 6 , 2008 8:19 am
More than 65 percent of Bay State voters supported Question 2 , which replaces criminal penalties for possessing one ounce or less of pot with a civil fine of $ 100 , or roughly the cost of a speeding ticket .
In Berkshire County , 60.3 percent of voters  or 38,787 people  supported Question 2 , while 39.7 percent  or 25,586 people  opposed the measure , which goes into effect in 30 days .
Under the law , those caught with marijuana must pay a $ 100 fine and hand over the illegal drug .
Minors caught with an ounce or less also must attend drug education and treatment classes and perform community service .
But local police officials are not happy with the measure .
Not only does it send the wrong message to Berkshire County 's younger residents , they said , but it could cost taxpayers and lead to a bureaucratic nightmare .
The new law will raise more legal questions than it answers and complicate drug laws rather than simplify them , according to officials .
" It 's definitely going to make it more complicated for us to do our job , " said Pittsfield Police Capt .
Michael J. Wynn , the ranking officer in charge of the Berkshires ' largest police department .
" It sets up this huge realm of questions . "
Wynn said the Pittsfield Police Department will have to develop a new citation and documentation system , for example , leading to administrative and legal headaches , not to mention additional costs .
It also creates a whole new set of questions for a police officer who confronts a person caught with just under an ounce of pot .
" Can we interview them ?
Can we interrogate them ? "
Wynn wondered .
" It 's going to be real tricky to figure out what this means , and there 's no question that people are going to try to take advantage of this . "
Berkshire District Attorney David F. Capeless said he was surprised by the level of support for the marijuana proposition .
" The size of the vote in favor of Question 2 , to me , indicates that there is a deep - seated belief among the public that marijuana is not a big deal , and that the present laws are unduly harsh to users , " Capeless said .
" As the father of two boys entering their teenage years , I hope that they will not be encountering a community attitude that says ' smoking dope is OK , ' " he said .
Law enforcement officials yesterday warned that it would take time to institute the new law .
Cape & Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe , the head of the statewide district attorney 's association , said the state will be forced to establish a new system to adapt to the law , including retraining officers .

" We have a Registry of Motor Vehicles in this state , " said O'Keefe .
" But we do n't have a registry of dope smokers yet .
But , apparently , we will now . "
Capeless echoed similar concerns , pointing out that local police agencies are not equipped to implement a new civil fine system for marijuana possession .
Implementing the law " raises some very serious problems , " said Capeless , " because the proposition has never called for the provisions that would implement the details of the measure . "
" I only ask now :
Who 's going to enforce collections of the fines ?
Who 's going to oversee that kids are going to these treatment programs ?
In fact , who 's going to pay for these programs ? "
Capeless said .
While the state Legislature could change , amend or nullify the binding referendum , lawmakers so far have not launched any effort to block implementation of Question 2 , which was supported by 1,938,366 Massachusetts residents and opposed by 1,036,050 .
Clarksburg was the only Berkshire community to defeat the measure , and just barely ; 452 residents voted against Question 2 , while 422 voted in favor .
Every other Berkshire town , from Adams to Windsor , passed the measure by healthy margins .

In North Adams  the county 's second city  3,392 residents approved the measure , while 2,364 opposed it .
The Yes - No vote in Great Barrington was 2,478 to 1,114 .
Dalton Police Chief John W. Bartels Jr. said the new law will have a ripple effect in local schools , particularly in situations where a student is found with a joint , or marijuana cigarette .
" Procedurally , it could effect school polices now that it's not a criminal offense , " Bartels said .
And it could increase the incidence of " driving while stoned , " according to officials .
" I think that it will promote a lot of use while operating a vehicle .
I just have that feeling , particularly with a lot of our younger people , " Bartels said .
" If it 's just a ticket , it 's going to be , ' OK , I 'll take my chances . ' "
Massachusetts State Police Lt. Joseph P. McDyer , the head of the Berkshire County Drug Task Force , predicted the new law will cost " millions of dollars to enact , " the brunt of which will be borne by taxpayers .
" It 's going to cost my unit more time and money to enforce this if it becomes a civil law , " McDyer said .
" Would you rather have your police officers waiting in court  getting paid overtime  for a $ 100 civil violation instead of being out in the street ? "

The new law also raises search - and - seizure questions , according to police officials .
" If I see a guy standing on the corner smoking a joint , that 's illegal , " McDyer said .
" But , can I search him for other drugs ?
Do I write him a ticket ?
Are we going to bring scales out and measure every seizure we make ?
No one has thought this out . "
The law , which will take " money and manpower " to enforce , " is overly burdensome to the police officer and to the court system , " he said .
But what most irks McDyer , he said , is the attempt to water down penalties for illegal drugs :
" So it 's illegal to possesses ( marijuana ) , but you can have it and do n't have to tell us where you got it . "
The veteran narcotics investigator said the law is just the " next step toward legalizing marijuana . "
Meanwhile , supporters of the ballot question say police officials are panicking for no reason , noting that many departments already are equipped to issue citations on a range of non-criminal offenses .
Supporters maintain that the new law will spare people from having a criminal record , which can make it difficult to get a job , a student loan or gain access to public housing .
" It 's going to end the creation of thousands of new people being involved in the criminal justice system each year and refocus law enforcement resources on violent crime , " said Whitney A. Taylor of the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy , the major proponent of Question 2 in Massachusetts .
Steven Epstein , an attorney who founded the Georgetown - based Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition in 1990 , said police and prosecutors should stop " whining " about the law , which was endorsed by a majority of Bay State voters .
" The question ( for law enforcement officials ) is not how do we implement this law , " Epstein said .
" The question is how do we implement the will of 1,938,366 registered voters of the commonwealth of Massachusetts . "
Epstein expressed no sympathy for police officers who say it will be difficult to measure an amount of marijuana that is seized in the field .
" If they 're really concerned , they can get a little postal scale .
What 's the big deal ? "
Epstein said .
Massachusetts is the 12th state in the nation to decriminalize possession of relatively small amounts of marijuana , though police officials reject the notion that an ounce is a small quantity of the drug .
According to law enforcement estimates , an ounce can produce between 50 to 100 joints , depending on how much marijuana is used .

Could this been the ultimate in geekwear ?
I think so !
The Stormtrooper Hoodie from Marc Ecko is the perfect way to establish your geek cred with your friends and family .
And the zip - up front that closes all the way over the face to make the helmet is just awesome .
We like the somewhat more subtle Boba Fett hoodie , but are a little disappointed they did n't do the zip - up helmet with that one too .
They would n't have been able to keep them in stock if they 'd don that !
( warning : yes , they are sadly rather expensive )

Joe Biden is no Sarah Palin when it comes to fundraising appeal .
The latest campaign finance reports show Barack Obama received only a minor fundraising bump after he named Biden as his running mate , although he raked in huge sums as the Democratic Co nvention closed and John McCain named Palin as his running mate .
Obama outspent his Republican rival in August , shelling out $ 53.5 million on television and mass mailings , as well as polling , food and lodging .
McCain spent $ 40 million but also benefited from $ 20 million spent by the Republican National Committee , Federal Election Commission reports showed today .
Obama's $ 66 - million haul in August was almost $ 20 million more than McCain's .
One of the most striking differences was the sums they raised after they announced their running mates .
McCain received $ 8.8 million in the two days after he announced that Alaska Gov. Palin would be his running mate .
Obama received what for him is a modest sum -- $ 1.7 million -- on the day he announced his choice of Biden and $ 694,000 the following day .
Obama ’s campaign aides said he received additional ....

The Rev Nick Martin , Michael Disney 's prison chaplain , conducts the funeral Every year thousands of recently deceased people are buried not by their loved ones , but by their local council - often because they have no known family to make the arrangements .
Who attends these funerals and how are they organised ?
As the plain wooden coffin holding Michael Disney 's body is lowered slowly into an unmarked grave , the mourners who knew him are out - numbered by people there because they are paid to be .
If he had any family , none of them turned up .
The handful of friends hunched against a chill wind under a granite - grey autumn sky knew Michael from the streets or from prison .
The rest are from the funeral directors or the council .
The only sign of his grave in the small cemetery outside Exeter is now a mound of freshly - dug earth .
Soon you will not be able to find it at all .
Homeless and a heroin addict , Michael was found dead in a park in Exeter aged 30 .
With no known relatives , he became one of hundreds of people each year whose final resting place is a multiple grave paid for by the government .
Ultimately , Michael 's burial spot will hold four bodies .
For many the grim scenario will resonate with echoes of the Beatles classic song Eleanor Rigby , about an elderly woman buried in a pauper 's grave .
Millionaire 's death
But that was more than 40 years ago .
These days , with DNA databases and social networking , and Britain dubbed by some a " surveillance society " , it seems hardly credible that someone could die with no - one to bury them .
But there are still many people who end their lives in such circumstances .
PUBLIC HEALTH FUNERALS Manchester , 400 - 450 Birmingham , 300 Edinburgh , 150 Glasgow , 100 - 150 Liverpool , 100 Lambeth , London , 25 - 35
There are no figures for how many people are given so - called public health funerals , but a straw poll of local authorities suggests they run into the thousands .
There are those , like Michael , whose desolate deaths are the tragic end to lives withered by addiction .
Some are pushed to the fringes of society by mental illness ; others simply outlive everyone they know .
But according to Brenda Dickens , who oversees 300 public health funerals a year for Birmingham City Council , there is no such thing as a " typical case " .
Her office has carried out burials ranging from a foetus " that 's been discarded in a public place , to someone who dies in their own home in luxurious surroundings and does n't have any relatives and has n't made a will " .
One council reported burying someone who turned out to be a multi-millionaire .
There may be more ways than ever to stay in touch , but none of them are compulsory and many are superficial .
Michael Disney , one of thousands each year buried in public health funerals ( Pic courtesy Express & Echo ) " If somebody chooses to become anonymous , then that 's what happens , " says Ms Dickens .
" It is possible that we are referred a case with someone 's name , but they may have three or four or five aliases .
" And you may have your own name and date of birth and still have dropped out of society because there is no compunction on someone to register with their GP or claim their benefits . "
In one recent case in Exeter an elderly man lay undiscovered in his flat for three weeks .
In August a man 's body was found at a home in Lancashire after lying there for two years .
His bills and council tax had been paid by direct debit .
Without hard figures , it is impossible to tell whether there is an upward trend in these lonely deaths .
But what is clear is that with the break - down of many traditional families and an aging population , more people than ever are living alone .
He said to my wife : ' In prison there is always someone you can talk to , you 're a somebody .
Out here , you 're a nobody '
The Reverend Nick Martin Michael had not dropped as far from sight as some .
While Michael was in prison , the Reverend Nick Martin , the prison chaplain who led the funeral , saw him every day .
But that soon ended when he got out .
Shortly after his release , the Rev Martin 's wife saw Michael back on the streets , looking emaciated .
She bought him pureed food normally eaten by the institutionalised elderly .
Her small act of generosity touched Michael .
" He said to my wife : ' In prison there is always someone you can talk to , you 're a somebody .
Out here , you 're a nobody . ' "
Just weeks later , in a park behind Exeter Central station , children out playing among the neatly - kept lawns and colourful flowerbeds found Michael 's dead body .
Scars and tattoos
It seems Michael was well - enough known for confirmation of his identity to be relatively simple .
But that is not always the case .
It can take months to name an unknown body , with a coroner stitching together an identity with anything from scars and tattoos , to prison records and a person 's final steps .
The City of London Coroner has kept hold of a corpse for a year .
A statue of Eleanor Rigby in Stanley Street , Liverpool The Home Office says the problem of identifying bodies found without personal effects would unlikely be solved by the introduction of ID cards .
But realistically , would someone in Michael 's condition hold an ID card ?
Eventually , however , the investigation will end and it will fall to the local council to deal with the body .
Under disease - control legislation , authorities are required to do no more than ensure a corpse is buried or cremated .
In practice councils are less callous .
According to the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management most will pay for a hearse , a casket and a professional mourner to lead the ceremony .
For Michael , Exeter City Council also bought a simple wreath and placed an obituary in the local paper .
It says each funeral costs about £ 2,800 .
If there are no other mourners , Ian Quance , a bereavement services manager for the council , often attends the funeral himself .
It is a matter of pride that the occasion should be treated with dignity , he says .
" I would like to think you can't tell the difference from a normal funeral .
At the end of the day , we come into the world equal and we should go out equal .
We should all have the same dignity . "
Below is a selection of your comments :
Over the years I 've arranged a number of " pauper 's funerals " .
One that stands out the most was for a elderly lady who was found only after her neighbours contacted the Police as they had n't seen her for a while .
She had been dead for over 4 months .
She was very rich but lived in poverty , no close friends or family could be found .
I attended her funeral and ensured her estate was passed on to the Government .
While I never knew her it was still extremely upsetting that I was they only person other than the Vicar at her funeral .
I think people would be shocked to how often this happens in our " modern society . "
Alastair Blunkett , Sheffield
In my professional life , I attend many of these types of funerals a year - roughly one a month .
Frequently , there are known family ( albeit distant ) but no - one wants to take the `responsibility ' ( i.e. foot the bill ) for the funeral so they leave the body unclaimed and then turn up for the funeral !
Sad , lonely world this .
William , Essex I am a CofE clergyman .
Many years ago I officiated at a funeral of a woman who died with no known relatives .
It was just me and the coffin in the crematorium .
What a privilege to ensure her funeral was conducted with reverence and simple dignity .
Roger , Devon Although I appreciate the sentiment , would the £ 2800 for a ' token ' funeral not be better spent on the living ?
Jonnie , Newcastle upon
Tyne I have to say I am very impressed that Exeter council took the time and effort to make sure Michael 's death was appropriately acknowledged .
I very sad story RIP Michael .
Emma , Talke , Staffs Having just have my boyfriends grandfather die on Saturday this article hits a spot with me .
People may whinge about the cost of each funeral , of people that even .
Society could n't be bothered with so why should we spend taxpayers money on them now they 're dead but " we come into the world equal and we should go out equal .
We should all have the same dignity . "
This is plain , this is simple and a beautiful sentiment , just a shame we can't treat everyone with the same dignity when they are alive .
Luckily for my boyfriends grandfather he died with his family around him , safe in the knowledge he was loved dearly and will be missed greatly , I wish everyone was as lucky .
Rest In Peace Bill , and Michael .
Claire , Gloucester , UK I used to work for an electricity company , and one of the saddest pieces of correspondence I ever received was from a local authority who had paid for someone 's funeral and were administering his estate , and asked for the small refund due to be made payable to the authority to defray some of the funeral expenses .
Deborah , Surrey when our daughter was born at 20 weeks the hospital arranged her funeral and cremation , even though at 20 weeks there is no legal obligation to register either the birth or the death .
this was n't a case of there being no one to attend her funeral but I was amazed at the kindness and humanity shown by the hospital , the hospital chaplain and the funeral directors , who are the same people that deal with deaths where there are no close relatives .
it does make you realise that there are some very decent kind and generous people out there - and the world is a better place for it .
Lisa , London
As a community nurse may I just add that , although not part of our role there are many many funerals of the lonely and isolated that are attended by health visitors and community nurses and local authority carers - we are never there because we are paid to be - we go out of compassion .
We are often aware that we are that persons only contact and despite many endeavours to improve things for them whilst they live it is not always possible - by attending their funerals it is often our last chance to redress the imbalance of their lives .
Susan , West Midlands
I was touched by this story .
Local Authorities are often criticised , but how nice to hear of councils behaving with kindness and responsibility to those who have died with no family or friends to respond to their death .
They were all someone 's beautiful baby and child at one point , before their lives followed a different path ; and I commend this compassionate service by the local authorities .
Long may it continue .
R Marsh
R Marsh , Maidstone Such a touching story .
In some way , i hope this story encourages us to all look out for and embrace our loved ones , family and friends alike .
I know I would certainly not like to end up as anonymous as these poor souls !
Anon , Aberdeen I 've no next of kin so I 've made a will and a living will all that is left is to do is get a funeral plan and then I 'm setup hopefully .
I think it 's something we should all take responsibility for especially as we get older , you do n't tend to think of these things in your twenties .
Ann , Canterbury
As a Coventry based church we have run a homeless drop in for a number of years and have befriended many " nameless " faces that have subsequently passed away .
We have also had the honour of conducting services for them , often packed with others from a similar background .
Relatives do come forwards with time and appreciate this care .
Neil Jarratt , Coventry Jesus Centre , Coventry Everyone when they are young thinks nothing will happen to them , there will always be someone there to look after them .
But it 's reassuring to know that when you get older and your friends pass away one by one and you have lost touch with your family there are still people around who care .
Darren Watkins , Newcastle upon Tyne , UK In Islam the responsibility of burying is on the local community .
In Islamic belief if the local community do not carry this out then they will be sinned .
Muslims see burying the dead in their community as their responsibility .
Arranging the funeral and attending the funeral prayer is seen as a rewarding and very comendable act to do .
Masud , High Wycombe
An ex-work colleague of mine was given a local authority cremation last year .
It was a credit to Poole crematorium , the vicar , organist and funereal directors who gave him as good a send off as any .
RIP Jeff Cheshire .
James Stevens , Windsor , UK
Thanks to all the people at each council , giving a respectful funeral to all the people who are unfortunate to be unknowns .
Its not an easy job to do , mentally I do n't think I would be able to do it .
Maybe we should look at the source of the problem , like broken families or too much liberty at too young an age .
To think that such is happening in he UK means that social problems still exists , no matter what survey is done by the government to tell us otherwise .
Vik , Epsom
What a terribly sad story .
It is , perhaps , understandable when an elderly person has no surviving relatives to mourn them but for a young man like this to die and be buried alone is heartbreaking .
RIP Michael .
Helen , I have a good friend who is an Anglican priest .
When he was a vicar in this city he often conducted such funerals .
On many occasions I would attend with him just so the deceased had someone there and I always provided a tiny floral tribute , sometimes picked from my own garden and sometimes purchased .
The only people present were my vicar friend , the funeral director and me , and we conducted the service between us .
I always felt privileged to be able to show some kindness to those poor people .
Annie , Bristol I feel sad and greatful at the same time .
Council 's get a lot wrong , so congratulations to Exeter City for getting something right .
There go I but for the grace of God .
Jacqueline , Aberdeen
In a world where local councils are viewed as parasites only here to take our money and use it for their own gains , it 's touching to see a man who completely goes the extra mile and believes he 's doing something ' because its the right thing to do '
We could do with a lot more Ian Quance 's in the world .

The Final Presidential Debate : Obama Overwhelms McCain by Huge Margins
Barack Obama Sweeps Post - Debate Polls
The New York Times gives interested readers a detailed review of last night ’s third presidential debate between Senators Barack Obama and John McCain , as well as a transcript of the debate .
In addition , the Times provides a video of the debate .
A new CBS News / New York Times poll showed that Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama entered the debate with a wide lead over Republican rival John McCain nationally .
According to that poll , the Obama - Biden ticket now leads the McCain - Palin ticket 53 percent to 39 percent among likely voters , a 14 - point margin .
Just one week ago , prior to the Town Hall debate that uncommitted voters saw as a win for Obama , that margin was just three points .
Further , among independents who are likely voters , a group that has swung back and forth between McCain and Obama over the course of the campaign , the Democratic ticket now leads by 18 points .
McCain led among independents last week .
It appears that McCain ’s campaign strategy is hurting hurt him :
Twenty - one percent of voters say their opinion of the Republican has changed for the worse in the last few weeks .
The top two reasons cited for the change of heart are McCain ’s attacks on Obama and his choice of Sarah Palin as running mate .
A number of post - debate polls have concluded that Obama trounced McCain by wide margins in the debate .
Early results in the CBS News and Knowledge Network ’s national poll of uncommitted voters after last night ’s debate found that fifty - three percent of the uncommitted voters surveyed identified Democratic nominee Barack Obama as the winner of tonight ’s debate .
Only twenty - two percent said that Republican rival John McCain won .
Twenty - four percent said the debate was a draw .
The Huffington Post surveyed some other post - debate polls .
A CNN poll of several hundred debate watchers favored Obama by large margins : 58 percent for Obama to McCain ’s 31 percent .
Perhaps more importantly , McCain ’s favorable rating dropped from 51 to 49 while his unfavorable rating increased from 45 percent to 49 percent .
Senator Obama ended up with a 66 percent favorable rating .
Meanwhile , virtually the entire Frank Luntz focus group on Fox News , which was held last night in Miami , said that Barack Obama had won the debate .
Luntz termed it a “ clear majority , ” but not one person raised their hand when asked if they thought McCain had won .
Said Luntz : “ None had made a decision to support Sen .
Obama before the debate , but more than half supported him after the debate .
It was a good night for Barack Obama . ”

Leaders of the campaign to outlaw same - sex marriage in California are warning businesses that have given money to the state ’s largest gay rights group they will be publicly identified as opponents of traditional unions unless they contribute to the gay marriage ban , too .
ProtectMarriage.com , the umbrella group behind a ballot initiative that would overturn the California Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage , sent a certified letter this week asking companies to withdraw their support of Equality California , a nonprofit organization that is helping lead the campaign against Proposition 8 .
“ Make a donation of a like amount to ProtectMarriage.com which will help us correct this error , ” reads the letter .
“ Were you to elect not to donate comparably , it would be a clear indication that you are in opposition to traditional marriage . …
The names of any companies and organizations that choose not to donate in like manner to ProtectMarriage.com but have given to Equality California will be published . ”
The letter was signed by four members of the group ’s executive committee : campaign chairman Ron Prentice ; Edward Dolejsi , executive director of the California Catholic Conference ; Mark Jansson , a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ; and Andrew Pugno , the lawyer for ProtectMarriage.com .
A donation form was attached .
The letter did not say where the names would be published .

With just five weeks left until Election Day , our favorite pundits discuss the power of Sarah Palin , why TV news is about as credible as Muzak , and whether Barack Obama is going to be '' sworn in on a gay baby ' '
This story originally appeared in the Oct. 3 , 2008 , issue of Entertainment Weekly .
In the midst of re-creating the controversial New Yorker cover illustration of Barack and Michelle Obama for the cover photo that graces this week ’s print edition of Entertainment Weekly , Jon Stewart stops briefly to pose a taste question .
As he stands by the catering table in ” secret Muslim ” garb , he ponders , ” Would it be weird to be dressed like this and have a bagel , salmon , and a schmear ? ” Pseudo - blowhard Stephen Colbert has his own worries .
Striking his best Michelle - as - Black - Panther pose , he glances at the original cartoon and realizes that he ’s ” hippier ” than the potential First Lady .
Gesturing at his own waist , he moans , ” I could drop a baby like a peasant . ”
Other than that , though , their worries are few .
Both of their Comedy Central shows just received an Emmy ( The Daily Show won best Variety , Music , or Comedy Series , while The Colbert Report took home a best writing trophy ) , and they have five more weeks of an election battle starring three men and an Alaskan moose - skinner that has given the satirists more fodder than an infinite number of Dick Cheneys shooting an infinite number of friends in the face .
We sat down with the comedians for a provocative talk about the political landscape , the way they ( and other , more traditional media outlets ) cover it , and whether or not we ’ll ever see the alleged ” change ” we ’ve been promised by every candidate .
” Do you mean change we need , or change we can believe in ? ” asks Stewart .
” Any change is as good as a vacation at this point , ” says Colbert , who set his conservative TV pundit character aside for the chat .
” I do n’t know if you ’ve paid much attention to the past eight years , but it has been a s— burger supreme .
If somebody gives me an empty burger , it ’s better than eating s — . ”
ENTERTAINMENT
WEEKLY : Forget the two presidential candidates :
The most prominent person in this election right now is Sarah Palin .
With the attention she ’s getting , you ’d think she was running for president .
JON STEWART : Everyone likes new and shiny .
We ’re bored .
What ’s great about that is [ Democratic VP candidate Joe ] Biden is an absolutely eccentric character .
That ’s how powerful Palin ’s story is — it has cast the first African - American presidential nominee , the oldest [ non- incumbent ] presidential nominee , and a really wild cork vice presidential candidate completely out of the picture .
The press is 6 - year - olds playing soccer ; nobody has a position , it ’s just ” Where ’s the ball ?
Where ’s the ball ?
Sarah Palin has the ball ! ” [ Mimes a mob running after her . ]
Because they can only cover one thing .
Why do you think some people embraced her as a folk hero ?
STEWART : I keep hearing that she ’s ” like us . ”
There ’s this idea that people who hunt and have ” good ” values are somehow this mythological American ; I do n’t know who ” this ” person is , I ’ve never met them .
She is no more typical ” us ” than I am , than Obama is , than McCain is , than Mr. T is .
If there is something quintessentially or authentically American about her , I sort of feel like , you know what ?
You ” good values people ” have had the country for eight years , and done an unbelievably s—ty job .
Let ’s find some bad values people and give them a shot , maybe they ’ll have a better take on it .
The easy and prevalent comedic take on John McCain has been that he ’s old .
Has one emerged on Obama yet ?
STEPHEN COLBERT : He ’s a hope - ronaut .
He ’s in a rarefied level of hope where the rest of us have to take tanks up with us .
Is that really a comedic take ?
Seems more like a compliment .
STEWART : But it ’s not , in the same way that the take on Al Gore was “ he ’s too smart . ”
Even if you ’re satirizing how wonderful they are , that hyperbole is setting them up for an expectation to fail , especially within the American political system now , where authenticity — and apparently mediocrity — are the manna that the populace feeds upon .
To set somebody up as if they ’re above us , and elitist …my God , you could n’t do anything worse .
Jon , you ’ve had McCain on your show 14 times and have spoken fondly of him .
Do you think he ’s changed as a candidate as the election has gotten closer ?
STEWART : I think it ’s somewhat inevitable .
The most interesting moment to me was the difference in protocol when he came on the show in May , after he was the [ presumptive ] Republican nominee .
The minute you are your party ’s nominee , you are a museum piece that is shuffled around by guys in earpieces .
You are spectacularly managed .
And I just felt the difference .
When you were walking down the hallway , you were now walking into history , as opposed to going and seeing this guy that comes on your show and is a senator and has a sharp sense of humor .
So that inevitably changes a person .
Once you are surrounded by people who have sworn to take a bullet for you even though they do n’t know you , I think you ’ve gotta be feeling pretty good about yourself at that moment .
COLBERT : Jon ?
If it comes down to it , I have a couple of interns I could toss in front of you .
The Colbert Report did n’t actually go to the conventions .
If it did , would Stephen have been cheered , or tarred and feathered ?
COLBERT : I offered to speak at the Democratic convention .
And I had some expectation they might actually say yes .
Because when I was running for president last year , they offered to let me speak to get me to drop out .
Which is so weird .
“ Wait , what ?
Why are you treating me like a real person ? ”
STEWART : The closer you get to the reality of the elections , the more you see the ranks closing .
Everything is in much more of a DEFCON 5 situation amongst the campaigns .
Their ability to absorb a bad actor into their atmosphere has dissipated .
They ’re too fearful .
Many people saw the conventions as little more than a series of talking points .
STEWART : We ’re all sort of complicit in forcing them to make those narratives in the first place .
COLBERT : You mean us , or the real press ?
STEWART : Everything .
The whole mechanism of dissecting their every waking moment has created somewhat of a paralysis .
We have drained them of their ability to remain human .
Because any human moment will be so fiercely dissected and digested and metastasized by the media .
COLBERT : People can be hung by anything they say .
We ’ve done it .
STEWART : We ’ve done it too .
You can kill people all the time for things that are absolutely human frailties .
COLBERT : You can even manufacture the frailty , and then hang them with it .
STEWART : That ’s why I do n’t excuse what I guess you ’d call the satiro - industrial complex from culpability .
COLBERT : That ’s funny : I absolve me .
I could absolve you if you want .
STEWART : That ’s the beauty of having a demagogue on right after your show — he can actually absolve our show , which is incredibly convenient .
COLBERT : One of the reasons I think politicians are very easy to interview is because you know what they ’re going to say .
I can write the entire interview before I even meet them .
STEWART : We write a lot of our convention coverage before we even go out there .
You guys regularly make a mockery of the 24 - hour news networks .
Do you see anything good about the format ?
STEWART : It ’s Muzak now .
You ever walk into a clothing store in New York City and they ’re not playing music ?
And you go , “ What ’s going on here ?
Did a virus hit ?
This does n’t seem right . ”
Twenty - four - hour news now is this weird companion to my life .
COLBERT : There ’s not more news now than there was when we were kids .
There ’s the same amount from when it was just Cronkite .
And the easiest way to fill it is to have someone ’s opinion on it .
Then you have an opposite opinion , and then you have a mishmash of fact and opinion , and you leave it the least informed you can possibly be .
STEWART : We ’ve got three financial networks on all day .
The bottom falls out of the credit market , and they were all running around .
On CNBC I saw a guy talking to eight people in [ eight different onscreen ] boxes , and they were all like , “ I do n’t know ! ”
It ’d be like if Hurricane Ike hit , and you put on the Weather Channel , and they were yelling , “ I do n’t know what the f— is going on !
I ’m getting wet and it ’s windy and I do n’t know why and it ’s making me sad !
Maybe the president could come down and put up some sort of windscreen ? ”
By being on 24 hours a day , you begin to not be able to tell what ’s salient anymore .
For years , studies have come out saying that many young people get their news from late - night comedy , and Jon has always pooh - poohed this idea .
But your shows are some of the only ones out there actually digging into archival video to prove when politicians are lying or contradicting themselves .
You might not want the responsibility , but have n’t you been given it by default ?
COLBERT : I do n’t know if responsibility is the right word .
STEWART : It ’s more that we ’re an emotional show , not a political show .
I do n’t know if you ’ve ever spent time in s—hole bars in New Jersey with old people yelling at the TV , but that ’s what it is .
It ’s a guy going , “ I never said that , ” and in the back of the room Elbow Eddie looks up from his Pall Malls and his Budweiser and goes , “ That ’s f— in ’ bulls — !
I heard you say it two days ago ! ”
That ’s all that is .
It ’s not a journalistic gotcha , it ’s just anger .
It ’s easy when you ’re participating in the discussion to forget that people are watching and taping .
Typically , politicians make you go back six months .
But now …
COLBERT : I ’ve got one for you .
McCain said , “ The fundamentals of our economy are strong ” and “ Our economy is at risk . ”
One was at 9 a.m. , the other was 11 a.m .
Our joke was “ You can be strong and at risk , too .
Like , a muscleman who would n’t wear a condom .
What ’s the worst that could happen ? ”
Is this election any different from the last two you covered ?
STEWART : I was convinced an Obama / McCain campaign would be measurably different on almost all standards .
And to watch it become Bush / Kerry , Bush / Gore , has been one of the most dissatisfying experiences .
COLBERT : That means it ’s not an Obama / McCain campaign .
It ’s a Guys Who Work for Bush / Guys Who Work for Kerry campaign .
Both sides have people who are just smart enough to know “ We need to tweak this dial right here , ” so of course voters are divided 50/50 between the parties .
When the 2000 election was down to 14 voters in Boca deciding the whole thing , I thought , “ Wow , that ’s great !
It really is a political science !
They ’ve found a way to put electrodes in people ’s hands , and a probe up their butt , show them images , and say ‘ See how they respond ! ' ”
STEWART : That ’s why you think to yourself , “ Hey , could n’t you guys tie for $ 10 million , instead of a trillion ?
Does it really cost that much money to tie ? ”
You both have a heavy armor of irony .
Does all this ever get to you ?
STEWART : This job is the hardest when we are directly exposed to the process :
When we go to the conventions , when we go up to New Hampshire — that ’s the only time I ever feel like , “ Oh , my God , are my glands swollen ? ”
COLBERT : After the 2006 Correspondents ’
Dinner [ in which Colbert gave a scathing satirical speech about Bush with the President right in front of him , earning some hardcore Beltway backlash ] , Jon said , “ You touched it .
You got close enough to touch it , and it got on you . ”
Then more than a year passed , and I got kicked off the ballot in South Carolina during my brief presidential run .
I had actually been on the phone with people in South Carolina , telling me I was gonna be fine .
People were on the phone lying to me .
And I called Jon and said , “ I touched it …again . ”
That was disappointing .
I thought I could put myself all the way in it and not feel it , but I did .
I realized , “ I understand , maybe , why people end up not being so good . ”
Because they get lied to a lot .
Can anyone break through this mess ?
STEWART : I worry that those people are there , but we wo n’t recognize them — or we ’ll destroy them so thoroughly that their voice wo n’t be heard .
I just imagine Lincoln out there , and people throwing the gay stuff at him .
“ And what about depression running in his family ? ”
Do you think anything will change if the Democrats control the White House and both houses of Congress ?
STEWART : Look at what they promised when they took over Congress .
I ’ve never heard such hardcore rhetoric .
“ The era of the blank check is over !
And we will send a sternly worded memorandum — nonbinding — to somebody at the White House .
Not necessarily the inner executive circle , we certainly do n’t want to offend , but … ”
And then they got in and were like , “ Really , you want to eavesdrop ?
Okay , we ’ll let this one go .
But this is the last blank check !
Unless you want another .
But let me say this :
The next one will not be blank , because we ’ll just write in the memo line .
Can we write in memo ?
Would you be bothered by that ? ”
COLBERT : One of the things I love about my character is I can make vast declarations and it does n’t matter if I ’m wrong .
I love being wrong .
So my character can tell you exactly what ’s going to happen :
The Democrats are going to change everything .
We ’re going to have gay parents marrying their own gay babies .
Obama ’s gonna be sworn in on a gay baby .
The oath is gonna end “ So help me , gay baby . ”
STEWART : Then they ’ll head right over to the abortion mixer .
There ’ll be a dance , and then there ’ll be a little tent set up outside , just in case anybody wants an RU - 486 .
There are a lot of issues in this election .
The biggest one right now is the economy .
STEWART : We were in this huge credit crisis , out of money .
Then the Fed goes ,
We ’ll give you a trillion dollars , and all of a sudden Wall Street is like , “ I ca n’t believe we got away with it ! ”
Can you imagine if someone said , “ I should n’t have bought that sports car because it means I ca n’t have my house , ” and the bank just said , “ All right , you can have your house .
And you know what ?
Keep the car . ”
[ He throws up his arms joyfully and shouts ]
“ Yeaaaaah , I get to keep the car !
Wait , do I have to give the money back ? ”
“ No , it does n’t matter . ” “ Yeah , I ’m gonna get another car !
I ’m gonna do the same thing the same way , except twice as f—ed up ! ”
COLBERT : The idea that Lehman Brothers does n’t get any money and AIG does reminds me very much of “ Iran is a mortal enemy because they have not achieved a nuclear weapon .
But North Korea is a country we can work with , because they have a nuclear weapon . ”
The idea is , Get big or go home .
How big can you f— up ?
Can you f— up so bad that you would ruin the world economy ?
If it ’s just 15,000 who are out of jobs , no .
You have to actually be a global f— up to get any help .
So what do you think is the issue that people will end up voting on ?
STEWART : Whatever happens that week .
It all depends on when that Michelle Obama “ I hate whitey ” tape comes out .
If it comes out now , it could dissipate by the election .
But if it comes out a couple days before , that could be dangerous .
Marrying my wife was the best decision I ever made .
We have an amazingly close relationship , and we ’ve also had our share of ups and downs like anyone else .
Despite the luck I had marrying my wife , our relationship still takes a lot of work and patience .
I ’ve made plenty of mistakes .
I ’ve also seen the ugliness that is failed relationships ( I ’ll spare you the details ) .
I ’ve avoided writing about this subject for a while for a couple of reasons .
Firstly , I do n’t want to seem like a know - it - all or that I have relationships figured out any more than anyone else .
They ’re a very personal thing and your relationship will inevitably be different than mine .
Secondly , just like anyone , I ’m still learning myself .
So here it is anyway .
These are the secrets I ’ve learned to having a successful relationship .
If you can start applying these in your relationship , I guarantee that it will start transforming immediately .
1. Accept your partner as they are .
The best time to decide what kind of partner you want is before you commit to being in a relationship .
If you ’re always trying to change your partner , the only thing you ’ll accomplish is the other person resenting you .
It does n’t get much more insulting than that .
But being accepting does n’t mean you act like a door mat , either .
The best thing you can do is treat your partner like you would a dog .
( Before any protests start , just bear with me for a second . )
Just think about it .
How do you treat your dog ?
You do n’t expect him to be anything that he ’s not , because he is completely authentic .
You just expect him to be a dog .
He drools , barks , and wags his little tail .
He ’s perfect that way .
You ca n’t help but accept him .
2 . Be more concerned with being kind , than with being right .
Everyone has a desire to be right .
And there are many occasions where being right will take you far ; like choosing the best place to raise a family .
But most of the time , insisting on being right will drive you and your partner apart .
There ’s been many times in past relationships where I ’ve insisted on the other person seeing things my way .
You can only take this so far before you end up losing sight of what you were arguing about in the first place .
It ’s no longer about a point , or anything else important .
It ’s just about being right .
In the end , this just drives a wedge between you and your partner .
So which would you rather be : kind or right ?
3 . Be the best partner you can be .
This sounds so obvious that you ’re probably thinking , “ Wow Jonathan , how long did it take you to come up with that one ? ” I know .
I knew you would say that .
But since I ’m the one that wrote it , I guess I better have a good reason for it .
And I do .
If you ’re not in a relationship , you ’re probably looking for the perfect partner .
Maybe the reason you ’re not with anyone right now has something to do with not being able to find the perfect person .
Perhaps you were with someone , but the reason you ’re not is because you felt they were less than perfect .
Or , let ’s be honest , maybe he was just crazy .
If you are in a relationship , you probably have lots of expectations for your partner .
You probably expect them to think like you do , and make the same type of decisions you would make .
Chances are you hold it against them when they think otherwise .
We spend a lot of time searching for the perfect partner and then expecting our partner to be perfect .
But how much time do we spend trying to be the perfect partner for our partner ?
We have all these expectations for the other person , yet we do n’t hold ourselves up to this as well .
Does n’t that seem like a double standard ?
I think so .
When something is n’t going well in my relationship with my wife , I try to think of how I can be a better partner .
Instead of reacting and thinking “ Why ca n ’t she just be like this ? ” I try to think “ What can I do to be a better partner ? ” I ’m not always perfect , but every time I do this , I feel like my relationship goes a little more consciously in the directly I want it to .
4 . Do n’t make assumptions , do n’t take things personally .
Just following this one bit of wisdom has saved me a lot of heartache and trouble ; not just in my marriage , but in every aspect of my life .
We have a tendency to think that everything is about us .
We have this thing called personal importance .
The truth is , everything is not about us .
Everything anyone else does is really about them , that ’s including your partner .
I know , hard to believe , but true .
If we take things personally when our partner acts not so wonderfully , we ’re likely to feel unloved .
We think it ’s about us , when it ’s really something they ’re personally dealing with .
That does n’t mean we do n’t call them out when they ’re acting a fool .
We just do n’t make it about us .
It ’s also important to not make assumptions .
How many times have you felt hurt because you thought your partner should have known something ?
Most of the time I am upset at my wife ( for some reason or another ) it ’s because I assumed that she automatically knew something .
I assumed that she knew I did n’t want to go somewhere with her because I had a headache .
But she did n’t know and thought I was upset at her for some reason ( she took it personally ) .
Then I ’m upset at her because I thought she should trust me enough to know that I love her enough to go somewhere with her when I am feeling up to it .
Then she ’s upset at me because she thinks that there ’s no reason I should be upset at her , when I ’m the one that did something wrong in the first place .
See the pointless cycle this creates ?
All of this confusion can be avoided if we simply do n’t make assumptions and do n’t take things personally .
Instead of making assumptions we can ask for what we want .
It seems so simple , right ?
If you do n’t ask for what you want , how do you expect to get it ?
As blindingly obvious as this is , it took me quite a while to get this .
We have a tendency to want to be understanding of the other person .
We think it will make them feel inadequate if we ask for what we want .
We think we ’ll make them feel bad for not meeting our needs , so we stay quiet , hoping that some day soon our partner will develop telepathy and figure things out .
That day has n’t come for me yet .
But you can go on waiting if you want .
Following these four things has helped me transform my relationship with my wife .
Not just that , it ’s transformed the relationship with myself .
My wife inspires me to be a better partner .
And what I ’ve really learned is that being a better partner makes you a better person .
It ’s through looking at the way we interact with others that we learn more about ourselves .
Sharing is caring !
Senator John McCain 's much heralded Obama Tax - Plan Critic ' Joe the Plumber ' Owes Back Taxes .
" Joe the plumber , " the Toledo , Ohio , man whose complaints about Barack Obama 's tax plan were highlighted by John McCain in the final presidential debate , owes the state of Ohio almost $ 1,200 in back income taxes .
According to records on file with the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas , the state filed a tax lien against Samuel J. Wurzelbacher for $ 1,182.98 on Jan. 26 , 2007 , that is still active .
Wurzelbacher was thrust into the national spotlight this week when he told Obama he worried that the Illinois senator 's proposals to roll back Bush administration tax breaks for Americans earning more than $ 250,000 would prevent him from buying a plumbing business that would earn between $ 250,000 and $ 280,000 a year .
Wurzelbacher 's home telephone number is unlisted , and efforts to reach him by calling his neighbors and family were unsuccessful .
Attempts to reach Wurzelbacher at the plumbing company where he works were also unsuccessful .
The address on the lien and other records for him matched the address published by the Toledo Blade , which also noted the lien .
The state of Ohio places a lien on real property after several steps to try to collect a tax debt , according to John Kohlstrand , a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Taxation who said he could n't discuss any specific case .
It 's far more likely that the $ 280,000 Wurzelbacher told Obama he 'd earn would be in the form of gross receipts and not taxable income , said Steven Bankler , a certified public accountant in San Antonio , who counts plumbers and other trade professionals as his clients .
According to an analysis by Dun & Bradstreet on Wurzelbacher 's employer , A. W. Newell Corp. , the plumbing and heating contractor has annual sales of $ 510,000 .
If Wurzelbacher bought the company , by the time he took proper business deductions , Bankler said , he'd be left with between $ 150,000 and $ 200,000 in taxable income and would n't be affected by Obama 's proposed increase in the top rates .
Wurzelbacher does n't have a plumber 's license and is n't registered as a plumber in Ohio , the Toledo Blade reported on its Web site today .
His employer has a state plumbing license , the newspaper said .
Joe In The Spotlight
One week ago , Joe Wurzelbacher was just another working man living in a modest ranch house near Toledo thinking about how to expand his plumbing business .
But when he stopped Senator Barack Obama during a visit to his block this weekend to ask about his taxes , he set himself on a path to being the newest media celebrity — and , like other celebrities , found himself under scrutiny .
Turns out that “ Joe the Plumber , ” as he became nationally known when Senator John McCain made him a theme at Wednesday night ’s third and final presidential debate , may run a plumbing business but he is not a licensed plumber .
His full name is Samuel J. Wurzelbacher .
And he owes a bit in back taxes .
An official at Local 50 of the plumber ’s union , based in Toledo , said Mr. Wurzelbacher does not hold a license .
He also has never served an apprenticeship and does not belong to the union .
“ I ’m getting ready to buy a company that makes $ 250,000 to $ 280,000 a year , ” he told Mr. Obama during an exchange that was filmed and later showed up on YouTube .
“ Your new tax plan is going to tax me more , is n’t it ? ”
When Mr. McCain invoked Mr. Wurzelbacher in Wednesday ’s debate — some version of “ Joe the Plumber ” was mentioned two dozen times during the 90 minutes — as a way to criticize Mr. Obama ’s tax plan and wealth - sharing argument , Mr. Wurzelbacher suddenly found camera crews outside his home , Katie Couric on the phone , and himself in the full glare of the media spotlight .
Mr. Wurzelbacher did not respond to a message left on his home phone and there was no answer at his plumbing business .
Unlike some other states , Ohio does not have a formal statewide licensing system for plumbers .
But the city of Toledo and other municipalities do , Mr. Joseph said , and Mr. Wurzelbacher has not met those requirements .
“ All contractors are licensed , and he does not have a license , either as a contractor or a plumber , ” the union official said , citing a search of government records .
“ I ca n’t find that he ’s ever even applied for any kind of apprenticeship , and he has never belonged to local 189 in Columbus , which is what he claims on his Facebook page . ”
Joe the Plumber or Joe the Deadbeat ?
If you are making $ 250,000 or more how come you cannot pay your tax bill ?
Why is your phone unlisted ?
Why do n't you have a plumber 's license ?
Do n't you need a plumber 's license to go into the plumbing business on your own ?
If you can't pay your tax bills how are you going to buy out your employer ?
Addendum :
McCain has entrepreneurs spooked about tax hikes , but fewer than 2 % of small business owners would pay more under Obama 's plan .
LIKE many considerate boyfriends , Ed Vessel , a cognitive neuroscientist who lives in Brooklyn , bought a toothbrush for his steady girlfriend Diana Adams to keep at his apartment when she sleeps over .
While Ms. Adams , a Cornell - educated lawyer , considered this touching , she was less pleased when she noticed the toothbrush that Mr. Vessel had bought for his other steady girlfriend when she slept over .
That Mr. Vessel had a second girlfriend was not the issue .
All parties here are committed to polyamory , which for them means maintaining multiple steady relationships , with the knowledge and consent of all involved .
The problem was that the other woman ’s toothbrush was “ a really fancy one that says ‘ Primo ’ on it , and mine is a junky one that says ‘ Duane Reade , ’ ” said Ms Adams , 29 .
For about a month , she was a little miffed every single time she brushed her teeth .
The two eventually talked  polyamory involves a lot of talking  and they now laugh about it .
“ I just decided that this was an example of a jealousy that is not warranted , ” Ms. Adams said .
Polyamory gained a degree of cultural vogue in the sexual revolution of the 1970s , when books like “ Open Marriage ” made best - seller lists and swingers capitalized on the concept to justify experimentation .
But while it failed to survive the era of fern bars for the mainstream population , a small but vocal collection of adherents  many borrowing the language of inclusion used in the gay rights movement  argues that polyamory can be a workable , responsible way to live .

I , Franklin D. Roosevelt , President of the United States of America , do declare that said national emergency still continues to exist and pursuant to said section to do hereby prohibit the hoarding gold coin , gold bullion , and gold certificates within the continental United States by individuals , partnerships , associations and corporations …
~ President Franklin D. Roosevelt , April 5 , 1933
Well , they went and did it .
Proving that they have learned nothing from history , Congress passed the massive $ 700 billion " bailout " bill that is allegedly going to save our insolvent banking system .
I was hoping against hope that a populist rebellion might somehow stop the oligarchy from helping itself to the taxpayers ’ wallets , but it was not to be .
In the end , the plutocrats got their money .
Frankly , the logic behind the House of Representative ’s final vote was incomprehensible .
When the bill was a straightforward handout to the banks , they rejected it .
But after the bill went through the Senate — which added dozens of pork - barrel spending projects and granted new Orwellian powers to the IRS — the House approved it .
How on earth could anyone rationalize voting for the second bill after they had voted against the first one ?
Beats me .
Either way , our government took a fateful step down the road to perdition .
This payment wo n’t be the last , since the solvency problem is much bigger than a mere $ 700 billion .
By some accounts , trillions of dollars of bad mortgage - backed paper is sloshing around in the financial system .
Most of it has no market , because no one knows if any of it is actually worth anything .
What ’s more , the federal government is bankrupt .
By any honest accounting , this year ’s budget deficit was already heading toward the $ 600 — 700 billion range .
Since the government can’t pay its existing bills , where will it get the money for this bailout ?
The feds will either have to find new suckers to loan them more money , or they will have to turn on the printing press and ignite a nasty bout of hyperinflation .
But the scary truth is that still more disasters are lurking just over the horizon .
First , as Senator Harry Reid let slip the other day , our insurance industry is teetering on the brink .
AIG has already gone under , and at least one more major company is allegedly about to give up its ghost .
Once that domino falls , who knows how many more will follow ?
And close on the heels of the insurance meltdown is the impending debacle in commercial real estate .
Greenspan ’s bubble not only inflated residential housing prices far above rational market levels , it also created a similar bubble in office buildings and shopping malls .
Many banks and investment houses are just as awash in bad commercial real estate paper as they are in subprime mortgages .
Is the federal government going to take on these bad loans too ?
If that is n’t enough to raise the hair on your neck , the horror does n’t stop there .
Since most state governments rely heavily on property taxes , their balance sheets are starting to drown in red ink .
When housing prices drop by 25 or 30 % and commercial real estate goes belly - up , so do tax receipts .
Yet , unlike the federal government , the states do not control the printing press .
They ca n’t inflate their way out of their predicament .
Governor Schwarzenegger of California has already asked the feds for a multi-billion dollar " loan . "
He wo n’t be the last .
( After having thrown huge piles of cash at banks and insurance companies , can the feds refuse to rescue a bankrupt state government ?
Politically speaking , I seriously doubt it . )
Also waiting in line at the pig trough is a gaggle of corporations .
During last week ’s chaos , not many folks noticed that the big - three automobile manufacturers got a multi-billion dollar handout from the taxpayers .
And now that a precedent has been established , look for other industries ( the airlines , for starters ) to belly up to the taxpayers ’ bar for a shot of free " liquidity . "
Can the government possibly do this ?
Can it absorb the entire residential and commercial real estate losses , bail out dozens of state governments , resuscitate the insurance industry , and hand out cash to unprofitable corporations ?
Not hardly …at least not without resorting to the printing press , which will set off a tsunami of hyperinflation .
As history has shown over and over , governments that spend themselves into a corner will inevitably try to escape their predicament with counterfeit money .
Although this scam works in the short run , it causes much bigger problems down the road .
Hyperinflation destroys the very basis of economic growth by poisoning the value of money .
Without a stable currency , businesses and individuals cannot make long - term plans , since no one knows what anything will cost even weeks or months into the future .
Which brings us to gold .
Libertarians and paleoconservatives have been discussing just such a hyperinflationary scenario for years .
For the most part , the consensus opinion has centered on precious metals .
Since governments can’t counterfeit metal , gold generally holds its value whenever fiat currency is debased .
While this investment strategy is a good one , it comes with one major risk .
The reason governments inflate their currency is to surreptitiously confiscate wealth from those individuals who store their wealth in that currency .
If too many citizens shield their wealth by investing in gold , they nullify the entire scam .
Inflation " works " because citizens are forced — by legal tender laws — to store their wealth in a medium controlled by the government .
As a government counterfeits its currency , it sucks wealth from all of those people who hold that currency .
The government cannot tolerate too many of its citizens successfully evading inflationary confiscation .
In a worst - case scenario , a headlong rush into gold would destroy the dollar completely as individuals replaced it with gold as a medium of wealth storage and exchange .
This cannot be permitted under any circumstances , since it would undermine the very foundations of our governing elite ’s power .
That is not to say that hyperinflation is the government ’s only option .
When faced with bankruptcy , the government could behave responsibly .
It could bring its expenditures into balance with its revenue .
It could slash the welfare state , defund the military - industrial complex , and withdraw it forces from the overseas Empire .
Unfortunately — from the plutocracy ’s perspective — such a policy would also massively undermine its power and is , therefore , completely unacceptable .
If responsible management of public finances is a non-starter , the only other alternative is to rescue the dollar by banning private citizens from buying or owning gold .
Given these two options , does anyone doubt which one the government will choose ?
If history is any guide , those individuals who have correctly predicted that our government ’s policies will end in disaster — and who invest heavily in gold — will be demonized as " hoarders " and " extremists . "
In keeping with the theme of our age , such investors might even be accused of " terrorism " ( Which , in a twisted way , makes sense .
After all , if the government is going to continue to fight the " War on Terror , " it needs money .
And if the only way it can get money is by confiscating gold , then those who resist the confiscation are " aiding and abetting terrorism . " )
Ominously , this logic would permit the government to invoke the Patriot Act and the infamous Military Commissions Act .
In practice , actual confiscation would be easy .
Most gold is held in ETFs or bank vaults .
The government could simply order these institutions to hand their gold over to the US Treasury .
In return , the depositors would be issued compensation in the form of increasingly worthless Federal Reserve Notes ( probably at an exchange rate that heavily favors the government .
After all , the feds could n’t allow " hoarders " to make " windfall profits " ) .
Those citizens who hold physical gold would be somewhat more problematic .
They would presumably be given a " grace period " to hand over their stash .
After that , the feds might have to get a bit rough .
Since many folks would probably try to hide their gold , President Obama would ultimately have no choice but to send federal agents into the countryside and seize it .
Given the recent demise of quaint Anglo - Saxon legalisms — such as search warrants and Habeas Corpus — this enterprise might not be as difficult as one might think .
( Maybe this could be a job for those creepy , Mugabe - style youth brigades that have been popping up around the county . )
I realize that a potentially violent government seizure of private property seems farfetched — or even apocalyptic — but those who dismiss it out of hand should remember their history .
After all , our government has done this before .

Economic Populism appears to be back in vogue .
Given the fall of Lehman Brothers and the Wall Street machine , the economic banter clearly seems to be “ the people ” versus “ the elites .
[ social_buttons ]
Economic populism involves an economic philosophy urging social and political system changes .
In the current political and economic climate , the public concern over the inequity of wealth appears to be at a peak .
There is a growing call by Senator Barack Obama and democrats to raise taxes on the wealthy to shrink the wealth gap .
But is it true that the rich are getting richer ?
Or are the rich actually in danger of losing a significant portion of the nation ’s wealth ?
Are the democrats worried about a problem that ’s already being fixed by the markets ?
Emmanuel Saez , the income - share expert and economics professor at the University of California , Berkeley told Robert Frank of the Wall Street Journal that during the Great Depression , the income and wealth of the top 1 % of society fell drastically .
( Read here for the full story ) .
If history is to be believed then this will happen again especially if Obama becomes president .
What does this mean fore the green economy ?
Spreading the wealth might help increase jobs however the indicators are that the funding is drying up for the green start - ups ( Reuters ) .
If the top income sector is to lose wealth then who will invest in the green entrepreneurism that will fuel a green economy that desperately needs to be built ?

Mérida , November 7 , 2008 ( venezuelanalysis.com ) --
On Friday , the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA and the Russian company Gazprom began drilling for gas in the Gulf of Venezuela .
Government officials from both energy giants further concretized an alliance with cooperation agreements in a wide variety of areas , including nuclear energy , gold mining , and flights between the two countries .
" The relationship between Venezuela and Russia is of strategic business character , " said Igor Sechin , the vice prime minister of Russia , in Caracas .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said the initiation of gas exploration " is as important as launching the Simon Bolivar satellite a week ago , " referring to the satellite that China manufactured and launched as part of a bilateral investment accord with Venezuela .
" Now a new stage of history has begun , because we are free , we are not a colony and we make use of our freedom .
We have liberated ourselves from imperialism , " said Chávez .
According to the president , Venezuela 's " Caribbean Gas Belt , " stretching along the entire coast , contains 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves .
Last month Chavez announced that Venezuela would build a new naval base on its largest island to defend the reserves .
" It is a great advantage for Venezuela to count on Russia 's presence and the company Gazprom in the Gulf , " said Chavez .
Venezuela should be able to produce its own gas within five years , thanks to Russia 's agreement to transfer technology to Venezuela and train Venezuelan workers , he said .
Also , Chávez announced that on November 26th of this month , Russian President Dmitri Medvedev will visit Venezuela , the first Russian President to do so ever .
Extensive teams of government authorities from the two countries set up more than twenty commissions to manage nearly fifty bilateral projects in education , finances , arms purchases , light industries , mining , infrastructure , energy , telecommunications , science and technology , environment , citizen security , culture , sports , and tourism .
The countries moved forward on several projects that were launched over the past year , including Venezuela 's development of civilian nuclear energy , a binational bank , purchases of Russian military equipment , and a joint energy company made up of five Russian firms and PDVSA .
They also discussed the construction of an aluminum plant and automobile factories in Venezuela , and a possible commercial flight between Caracas and Moscow .
According to statements by Venezuela 's Basic Industries and Mining Minister , Rodolfo Sanz , on Thursday , the Venezuelan government might grant the Russian mining firm Rusoro partnership with Venezuelan state mining companies in two major gold projects in Venezuela , Las Cristinas and Las Brisas .
Sanz had announced on Tuesday the government 's intention to nationalize the two gold deposits , which are currently controlled by the Canadian firm Crystallex and Washington State - based Gold Reserve .
According to Venezuelan Major General Jesus Gonzalez , Venezuela will continue purchasing Russian arms until it has " sufficient strength " to defend its territory and oil .
" I do not doubt that the United States wants to come looking for petroleum here , " said Gonzalez .
Even with new president - elect Barack Obama , " the end goal and purpose of the United States will be the same :
To dominate the world , " he said .
Venezuela has purchased $ 4.4 billion worth of Russian weapons since 2005 and in September Russia approved a $ 1 billion loan to Venezuela for future arms purchases .
Venezuela 's Foreign Relations Minister Nicolas Maduro said , " This alliance with Russia forms part of the effort to construct a multi- polar world " that is based on the principles of " respect for sovereignty , equality among states , and on the basis of a constructive agenda . "
Maduro emphasized the need to end war and construct a new financial system to prevent states from dominating other states in order to exploit their natural resources .
Soy beans are seen after being harvested in the outskirts of Gualeguaychu city , 230 km ( 143 miles ) north of Buenos Aires , March 30 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Andres Stapff
HONG KONG ( Reuters Life ! ) - Scientists in Singapore may have found a way to reduce certain carbohydrates in soybeans that have long been blamed for flatulence .
At issue are two sugars in soy -- raffinose and stachyose -- that produce intestinal gas because they are indigestible .
For this reason , many consumers stay away from soy - based products despite their health benefits over dairy - based ones .
In an article in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry , researchers in Singapore said they found a way round this by mixing soybeans with the fungus , R. oligosporus , which contains enzymes that appear to be able to degrade the two culprit sugars .
In their experiment , the researchers injected black soybeans with a diluted solution of the fungus before allowing them to germinate .
After three days , they found that levels of stachyose and raffinose in the germinated soybean had reduced by 92 and 80 percent respectively .
Furthermore , it showed elevated levels of isoflavones , which some nutritionists believe to be useful in preventing cancer .
When a prefab home or building solution is required it can kick a design - oriented mind into high gear – the search for a visually appealing yet functional solution can be incredibly motivating .
These creative designers are no exception .
Prefabrication , modularity and portability also translate well into the world of furniture design , where versatile kit - based and flat - pack products can be more easily made and sustainably shipped .
Prefab is becoming a major buzz word in the world of contemporary architectural design .
Prefabricated and flat - pack homes , buildings and furniture represent the possibilities of partial mass production and extreme portability fused into aesthetically awesome finished products .
The challenge is to combine the need for mobility and sustainability with a building design that appeals to clients and overcomes potentially negative stereotypes ( such as shoddy workmanship or poor design ) that are conventionally associated with prefab .

Hey , you look like a smart kid .
Which of these does n't belong ?
Chinese Red Cross volunteers hauling the remains of a crumpled schoolhouse off a pile of 3rd graders ?
Heart wrenching .

Terrible .
A middle - aged white guy with thick calves and a Rolex using his Denali to tow a horse trailer away from his 6 - bedroom ranch house in Calabasas as flames crest the hillside ?
Mildly enfuriating .
Before the Santa Anas declare open season on the upper - middle class Southern California - wide once again , let 's get it straight : Disasters everywhere are bad times , but wildfires are the only kind that exclusively affect people rich enough to live up against a National Wildlife Refuge .
In spite of all the hoopla during their regularly scheduled seasons , almost nobody dies in even the most destructive of these things .
Not surprisingly .
We 're dealing with an event that announces its approach over many hours in at least 3 of the 5 human senses .
Sight , smell , television .
The only survival instinct you need is the instinct of walking away .
Or , barring that , riding away on an insurance - purchased fatty wagon .
Actually , no .
The only people wildfires consistently manage to nab are firefighters .
Which really means that these guys are n’t actually laying down their lives to save rich people , they ’re dying in order to save rich people ’s things .
" Let us bow our heads to Battalion Chief Steeves , who bravely offered himself to the flames so that some 12 - year - old named Hunter might not have to hassle with finding another Go - Ped on eBay , and trouble his father a second time to fish out a credit card and enter it into the site . "
Rich -o’s , if you really feel like collecting mad fire insurance at regular intervals is such a tragedy , move to Watts .
I guarantee the only " wildfire " they ’ve heard of down that way is the angry spray of bullets the local dealer will loose on your front door when Hunter starts shorting him on payments for his burgeoning dope habit .

やっぱ ruby1.8 のグリーンスレッドじゃパフォーマンスは期待できないか(ﾉД`､ )
実際の使用感な ど
苦労した割にベンチマークでは散々な threaded rails なのですが、せっかくなので実際に本番環境で数日運用しています。
夜間のアクセスが集中する時刻には 、Rails 2.1 以前だと起動している Rails のインスタンス数で捌ききれない量のアクセスが来ると、一気にサービス不能の状態に陥っていたのが、2.2 ( -- threaded ) に変更してからは遅くてもなんとか応答を返そうと努力してくれるようになった感じ。
現 状7台のマシンに分散して 350 インスタンス起動。それなりの並列度があればパフォーマンスの低下は全く気にならない。
まだ暫くは、従来どおり Rails インスタンスの数で並列度を確保しておいて、繁忙時にサービス停止しないよう threaded ( コネクションプーリングも控えめ に 2~3 くらい ) で運用するような加減が良い塩梅なのかもしれない。
Ruby1.9 や JRuby で動かせば、もっと劇的に並列度もパフォーマンスも改善されるのかな(;´Д`)さすがに今それをやる勇気も根性もでないが
まとめ
Rails と俺たちの戦いはまだ始まったばっかりだ！(

Tech 's superstar CEOs have seen their on - paper personal fortunes plummet since the beginning of the year , as a Wall Street Journal story pointed out last week .
Oracle 's Larry Ellison is down $ 6.6 billion , Amazon 's Jeff Bezos is off $ 4.2 billion and Microsoft 's Steve Ballmer 's fortune is down $ 4.8 billion .
But it turns out that 's a bit of a skewed view .
Right at the end of 2007 , tech stocks were at an odd high – actually , for most big tech companies , a high that has been unmatched since 2000 or 2001 .
Measuring the wealth of these guys using a seven - year high at the start and a panic - driven low now does n't really tell us much of anything , outside of its gawking value .
It 's like measuring the New England Patriots by using a start date of the last day of last year 's undefeated season and an end date of this year 's game after quarterback Tom Brady got injured , and saying that 's how far the team had fallen .
I wondered , though , how this wealth comparison looks if you go 10 years back .
In October a decade ago , Amazon was at $ 21 a share .
From there it had a wild ride up , down , back up and back down , arriving at about $ 78 a share in September before the markets plunged , and today 's price of $ 51 .
So measured by Amazon 's stock price alone , Bezos would still be 2.5 times as rich today as he was a decade ago .
( Of course , in between he 's sold some shares , gotten paid big salaries , and made other investments , so Bezos is likely many more times as wealthy as he was a decade ago .
Same is true of other tech CEOs . )
How about Ellison ?
In October 1998 , Oracle was about $ 5 a share .
It roared up with the tech boom , fell , then slowly ascended again , arriving at $ 20 in September before dropping to day 's price of $ 16.50 .
That leaves Ellison more than three times richer in 10 years , based solely on Oracle 's stock price .
And Ballmer ?
In October 1998 , Microsoft was about $ 26.50 .
It zoomed up in 2000 , fell back after the tech bust , and flat - out stalled .
In September the stock was – $ 26.50 .
It 's now about
$ 21.50 .
Steve Ballmer is actually poorer than he was a decade ago .
Over the long run , Amazon and Oracle look like healthy , growing tech companies , while Microsoft 's fortunes make it look more like some old industrial refrigerator maker rather than an exciting tech company .
Success depends not just on how you measure it , but when .

Astronomy is arguably the most beautiful of the sciences .
I 'm biased , of course , but it 's nearly impossible to gaze upon a picture of a galaxy , a moon , a nebula , and not see in it something compellingly artistic .
Sometimes it 's the color , sometimes the shape , and sometimes it 's the knowledge that we can understand the subject of the picture itself .
Science does n't take away from the beauty of nature .
It enhances it , multiplies it .
There are so many incredible astronomical photographs released every year that picking ten as the most beautiful is a substantial task .
But it becomes easier when you consider the science behind the image as well .
Does this image tell us more than that one ?
Was the scientific result drawn from an image surprising , or did it firm up a previously considered hypothesis ?
Still , there 's something to be said for a simple , drop dead gorgeous picture .
So here I present my Top Ten Astronomy Pictures for 2007 .
A note : I tried to avoid repeating using images that were too similar to the ones I posted last year , so you may be surprised at some of my picks , or some pictures I did n't pick .
You may even disagree with me , so if you have a favorite that missed being on this list , leave a link in the comments !
I just bet ten images are n't enough for most people anyway .
All of the pictures here are clickable , and link to higher resolution versions ; some substantially so .
Enjoy .
Number 10 : A Comet Bursts Forth I remember when I first heard of Comet Holmes : I 'd received an email in October from a BABloggee telling me about it , and I could n't wait for the sky to darken so I could see it with my own eyes .
Naked eye comets are rare , but a run -of - the - mill faint one to suddenly brighten by a factor of a million ; well , that 's a must - see .
People all over the world took pictures of the comet 's outburst ( the cause of which is still something of a mystery ) .
For a while , the outburst appeared as a circular shell surrounding the comet , though eventually a more tail - like appearance took shape ... but it was still just plain ol ' odd .
This picture was taken on November 29 , 2007 by the gifted astrophotographer Tamas Ladanyi ( he also has another picture taken on December 5 which shows the motion of the comet , too ) .
This remarkable shot covers several degrees of sky ; by this time the comet was getting difficult to see with the unaided eye ( it got fainter as the debris cloud expanded ) , and at the time the cloud was bigger than the full Moon in the sky .
I love the starry background in this picture , and the small open cluster of stars on the right .
As I write this , Comet Holmes is still fading away .
But will it brighten again ?
In 1892 , just after it was first discovered , Holmes had an outburst very similar to this modern one .
So even as it dims and moves into the outer solar system , is it gearing up for another exciting run ?
I 've written quite a bit about this comet , if you want the background info , and I even made a video .
Number 9 : A Black Hole on Mars [ Update ( January 20 , 2010 : I was just informed I had the wrong link to the original image in my post !
Oops .
I fixed it below . ]
What is it about Mars that draws us in ?
Even through a big telescope it 's small , distant , and fuzzy .
But when you gaze up on it in the night sky it 's a bright bloody beacon , a glaring eye staring back at you .
No wonder the ancients thought it the god of war !
We 've been exploring the Red Planet for decades now , and we have learned so much about it .
Sometime over the past few decades , Mars transformed from an astronomical object to a place , an actual location where we can go and look around .
And even though terabytes of data have been taken , Mars still has a surprise or two up its sleeve .
Update : I had originally described this hole as a skylight to a cavern , but that turns out to be incorrect .
I would normally keep the incorrect text here and strike it through so you could see my mistake , but the way I had written it makes that hard .
So instead , I 'll simply delete the incorrect text , admit my mistake , thank commenter AJ Milne for pointing it out , and post the correct description !
When I saw this image , my jaw dropped .
Other images of the surface showed black spots suspected to be cavern entrances or pits , but they showed featureless black holes .
But then I saw this picture , and once again Mars reinforced the idea that it 's a place .
The picture ( taken with the HiRISE camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ) shows a pit crater , a collapsed shaft going down into the surface of Mars .
It 's on the side of a volcano , and similar features are seen in Hawaiian volcanoes .
Most likely they form when magma under the surface subsides , and the ground above it collapses .
In this hi-res picture , with the Sun off to the side , we can see rocks and debris littering the floor .
It looks like the pit leads to a tunnel off to the right , but that may be an illusion caused by the shadowing .
It tricked me at first !
But it 's probable that this does not lead to an underground cavern .
Still , I 've stood at cavern entrances in Virginia and Kentucky ( and a sinkhole , once ) that are n't too different in appearance from this pit , bringing home the fact that Mars , like Earth , is an actual world .
When I look at this picture my sense of exploration , of wanting to walk into that pit and poke around , is nearly overwhelming .
I can't help thinking that Jules Verne would have felt at home standing at the lip of that crater .
Number 8 : The Wonderful
The red giant star Mira is called " The Wonderful " because it brightens and dims noticeably to the naked eye , sometimes going from quite bright to total invisibility in just a few weeks .
Mira is a star on its death bed ; it is in the final stages of sloughing off its outer layers , and in a few hundred thousand years the entire envelope of the star will have been ejected , leaving only a naked and very hot white dwarf star .
It 's been studied extensively for decades , centuries -- but when the Galex spacecraft pointed its ultraviolet camera at the sky near Mira , astronomers got quite a surprise .
Mira is like a comet !
But a lot , lot bigger : the tail of Mira is 13 light years ( 130 trillion kilometers / 80 trillion miles ) long .
The tail is really the gas ejected by the star as it dies .
As Mira moves through space , the gas between the stars slows the ejected material , forming the long streamer .
It reminds me of The Little Astronomer 's hair flowing behind her as she runs .
But Mira is moving substantially faster than my daughter can run ; it 's tooling along at 140 kilometers / second ( 90 miles / second ) .
It 's taken the star 30,000 years to move the length of its tail .
In the picture , the motion is left to right , so the left - hand side of the tail is the oldest .
On the right you can actually see the bow shock as the star plows through the gas between stars .
This image is n't the highest resolution , or the prettiest of the lot .
But it has so much to say .
Mira is much like the way the Sun will be in a few billion years when its time runs out , for one , so by studying this image we are perhaps peering into our own future .
But it also tells us that even a familiar object can surprise us , when we look at it with different eyes .
For far more detail on the story of this remarkable object , read my blog entry on it .
Number 7 : The Lover 's Embrace of Arp 87 Galaxies seem like immutable giants of the cosmos ; serene , majestic , and unmoving .
But that 's an illusion .
Everything in space is in motion , including galaxies .
As you can imagine , when you take a collection of several hundred billion stars and set it in motion , it can be pretty hard to stop it .
Galaxies move through space at numbing speeds , and the forces built up are mighty .
But then , sometimes , another galaxy gets in the way .
Then those vast forces come into play .
Gravity twists and pulls at the galaxies as they dance past each other .
And , as if they resist the inevitable recession of their partner , they reach out to one another in what looks like a tender embrace , but is in reality a stark ( if lovely ) portent of the destruction wrought on both galaxies .
Arp 87 is the name given to the system of two galaxies , NGC 3808A and NGC 3808B .
They passed each other just as the age of dinosaurs was starting to get going on Earth , 200 million years ago .
The gravity of B ( the cigar - shaped galaxy on the left ) drew out a long tentacle from the much larger A ( the spiral on the right ) , and it appears as if the passage also wrapped the tendril around B , perhaps more than once .
It 's also possible the tendril flared out , separating into streams that only appear to entwine the smaller galaxy .
The pair is 300 million light years away , and the power of the Hubble Space Telescope is clear when that forbidding distance is taken in .
We can see reddish gas clouds collapsing to form stars in the galaxies , and we can ( just barely ) tell that NGC 3808B is looking a little disturbed .
Will the two galaxies continue to separate , or will gravity eventually win , drawing them together ?
Perhaps the latter .
In a few hundred million years the merged remnant will settle down and look like a normal galaxy once again .
And while this may look like a totally alien tableau , keep in mind that the Milky Way Galaxy has suffered through such collisions in the past ... and will again : the Andromeda Galaxy is bearing down on us .
In a couple of billion years , the fireworks here will begin .
My original blog entry about Arp 87 is here .
Number 6 : Lightning at Weikerscheim Observatory Astronomy only plays a tangential role in this picture ... you can see stars in the sky , and the observatory is pretty obvious .
But it 's the terrestrial drama that steals the show .
Jens Hackmann took this stunning picture of a lightning storm near the Weikerscheim Observatory ; the 300 second exposure is enough to see the stars streak and the observatory lit up by ambient light .
Sometimes , when it 's cloudy , observing is difficult ... but you can still get incredible pictures .
Number 5 : A Meeting of the Moons Jupiter is fantastically massive , and its fearsome gravity holds thrall over a retinue of moons that might otherwise be called planets in their on right .
By far , the most interesting of its family are the moons Europa and Io .
Europa is an ice world , covered in a thick sheet of ice that might reach down to depths of over perhaps several kilometers .
It 's nearly a dead certainty that underneath that forbidding icecap is an ocean of water , kept liquid from energy input by gravitational stress as Europa passes by her sister moons .
Of all the real estate in the solar system , many astronomers have their money on Europa as the best place to look for alien life .
Io , on the other hand , is perhaps the worst place for life .
It has an incredibly high sulfur content , for one thing .
For another , the same gravitational heating that keeps Europa 's ocean liquid also keeps
Io 's interior molten , but it gives the moon a cosmic case of indigestion .
Io is wracked with volcanoes .
They are almost constantly erupting , spewing molten sulfur over a kilometer high in the low gravity , and plumes of dust and gas blast hundreds of kilometers off the surface .
This activity was first discovered when the Voyager 1 probe passed the moon in 1979 , but subsequent space probes have gotten even more detailed images .
When the New Horizons Pluto probe passed Jupiter in March 2007 for a gravity boost , it snapped a beautiful picture of the sisters .
Europa is the crescent on the lower left , and Io ( obviously ) is the one on the upper right .
The plume you see is from the volcano Tvashtar , which has been active for quite some time now .
If you look right at the bottom of the plume , you can see molten sulfur glowing red .
Two other volcanoes appear to be making some noise as well .
While they appear to be close together , the two moons were actually nearly 800,000 kilometers apart when this picture was taken ;
Io was on one side of Jupiter and Europa on the other , but from the spacecraft 's perspective they were next to each other in the sky .
This picture is actually a composite of two images ; one was greyscale and had high resolution , and the other was in color but had lower resolution .
By merging the two , we can see more details than we could from the color image alone , and we get the benefit of having the colors enhance the scene .
When I first saw this image , I knew right away the two moons were not close together at all .
My secret ?
I saw that the dark side of Europa was truly dark , but Io 's dark side was lighter .
That meant that Io was positioned such that Jupiter was illuminating its otherwise dark half , while Europa must have been on the other side of Jupiter , where it was dark .
Sometimes , you can tell a lot just by looking at a image and picturing the geometry in your head .
Funny : I almost picked a movie sequence of Tvashtar erupting for this Top Ten list , but I had to cull it due to the other images I liked better .
Plus , the animation is 752 kb , and I did n't want to choke my server .
But you can see it on Emily Lakdawalla 's Planetary Society Blog .
It 's worth watching !
Number 4 : Dark Matter Makes an Appearance
It 's baffling , and a little humbling , to think that what we can see , taste , and feel makes up only a tiny fraction of the Universe .
Normal matter only constitutes 4 % of the cosmic budget , with dark energy eating up a whopping 73 % .
The remaining 23 % belongs to the mysterious dark matter : some exotic form of material that does not emit light , but does exert a gravitational force .
Astronomers knew it was out there for decades ; it pulled on galaxies and clusters and galaxies , changing their speeds .
We just could n't see it !
But the gravity of dark matter has a subtle effect : it acts like a lens , bending the path of light coming from objects behind it .
We can use telescopes to map out the location of normal matter , and then measure the distortion of background objects from the intervening dark matter .
When that is done , spectacular results emerge .
In this Hubble image , the white dots are entire galaxies .
They are part of a cluster called CL0024+1652 , which is a whopping 5 billion light years away .
The blue glow is the location of the dark matter , revealed by its distortion of the shapes of more distant galaxies behind it .
The dark matter is in the shape of a ring surrounding the cluster , which indicates that a long time ago , CL0024 suffered a mighty blow , colliding head - on with another cluster .
The dark matter from the two clusters passed right through each other , and their gravity caused the material to form the ring shape .
We 're seeing this right down the barrel of the collision .
This image is a stunning confirmation of the existence of dark matter , and our understanding of how it works .
Many people -- who do n't understand the science -- claim dark matter does n't exist , and that astronomers are making it all up .
Well , there 's a giant smoke ring in the sky indicating they are quite wrong .
However , that 's not to say we understand everything about such events .
In a picture I almost picked for the Top Ten , we see evidence that there are holes in our knowledge .
In this composite image of the galaxy cluster Abell 520 using Chandra , CFHT , and the Subaru telescope , red is normal matter heated to millions of degrees , and blue shows the location of the dark matter .
The problem is , where the normal matter is densest the dark matter is least dense , and vice - versa .
That 's the opposite of what 's expected here .
Perhaps dark matter particles interact with each other differently than we think , or there was some odd factor in the cluster collision that 's throwing a monkey wrench into the works .
There 's a lot more about dark matter to learn , and images like these will help us solve these mysteries .
Right now there a lot we do n't know ... but we 'll figure it out .
That 's why astronomy is so much fun .
Number 3 : Chaos in Vela I have long been a fan of Davide De Martin from Sky Factory .
He takes images from professional observatories and stitches them together to make images of indescribable beauty , elegance , and wonder .
His work is , simply , breathtaking .
This image shows the devastation wrought when a star explodes .
The Vela Supernova Remnant formed when a massive star 800 light years away blew up 11,000 years ago .
Expanding at a ferocious velocity , it is now 8 degrees across in the sky -- 16 times the apparent width of the Moon , and about the size of your outstretched fist !
David 's mosaic shows a stunning amount of detail , tracing the variety of shapes and patterns the expanding gas makes as it slams into the interstellar junk floating around it .
And if that 's not enough , the full - size image he has on his site is well over a billion pixels in size .
Think about that the next time you brag about your digital camera .
I wrote more about David and his Vela image on my blog .
Number 2 : STEREO Eclipse
Technically , this one is not a picture , but I had to include it anyway .
It 's just so cool !
Studying the Sun seems like a pretty good idea ; as the major source of light and heat for our planet , it 's a good thing that we try to understand it .
And the Sun is a star , with all that implies : it 's huge in size , and frightening in its energy production .
To better understand it and the complicated nature of its surface activity , NASA launched a pair of satellites that can take pictures of the Sun simultaneously from different angles , providing a 3D view of our nearest star .
They 're called the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory , or ( haha ) STEREO .
One satellite orbits the Sun ahead of the Earth , and the other behind .
They stay in the same orbital plane as the Earth does in its travels around the Sun , and that means that sometimes you get interesting geometric situations which arise .
The STEREO team realized that there would be a time when the Moon would pass in front of the Sun as seen by one of the spacecraft .
Solar eclipses are rare on Earth , but from STEREO 's vantage it would be even more unusual .
From the Earth , the Sun is about 400 times farther away than the Moon , and is also about 400 times the Moon 's physical size .
These two characteristics cancel out , meaning the Sun and Moon are about the same apparent size in the sky , so every solar eclipse has the Moon slipping in front of the Sun , with the dark disk of the Moon just barely ( if even ) covering the bright disk of the Sun .
That is , every solar eclipse as seen from the Earth .
But STEREO was receding from the Earth and Moon .
To it , the Moon appeared much smaller than we see it , stuck as we are on the surface of our planet .
The Sun , however , was still at about the same distance , and therefore looked the same size as we see it .
This means that , to STEREO , the Moon appeared far smaller than the Sun .
Not long after launch , the situation arose that the Moon would pass directly in front of the Sun as seen from one of the spacecraft .
STEREO turned its eye that way , and recorded what may be the most remarkable footage of a solar eclipse ever taken .
This sequence shows something we can never see from the Earth : a shrunken Moon passing in front of the Sun .
Technically , it 's not even really an eclipse ; it 's a transit ( when something small crosses in front of something large ) .
That video , only 8 seconds long , is incredible .
We see the Sun and Moon literally every day , of course , and it totally shook me to see them look so different .
That 's why I chose this sequence .
I love seeing the familiar become unfamiliar , grasping a new perspective on the everyday , the ordinary .
You see ?
There is something new under the Sun .
By the way , STEREO has taken some truly excellent images of the sky , including an astonishing sequence of Comet McNaught .
And the Number One Astronomy Picture of 2007 is ...
The Beautiful Face of IC 342
I am a sucker for spiral galaxies , especially ones that are face - on .
They are sweeping , majestic , chillingly beautiful , and utterly mesmerizing .
There are many such grand design spirals in the sky , and astronomers are almost all familiar with the roster : M81 , M51 , M101 , and others .
But there is one that is a bit less seen , less well known .
That 's because it hides itself , tucked away in a part of the sky where stars and dust are thick , obscured by the fog of our own Galaxy .
But it is no less gorgeous for being demure .
This creature is IC 342
, a nearby spiral lying only 11 million light years away , very close on a galactic scale .
If IC342 were located in a region of the sky where our own Milky Way did n't interfere with the view so much , it would be one of the most celebrated objects in the sky , and would most likely sport a proper name and not just a numerical designation .
But because we see it through so much murk , it remains mostly unknown .
What a misfortune !
It is a spectacular object
.
The power of the Mayall 4 - meter telescope at Kitt Peak in Arizona reveals the true beauty of this galaxy .
Almost all the stars in the image are actually in our Galaxy , much closer than IC 342 ( imagine looking out a dirty window to see a bird sitting on a fence to get an idea of what 's going on ) .
But look at it !
The arms trace out the births of countless stars , punctuated by glowing red gas as the young stars heat their cocoons .
Dark dust lanes hide the stars behind them , mimicking the way the Milky Way dust hides IC 342 itself .
You can trace the magnificent arms all the way in to the center , where they meet in a pinwheel of colossal proportions .
In the highest resolution images ( click here if you dare !
) the picture is even more boggling : you can see far more distant galaxies in the background , some edge - on spirals , and even one ring galaxy .
Huge clumps of star - forming regions in IC 342 reveal themselves , and you can spot places where the spiral arms split into separate spurs .
Even the foreground stars , so much closer to home , provide a polychromatically spangled vista against which the much more regal spiral lies .
All in all , a devastating picture .
The colors , the features , the composition ... and it shows us that sometimes , beauty and grandeur can be missed , even when it 's in your own back yard .
And that 's why it 's my Number One Astronomy Picture of 2007 .
Nothing says romance like wine .
In California and Illinois September is officially wine month .
Wine celebrations , tours and events are going on everywhere .
It is fitting .
To me Autumn and wine go together , especially with a twist of romance thrown in .
Maybe that ’s why I got married in September .
Love and romance is always swirling in the crisp Autumn air .
This weekend my husband and I will be celebrating our fifth wedding anniversary .
How are we going to celebrate ?
With some awesome Italian food and a little bit of wine .
Ideally , I would love to take a wine tour of some of the vineyards and wineries around Michigan but I do n’t know if we ’ll have the time , or the babysitter .
I think we ’ll wait until the following weekend ( which is my birthday , woo hoo free wine tasting ) and visit the grand opening of a new winery right in our area , Wolcott Winery , part of Wolcott Orchards .
It ’s not biodynamic or organic but it is local .
Another fabulous addition to the many wineries in Michigan .
What you did n’t know Michigan had vineyards ?
Michigan has an extraordinary amount of vineyards and wineries for being such a cold state .
Honestly I do n’t know much about wine .
I ’m not some wine connoisseur or snob , I just like what I like .
Do n’t ask me to pair up the right food with the right wine or even distinguish between dry and wet wines ( okay , maybe I can do that ) .
Sometimes I buy wine solely based on what the bottle and label look like ( I ’m a sucker for aesthetics ) .
One thing I do regularly though , is buy wine from local Michigan wineries .
St Julian ’s is one of my favorites .
It is the oldest and largest winery in Michigan , founded originally in 1921 by Mariano Meconi as Border City Wine Cellars .
Several name changes later the winery found it ’s current name of St. Julian Winery during World War II .
It was named after the patron saint of Meconi ’s village in Faleria , Italy .
I would love to visit their main facility in Paw Paw , MI and go on the free tour and tasting .
They even offer tasting for kids , since St Julian ’s produces twice as much juice as they do wine .
Another Michigan brand I particularly enjoy is Leelanau Cellars .
Their kitschy seasonal wine , Witch ’s Brew ( which I originally purchased because of the cool label and name ) , is a fun treat for Halloween .
A spicy blend best served warm , it has an interesting flavor .
I check out a lot of wine , my kitchen and dining room are both decorated with a wine theme , but I try to stick with local wines to support Michigan ’s ever struggling economy .
Michigan ’s wine businesses created nearly $ 790 million worth of economic value to the State of Michigan in 2005 , they paid more than $ 42 million in state and local taxes in Michigan , and they support more than 5,000 jobs across the state , with a payroll of more than $ 190 million .
Those are all some very green reasons for me to check out what local wines have to offer .
I ’m looking forward to trying out Wolcott Winery ’s new selection .
What ’s available in your area ?
It is worth checking out .

The $ 700 billion infusion of U.S. Treasury funds into mortgages and mortgage - backed securities , which will begin later this week , is necessary because the free market is incapable of making such a massive investment , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told members of the National Association of Business Economics ( NABE ) at their annual meeting in Washington on Tuesday .
A free market economist from the libertarian Ludwig Von Mises Institute , however , told CNSNews.com that while private investors may not have had $ 700 billion available to purchase shaky investments , it was a financial venture too risky for them to take anyway .
“ Given the scale of the losses in portfolios , raising enough capital from private investors was n’t feasible , ” Bernanke told the NABE .
Also , “ their government sponsored status precluded a merger or acquisition from other companies . ”
But Joe Thornton , a senior analyst at the Mises Institute , told CNSNews.com that investors were not interested in investing in companies like Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac , because it was too risky .
“ True , the market is not going to raise the capital for these failing companies , ” said Thornton .
“ It would have let them fail , which is precisely what it should be doing .
“ The bailout approach is the problem , ” said Thornton .
“ Bernanke is assuming that the market needed the capital to make all of these firms and businesses solvent .
That is simply not the case .
Bernanke thinks he needs to pay for all of this stuff to work , when in reality these business models and the products they offer are seriously flawed . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
But Bernanke explained that , except in extreme cases , the Federal Reserve operates under the belief that the free market can be relied upon to solve financial crises .
“ The Federal Reserve believes that , whenever possible , such difficulties should be addressed in private sector arrangements , ” said Bernanke .
“ For example , by raising equity capital as many firms have done , by negotiations leading to a merger or acquisitions , or by an orderly wind down . ”
“ Government assistance should be provided only when the financial system and thus the health of the broader economy are at risk , ” he said .
“ In those cases when financial stability is threatened , however , intervention to protect the public interest may well be justified . ”
Thorton , however , said the Fed ’s actions over the last 14 months prove it does not favor a free market approach to dealing with crises .
“ That ’s just classic ‘ Fed - speak , ’ ” said Thornton .
“ If that were the case , he [ Bernanke ] would not have been dangling all these bailouts and auctions and facilities .
The Federal Reserve is currently one of the main road blocks obstructing the will of the private market . ”
Bernanke said that the Treasury will start distributing the $ 700 billion bailout , which was approved in a bill passed by Congress and signed by the president last Friday , sometime later this week .
The NABE is an association of about 2,500 professionals , who have an interest in business economics .
Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan served as chairman of NABE during 1969 and 1970 .

Id Software technical director John Carmack has told Eurogamer that the reason Apple does n't " deeply get " gaming , as he put it during his QuakeCon keynote , is down to Apple 's CEO .
" The truth is Steve Jobs does n't care about games .
This is going to be one of those things that I say something in an interview and it gets fed back to him and I 'm on his s*** head list for a while on that , until he needs me to do something else there .
But I think that that 's my general opinion .
He 's not a gamer , " Carmack explained in an interview published today .
" It 's difficult to ask somebody to get behind something they do n't really believe in .
I mean obviously he believes in the music and the iTunes and that whole side of things , and the media side of things , and he gets it and he pushes it and they do wonderful things with that , but he 's not a gamer .
That 's just the bottom line about it . "
With Mac owners now able to use Boot Camp to install Windows XP alongside OS X on Intel - based machines , Carmack also questioned the value of including native OS X support in cross- platform development plans - albeit something that is happening on id's upcoming action title Rage .
As he said during Thursday 's QuakeCon keynote , however , he has high hopes for the iPhone .
" I think the iPhone is a potentially extremely important platform for a lot of reasons , and I think it could be the type of thing that really makes inroads into ... does it kill the PSP .
There are structural reasons why it 's not going to kill the DS in there , but it certainly should be in there in the running there as a device that you can get modern , quality games for something , and I think it 's a great platform for content and new talent on there , " he explained .
He even suggested that two - man development teams could make " a couple of million dollars probably by having some breakout success " .
For Carmack 's part , id has a couple of iPhone projects in the early stages , but the company is n't showing anything much yet - except to say that neither is likely to be a port of a recognised shooter like Doom 3 .
" There 's obviously a few FPSes out there - Quake ports and stuff like that - and they 're trying out different things and none of them are good yet , " Carmack pointed out .
" What you have to do when you 're looking at a new platform is not take your favourite thing and try and cram it onto the platform , but you need to look at the platform and see what you can do , which is what we did on our conventional mobile devices . "
For more on Apple , iPhone and id Software - and of course Rage , Doom 4 , Quake Live , the console war and digital distribution , among other things - be sure to check out the full John Carmack interview elsewhere on Eurogamer .

What movie would you like recreated in plastic bricks ?
The OpenSolaris project and Sine Nomine Associates have announced that Sirius - a Solaris port for IBM mainframes - is ready for action .
The Sirius variant of Solaris runs atop IBM 's z/VM operating system , which is also one of the pioneer virtualization environments for servers .
The Sirius code is a 64 - bit implementation of Solaris that runs on z9 or z10 mainframe processors and requires z / VM 5.3 or later .
z /VM is one of the ways that IBM and its partner commercial Linux distributors - Red Hat and Novell - support Linux on the mainframe .
But Linux also runs natively on top of the Processor Resource / Systems Manager ( PR / SM ) hypervisor that is nearly two decades old and that supports z/ OS , Linux , z / VM , z/VSE , and TPF operating systems .
PR /SM is a hybrid hardware - software virtualization hypervisor that is a mix of microcode based largely on earlier versions of the VM platform for mainframes and hardware - assist features that have been part of the mainframe iron since PR / SM was announced in 1989 .
Sine Nomine is the mainframe consultancy that has done the bulk of the work on Sirius .
Last year , when I talked to the company about the project , it said that porting an operating system to PR / SM is particularly difficult , and that 's why Sirius is taking the z / VM route to the mainframe .
Moreover , PR / SM tops out at a mere 60 partitions per mainframe , while z / VM can have thousands of partitions and span up to 8 TB of main memory and 32 processor cores in a single partition .
You can get the Sirius binary code through Sine Nomine 's Web site and the open source code through the OpenSolaris site , which is where development for OpenSolaris for x64 and Sparc processors as well as the related " Polaris " project for Power - based machines is hosted .
A prototype of OpenSolaris running on mainframes was announced a year ago , by the way .
While IBM and Sun announced an OEM agreement in August 2007 that had IBM embrace Solaris and sell support contracts for it on selected models of its System x rack and BladeCenter blade servers and Big Blue gave the nod to the mainframe and Power ports , neither Sun nor IBM have made any big moves to get Polaris and Sirius rolled up into a commercially supported variant of Solaris 10 .
Sine Nomine has been at this Solaris - on - the - mainframe thing for a while .
The company did a feasibility study looking at moving OpenSolaris to the mainframe in 2005 , before Sun even went open source with the code .
Right after Sun put out the OpenSolaris source code , Sine Nomine created a project for the mainframe port , but serious development did not begin until November 2006 .
The company went public with the effort in April 2007 , but it really did n't come to anyone 's attention in the larger IT space until Sun and IBM inked their OEM agreement last August . ®
The FCC has completed tests confirming that deployment of its porn - and - cost - free network wo n't interfere with incumbent operators , as already established by Ofcom and Czech deployments .
The tests were completed during September , and state unequivocally that a deployment of Time Division Duplexing technology wo n't interfere with T - Mobile 's Frequency Divisioned network lurking nearby .
Licensees of the spectrum , known as Advanced Wireless Spectrum ( AWS ) , will be allowed to deploy any technology they want , including TDD , and that worried incumbent operator T - Mobile .
These tests were demanded by T - Mobile despite the same issue having been thoroughly investigated by UK regulator Ofcom when looking at WiMAX deployments , and both technologies happily coexisting on neighbouring frequencies in the Czech Republic .
In fact , the tests were such a waste of time that two members of congress were moved to write to the chair of the FCC iterating this fact , and pointing out that the demands were little more than a delaying tactic by T - Mobile .
That remains speculation , but the tests have now established that radio spectrum operates the same on both sides of the Atlantic and clears the way for the FCC to auction off the 25MHz of spectrum to anyone prepared to offer advertising - supported broadband to 50 per cent of the US population within four years .
The ( very ) technically minded might enjoy the full analysis direct from the FCC ( pdf ) ; but in summary , the level of interference that could be generated is not significant , regardless of the technology the auction winner decides to deploy .
It remains to be seen if anyone will be tempted to bid for the spectrum , which starts at 2155 M Hz but comes with significant public service guarantees including a promise to prevent users accessing inappropriate content .
The economic situation has deteriorated slightly since June , when the proposals were published , and even then the business model was suspect .
There 's also the problem of finding a filtering technology to remove all that grot , and one that the whole USA finds acceptable . ®
COMMENTARY :
About 50 parishioners were locked into the Assemblies of God church before it was set ablaze .
They were mostly women and children .
Those who tried to flee were hacked to death by machete - wielding members of a mob numbering 2,000 .
The 2008 New Year Day atrocity in the Kenyan village Eldoret , about 185 miles northwest of Nairobi , had all the markings of the Rwanda genocide of a decade earlier .
By mid-February 2008 , more than 1,500 Kenyans were killed .
Many were slain by machete - armed attackers .
More than 500,000 were displaced by the religious strife .
Villages lay in ruin .
Many of the atrocities were perpetrated by Muslims against Christians .
The violence was led by supporters of Raila Odinga , the opposition leader who lost the Dec. 27 , 2007 , presidential election by more than 230,000 votes .
Odinga supporters began the genocide hours after the final election results were announced Dec. 30 .
Mr. Odinga was a member of Parliament representing an area in western Kenya , heavily populated by the Luo tribe , and the birthplace of Barack Obama ’s father .
Mr. Odinga had the backing of Kenya ’s Muslim community heading into the election .
For months he denied any ties to Muslim leaders , but fell silent when Sheik Abdullahi Abdi , chairman of the National Muslim Leaders Forum , appeared on Kenya television displaying a memorandum of understanding signed on Aug. 29 , 2007 , by Mr. Odinga and the Muslim leader .
Mr. Odinga then denied his denials .
The details of the MOU were shocking .
In return for Muslim backing , Mr. Odinga promised to impose a number of measures favored by Muslims if he were elected president .
Among these were recognition of “ Islam as the only true religion , ” Islamic leaders would have an “ oversight role to monitor activities of ALL other religions [ emphasis in original ] , ” installation of Shariah courts in every jurisdiction , a ban on Christian preaching , replacement of the police commissioner who “ allowed himself to be used by heathens and Zionists , ” adoption of a women ’s dress code , and bans on alcohol and pork .
This was not Mr. Odinga ’s first brush with notoriety .
Like his father , Jaramogi Oginga Odinga , the main opposition leader in the 1960s and 1970s , Raila Odinga is a Marxist He graduated from East Germany ’s Magdeburg University in 1970 on a scholarship provided by the East German government .
He named his oldest son after Fidel Castro .
Raila Odinga was implicated in the bloody coup attempt in 1982 against then - President Daniel Arap Moi , a close ally of the United States .
Kenya has been one of the most stable democracies in Africa since the 1960s .
The ethnic cleansing earlier this year was the worst violence in Kenya since that 1982 coup attempt .
Mr. Odinga spent eight years in prison .
At the time , he denied guilt but later detailed he was a coup leader in his 2006 biography .
Statue of limitations precluded further prosecution when the biography appeared .
Initially , Mr. Odinga was not the favored opposition candidate to stand in the 2007 election against President Mwai Kibaki , who was seeking his second term .
However , he received a tremendous boost when Sen. Barack Obama arrived in Kenya in August 2006 to campaign on his behalf .
Mr. Obama denies that supporting Mr. Odinga was the intention of his trip , but his actions and local media reports tell otherwise .
Mr. Odinga and Mr. Obama were nearly inseparable throughout Mr. Obama ’s six - day stay .
The two traveled together throughout Kenya and Mr. Obama spoke on behalf of Mr. Odinga at numerous rallies .
In contrast , Mr. Obama had only criticism for Kibaki .
He lashed out against the Kenyan government shortly after meeting with the president on Aug. 25 .
“ The [ Kenyan ] people have to suffer over corruption perpetrated by government officials , ” Mr. Obama announced .
“ Kenyans are now yearning for change , ” he declared .
The intent of Mr. Obama ’s remarks and actions was transparent to Kenyans - he was firmly behind Mr. Odinga .
Mr. Odinga and Mr. Obama had met several times before the 2006 trip .
Reports indicate Mr. Odinga visited Mr. Obama during trips to the U.S. in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 .
Mr. Obama sent his foreign policy adviser Mark Lippert to Kenya in early 2006 to coordinate his summer visit .
Mr. Obama ’s August trip coincided with strategizing by Orange Democratic Movement leaders to defeat Mr. Kibaki in the upcoming elections .
Mr. Odinga represented the ODM ticket in the presidential race .
Mr. Odinga and Mr. Obama ’s father were both from the Luo community , the second - largest tribe in Kenya , but their ties run much deeper .
Mr. Odinga told a stunned BBC Radio interviewer the reason why he and Mr. Obama were staying in near daily telephone contact was because they were cousins .
In a Jan. 8 , 2008 , interview , Mr. Odinga said Mr. Obama had called him twice the day before while campaigning in the New Hampshire primary before adding , “ Barack Obama ’s father is my maternal uncle . ”
President Kibaki requested a meeting of all opposition leaders in early January in an effort to quell the violence .
All agreed to attend except Mr. Odinga .
A month later , Mr. Kibaki offered Mr. Odinga the role of prime minister , the de facto No. 2 in the Kenyan government , in return for an end to the attacks .
Mr. Odinga was sworn in on April 17 , 2008 .
Mr. Obama ’s judgment is seriously called into question when he backs an official with troubling ties to Muslim extremists and whose supporters practice ethnic cleansing and genocide .
It was Islamic extremists in Kenya who bombed the U.S. Embassy in 1998 , killing more than 200 and injuring thousands .
None of this has dissuaded Mr. Obama from maintaining disturbing loyalties .

We will take a look at Schiff from two perspectives shortly .
First let 's note the massive influx of workers into Chinese cities is now in reverse as Chinese job losses prompt exodus .
Tens of thousands of migrant workers are leaving the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou after losing their jobs , railway officials say .
The increase to 130,000 passengers leaving the city 's main station daily is being blamed on the credit crunch .
Guangzhou is one of China 's largest manufacturing hubs , but many companies who export products have collapsed .
Chinese officials are worried that a sudden increase in unemployment could lead to social unrest .
The most badly hit export companies are toy , shoe , and furniture manufacturers .
There are already reports of demonstrations and social unrest in the provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong .
Toy Manufacturing Collapses
A total of 3,631 toy exporters or 52.7 percent of the industry 's businesses shut down in 2008 .
They were mainly small - sized toy producers with an export value of less than $ 100,000 .
Workers at a toy factory in Guangdong have become the latest victims of the worldwide financial tsunami .
More than 6,000 employees lost their jobs when Smart Union , a major toy manufacturer in Dongguan , closed earlier this week .
" The main reason for the closure is we are too dependent on the US market , which has become sluggish , " said Xu Xiaofang , a Smart Union human resource worker .
After losing money for the first half of the year , its cash flow finally dried up .
Machinery normally busy churning out toys for major US toy brands Mattel and Disney now sits idle .
Speaking in an interview with Guangzhou Daily , Wang Zhiguang , vice - chairman of the Dongguan Toy Industry Association , said : " Of the 3,800 - odd toy firms in Dongguan , no more than 2,000 are likely to survive the next couple of years . "
Xiao Yong , the owner of a Dongguan firm that sells Christmas trees and gifts , is equally worried about what the coming winter might have in store .
" One of the main problems is that many toymakers in Dongguan rely too much on orders from the US and Europe .
The financial crises there have led directly to a reduction in orders , " he said .
The number of orders his firm has received for this Christmas is about half what it reported last year , he said .
Two sub - contract manufacturing factories under one global toy maker in South China 's Guangdong Province have collapsed , in the first bankruptcy case for the substantial economy in China , according to today 's National Business Daily .
The two factories , located in Zhangmutou Town of Dongguan City , were toymakers for Smart Union Group ( Holding ) Ltd , one of the world 's largest manufacturing and trading companies in toys and recreational products on an original equipment manufacturer basis .
All the products were being sold to the United States .
Home Prices Collapse In China
The speedy rise — and speedier fall — of River Dragon is a depressingly familiar story in China these days .
Thousands of Chinese factories have shuttered in the past year , done in by :
• An export - killing global slowdown that began with the collapse of the U.S. housing market and the ensuing financial crisis .
• Rising materials costs that have squeezed profit margins .
• A deliberate Chinese government campaign to regulate sweatshop factories out of business .
The Chinese economy is absorbing another blow beyond crumbling exports : collapsing home prices .
Nicholas Lardy , senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington , D.C. , reckons a slowdown in construction could shave another 1 to 2 percentage points off China 's economic growth .
" The property bubble is already starting to burst , " says Yan Yu , a business management scholar at Peking University , researching the export center of Dongguan in southern Guangdong province .
" House prices here in Dongguan have fallen by up to 50 % this year , " leaving many homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth .
" People have worked all their lives and believed the hype and bought overvalued properties , then saw their savings vanish , " says independent economist Andy Xie in Shanghai .
" That carries more political risk " than rising joblessness .
China Announces Major Stimulus Plan
China announced a stimulus program that could exceed half a trillion dollars , its biggest move yet to rebuild rapidly weakening confidence and unleash domestic demand to counter the prospect of global economic recession .
The package of infrastructure investment and other stimulus measures is to be spread over the next two years and appears to include some measures that were already announced .
Still , the huge scale of the planned response -- potentially 4 trillion yuan ( $ 586 billion ) -- underscores how rapidly the outlook for China 's once - booming economy has worsened and how the country remains comparatively well - placed to deal with such a slowdown .
Other governments around the world are also considering fiscal stimulus plans to boost their economies , something the International Monetary Fund has encouraged .
U.S. lawmakers , during their lame - duck session next week , are expected to consider a stimulus package focused on aid to local governments and extended unemployment benefits .
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is pushing for a two - step plan with as much as $ 100 billion this month followed by a companion measure early next year that would include a tax cut .
Outside economists are urging Democratic congressional leaders to move a much larger package -- as much as $ 300 billion , or 2 % of U.S. economic output -- as the U.S. economy faces one of its worst recessions since the 1930s .
China 's plan appears to be comparable in size .
In a statement announcing the plan , China 's State Council said it would deliver 120 billion yuan ( $ 18 billion ) of new spending in the last quarter of this year alone .
The State Council -- effectively China 's cabinet -- estimated that would drive an additional increase of 400 billion yuan in local and private - sector investment throughout the economy .
China 's government is also making plans for new spending in areas such as low - cost housing , road and rail infrastructure , agricultural subsidies , health care and social welfare over the next two years .

Escalating Inflationary Pressures

Last week the U.S. Federal Reserve moved one step closer to acknowledging reality .
Unfortunately , it did n’t let that admission move it from a policy course firmly guided by fantasy - meaning the central bank opted to stand pat on interest rates , despite the clear escalation of inflationary pressures .

In case you missed it over the weekend , a minister who gave the invocation at a McCain rally in Iowa couched his prayer in terms I ’ve never heard before :
God ’s own reputation is at stake in this election , he said , because so many Muslims , Hindus and Buddhists around the world are praying for an Obama victory that if Obama wins , they ’ll think “ their god is bigger ” than the Christian god .
It conjures up bad Japanese movies , or the fanciful musings of 10 - year - old boys .
Who would win between King Kong and Godzilla ?
Between Allah and Vishnu ?
Does the Christian god have an unfair advantage because he ’s three in one ?
His “ theological ” take also suggests some influences from Greek mythology , but instead of angry gods hurling lightning bolts at one another , they ’re trying to throw an election one way or the other , which is almost post - modern in its own way .
Just in time for the holidays , here 's some toys you may remember that are still around and a few that are n't .
Where have some of the most popular toys of old gone ?
Well many of them are still around and have been fixed up for the youngsters of today .
( With even more lead paint ! )
We start our toy trip down memory lane in no special order with one of my favorites ...
Speak-n- Spell
Before Leap Frog , Speak - n - Spell was the toy kids used to make computers say and spell shit , fuck and loads of other naughty words Mom would stick soap in your mouth for .
Texas Instruments created Speak n Spell but they 've moved on to creating security devices and Telcom stuff for adults .
Today you can go down memory lane with many Speak - n - Spell emulators like this one .
Weebles
The ads said " They wobble but they do n't fall down . "
And they did n't .
Plus they were practically indestructible unless you taped them to an M - 80 like I did once .
Poor Weeble dog .
Weebles are still wobbling today , but were remade to look more like real characters as opposed to being illustrated faces encased in clear plastic like the ones I had .
Teddy Ruxpin
This little bear talked and chatted with you .
Think Chucky but dressed as a bear .
Teddy 's still here .
And still convincing children to join his cult .
Cabbage Patch Dolls
You have to give props to a toy that people trampled each other to get .
The Cabbage Patch Dolls are still around with the same gimmick .
Although they 've made the birthplace of the dolls , BabyLand General ® Hospital , in Cleveland , GA a tourist destination .
Petster
Before the Robot dog came the robot cat .
Or , The Clapper in synthetic fur .
These days you can only find them on Ebay or by Googling Petster toy .
Speaking of The Clapper .
Before there was Head On , The Clapper had the dumbest commercial ever that sold a boat load of product .
ViewMaster
It never really went away but interestingly enough , this year View Master celebrates 65 years of , um , viewing stuff .
To keep up with the times they 've made 3D reels and Viewers with sound .
Even with computers , video games and such , kids still love them .
You can find vintage versions on Ebay too .
Pound Puppies
A stuffed animal wrapped in a gimmick ... dogs stuck in the pound .
Something to go with your Cabbage Patch kid I guess .
My cousin's had a whole kennel of these in their house .
Pound Puppies are still being rescued in new colors , styles , looks and the same stupid jingle selling them .
Colecovision
Screw Atari , Colecovision was what the cool kids had .
For a millisecond .
Looks like the company still makes crude hand - held games and players to sell at Target .
He -Man and the Master 's of the Universe
The muscle bound hero and his friends battled the evil Skeletor and his psycho friends for Castle Grayskull in Eternia .
He - Man sold boats loads of toys way back when .
Has n't made a comeback of late except on this funny Myspace page .
Glo -Worm
A worm that provides a soothing light to toddlers at bedtime .
I think it even got so big there was a Saturday morning cartoon .
Ugh .
No worries Glo-Worm lovers cause Hasbro has given it a new light .
Easy bake oven
Easy bake never really went away since it 's introduction in 1963 .
Today it 's not just about the oven , it 's part of the Easy Bake Oven World .
Hasbro added oven mitts , aprons and loads more mixes - which is good since you could never find the refills back in the day .
Snack - sized yum !
Voltron
A Saturday morning show turned best - selling toy .
A precursor to Power Rangers .
The afternoon cartoons have been remastered and marketed through a pretty cool site .
The toys do n't seem to have been redone like Transformers .
Yet .
Stompers
Motorized 4X4 trucks that looked tough but had trouble going over things thicker than a pencil .
They may have been re-released some time ago but I can't really tell from this Stompers fan site .
Sadly , it seems Stompers had their day and have since faded into a landfill somewhere .
That 's all for now .
If you 've got an update on any of these or if I missed you 're favorite let me know .

In the present economic climate , the hard - pressed are counting their pennies .
Teacher Kath Kelly found £ 117 in dropped cash on the streets of Bristol , during a year in which she lived off £ 1 a day .
She shares her tips on spotting free money .
Dick Whittington found that the streets of London were not paved with gold after all .
He and his pussycat had their eyes set a bit higher than one and two pence pieces , but Kath Kelly can vouch for the potential riches that millions of us step over every day .
In 12 months , she found £ 117 lying loose on the streets of Bristol , while living off £ 1 a day .
So how does she fare in central London ?
A lot of people would not consider a penny worth bending down for , but I would n't pass up any coins
Kath Kelly Surveying the busy Euston Road before starting , the 47 - year - old teacher is not optimistic .
" Bristol streets are a bit grubbier , so money goes unnoticed , but these streets are cleanly swept .
But people probably chuck their money around a bit more in London , so who knows . "
It 's perhaps the first time the streets of Kings Cross have been described as too clean , but the footpath is soon getting another sweep , this time from her eyes which discreetly skirt the paverment as she walks and talks .
" Bus stops are good , and places where people get out of taxis .
They tend not to check their change too carefully , or they 're a bit drunk getting out of the taxi and just drop it when they get their things together .
People do that , do n't they ?
It takes a trained eye to spot a penny from distance " Also places where people come and go a lot in the evening where they might not see very clearly , like outside cinemas .
" Supermarkets too - the pounds they put into machines for their trolleys , and do n't always put in the money carefully . "
She compares the technique to picking fruit - getting your " eye in " by imagining the colour and shape of what you 're looking for .
It 's a method that 's brought her results in the past , but after 10 minutes on the streets of London , we have n't found enough for a penny sweet .
Penny - picking shame
The prospects improve when she reaches Euston railway station - " nice and grubby " , she says .
Her radar begins to quiver and suddenly in mid-sentence she exclaims : " There 's a penny ! "
Barely discernible between the feet of a man sitting at a bench is a single copper coin .
Only £ 116.99 to go .
After waiting patiently for the man to leave , Ms Kelly cashes in , getting a few funny looks from those nearby .
" A lot of people would not consider a penny worth bending down for , but I would n't pass up any coins .
" There 's a bit of shame attached to it .
In a way it 's almost like begging or scavenging around the street , not considered the thing to do .
But it 's changing .
People are quite proud of getting a bargain nowadays . "
£ 1 A DAY BARGAIN BUYS three bars of soap 18 p litre of shampoo 27 p loaf of bread 5 p box of mushrooms 10 p
The £ 117 she amassed in Bristol came about quite by accident , she says , because her £ 1 a day regime meant she was no longer looking in shop windows .
She gave her pavement pennies ( and one £ 20 note ) to charity , because she thought it cheating to supplement her strict budget .
She put herself through this 12 - month ordeal to save up enough to get her brother a decent wedding present , which with her part - time salary of £ 10,000 , she thought would otherwise not be possible .
Paying her £ 3,000 annual rent up front , she kept to her £ 365 budget for the year and was able to spend £ 1,300 on lifetime memberships of the National Trust for her brother and his wife , plus contribute to the cost of his wedding .
So how did she do it ?
" Collecting all the bargains at the end of the day I would come out of the supermarket with an armful of shopping that only cost 50 p - people looked me up and down as if I was a tramp .
TOP THREE TIPS
Do n't stay in .
Having fun does n't cost a lot Do n't be embarrassed to ask about prices or pick up bargains
Share more with others , like garden tools or chores " But that did n't bother me .
I did become quite shameless , walking into hairdressers asking if new stylists wanted hair to cut . "
Free buffets were another source of sustenance and she scoured notice boards , local newspapers and the internet for events , launches and gallery openings that could provide nibbles and sometimes even a glass of wine .
" My social life improved .
I was out almost every night .
My friends thought I would be sitting by the TV or in a library and it would be boring . "
She also walked or cycled 10 miles a day , bought clothes at jumble sales and managed without a mobile phone .
' Share more ' A pound a day is too strict a regime to be sustainable , she says - and impossible with dependents - but the experience has taught her a change in philosophy .
Months after the end of her mission , she still shops for bargains , no longer frequents coffee shops and has a smaller shoe collection .
And longer term , she believes people could spend less by sharing more of what they have , whether it's a garden mower with neighbours or babysitting duties with other parents .
Pavement pennies wo n't buy much , but they might make you value money differently .
Kath Kelly is author of How I Lived a Year On Just a Pound a Day Below is a selection of your comments .
Vending machines in railway stations .
Get down and have a look under there .
ALWAYS a few quid there .
Gregg , Egham I used to moan about how expensive meat has become .
Now I just turn up as the market is closing .
You can buy trays of the stuff for a tenner and you get to pick which tray you want so you do n't even end up with the leftovers nobody wants !
D , Leeds , UK I work at a supermarket , and the amount of people who leave money in trolleys , or on the floor is staggering .
In one day I found excess of £ 20 in notes and coins , just lying on the ground .
Tim
Whenever we take the dog for a walk we find money , whether it 's 1p or £ 1 we always pick it up and take it home and put it in a jar .
This year we managed to save in excess of £ 30 which went towards the fuel for our trip to Somerset .
We do find that there 's less money when the children are off school , there must be a lot of holes in their school trousers !!!
E , Coventry , England
My husband never lets a penny lie in the street .
He says it 's bad luck to let money go to waste and good luck if you find a penny .
You will always have money if you pick pennies up off the street .
We have a glass jar full of pennies that he 's found lying on the ground while we 've been walking .
Once day we may cash them in , who knows .
With the credit crunch , we may have to use the penny machine at ASDA .
Sunny , Kendal , Cumbria , UK A branch of one of the big supermarkets opened up next door but one to us a few weeks ago .
I often pop in after 9 pm and pick up reduced items ( sandwiches for work the next day , bread , pork pies , etc ) .
And I see plenty of people doing exactly the same thing .
We have to make our money go much further at the moment , so there 's no shame in it .
Apart from the kids clothes and shoes I do n't think I 've paid full price for anything for ages .
Martin , Leeds
Well done to Kath Kelly , but is n't the description of this as " living on a pound a day " a little disingenuous ?
According to the article , this figure does n't include her accommodation costs ( over eight pounds per day ) - and do these by any chance include the cost of energy and other utilities ?
The message seems to be that if you exclude your main expenses from the calculation you can live on an income that even Nick Clegg might find plausible ...
Dave Pritchard , Glasgow , Scotland
In the main shopping street in Lancaster the pavements have coins set into them as a design feature - the number of times I thought I 'd found a £ 1 coin only to be disappointed !
It 's quite funny to watch others do the same !
Rachel , Lancaster , England I had a similar experience when supporting a partner who needed expensive medical treatment , medications and the like .
For two years I 'd pay the monthly rent and bills ; then buy food for the month - all Sainsbury basics - for around £ 25 .
Our one meal a day diet was monotonous , but it kept us going .
I became a bin raider at the back of supermarkets , grabbing packaged food just past its sell by date ( but not meat or dairy products ) .
I gave up the car and walked to and from work .
Clothes , we realised how many we already had but seldom wore .
We read many books from our library ; it gave me a second education .
We gave up all luxuries .
It taught me that what was important was having a roof , bed and meal each day , together with having a purpose to life ; we were doing this for a good reason .
I 'm glad to say the treatment worked and she 's now right as rain .
I still walk to work , eat one main meal a day and feel fitter and leaner than before .
I also learnt to appreciate things for what they are , not the price tag or label .
Jay , UK I purchased a handbag from a car boot sale .
When I got home , I opened the small internal pocket and found a £ 20 note .
The bag only cost me 20 p !
Helen , Leicester I admire her tenacity , but if just a few people start copying her then it really wo n't be worth looking , will it ?
There 's just not enough lost money to go round .
I can see it now , a pair of pavement penny prowlers seeing a solitary coin , and fighting over who saw it first .
The only person who will make any money out of this is the author herself and the publisher .
Deano , Gt. Yarmouth , UK
While working early shifts in Newcastle - upon - Tyne , I used to be walking to work through the city at around 5 am and always kept my eyes peeled for stray coins , especially on Saturday & Sunday mornings when the chances were higher of finding a decent sum because people while drunk had dropped handfuls of change just a few hours earlier .
A couple of times I picked up in excess of £ 2 a day , although mostly it was more like 10 p , 20 p , 50 p .
I only started keeping an eye out for change because it had happened several times that I 'd randomly found quite a bit of change but still , it 's nowt to be ashamed of .
Amanda , Nottingham
Wow , what self - control !
Kath 's story is refreshing in today 's throwaway , consumerist society , but I doubt with two young kids I could manage quite as well .
Still , there are lessons to be learned - I will be keeping my beady eye on the pavement from now on !

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Searching the Internet may help middle - aged and older adults keep their memories sharp , U.S. researchers said on Tuesday .
Two functional MRI brain scans show how searching the Internet dramatically engages brain neural networks ( in red ) .
The image on the left displays brain activity while reading a book ; the image on the right displays activity while engaging in an Internet search .
REUTERS / UCLA / Handout
Researchers at the University of California Los Angeles studied people doing Web searches while their brain activity was recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging scans .
“ What we saw was people who had Internet experience used more of their brain during the search , ” Dr. Gary Small , a UCLA expert on aging , said in a telephone interview .
“ This suggests that just searching on the Internet may train the brain -- that it may keep it active and healthy , ” said Small , whose research appears in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry .
Many studies have found that challenging mental activities such as puzzles can help preserve brain function , but few have looked at what role the Internet might play .
“ This is the first time anyone has simulated an Internet search task while scanning the brain , ” Small said .
His team studied 24 normal volunteers between the ages of 55 and 76 .
Half were experienced at searching the Internet and the other half had no Web experience .
Otherwise , the groups were similar in age , gender and education .
Both groups were asked to do Internet searches and book reading tasks while their brain activity was monitored .
“ We found that in reading the book task , the visual cortex -- the part of the brain that controls reading and language -- was activated , ” Small said .
“ In doing the Internet search task , there was much greater activity , but only in the Internet - savvy group . ”
He said it appears that people who are familiar with the Internet can engage in a much deeper level of brain activity .
“ There is something about Internet searching where we can gauge it to a level that we find challenging , ” Small said .
In the aging brain , atrophy and reduced cell activity can take a toll on cognitive function .
Activities that keep the brain engaged can preserve brain health and thinking ability .
Small thinks learning to do Internet searches may be one of those activities .
“ It tells us we probably can teach an old brain new Internet tricks , ” he said .
Backlash Against Mormons Over Prop 8 Looms Large Posted by Pile ( 17830 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Activists ]
After spending more than $ 20 Million to lobby for the passage of Proposition 8 in California , which retroactively banned gay marriage and nullified 20,000 existing marriages , the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints , also known as " The Mormons " is catching quite a lot of backlash , from campaigns to revoke the church 's tax - exempt status to calls to boycott the entire state of Utah !
People are being urged to file a complaint with the IRS to investigate the tax - exempt status of the Mormon church - complete sets of documents detailing the planned attempts of the church to engage in active political lobbying and more , which many say is in violation of law .
There 's also a list of Mormon - owned companies that people are boycotting .
Others are resigning from the church if they 're Mormon , or calling for an outright ban of Utah , the stronghold of the Mormons and home of the popular Sundance Film Festival .
Utah 's growing tourism industry and the star - studded Sundance Film Festival are being targeted for a boycott by bloggers , gay rights activists and others seeking to punish the Mormon church for its aggressive promotion of California 's ban on gay marriage .
It could be a heavy price to pay .
Tourism brings in $ 6 billion a year to Utah , with world - class skiing , a spectacular red rock country and the film festival founded by Robert Redford , among other popular tourist draws .
" At a fundamental level , the Utah Mormons crossed the line on this one , " said gay rights activist John Aravosis , an influential blogger in Washington , D.C .
" They just took marriage away from 20,000 couples and made their children bastards , " he said .
" You do n't do that and get away with it . "
Salt Lake City is the world headquarters for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , which counts about 62 percent of Utah residents as members .
The church encouraged its members to work to pass California 's Proposition 8 by volunteering their time and money for the campaign .
Thousands of Mormons worked as grassroots volunteers and gave tens of millions of dollars to the campaign .
The ballot measure passed Tuesday .
It amends the California Constitution to define marriage as a heterosexual act , overriding a state Supreme Court ruling that briefly gave same - sex couples the right to wed .
The backlash against the church — and by extension Utah — has been immediate .
Protests erupted outside Mormon temples , Facebook groups formed telling people to boycott Utah , and Web sites such as mormonsstoleourrights.com began popping up , calling for an end to the church 's tax - exempt status .
Church spokeswoman Kim Farah said in a statement about the temple protests Friday that it is " disturbing " that the church is being singled out for exercising its right to speak up in a free election .
" While those who disagree with our position on Proposition 8 have the right to make their feelings known , it is wrong to target the Church and its sacred places of worship for being part of the democratic process , " Farah said .
The church had said in a statement after Tuesday 's vote that " no one on any side of the question should be vilified , intimidated , harassed or subject to erroneous information . "
Aravosis is the editor of the popular americablog.com , which has about 900,000 unique monthly visitors .
He is calling for skiers to choose any state but Utah and for Hollywood actors and directors to pull out of the Sundance Film Festival .
Other bloggers and readers have responded to his call .
" There 's a movement afoot and large donors are involved who are very interested in organizing a campaign , because I do not believe in frivolous boycotts , " said Aravosis , who has helped organize boycotts against " Dr. Laura " Schlessinger 's television show , Microsoft and Ford over gay rights issues .
" The main focus is going to be going after the Utah brand , " he said .
" At this point , honestly , we 're going to destroy the Utah brand .

Too little too late !
The great organizing needed to be done more before November 4th .
Obviously the churches did a better job than all of you did .

Now this is just f*cked .
I do n't see the big deal with marriage .
I mean , who the f*ck wants to get married ?
You get stuck with the same bitch / asshole for the ' rest of your life ' and when she goes down hill the bitch gets your money .
I think marriage is a pretty miserable lifestyle and if gays want to do it I do n't see what the big deal is .
I 'm just dumbfounded because the Bible also states that people who get a divorce go to hell , and what is the divorce rate ?
Seriously , these people need to read the entire f*cking Bible instead of being so selective and insensitive to minority / at risk populations .
If god existed I bet you 90 % of the assholes that consider themselves godly would be sent to hell for being cruel ... but then again I guess that 's what the Bible is all about .
That 's pretty disgusting .
There 's nothing wrong with being gay .
Love is love and I do n't see why people have to devote so much hatred to that .
WTF is the big deal ?
This should n't even be a f*cking issue .
It 's not like a gay guy is going to come up and try to have sex with a straight man , it 's not like being gay makes you a sex driven homo and you go f*ck a bunch of straight guys in the ass .
What you do in the bedroom , who cares ?
Some people like shitting on eachother and eating it for f*ck sakes , I do n't see any ' anti- scat ' parades and laws .
Seriously , WTF is the big deal ?

Thanks for adding me to your list of businesses that have supported Prop 8 in California .
I welcome the new business .
BTW I am not Mormon sour grapes
Posted by marza esparza on 2010-08-02 03:55:27
It 's obvious that your disagreement is n't against the Mormons -- It 's against our Heavenly Father who knew you before you were born and without His mercy you could n't draw your next breath .
And one thing is for sure --- you can't boycott HIM !
He is your best friend -- get to KNOW HIM --- He loves you !

ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) --
Key evangelical leaders rallied to Sarah Palin 's support Monday amid news that her 17 - year - old daughter , Bristol , was having a child .
Sarah Palin confirmed Monday that her 17 - year - old daughter is pregnant .
" Before , they were excited about her , with the Down syndrome baby , " conservative , anti-tax activist Grover Norquist said .
" But now with this , they are over the moon .
It reinforces the fact that this family lives its pro-life values . "
Palin and John McCain oppose abortion and have supported promoting abstinence in schools , which would seem to make Bristol Palin 's pregnancy an inconveniently timed development .
But she is keeping the child , a fact that could make the Alaska governor -- whose candidacy has been enthusiastically embraced by evangelicals who regard her as one of their own -- even more popular among that key GOP voting bloc .
Watch more on Palin 's announcement »
" Fortunately , Bristol is following her mother and father 's example of choosing life in the midst of a difficult situation , " Family Research Council president Tony Perkins said .
" We are committed to praying for Bristol and her husband - to - be and the entire Palin family as they walk through a very private matter in the eyes of the public . "
Evangelical leader Richard Land also backed Palin completely .
" This is the pro-life choice .
The fact that people will criticize her for this shows the astounding extent to which the secular critics of the pro-life movement just do n't get it , " Land said in a statement .
" Those who criticize the Palin family do n't understand that we do n't see babies as a punishment but as a blessing .
Barack Obama said that if one of his daughters made a mistake and got pregnant out of wedlock , he would n't want her to be punished with a child .
Pro-lifers do n't see a child as punishment . "
The immediate support of these major figures , who offered universal praise for the Palins ' actions after learning their daughter was pregnant , provides the filter through which conservative Christian voters will process the development .
iReport.com :
Were you married at a young age ?
Most important for Palin , an elder statesman of the movement , Focus on the Family founder James Dobson , released a statement lauding the Palins for acting in keeping with the group 's policies and practices :
" We have always encouraged the parents to love and support their children and always advised the girls to see their pregnancies through , even though there will of course be challenges along the way .
That is what the Palins are doing , and they should be commended once again for not just talking about their pro-life and pro-family values , but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances .
" Being a Christian does not mean you 're perfect .
Nor does it mean your children are perfect .
But it does mean there is forgiveness and restoration when we confess our imperfections to the Lord .
I 've been the beneficiary of that forgiveness and restoration in my own life countless times , as I 'm sure the Palins have , " Dobson said .
Some evangelicals gathered in Minneapolis - St. Paul , Minnesota , for the Republican convention speculated that the news would pose more of a problem for Democrats than for the GOP ticket .
Speculation by some on blogs that Palin 's son Trig was actually Bristol 's child had led to outrage among conservatives .
Any comment by Democrats that is viewed as remotely critical could make both Sarah and Bristol Palin appear to be sympathetic victims of a political vendetta .
By Monday afternoon , evangelical leaders were circling the wagons .
" The media are already trying to spin this as evidence Gov. Palin is a ' hypocrite , ' but all it really means is that she and her family are human , " Dobson said .
" They are in my prayers and those of millions of Americans . "

Help me , and fellow readers of the PlayStation Blog , by sharing your favorite links of the week in the comments below .
The PS Blog weekly reading list ( Week of 10 /13 )
Peteris Krumins has been posting his notes on MITâ€™s Introduction to Algorithms .
The notes are valuable for anyone interested in working their way through the CLRS text and MIT Open Courseware videos .
I just finished watching the last lecture of MITâ€™s " Introduction to Algorithms " course .
Having a great passion for all aspects of computing , I decided to share everything I learned ...
Although not directly tied to programming languages , every PL has to eventually be able to express algorithms .
Aside from Knuth , CLRS is probably the closest approximation to a comprehensive approach to algortihms .
The text itself is language agnostic - the authors use their own brand of pseudo - code to describe the algorithms .
This has the advantage of allowing the reader to focus on the algorithms at a higher level , rather than get bogged down in the specifics of any PL .
The downside , at least in my estimation , is that the authors do n't make it particularly easy to implement the algorithms in any specific PL .
The pseudo code conflates common data structures ( such as arrays ) with properties / attributes that can be tagged with those structures .
And some of the algorithms refer to variables that are outside of the scope of the function .
Also , like Knuth , most of the algorithms are steeped in state , making it hard to implement them with functional programming approaches .
That said , the video lectures and the accompanying notes above are good resources for any that want to self - study CLRS .
Here are the notes thus far :
Proceeding with my project to learn how to develop a Django web application over Pinax , I build two simple forms : one for submitting a new item , and another to show an item .
As one reader commented , up to this point I ’m not really using any Pinax feature other than the website structure itself , like authentication , templates and menus .
I ’m starting with a basic Django application .
I hope to add soon features like notification , messaging , tagging , gravatar .
So , in this sprint I started by defining two URLs :
/ pastebin / to submit a new item
to submit a new item / pastebin / < uuid >/ to view a submitted item
This is what my apps / oxybeles / urls .py file looks like :
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * from oxybeles.models import PastedItem info_dict = { ' queryset ' : PastedItem.objects.all ( ) , ' slug_field ' : ' uuid ' , } urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , url ( r'^$ ' , ' oxybeles.views.new ' , name= ' oxybeles_new ' ) , url ( r '^ ( ?
P< slug >[ -0 - 9a - f ] {36 } ) /$ ' , ' django.views.generic.list_detail.object_detail ' , info_dict , ' oxybeles_detail ' ) , )
I also updated apps / oxybeles / models .py so it knows how to build a URL for a pasted item :
def get_absolute_url ( self ) : return ( ' oxybeles_detail ' , ( ) , { ' slug ' : self.uuid } ) get_absolute_url = models.permalink(get_absolute_url )
I wrote a simple form class in apps / oxybeles / forms.py :
from django import forms from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from oxybeles.models import PastedItem class PastedItemForm( forms.ModelForm ) : class Meta( ) : model = PastedItem fields = ( ' text ' , ) def __init__ ( self , user = None , * args , ** kwargs ) : self.user = user super ( PastedItemForm , self ) .__init__(*args , ** kwargs )
And finally I wrote in apps / oxybeles / views .py the view function that is in charge of the form for submitting new items :
from django.
shortcuts import render_to_response , get_object_or_404 from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect , get_host from django.
template import RequestContext from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse from django.utils.translation import ugettext , ugettext_lazy as _ from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required from oxybeles.models import PastedItem from oxybeles.forms import PastedItemForm def new ( request , form_class=PastedItemForm , template_name= " oxybeles/new.html " ) : " " " Form for pasting new items . " " " form = form_class ( ) if request .
method == ' POST ' : if request .
POST [ " action " ] == " paste " : form = form_class ( request.user , request .
POST ) if form.is_valid( ) : item = form.save(commit=False ) item.user = request.user item.save( ) request.user.message_set.create ( message=ugettext
( " The new pasted item was saved . " ) )
# some problem with ugettext_lazy here return HttpResponseRedirect ( reverse ('oxybeles_detail ' , args=( item.uuid , ) ) ) return render_to_response ( template_name , { " form " : form , } , context_instance=RequestContext ( request ) ) new = login_required ( new )
Finally , I wrote the two templates .
templates/oxybeles/new.html :
{ % extends " site_base.html " %} { % load i18n %} { % block head_title % }{ % trans " Paste Bin " % }{ % endblock %} { % block body %} < div id =" basic - form " > < fieldset > < legend > { % trans " New Item " %}</legend > < form id=" pastebin_new_form " method = " POST " action= " " > < div>{{ form.non_field_errors }}</div> < div>{{ form.text.errors }}</div> < div>{{ form.text }}</div> < div >< input type =" hidden " name = " action " value= " paste " /> < input type =" submit " value= " paste " class= " button " /></div> </ form > </ fieldset > </div > { % endblock %}
templates/oxybeles/pasteditem_detail.html :
{ % extends " site_base.html " %} { % load i18n %} { % block head_title % }{ % trans " Paste Bin " % }{ % endblock %} { % block body %} < h1 > Pasted Item </ h1 > < pre > < p >{{ object.text }}</p> </ pre> { % endblock %}
And this is the final result :
http://127.0.0.1:8000/pastebin/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/pastebin/47d33482-a936-453a-8d4a-88aada4ebc44/
So , the basic app is in place .
The source is in GitHub .
In the next article I plan to implement a command to send a pasted item to a user , using Pinax ’s features .

Protests continue to mushroom across California in the wake of last week ’s passage of Proposition 8 , which eliminated the right to marry for gay and lesbian couples .
In Los Angeles :
Police estimated that 12,500 boisterous marchers converged about 6 p.m. at Sunset and Santa Monica boulevards in Silver Lake near the site of the former Black Cat bar , which the city recently designated a historic - cultural monument for its ’ 60s role as home of the local gay rights movement .
Police guided the demonstrators through the streets for more than three hours without major confrontations .
No arrests were reported .
… Steering the crowds , several hundred officers were on scene , riding horses , motorcycles and bicycles .
Others on foot were sprinkled through the crowd .
Mario Mariscal , 20 , and his mother , Delia Perez , a 45 - year - old Guatemalan immigrant , stood on the Sunset Boulevard sidewalk .
Mariscal came out to his mother as gay when he was 16 .
She held a sign saying , “ Give my son his rights . ”
In San Diego :
An estimated 8,000 to 10,000 people marched from Hillcrest to North Park behind a giant rainbow flag in protest of Proposition 8 .
The measure , approved Tuesday by 52 percent of voters , overturns the state Supreme Court ruling in May that legalized gay marriage .
“ I do n’t want anyone to take away my right to marry , ” said Ken Hagen , a University City newlywed who marched down University Avenue alongside his partner , John Young .
Chants for equality were sometimes drowned out by drivers honking their horns in support of the passing crowd .
Signs waved and bobbed in the air with slogans such as “ We Shall Overcome ” and “ Not Gay , Love You Anyway . ”
In San Francisco :
Thousands of demonstrators marched down Market Street in San Francisco on Friday night to protest the passage earlier this week of Proposition 8 , which effectively bans same - sex marriage in California .
The march began around 5:30 p.m. , as the group worked its way west toward its final destination of Dolores Park .
A large group remained around Ninth and Market streets , holding signs , chanting and jamming traffic .
About a dozen Muni buses were stuck in the traffic mess .
In Oakland :
Backlash to the passage of an anti-gay - marriage law continued to sweep across California on Sunday , with hundreds of protesters rallying outside the Mormon Temple on Lincoln Avenue in the Oakland Hills .
Same - sex marriage supporters carried signs , blew whistles , and passing cars honked in support outside the largest temple in the Bay Area .
The Mormon church was among the top contributors to the effort to pass Proposition 8 .
… The California Highway Patrol was forced to shut down the nearby Joaquin Miller and Lincoln on and off - ramps to the freeway due to the Oakland protest .
A CHP dispatcher said the highway ramps were closed to protect pedestrians from traffic .
In Orange County :
About 300 people gathered in front of Saddleback Church protesting the recently - passed gay marriage ban this morning .
Holding signs reading “ Shame on Rick Warren ” and “ Preach Love not Discrimination , ” the crowd chanted “ Equal rights now . ”
… In Orange County , hundreds protested without incident in Laguna Beach and Huntington Beach yesterday .
Protests were planned in Lake Forest , Laguna Niguel and Rancho Santa Margarita today .
In Sacramento :
Thousands of Prop 8 opponents demonstrated at the State Capitol Sunday for the latest rally against the measure banning same - sex marriage in California .
By 2:00 p.m. , thousands of people had massed in front of the California statehouse .
The event was the latest demonstration in Sacramento and across the state since the passage of Proposition 8 Tuesday , which amended the state constitution to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman .
In Santa Barbara :
Many people at a rally in Santa Barbara Friday night not only oppose Proposition 8 , they oppose the fact that it was on the ballot to begin with .
“ This should not have been a ballot measure , the basic fundamental human rights should n’t be voted on by the electorate , ” said David Selberg with Pacific Pride Foundation .
In Long Beach :
More than 2,000 demonstrators marched through Long Beach on Friday night , protesting the passage of Proposition 8 , the ban on same - sex marriage in California .
Fifteen people were arrested .
The march started about 7:30 p.m. and within an hour had taken over Broadway , with protesters shouting and holding signs with such messages as “ Did we vote on your marriage ? ”

“ It is through the search for God that the secular sciences take on their importance . ”
His message went counter to a deep vein of anticlericalism in France , which has long drawn sharp distinctions between issues of faith and matters of temporal power .
“ At this moment in history , when cultures continue to cross paths more frequently , I am firmly convinced that a new reflection on the true meaning and importance of secularism is now necessary , ” the pope said at a ceremony earlier Friday with President Nicolas Sarkozy at the Élysée Palace .
He used the word “ laïcité , ” which denotes the separation of church and state .
But the pope proposed a “ distinction between the political realm and that of religion in order to preserve both the religious freedom of citizens and the responsibility of the state toward them . ”
He distinguished the state ’s legislative and social duties from religion ’s role “ for the formation of conscience ” and the “ creation of a basic ethical consensus in society . ”

After his speeches , the pope said a Mass for young people at the Cathedral of Notre - Dame .
The pope ’s four - day stay in France had been planned to commemorate the 150th anniversary of what the Vatican recognizes as the apparitions of the Virgin Mary to a 14 - year - old peasant girl , Bernadette Soubirous , at Lourdes in 1858 .
He broadened his journey at the invitation of Mr. Sarkozy , who spoke during a visit to Rome and the Vatican last year of a “ positive secularism , ” saying religion “ should not be considered a danger but an asset . ”

The crowd in Denver
Another enormous crowd out West today , running up the Capitol steps and covering all of the long Civic Center Park .
A local police official cited by the Obama campaign put the crowd count at more than 100,000 .
Crowd counts do n't decide elections , though it 's worth noting that these are bigger crowds than Kerry was getting this time four years ago .
UPDATE : The Denver Post suggests a smaller number — some 35,000 in the park , and several thousand more in the side streets .
Letterman nails McCain over Gordon Liddy ties : Video Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday October 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Thursday night on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman , the longtime latenight talk show host kneecapped GOP Presidential Candidate John McCain over his relationship to Watergate planner G. Gordon Liddy .
" You will also admit that we cannot really control who we interact with in our lives , a hundred percent , " said Letterman , referencing McCain 's ubiquitous attack against Barack Obama that ties him to a 60's political radical .
" I mean , you have ...
You have ... "
McCain interrupted .
" Depends on how long we interact with them and how we interact with them . "
Letterman tried to cut in several times , but he was cut off by the candidate .
" The point is ...
The point , the point of this whole campaign , the economy , the economy ... " trailed McCain , counting with his left hand , but ceeding to Letterman on his third ' economy . '
" Did you not have a relationship with Gordon Liddy ? " asked the host .
" Um , I 've met him , uh , you know , I mean , um ... " began McCain .
" Did n't you attend a fundraiser at his house ? " asked Letterman .
" That 's , " sputtered McCain , looking trapped .
" That 's , what ... Is ... "
" I object , your honor ! " shouted Paul Shaffer , Letterman 's band leader , only after several seconds of McCain looking like a deer in a car 's headlights .
The host laughed as he stared straight into the CBS cameras , broadcasting live .
Smiling , Letterman concluded : " We 'll be right back . "

McCain apologizes to Letterman : ' I screwed up !'
NEW YORK ( AFP ) - John McCain confronted his chief tormentor on comedy television Thursday , demonstrating he can still take a joke , despite the rigors of the White House race .
McCain 's appearance on the Late Show in New York ended a feud with host David Letterman dating back to the Republican candidate 's failure to appear in the CBS television studio last month .
Asked by Letterman why he had n't come , McCain dead - panned : " Can I give you an answer ?
I screwed up . "
The sight of McCain grovelling before the comedian tickled the audience at the taping of the show , due to be shown later Thursday .
" I have a son in the Marine Corps and I asked him to Fedex his helmet , " McCain quipped as he came on stage .
There was also laughter when McCain , a former Vietnam War POW , complained about Letterman 's grilling .
" I have n't had so much fun since my last interrogation , " he said .
The light - hearted session was in contrast to a tense final debate against Democrat rival Barack Obama late Wednesday , where many analysts said McCain appeared angry and irritated .
On a more serious note , McCain told Letterman that he did not approve of increasingly negative , sometimes violent anti-Obama remarks shouted out by " fringe " elements at his rallies .
" I admire and respect Senator Obama .
He 's inspired America , " McCain said .
However , he defended and repeated a claim by his running mate Sarah Palin , the governor of Alaska , that Obama had " palled around with terrorists . "
" He did , " McCain said .
The allegation refers to a modest professional association in recent times between Obama and Bill Ayers , a professor who was a bomb - throwing extreme leftist in the 1960s , when Obama was still a child .
McCain brushed off Letterman 's question as to why Palin refers to terrorists in the plural , simply laughing : " There 's millions of words said in a campaign . "
The Republican also stood firm on his support for Palin .
Her image as a moose - hunting Alaskan right winger and her evidently limited knowledge of foreign affairs has been mercilessly lampooned by comedians .
But McCain said " she 's a reformer , she 's the most popular governor in the United States . "
He indicated she would make a long awaited appearance on the television show most famous for making fun of her -- Saturday Night Live .
" I think she is " to appear , he said .

LONDON , Oct 6 ( Reuters ) - European shares fell sharply in early trade on Monday , with banks worst hit after further measures to bail out major financial companies over the weekend , and following a decline on Wall Street on Friday .
At 0818 GMT , the FTSEurofirst .
FTEU3 index of leading European shares was down 4.8 percent at 1,037.36 points , with just three gainers among its 312 stocks .
The benchmark is down more than 30 percent so far this year .
Banks took the most points off the index , with BNP Paribas BNPP .
PA down 3.4 percent , Credit Agricole CAGR .
PA falling 6.8 percent , Dexia DEXI .BR slipping 11.2 percent and Societe Generale SOGN .

Commerzbank CBKG.DE tumbled 15.7 percent on big volumes .
HBOS HBOS.L , due to be taken over by Lloyds TSB , was down 14 percent .
Lloyds fell 5.8 percent .
“ Obviously there ’s a negative read from the poor performance on Wall Street on Friday .
There is no doubt the unemployment position there is looking pretty poor .
The economy has lost jobs for the last nine months .
It ’s a miserable state of affairs , ” said Henk Potts , strategist at Barclays stockbrokers .
“ And then you add to that the banking problems we ’ve seen over the weekend . ”
BNP Paribas BNPP .
PA , France 's biggest listed bank , said it was paying 14.5 billion euros ( $ 20.1 billion ) to take control of European financial group Fortis FOR .

Over the weekend , German officials clinched a renewed rescue deal for property lender Hypo Real Estate HRXG.DE and UniCredit CRDI .
MI , Italy 's second - biggest bank , announced plans to raise new capital .
But Hypo Real shares were down 26 percent after slumping as much as 48 percent in early trade .
Germany also offered a blanket bank deposit guarantee and South Korea pledged to use its $ 240 billion in official reserves to help its banks secure enough foreign currency liquidity .
“ European governments are looking to stabilise the financial sector by attempting to rescue some major institutions .
Whilst their actions are understandable , the smell of desperation remains strong , ” said Chris Hossain , senior sales manager at ODL Securities .
A $ 700 billion package to rescue the U.S. financial sector , passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on its second try on Friday and signed by President George W. Bush into law , also failed to cheer investors .
" There 's uncertainty over the price at which assets are going to be bought .
And the reality is that it will take some time to see the benefit , and there 's uncertainty on how quickly the banks will lend to each other , " said Barclays ' Potts .
Across Europe , Germany 's DAX index .
GDAXI fell 4 percent , UK's FTSE 100 index .
FTSE slipped 4.1 percent and France 's CAC 40 .

Oils were another notable casualty , with crude prices CLc1 falling as much as 4 percent to below $ 90 a barrel , on worries of weaker demand .
Total TOTF .
PA , ENI ENI .
MI , BP BP.L , and Royal Dutch Shell RDSa .L all fell between 4.1 and 4.7 percent .
A stronger dollar led lower metals prices , hurting mining shares .
UBS and Merrill Lynch issued downbeat notes on the sector , cutting their forecasts for metals prices , and lowering price targets for shares .
Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. ENRC.L fell 15.3 percent .
Anglo American AAL.L , Antofagasta ANTO.L , BHP Billiton BLT.L , Kazakhmys KAZ.L , Rio Tinto RIO.L , Vedanta Resources VED.L , Xstrata XTA.L all fell more than 8 percent .
Beijing , 3 pm , October 22 , 2008 -- 32 days after the Olympic / Paralympic emergency " clean air " rules came to an end .
Feels like home again !
UPDATE : After a big thunderstorm last night and passage of a cold front , it 's beautiful the following morning .
Picture shortly below .
Here is what a good cold front will do !
Same pattern during the Olympics .
For the first two days of the Games , despite all the cleanup measures , the air was opaque .
Then a powerful cold front brought intense thunderstorms , and behind it clear , cooler dry air .
Problem is , the fast - moving fronts are much rarer in northern China than in the eastern two - thirds of North America , where they 're moving through every few days .
Subject for another time .
For now , the view on October 23 , 2008 , at noon :

One of the stranger aspects of the debate over the bailout was the way both progressives and conservatives latched onto the idea of suspending mark to market accounting .
( The final bailout bill ( pdf ) reiterated that the head of the SEC had the power to do this ( sec. 132 ) , and called for a study of mark to market ( sec. 133 ) , but did not require that it be suspended . )
If you 're not up to speed on accounting regulations , here are the basics :
Mark to market accounting requires that you value ( " mark " ) your assets at their market price .
This is straightforward in the case of something like a share of IBM : lots of people are buying and selling those shares , so figuring out the market price is easy .
It 's harder in the case of assets for which there is no active market .
A familiar example : houses .
Most people hold their homes over the long term , and there are often no exactly identical homes .
So when someone estimates the value of your home , they rely on the sales of houses they think are enough like yours to allow for comparisons .
In normal real estate markets , you can find enough sales that are comparable enough to allow you to come up with a more or less decent valuation .
But when the real estate market tanks , most people do n't want to sell if they can possibly avoid it .
This has two results : first , the number of sales goes down , and so you have fewer even remotely comparable sales to look at in valuing your own house .
Second , the people who do sell tend to be desperate , and will therefore sell their homes for very low prices .
This is n't a problem for many homeowners : so long as I do n't plan to sell my home or to take out another loan on it , its value can go up or down as it pleases without affecting me .
But suppose that my creditors required me to keep tabs on the value of all my assets , and to maintain a given balance between my assets and my debts .
In this case , the fact that my home 's market value went down would cause the ratio between my assets and my debts to go down as well , thereby causing me to have to sell assets in order to maintain it .
To do that , I 'd have to sell assets .
In the worst case , I 'd have to sell -- you guessed it -- my home .
And if enough homeowners found themselves in a similar situation , it could produce a horrible downward spiral in home prices : home prices decline , causing some homeowners to have to sell their houses , causing a further decline in home prices , causing more homes to be dumped on the market : wash , rinse , and repeat .
( Note : the same thing works in reverse , during asset bubbles : people get to book fantastic paper profits , and can use them to offset ever - increasing amounts of debt .
Oddly , we tend not to hear banks complaining about mark to market then . )
The possibility of that kind of vicious spiral is , basically , the problem with mark to market .
It 's a real problem .
But I do n't see why anyone would think that suspending mark to market is a good solution to it .
For one thing , what 's the alternative ?
Well :
" Because securities in the $ 1 trillion CDO market trade infrequently , it is difficult for hedge funds and other investors to mark their values to recent sale prices , called " marking to market . "
Hedge funds instead use mathematical models of their own to estimate and report the value of their CDO holdings to investors -- a practice known as " marking to model . " "
And who , you might ask , comes up with these models ?
The people who own the assets .
Might they have an interest in tweaking the models so that they showed inflated values for those assets ?
Why , yes , they might .
Warren Buffett ( pdf ) :
" Those who trade derivatives are usually paid , in whole or part , on " earnings " calculated by mark - to - market accounting .
But often there is no real market , and " mark - to - model " is utilized .
This substitution can bring on large - scale mischief .
As a general rule , contracts involving multiple reference items and distant settlement dates increase the opportunities for counter - parties to use fanciful assumptions .
The two parties to the contract might well use differing models allowing both to show substantial profits for many years .
In extreme cases , mark - to - model degenerates into what I would call mark - to - myth .
I can assure you that the marking errors in the derivatives business have not been symmetrical .
Almost invariably , they have favored either the trader who was eyeing a multi-million dollar bonus or the CEO who wanted to report impressive " earnings " ( or both ) .
The bonuses were paid , and the CEO profited from his options .
Only much later did shareholders learn that the reported earnings
were a sham . "
As best I can tell , our main alternatives here are : ( a ) require firms to value assets at market value , unless it is literally impossible to do so , or ( b ) allow firms to construct their own models for determining how much their assets are worth .
The second alternative might be OK if there were some widely accepted way of modeling the value of these assets that left no real discretion to the firms that owned them .
But as far as I know , there is n't .
And that means that mark - to - model is , in my judgment , an invitation to wishful thinking and outright fraud .
As I understand it , one of the reasons why we got new rules on mark - to - market accounting was precisely that the models that had been used to value a lot of the newer financial instruments turned out to be completely wrong .
Whatever the problems with marking to market during a panic , the solution cannot be to let firms disregard market data in favor of models they make up themselves .
***
One way to think about this is as follows .
The problem with mark - to - market is , basically , not that assets are valued in a certain way , but that firms are required to do certain things as a result of those valuations .
The argument against mark - to - market is that we think they should not have to do those things .
Suppose , for the sake of argument , that you agree .
It does n't follow that mark to market should be suspended .
There are two ways to allow firms not to sell their assets in response to low market prices .
One is to stop asking firms to reveal the market value of their assets ; the second is to change the requirement that they sell those assets whenever their asset / debt ratio gets too low .
The second seems obviously preferable : it solves the problem directly , while allowing us to have as much information about the companies we invest in as possible .
But , one might say , in a lot of cases , it 's the lenders who impose that requirement , not the government , and so we can't just change it .
In that case , people who advocate changing mark to market should be straightforward enough to say : we do not trust lenders to react appropriately to information about the value of their borrowers ' assets , and that 's why we 're not going to require companies to reveal that information to them .
Because that 's really what it comes down to .
I see the problems with mark to market .
But why anyone thinks that the best response is to let companies go back to mark to model is a mystery to me .
This is especially true now : one of the ( many ) reasons why we 're in trouble is that no one seems to know how solid companies ' assets are , and which unpleasant surprises might crop up in whose balance sheets .
I can't see why anyone would think that what we really need right now is less transparency .
Journalists covering the Olympics in Beijing ought to consider using virtual private networks and avoiding the use of instant messenger to interview subjects for stories , says Rebecca MacKinnon , CNN 's former Beijing bureau chief and University of Hong Kong new media professor .
" If you are trying to work on sensitive stories that may be beyond topics that perhaps the Chinese government might be happy about you reporting , if you ’re communicating with sources who might be under surveillance , you need to make sure that you ’re using secure e-mail and that you ’re using a secure internet connection , " she says .
Thousands of journalists from around the globe are parachuting into Beijing this August to cover the Olympic Games , which begin on a day the Chinese consider auspicious : 08,08,2008 .
Reuters is reporting that the authorities in Beijing are continuing to renege on their Olympic bid promise to allow wider access to information online and greater press freedom .
MacKinnon made her remarks in a YouTube video made by veteran journalist and former International Herald Tribune correspondent Thomas Crampton .
Among her tips :
Try using Witopia to secure your wireless communications .
Try using
Tor to prevent ithe Chinese government from snooping on your online activities .
Interview people in person .
Be extra vigilant about not misquoting your Chinese sources – it could put them at risk .
Any other recommendations from our readers , or evaluation of MacKinnon 's advice ?

Sarah Palin : A Bridge Too Far
Have we reached the point of mediocrity in this country that Sarah Palin 's debate performance was actually acceptable to her supporters ( fortunately , Independents in early polls do not share that view ) because she did n't fall on her face , as many conservatives feared ?
That 's your standard ?
No wonder there are still some of you who still think George Bush , the very definition of mediocrity , is a good president .
In a word , Palin 's debate performance was awful .
She could n't win a high school student council election with those homespun platitudes , repetitive inane comments about the war , and most strikingly her refusal to answer not a few but EVERY question put to her that demanded a direct answer .
Every economic question received the tired tax - and - spend slogans Republicans have bellowed for years .
Foreign policy : " You were wrong on the surge . " --
That was it .
Not one single idea of her own ( which is understandable , since she has none ) .
What would you do different in bad economic times like this ?
" Cut more taxes in Walissa . "
The great foreign policy team around McCain - Palin includes Rudy Giuliani , who has about as much foreign policy experience as Madonna , and who history will record mishandled 9/11 in tragic ways .
Palin's next foreign policy guru ?
Mitt Romney . --
The same stiff - haired flip - flopper whose entire foreign policy experience was pedaling his bike trying to convert Mormons in France .
Or Henry Kissinger , who ran illegal wars in Laos and Cambodia to get Richard Nixon re-elected and lied when he told Americans before the 1972 election that , " Peace is at hand " in Vietnam .
I suppose if your worldview is seeing Russia from an island in Alaska , and having a border with our threatening neighbor , Canada , you love these guys .
The Economic Crisis :
When asked about the current economic crisis , she says nothing because she knows nothing .
But she sure talked about her family breakfast table a lot .
That 's the table the citizens of Alaska paid per diem for her to sit at for over 300 days as governor .
She says electing her and McCain is electing two mavericks who will cut spending , including earmarks .
Palin has asked for , and gotten , $ 1 million every day in pork for Alaska since she 's been governor .
Palin says she and McCain will appoint the most qualified people to government despite party labels .
Sort of like your second grade friend you put in charge of Alaska 's agriculture because " she loved cows as a little girl , " Sarah ?
A word for Moderator Gwen Ifill : The right intimidated you .
You never forced Palin to answer a question directly and not duck ; you bent over backward to take her sophomoric answers seriously ; and frankly you treated her with girlie gloves .
But that 's not the point .
Even with your softball questions she could n't get past " aw shucks , " " hockey moms " and " Wasilla values " ( which get weirder and weirder ) .
If the stakes were n't so high , this obviously nice and fairly articulate person can probably still govern the state of Alaska , where frankly it does n't much matter .
But vice president of the United States ?
That is a bridge not only too far , but the real bridge to nowhere .

Will Palin Get the Same Scrutiny Hillary Got ?
So now we learn that Sarah Palin did not go to visit troops in Iraq , as the McCain - Palin campaign originally claimed , nor did she visit Ireland , as a spokesman claimed – she went through Ireland only for a refueling stop .
Good reporting by the Boston Globe got to the truth of the matter .
The McCain - Palin campaign was forced to concede the facts , but only after being pressed .
There ’s a pattern here , two patterns actually .
The first is that the McCain campaign is willing to peddle all sorts of untrue and half - true claims .
The second is that the McCain campaign is clearly so uneasy about Palin ’s patent lack of engagement with foreign policy that it has felt the need to greatly exaggerate what small bits of engagement she has had .
( When ABC News ' Charlie Gibson asked her how Alaska 's proximity to Russia gave her insight into that country , Palin replied : “ They 're our next door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska , from an island in Alaska . ”
That ’s reassuring , is n’t it ?
The Gibson interview also revealed the thinness Palin 's knowledge of domestic policy , particularly on the budget . )
There is also a question here for the media .
When Hillary Clinton claimed last March that she had to evade sniper fire during a landing in Bosnia in 1996 , the media came down on her hard .
It was a huge story .
But at least Clinton actually visited Bosnia .
Will the media focus the same attention on the false and exaggerated claims about Palin ?
Journalists gave Al Gore endless grief about supposed exaggerations and even suggested he said things ( about inventing the Internet ) that he actually did n't say .
Are n't Palin 's claims about opposing earmarks , when she actually tried to get them , and about saying " no thanks " to the bridge to nowhere , when she initially supported it , part of a larger narrative of deception ?
The media made a big deal about whether John Kerry , when he served in Vietnam , did or did n't cross the border with Cambodia .
Why does n't Palin 's relationship to the Kuwait - Iraq border deserve at least as much attention ?
Since we 're talking about travel here , let 's stay focused on the Clinton comparison :
Is there one standard for Hillary Clinton -- a tough one -- and another , permissive standard for Sarah Palin ?
I ’ll be curious about this and so , I suspect , will Hillary Clinton ’s supporters .
A Note on Gibson :
In an earlier post , I suggested that Gibson should stay away from questions about Palin ’s family life and focus on policy and her public life .
I salute him for doing exactly that .
And to conservatives who are going after Gibson , I ’d point out that ( 1. ) he did not press her at all hard either on Troopergate or on the controversy over her relationship with the Wasilla public library when she was mayor ; ( 2. ) he was still far tougher on Barack Obama in last April ’s debate than he was on Palin ; and ( 3. ) he treated Palin as a serious person who presumably had something to say beyond index card briefings about policy .
That ’s the opposite of sexism .
( Click here for ABC ’s lengthy excerpts from the interview to judge for yourself . )
I continue to believe that Palin ’s lack of engagement with most national and virtually all international issues until the moment of her selection will eventually become a bigger issue .
So will McCain ’s extremely limited personal knowledge of Palin before he picked her .
McCain : Palin ‘ Most Qualified ’ VP Nominee in Recent Memory
Created : October 22 , 2008 11:49 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Sen .
John McCain gave a remarkable interview with radio personality Don Imus this morning , and the principle topic of discussion was Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
McCain dismissed the notion , which Imus said he shared , that Palin performed poorly during interviews with ABC ’s Charles Gibson and CBS ’ Katie Couric :
She did fine in the interviews with Charlie Gibson and Katie Couric .
If I called you up and asked “ What ’s the Bush Doctrine ? ” I doubt if you would know what it is .
I think you ’d probably have a pretty funny answer .
She did a great job in those interviews .
When Imus responded that he would be able to say what newspapers he reads , which Palin was unable to do when asked by Couric , McCain suggested it was a “ gotcha question , ” and Palin gets her news from the Internet .
Do you think she does n’t read newspapers ?
A whole lot of people get their news online now .
They just go online .
That ’s why newspapers are declining in circulation .
It ’s easy to make fun of people and ask them gotcha questions .
That ’s fine .
I understand how the game is played .
But do n’t think that the American people buy that baloney .
Of course , Palin never mentioned getting her information online when Couric asked , or , for that matter , when Fox News ’ Carl Cameron gave her the opportunity to re-do her answer after the vice presidential debate .
Imus clearly struck a nerve when he questioned the campaign ’s reluctance to put Palin through the grinder on Sunday morning talk shows .
McCain laughed through his response that seemed to border on mocking :
Imus :
It used to be said that a candidate had to get through a “ Meet The Press ” session with Tim Russert , and if they did n’t , it was difficult to recover -
McCain : Who said that ?
That ’s hilarious .
That ’s hilarious .
With thousands of people showing up at a town hall meeting , at a rally , I ’ve never had one of them say , “ Why has n’t she gone on ‘ Meet The Press ? ”
Not once .
That ’s very good .
That is very good , Don .
I bet you there ’s some who say she ’s never been to a Georgetown cocktail party .
I ’ll bet they say that too .
Actually , McCain ’s attorney , Robert Bennett — who had earlier investigated McCain ’s involvement in the Keating Five scandal — said it this year , during an interview with The New York Times .
McCain lashed out at the ever - increasing list of Republicans questioning McCain ’s judgment because of his choice of Palin as a running mate .
He rejected concerns that Palin is unprepared for America ’s second - highest office .
My question is , ‘ What ’s their problem ? ’
She is the most popular governor in America …
Because she ’s not known , or she has n’t been to a Georgetown cocktail party , or maybe some in Manhattan — ** I think she ’s the most qualified of any that who has run recently for vice president , to tell you the truth .
**[ Emphasis added . ]
Apparently , McCain has yet to learn the lesson that hyper - inflated praise for Palin only increases the public ’s expectations of her .

Oh dear .
Does Cindy know ?
After only one meeting before naming her his running mate and little to no vetting , McCain has decided that Sarah Palin is his " partner and soulmate " .
Ew , that 's a little creepy .
Can you imagine him saying that about his true partner , Joe Lieberman , if the GOP had n't demanded he not pick Holy Joe as his running mate ?
McCain continues the lies -- he must really count on the low info voter taking everything at face value -- by claiming he 's been following Palin 's career for years and years .
Oh really ?
What 's McCain doing following a ex-beauty queen turned small town Alaskan mayor 's career , because she has hardly had enough time at the Governor 's mansion to be tracked for a year , much less years and years ?
And she stood up against oil interests ?
That 's not what environmentalists are saying .
Being FOR drilling in ANWR is hardly standing up against the oil companies .
My favorite line ?
I do n't particularly enjoy the label " maverick "
Yeah , rrrriiiiiiiggggghhhhhtttttt .
Transcripts below the fold :
WALLACE : Let 's start with your choice of running mate .
Of all the people you could have chosen , all the Republican leaders you 've known for years .
Straight talk , can you honestly say that Sarah Palin is the best person to put a heartbeat away from the presidency ?
McCAIN : Oh yeah .
She 's a ... she's a partner and a soulmate .
[ laughs ]
She 's ... she 's a reformer .
I do n't particularly enjoy the label " maverick , " but when somebody takes on the old bulls in her own party , runs against an incumbent governor of her own party , stands up against the oil and gas interests ... I mean , they really are so vital to the economy of her ... of the state of Alaska .
I mean , it 's remarkable .
It 's a remarkable person and I 've watched her record and I 've watched her for many , many years as she implemented ethics and lobbying reforms .
I mean , she led on it ; she did n't just vote for it .
She led it , I 've seen her ... take on her own party .
Look , one thing I know is when you take on your own party in Washington , you pay a price for it .
You do .
You pay a price for it .
Dozens of newly minted Republican voters say they were duped into joining the party by a GOP contractor with a trail of fraud complaints stretching across the country .
Voters contacted by The Times said they were tricked into switching parties while signing what they believed were petitions for tougher penalties against child molesters .
Some said they were told that they had to become Republicans to sign the petition , contrary to California initiative law .
Others had no idea their registration was being changed .
“ I am not a Republican , ” insisted Karen Ashcraft , 47 , a pet-clinic manager and former Democrat from Ventura who said she was duped by a signature gatherer into joining the GOP .
“ I certainly . . . wo n’t sign anything in front of a grocery store ever again . ”
It is a bait - and - switch scheme familiar to election experts .
The firm hired by the California Republican Party -- a small company called Young Political Majors , or YPM , which operates in several states -- has been accused of using the tactic across the country .

Election officials and lawmakers have launched investigations into the activities of YPM workers in Florida and Massachusetts .
In Arizona , the firm was recently a defendant in a civil rights lawsuit .
Prosecutors in Los Angeles and Ventura counties say they are investigating complaints about the company .
The firm , which a Republican Party spokesman said is paid $ 7 to $ 12 for each registration it secures , has denied any wrongdoing and says it has never been charged with a crime .
The 70,000 voters YPM has registered for the Republican Party this year will help combat public perception that it is struggling amid Democratic gains nationally , give a boost to fundraising efforts and bolster member support for party leaders , political strategists from both parties say .
Those who were formerly Democrats may stop receiving phone calls and literature from that party , perhaps affecting its get - out - the - vote efforts .
They also will be given only a Republican ballot in the next primary election if they do not switch their registration back before then .

Some also report having their registration status changed to absentee without their permission ; if they show up at the polls without a ballot they may be unable to vote .
The Times randomly interviewed 46 of the hundreds of voters whose election records show they were recently re-registered as Republicans by YPM , and 37 of them -- more than 80 % -- said that they were misled into making the change or that it was done without their knowledge .
Lydia Laws , a Palm Springs retiree , said she was angry to find recently that her registration had been switched from Democrat to Republican .
Laws said the YPM staffer who instructed her to identify herself on a petition as a Republican assured her that it was a formality , and that her registration would not be changed .
Later , a card showed up in the mail saying she had joined the GOP .
“ I said , ‘ No , no , no .
That ’s not right , ’ ” Laws said .

It all sounds familiar to Beverly Hill , a Democrat and the former election supervisor in Florida ’s Alachua County .
About 200 voters -- mostly college students -- were unwittingly registered as Republicans there in 2004 by YPM staffers using the same tactic , Hill said .
“ It is just incredible that this can keep happening election after election , ” she said .
YPM and Republican Party officials said they were surprised by the complaints .
The officials said the signature gatherers wear shirts bearing the Republican symbol , an elephant -- a contention disputed by some of the voters interviewed .
Every person registered signs an affidavit confirming they voluntarily joined the GOP , party leaders said .

“ It does the state party no good to register people in a party they do n’t want to be in , ” said Hector Barajas , communications director for the California Republican Party .
The document that voters thought was an initiative petition has no legal implications at all .
YPM founder Mark Jacoby said the petition was clearly labeled as a “ plebiscite , ” which does nothing more than show public support .
He also said that plainclothes investigators for Secretary of State Debra Bowen , a Democrat , have conducted multiple spot checks and told his firm it is doing nothing improper .
“ Every time , they gave us a thumbs - up , ” Jacoby said .
“ People are not being tricked . ”

But Nicole Winger , a spokeswoman for the secretary of state ’s office , said the agency “ does not give an OK or seal of approval to voter registration groups . ”
Two years ago , Orange County Dist .
Atty .
Tony Rackauckas charged 12 workers for a petitioning firm hired by the local Republican Party with fraudulently registering voters as Republican .
Democratic registration drives have also caught the attention of law enforcement officials .
The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , or ACORN , a national nonprofit that recruits mostly Democratic voters , is being investigated by the FBI for filing fake registrations in multiple states during the current presidential campaign .
In April , eight ACORN officials in St. Louis pleaded guilty to federal election fraud for submitting false registration cards in 2006 .
In California , signature - gatherers are prohibited by law from misleading voters about what they are signing .

“ You ca n’t lie to someone to procure their signature , ” said Richard L. Hasen , a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who specializes in election law .
Civil rights activists recently filed a lawsuit in Arizona accusing YPM of deceiving residents to get signatures for a ballot measure that would have prohibited affirmative action by that state .
The lawsuit was dropped after supporters of the measure pulled it from the ballot .
In Massachusetts , former YPM worker Angela McElroy testified at a legislative hearing in 2004 that she had tricked voters into signing a ballot measure to ban gay marriage .
She said she told voters they were signing in favor of a measure to allow alcoholic drinks to be sold in supermarkets .
YPM ’s Jacoby said McElroy was on loan to another signature - gathering company at the time the alleged deception took place .

Jose Aguilera , a 48 - year - old math teacher from Ventura whose registration was recently changed from Democrat to Republican , said he signed the child - molester petition outside an Albertsons supermarket .
He said he was asked to sign a second document but not told that it would change his registration .
“ Somehow the guy pulled out something else and I signed it , ” he said .
Ashcraft , the pet-clinic manager , said she knew that she could still vote in November for whichever presidential candidate she supports -- in her case , Democrat Barack Obama .
“ I just do n’t like being lied to , ” she said .

Janett Lemaire , 54 , said she told a signature - gatherer in the small Riverside County town of Desert Edge , “ I ’ve been a Democrat all my life and I want to stay that way . ”
But the man “ said this has nothing to do with changing how you are registered , ” Lemaire said .
“ Then I get a notice in the mail saying I am a Republican .
. . . I was very angry . ”

STEELVILLE , Mo. — Missouri is on a political knife - edge .
For weeks , Senator Barack Obama has been inching up in the polls here , and some analysts now believe he is slightly ahead .
Mr. Obama ’s campaign had refused to concede this bellwether state despite remaining behind in the polls for months , manning dozens of offices across rural areas and sending some 2,000 volunteers door - to - door seeking support for him .
At this point four years ago , Senator John Kerry , the Democratic presidential nominee , had all but conceded the state , but the Obama campaign ’s effort has been unrelenting .
About 250,000 voters have been added to the Missouri rolls since January , many — perhaps most — in the urban areas of Kansas City and St. Louis , where Mr. Obama is expected to win by overwhelming margins .
“ I ’ve never seen this kind of infrastructure being laid down , registering new voters , ” said Clint Zweifel , a Democratic state representative who is running for state treasurer .
“ It ’s pretty overwhelming , the operation . ”
First it was the Eucharist videos being pulled and now they ’ve removed Pat Condell ‘s latest video about Sharia law in the UK .
Well this is getting ridiculous and I do n’t like it one bit .
If there ’s one thing that online services like this provide is a voice for all the people who ’s opinions would never be presented in the traditional media .
When those online services take our voices away because they just feel like it , I say that it ’s time to move on .
They already have a shaky relationship with Atheists but this should be the last straw for many of us .
Like so many things in life , they need us , we do not need them .
Without people using Youtube , it would n’t be the online power it is today .
I can already foresee that many people will say that Youtube is what everyone is using and thus you do n’t have a choice if you want audience .
Well , like partisan politics , this is only in your head and it hurts you when you do not realise it .
You do have a choice , you just have to use it .
At the moment , many users are protesting the latest ban by reposting the removed video .
This is all well and good but , and I hope to be proved wrong , Google is too big , you made them too big .
They do n’t give a toss .
Especially for a few dozen vocal atheists .
Do you want to protest ?
Take your ball and go home .
Make a public statement and invite your subscribers to join you .
If there ’s anything Youtube is taking note , that is market share .
If they were to lose 50 k users overnight , they might stand up and take notice .
But where should one go ?
Well , there are of course dozens of youtube clones out there ( many of them considerably better than ) but that ’s also a problem by itself , for who ’s to say that tomorrow that service is not going to start banning your videos as well ?
This is why I ’m proposing you use something a bit different .
Namely Vuze
What is Vuze
Once upon a time , there was a BiTtorrent client called Azureus .
It was the best of the bunch .
Eventually they decided that P2P can also serve as a great way to serve content without having the immense costs associated with hosting everything on your own server .
They became Vuze
Now you have a service where the content is not held by them but rather by everyone who is using it .
They only handle the portal / library and that ’s about it .
When you publish something to Vuze , you get to keep it as does anyone else who has seen it .
Yes , Vuze does retain the right to remove content from the portal as well but looking from where they started , I believe they will not be as trigger happy as Youtube , plus if things get out of hand .
Other than that , there are a few other very solid benefits to using Vuze .
You are not limited to posting Videos .
You can post any kind of file you wish .
You can upload at any quality you wish , at any size you wish , at any length you wish .
No need to split in 10 minute segments .
Did I mention that Vuze is a full fledged BitTorrent application ?
That means that you do n’t have to use Vuze only but can use , say , The Pirate Bay as well 😉
Friends and stuff but with quite a lot of extras .
One of these extras is that you can share interesting torrents with your friends over a secure connection .
I.e. torrents that you found in the aforementioned Pirate bay , or even your own homemade torrents for files you have on your disk .
It ’s free software .
This means that it ’s more ethical and it gets very fast improvements .
Plus whatever happens , it will never go away .
So there you have one proposal .
I ’m certain others will have other services that are good as well but I tend to always side with the ones who have Free Software roots .
Better for everyone that way .
Youtube has dropped the ball on Atheist heads one too many times now and unless people take a definite action , they ’ll just keep doing it , similar to politicians who get elected no matter what .
And that ’s my two cents on this .
UPDATE : It seems youtube has reinstated the Video .
Apparently it was organised muslim activists who flagged the video for removal .
If that is indeed the case , then Youtube needs to , at the least , give a warning to the ones that flagged it and , my personal suggestion would be to dissalow flagging from those people in the future .
They ’ve already proved that they abuse the system for their own agendas .

NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) --
A series of blasts ripped nearly simultaneously Thursday through crowded areas of a remote state in India , killing 62 people and wounding 300 , an official in Assam state told CNN .
A man tries to extinguish a fire after one of the blasts in northeastern India on Thursday .

Assam Home Commissioner Rajiv Kumar Bora said other small blasts occurred in the northeastern state in addition to the nine bombs ; authorities believe those may be from kitchen gas cylinders , he said .
Following the explosions , black smoke poured into the air .
On the ground , charred and burned vehicles , their windows punched out and their metal frames mangled , remained on the streets .
Police officers combed areas afterward for unexploded bombs , authorities said .
Watch more about the blasts »
No one claimed responsibility for the attacks , some of which police said occurred in the state capital , Guwahati , in Kamrup district .
Other bombs exploded in the Kokrajhar , Barpeta and Bongaigaon districts , police said .
Bora named the United Liberation Front of Asom -- a separatist group that has waged a 20 - year rebellion demanding more autonomy from the central government -- as a suspect in the attacks .
ULFA denies wrongdoing , he said .

" Although ULFA has denied involvement , it is one of the suspects , " he said .
Earlier , Assam 's superintendent of police said both local insurgents and separatist organizations were being investigated .
India 's president , Pratibha Devisingh Patil , condemned the attack in a written statement .
" There is no place for violence in our society , " the statement said .
The prime minister , Manmohan Singh , also condemned the blasts .
" Such barbaric acts targeting innocent men , women and children only highlight the desperation and cowardice of those responsible , " he said in a written statement .
" I am confident that the people of India will rise unitedly against these attempts to disturb peace and harmony and to destroy our social fabric .
We will take all possible steps to maintain peace and bring the perpetrators of such acts to justice . "
Three other blasts in Assam this year were blamed on the ULFA .

The group is also blamed for the deaths of 42 migrant workers in a series of small arms attacks in January 2007 and for bombing an Indian paramilitary forces bus in 2004 .
There also have been clashes between local tribal people , known as the Bodo , and immigrants from Bangladesh , with which Assam shares a porous border .
Fighting between the two groups killed at least 47 this month .

Green admitted 27 counts of sexual abuse A priest who sexually abused boys at a Catholic school over a 20 year period has been jailed for six years .
William Green , 67 , of Cale Lane , Aspull , Wigan , admitted 27 counts of sexual abuse on children in August .
He abused pupils aged 11 to 15 at St Bede 's Boys ' School in Manchester between 1975 and 1987 where he worked as a religious education teacher .
He also assaulted an eight - year - old boy at St Margaret Mary 's Junior School , Moston , where he also worked , in 1968 .
He was jailed at Manchester Crown Court on Wednesday .
Police were first contacted in late 2007 by a victim who had been abused by Green during the 1970s .
The effects of your abuse on their lives was to last for many years
Judge Goldstone QC
Further inquiries revealed other victims and Green was charged in April 2007 .
The court was told how Green abused " lonely " and vulnerable boys hundreds of times .
Alaric Bassano , prosecuting , said Green presented himself as a friendly father figure who won his victims ' trust by offering them privileges and treats of tea , sweets , cigarettes and television in his room .
Passing sentence , Judge Goldstone QC said Green had systematically sexually abused the boys as both a priest and teacher .
Victims ' courage
He said : " These boys were vulnerable and they were groomed by you for the purposes of your own sexual gratification .
" You abused them in the school and on church - related activities .
" As far as the lives of these boys , and later men , were concerned the effects of your abuse on their lives was to last for many years and in some cases it remains . "
The police investigation was carried out with the support and co-operation of the Salford Diocese Child Protection Commission , St Bedes College and Manchester City Council .
Supt Nadeem Butt , from Greater Manchester Police , said : " Thanks to the courage of the victims who were prepared to come forward after years of living with the knowledge they had been abused , we have been able to bring Green to justice .
" This investigation has never been about the institutions where Green worked , and I would like to praise St Bedes , the church and Manchester City Council for their openness and the way they have helped us throughout our inquiries .
" No one can be held responsible for the actions of Green but Green himself , and the support we were given has been greatly appreciated . "

What are these ?
All right Mr. and Mrs. Murka .
Let 's start with the National School Lunch Program .
Talk about spreading the wealth around !
Do kids pay income tax ?
Screw the bastards !
SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM : GONE !
( um , yeah , okay ... )
Next let 's cut the G.I. Bill .
Just a bunch of grizzled veterans trying to get into your daughter 's culottes .
On your dime and mine .
GI BILL : POOF !
( oh gee that does n't seem ... )
It 's time we stopped coddling old people , so let 's drain Medicare while we 're at it .
Smart people got great jobs , invested properly , and inherited a mountain of wealth from their parents .
So it 's not true that old people can't afford their own health care .
For those people that did n't rise to the executive level of a multinational energy conglomerate , well , you had your chance .
You only go around once in life !
MEDICARE : DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YA !
( gee I dunno that seems ... )
And that goes double for poor people .
You want Medicaid ?
SCHIP ?
Get a job .
A government job .
MEDICAID : SO LONG , DEADBEAT !
( well okay if you say so but ...)
Oh , wait , health care for government employees is socia ... oops !
Okay , we 'll give you government mopes a $ 3,000 raise and call it square .
Can we tax that $ 3,000 ?
We can ?
Great , we 'll need it in Iran ! ( oops ! !! )
GOV'T HEALTH CARE : CIAO BABY !
( yabbut what about my ..? )
How about the Forest Service , the brainchild of that uber socialist on Mt. Rushmore with the funny glasses .
No self - respectin ' free market system should let all those 700 million square miles of timber and free range just sit there doing nothing !
Heck , let 's just auction it off , let Exxon and Weyerhauser and McDonalds divvy it up and charge people for camping permits .
There wo n't be any kind of hunter - fisherman backlash or anything will there ?
Montana and Idaho will still stay red , right ?
Bah !
Who cares ?
U.S. FOREST SERVICE : SORRY TEDDY !!!
( but really all the best hunting is ...)
Come to think of it , what about the Park Service ( damn that land - grabbing Roosevelt !!! ) ?
So much lost opportunity for profit !
Most REAL
Americans would love to have a Big Mac or a Whopper or a Denny 's Grand Slam to enhance their visit to Yosemite Valley , but the SOCIALISTS wo n't let them !
NATIONAL PARK SERVICE : SOLD !
( is that really neccess ...? )
Now finally a real biggie : The Armed Forces .
Did you realize those slackers get paid even when they 're NOT FIGHTING ?
It 's true !
Folks , you may not realize it but you are " spreading the wealth " so that high school dropouts can hop from country to country on a babe - magnet aircraft carrier !
Which is why we propose transferring 300,000 military units to Blackwater Inc. by the end of 2009 .
ARMED FORCES : SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE GREAT STORIES !
( my stars that really seems kinda ... )
Hmm ... what else ?
Amtrack ?
This is nothing but welfare for Amish people who want to see the west coast .
What better way to keep the trains running on time than ... getting rid of the trains !?
AMTRAK : BUH - BYE !
( b - b - but the trains are so ...)
It still still seems like we 're forgetting something ... OH GOOD CHRIST ALMIGHTY HOW CAN WE FORGET SOCIAL SECURITY !!!
SOCIAL SECURITY : KAPOW !
KABLOOOOOOOEY !!!!
( HEY WTF !?)
Hey whatsa matter folks ?
Too much too soon ?
Okay , we shoulda warned you about social security .
And anyway we 're not really going to get rid of this stuff .
What , you think we 're crazy ?
They 'd run us out of office faster than Sarah can level a wolf pack !
But look , you gotta promise you wo n't tell your neighbors about this .
I mean what 's a little scare tactic between friends , right ?
If you were to go around telling good Americans that socialism is all around them it would take all the fun out of it !
And then we could n't frighten the piss outta people by yelling SOCIALISM HUSSEIN SOCIALISM SOCIALISM OBAMA SOCIALISM !!!
Anyway , thanks for stopping by the office .
Here 's a McCain / Palin button .
Now go get me a latte .
Radon is radioactive gas occur naturally from the process of breaking down particular elements such as thorium , uranium , and radium from water , soil , or rocks .
The radioactive gas is then released into the air .
It can dilute easily when it is in the open air .
However , it will build up and get accumulated once it is trapped inside a building or closed establishment .
Radon gas has characteristics that make it hard to recognize .
It is colorless , tasteless , and odorless .
Thus , it can seep through the building without your notice .
Radon exposure is dangerous because it is the second leading cause of lung cancer .
When you spend most of your time at home with poor air flow or circulation , the risk of radon exposure is higher .
You have high risk of developing lung cancer just like a smoker .
If you are already a smoker and live inside a building with high level of radon exposure , the risk doubles up .
Lung cancer is serious illness and deathly .
Therefore , you should be more aware of radon gas exposure rather than consequences of playing judi dadu online at http://178.128.214.248 from now on .
How to know if you are exposed to high level of radon gas ?
Any building is at risk of radon exposure .
However , there are particular buildings with higher risk at getting radon exposure .
For example , buildings with so many cracks and hole but so little airflow .
Buildings that have many openings from pipes or wires without proper sealing are also at higher risk of radon exposure .
Enclosed area in your home is mostly where radon is trapped and accumulated .
The basement is often found to have highest level or radon since it is the closest to the ground .
It is hard to tell radon exposure or poisoning because radon is different from other gases for example carbon monoxide .
You may only aware of the radon after so many years when your health is decreased .
Lung cancer is great indication of radon exposure especially if you are non-smoker .
As for the symptoms of the lung cancer itself , it usually starts with constant cough , wheezing , and shortness of breath .
If you start coughing up blood , losing weight drastically , or experience pain chest , you should seek help from physician .
Basically , there are no tests that can tell you how much amount of radon gas you have been breathing in .
There are no treatments to flush out the radon from your body either .
If you suspect you have been exposed to radon , call your doctor to consult .
Most doctor may suggest you to have a test to check if you are developing lung cancer .
To really tell if you are exposed to radon is to perform radon test .
You can conduct short - term test by purchasing passive testing device .
Or , you can also choose to hire professional and let them perform long - term radon test which often takes longer .
The test may take more than 90 days to complete .
If the radon level in your home is higher than 4 pCi/L , you need to take further action to reduce it .

( PHILADELPHIA ) – Lance Becker , MD , Professor of Emergency Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , has been named Director of Penn ’s new Center for Resuscitation Science .
The Center will focus on cellular research to aid in developing new and improved techniques to treat cardiac arrest .
The Center will consist of three full - time labs and a clinical and administration branch .
“ I believe this Center has the potential to save lives and to revolutionize emergency patient care , ” said Becker , who was recruited from the University of Chicago Hospital to lead the Center .
“ My goal is to make resuscitation medicine a specialty like trauma or critical care . ”
Dr. Becker ’s previous contributions to cardiac care include the development of the automatic external defibrillator ( AED ) .
The AED is a device that delivers a shock to restart the heart of a person in cardiac arrest that can be used by non-medically trained personnel .
Initially , Dr. Becker ’s new research will focus on extending the five - minute window associated with successful cardiac arrest resuscitation .
“ If I can get a cardiac arrest patient in front of me within five minutes , I have a good chance of saving them , ” said Becker .
“ But the chances of that are slim due to the average response time of Emergency Medical Services , which tend to take between 10 - 20 minutes to get you to a hospital .
The thrust of my work is to take that five minutes and stretch it into 15 minutes . ”
Dr. Becker ’s previous research has indicated the possibility of extending the window .
When a person has a heart attack , their cells are deprived of oxygen .
So Dr. Becker began studying oxygen deprivation in cells .
“ What we found when we studied oxygen deprivation in cells astounded us , ” explained Becker .
“ When cells are deprived of oxygen for an hour there is only 4 % cell death .
After four hours , cell death is only around 16 % .
Both of these numbers are low .
The amazing thing was once we re-introduced oxygen to the cells they died off rapidly to almost 60 % cell death .
This re-oxygenation injury we termed reperfusion injury .
We concluded that the re-introduction of oxygen must be handled carefully for the majority of cells to survive .
Our studies will be concentrating on ways to prepare cells deprived of oxygen for the re-introduction of oxygen . ”
Dr. Becker ’s group will also study the benefits of cooling cardiac arrest patients .
Previous studies have indicated that cooling a patient immediately after arrest noticeably improves cell death rates and resuscitation success .
Recently , the American Heart Association recommended that every cardiac arrest patient who qualifies should be cooled .
“ We have developed a whole program on why cooling saves cells , ” said Becker .
“ Immediate cooling cardiac arrest victims increased their survival by 16 % .
That ’s a very significant improvement which could mean thousands of lives saved each year as we get faster and better at cooling patients .
Unfortunately , we do n’t know exactly how cooling saves cells , so we will definitely be doing cellular experiments on the mechanisms of how cooling works .
The one thing we do know from our lab , the best results require rapid cooling , yet we do n’t have a good way to rapidly cool patients . ”
To develop more rapid cooling methods the Center for Resuscitation Science will continue to develop a novel cold slurry - a slushy mixture of salt and ice crystals - that can be injected intravenously for rapid internal cooling .
“ Our current methods of cooling are far too slow , ” said Becker .
“ Injecting bio -compatible cold slurry is the best way to rapidly drop internal temperature . ”
Eventually , the goal is to create a slurry - delivery device that both medically and non-medically trained people could use on cardiac arrest patients to keep them cool during transport to a hospital .
“ I do n’t think the full benefits of cooling on humans have been discovered yet , ” continued Becker .
“ I ’m looking forward to working with the team to find the best ways to rapidly cool patients . ”
While Dr. Becker may be an expert in finding cardiac care solutions , he will also be working on ways to extend brain function during periods of resuscitation .
“ Many of the things we see in the heart , are also true in the brain and the focus of our new Center is to save both the heart and the brain .
Therapies for the heart may be adapted to work on the brain .
I am excited because Penn offers the ability for me to work side - by - side with Penn neuroscientists to develop advanced therapies to work for both organs . ”
In recognition of his many scientific contributions and international leadership , Dr. Becker was also recently elected as a member of the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) , one of the nations ’ highest honors in biomedicine .

Colin Powell endorses Obama
Growing ruling class consensus behind Democratic candidate
By Barry Grey
20 October 2008
Retired Gen. Colin Powell 's endorsement of Barack Obama on Sunday was the most politically significant of a series of recent statements by influential voices in the American ruling elite calling for the Democratic presidential candidate 's election on November 4 .
Speaking on the NBC News program " Meet the Press , " Powell , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and secretary of state during the first term of George W. Bush , said he would vote for Obama because the Illinois senator was better able than his Republican opponent , Senator John McCain , to " fix our economic problems " and restore " a sense of purpose , a sense of confidence in the American people and , in the international community , in America . "
Powell 's support for Obama over the candidate of his own party followed a series of endorsements by prominent newspapers , including the Washington Post , the Los Angeles Times , the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune .
The Tribune 's endorsement was particularly significant .
It marked the first time in its 161 - year history that the conservative Republican newspaper endorsed a Democrat for president .
These endorsements coincided with the Obama campaign 's announcement on Friday that it had raised the staggering sum of $ 150 million in September , shattering the previous record it set when it collected $ 66 million in August .
This brings Obama 's total in campaign funds to more than $ 600 million , far surpassing the amounts raised by Bush in 2000 and 2004 .
The flood of corporate money to Obama , substantially larger than the sums raised by McCain , is another unmistakable indication of his support among the most influential sections of the American ruling class .
The endorsement of Obama by Powell , a key architect of the Iraq war , and by newspapers that have unswervingly supported the US occupation of the country , underscores the duplicity of the Obama campaign .
These advocates of US imperialism and militarism have no problem endorsing a candidate who won his party 's nomination largely by appealing to popular antiwar sentiment and attacking his major rival , Senator Hillary Clinton , for voting to authorize the Iraq war in October of 2002 .
Since securing the Democratic nomination in June , Obama has concentrated his efforts on reassuring the ruling elite that , his antiwar rhetoric and campaign slogan of " change " notwithstanding , an Obama presidency will be a reliable defender of their class interests .
This has entailed a swing to the right on both foreign and domestic policy , including assurances that he will retain a substantial US military force in Iraq after a drawdown of " combat " forces , and will be prepared to extend his timeline for withdrawing combat troops if requested by military commanders .
At the same time , Obama has made a buildup of US forces in Afghanistan and the extension of military attacks into Pakistan a centerpiece of his campaign .
Under conditions of a financial crisis of historic proportions which has further undermined US influence and prestige internationally and intensified popular discontent within the US , Obama 's solicitousness for the concerns of the financial - corporate elite has paid off .
A common theme of Powell 's interview and the editorial statements endorsing Obama is the belief that Obama , in large part by virtue of his race and relative youthfulness , will improve the image of the United States around the world and as well as among the American people , while he can be relied on to pursue a conservative domestic agenda and continue the basic thrust of imperialist policy internationally .
The endorsements stressed the need , after the disastrous Bush years , for a president who could more intelligently and competently defend the basic interests of American imperialism .
In his interview , Powell gave a sober assessment of the crisis facing the United States .
Like many of Obama 's establishment endorsers , he indicated that the eruption of the financial crisis over the past two months was a critical factor in swinging his support behind the Democrat .
Powell echoed a widespread consensus within the ruling elite that Obama , by unambiguously supporting the government bailout of the banks , had acquitted himself more favorably than his opponent .
" I have especially watched over the last six or seven weeks as both of them have really taken a final exam with respect to this economic crisis , " he said .
The Chicago Tribune wrote in dire terms of the crisis facing American capitalism , speaking of " the greatest threat to the world economic system in 80 years " and the need for a president who could " lead us through a perilous time " and navigate " the grave domestic and foreign crises we face . "
Declaring that its " editorial page has been a proponent of conservative principles , " the newspaper said it could " provide some assurance " that Obama , who made his start in Chicago Democratic politics , would pursue a conservative course .
It wrote : " We have known Obama since he entered politics a dozen years ago .
We have watched him , worked with him , argued with him as he rose from an effective state senator to an inspiring US senator to the Democratic Party 's nominee for president .
" We have tremendous confidence in his intellectual rigor , his moral compass and his ability to make sound , thoughtful , careful decisions ... "
The Tribune said it was confident that Obama would " govern as much more of a pragmatic centrist than many people expect , " and added for good measure that he has been called a " ‘ University of Chicago Democrat ' — a reference to the famed free - market Chicago school of economics , which puts faith in markets . "
It is instructive to compare the measured judgments of these establishment spokesmen , who weigh their decision on the basis of a clear - eyed appreciation of their class interests , and the delusional claims of Obama 's supporters within the liberal intelligentsia and the liberal periphery of the Democratic Party .
The current issue of the New York Review of Books features a series of essays on Obama by a group of contributors under the heading " A Fateful Election . "
With the exception of author Joan Didion , who debunks the notion that the Obama campaign represents a progressive departure from conventional American bourgeois politics and notes the way in which race is employed to obscure " the real issue in American life , which is class , " the contributors portray an Obama victory as a historic milestone and the harbinger of a new age of social progress .
Virtually all of the essays evince an obsession with race .
Journalist Mark Danner declares , " The radicalism of Barack Obama lies not in his policies but in his face . "
He refers to " the unspoken centrality of race , the ancient sinful fulcrum of American politics , " and concludes that the election of Obama would mark " a true revolution . "
Columbia University professor Andrew Delbanco acknowledges Obama to be " a chastened liberal whose domestic policy plans can seem vague , " but nonetheless declares , " The fact is that Obama , by virtue of being black , has already changed our culture , and changed it profoundly ... "
Nobel laureate economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman asserts that Republicans were previously able to win elections " by exploiting white racial resentment , " but concludes that this time it will be different and " the prospects for a new New Deal are looking bright again ... "
Historian Garry Wills argues that the ability of the next president to shape the Supreme Court makes the stakes in the election " staggering , " ignoring Obama 's own vote in support of Bush 's illegal domestic spying program and his support for police state measures as the Patriot Act , the Homeland Security Department , the Northern Command , etc .
For the most part , these intellectuals and academics , in their desire to believe that something better is coming , engage in a willing suspension of disbelief .
That having been said , they write not as the tribunes of popular opposition , but rather as representatives of layers of the establishment itself .
In the case of the Nation magazine , one is dealing more with professional dispensers of political illusions in the Democratic Party than with people who are disoriented by wishful thinking .
The editorial in the current issue suggests that the Wall Street bailout signals a shift to the left within the political establishment .
Citing McCain 's proposal for the government to buy up bad mortgages and Obama 's call for a 90 - day moratorium on home foreclosures , the Nation writes that the crisis " has pushed the center firmly in a progressive direction . "
William Greider , in a piece on the bailout , writes : " Fortunately , Bush and Paulson are lame ducks .
They will be replaced soon ( we fervently hope ) by Barack Obama , who is addressing the side of the crisis that Republicans always ignore — what 's happening to the people .
Obama has revised and expanded his agenda , and he does not intend to wait until January . "
He then cites the token measures advanced by Obama , in the face of a social catastrophe that is engulfing the working class , and concludes breathlessly , " Economic turmoil has instilled a dynamic process in politics , driving everyone , including voters , to a new ground .
We are likely to see even larger changes in the coming months .
The treasury secretary seems out of breath .
Obama appears to be getting his second wind . "
The Nation specializes in peddling the notion that objective events and the pressure of popular opinion will push an Obama White House to the left .
This is despite the indisputable fact that since securing the nomination , Obama has responded not to the antiwar and increasingly anti-corporate sentiment within the population , but rather to the demands of his corporate sponsors and donors .
Why this will suddenly shift after the election , the Nation does not explain .
In the increasingly likely event that Obama wins the election , it will not take long to discover what Colin Powell and the major organs of the bourgeois press already know — that beyond certain cosmetic changes , the reactionary thrust of the Bush administration will , in all essentials , continue .
How will the self - deluded intellectuals of the New York Review of Books respond to a much wider war in Afghanistan , or its extension into Pakistan , or Iran , or even Russia ?
As for the Nation , there is no reason to believe that such developments will alter its determination to serve as the " left " flank of the political establishment by opposing the development of an independent political and socialist movement of the working class .

In an interview that aired on CNN Tuesday night , Republican candidate for vice - president Sarah Palin seemed to stumble trying to recall the name of the Alaska Oil & Gas Conservation Commission – a commission she chaired for two years , which according to John McCain , makes her one of the foremost energy experts in the nation .
Asked by CNN ’s Drew Griffin what her role would be as vice - president , Palin said she would focus on government reform and energy independence .
“ That ’s been my forte as the governor of an energy producing state and as a former chair of the… of the energy regulator … entity up there in Alaska . ”
Watch it :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/SgJpvR_ImEk&hl=en&fs=1]
To be honest , I ’m pretty sure that Gov. Palin knows the name of the Alaska Oil & Gas Conservation Commission .
What I think hope , is that she did n’t say the actual name of the Commission because she is fully cognizant of how loaded those words are : or that someone told her .
Speaking on CNN , she had to temper the ‘ drill , baby , drill ’
Republican rhetoric something softer and more ‘ all of the above ’- sounding .

I ’ve finished renaming pyinstall to its new name : pip .
The name pip is a acronym and declaration : pip installs packages .
I ’ve also added a small feature intended for Google App Engine users , allowing you to zip and unzip packages in an environment .
For instance :
$ pip zip -- list In ./lib/ python2.5/site- packages :
No zipped packages .
Unzipped packages : paste ( 98 files ) pygments ( 64 files ) tempita ( 7 files ) weberror ( 31 files ) webob ( 22 files ) webtest ( 9 files ) nose ( 43 files ) setuptools - 0.6c9-py2.5.egg ( 43 files ) simplejson ( 28 files ) $ pip zip webob Zip webob ( in ./lib/ python2.5/site-packages /webob )
Right now this does n’t work well with egg directories ( i.e. , packages installed with easy_install ) , though that should n’t be too hard to resolve .
pip install itself does not install packages into egg directories ( it does install eggs , which is to say it installs all the egg metadata and works fine with pkg_resources ) .

First , lets discuss the mail .
The first piece I got was from the National Right to Life PAC .
On it , I find a picture of Sarah Palin holding her baby and right next to it : " Barack Obama voted 4 times to provide care and protection for babies ! "
On the reverse side it talks about how " John McCain and Sarah Palin protect the lives of innocent babies . "
The second piece came from the Republican Party of Florida .
On the cover it features a Marine , and the words " Why did Barack Obama vote to cut funding that could save my life ? "
If you flip to the inside you 'll see Florida 's Governor Charlie Crist saying that John McCain and Sarah Palin are " the right choice for Florida . "
The third piece of mail comes from the RNC and it asks Obama to " Tell the Truth " .
It goes on to question his associations and his record on taxes .
The final piece appears to come directly from the McCain / Palin campaign .
It does n't mention Obama at all .
Even before I had gone to check my mail this morning , I had already gotten a robocall from John McCain .
It was the Ayers call .
I listened , and then called the local John McCain " Victory " office .
The woman there said that the campaign is not responsible for those calls .
She also told me that Obama was doing robocalls as well calling John McCain " too old " to be President .
( This is the first I 've heard of this ... not sure if its true or not . )
I told her that the campaign run by McCain and Palin was disgusting to me .
To that she replied , " Why do you hate America ? " and hung up .
Disgusting .
On top of all of this , I get a knock at my door not long ago .
I had expected a friend to stop by so I did n't even check before opening the door .
I was greeted by an elderly couple that I would estimate must be in their 70's .
I saw her t- shirt and immediately said " I 'm for Obama " .
The lady then asked me , " Do you know the real Barack Obama ? "
I took the bait and asked " What do you mean ? "
She proceeded to tell me that not only was he associated with terrorists , but he also was anti-military .
I said " wow I did n't know that " .
She said , " Oh yes you should go to johnmccain.com and find out more . "
I told her that I was still voting for Obama and to that she told me , " John McCain and Sarah Palin are good Christians and that is what we need in the White House . "
I told her that I thought Obama was a good Christian too .
She responded , " No he is Muslim . "
I said " No he is n't . "
She said , " Yes he is .
He was raised by a Muslim family and his mother was anti-American . "
I said I did n't believe her and she told me that Obama was a " socialist " who wanted to take " money from hard working people and give to those on welfare . "
To that I said , " No , that is n't true . "
They left .
Apparently the Republicans are really going to get nasty .
There is this nasty campaign that many of you might not see unless you are in a battleground state .
The information being handed out is not only misleading , but much of it is down right false .
I also cancelled my subscription to the Tampa Tribune after their endorsement of John McCain .
It was n't the fact that they endorsed him that got me , but the way they did it .
They called Obama 's tax plan " a policy that penalizes success " .
They went on to say :
Obama is a lawyer , a professor , a best - selling author and a winning debater .
He is smart and patriotic , but as a leader on the national stage , mostly untested .
His short tenure in the Senate has been unremarkable , other than being consistently partisan .
They also call Obama a " celebrity " and talks about how his supporters are
He is generating unprecedented enthusiasm among the young and the poor
.
I found the endosement very insulting .
This part really got me :
Obama 's vision of hope shines like a rainbow , appealing but just out of reach .
McCain 's call to freedom and responsibility is less exciting , but you know it works .
You can read the full endorsement here .
Anyway , I got rid of my subscription and I told them exactly why I did it too .
This is a rant , but I am sick and tired of the crap the Republicans are pulling .
Unfortunately , I am afraid it could work .
Low information voters might not know that the things they are saying are untrue and could in the end vote for McCain out of ignorance .
I 'm trying to be hopeful .
I go out canvassing in a few hours and hopefully that will lift my spirits .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In the face of an economy in crisis and a deeply unpopular president , some analysts believe the situation is ripe to give Democrats a shot at a 60 - seat filibuster - proof majority in the Senate in November .
Analysts say the November election could give Democrats a filibuster - proof majority .
It 's " the perfect storm , " said Stuart Rothenberg , editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report .
" You 've got Republican voters angry at Republicans , many Americans just petrified about the future ... wanting change .
And right now change appears to be coming in the form of Democrats . "
Not so fast , say Republicans .
And even Democrats admit it 's too early to say whether they can pick up the necessary seats .
According to Rebecca Fisher , a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee , Republicans are confident that they will , at the very least , keep their current seats .
Of the 35 Senate seats on the line this year , 23 are held by Republicans .
Five Republican senators are retiring : Pete Domenici of New Mexico , Wayne Allard of Colorado , John Warner of Virginia , Larry Craig of Idaho and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska .
Democrats control the Senate .
Although it 's split evenly with 49 Democrats and 49 Republicans , two independents -- Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut -- caucus with the Democrats .
Check out the races to watch »
Winning a filibuster - proof majority of 60 Senate seats , commonly called the " magic 60 , " would virtually prevent Republicans from blocking legislation on the Senate floor .
The last time either party had this ability was in the 95th Congress of 1977 - 1979 , when Democrats held 61 seats during President Jimmy Carter 's administration .
Carter faced concerns similar to those today -- economic instability , inflation and a 7.5 percent unemployment rate .
Larry Sabato , director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia , said Democrats have a good shot at reaching a 60 - seat majority in November , a possibility he all but ruled out earlier this year .
" The fundamentals of this election year could not be more Democratic , " Sabato said .
" You 've got a terrible economy , a deeply unpopular president and an unpopular war .
You put those elements together and it's going to produce a Democratic victory .
...
The only question is , what size ? "
Sen . Chuck Schumer of New York , who runs campaign operations for Senate Democrats , said Democrats are " significantly ahead " in five Senate races for seats held by Republicans .
He cited polls that show Democrats leading in :
• Virginia , where former Democratic Gov. Mark Warner is up by double - digit margins in a bid to replace the retiring John Warner ;
• New Mexico , where Democratic Rep. Tom Udall is trying to replace the retiring Domenici ;
• Colorado , where Rep. Mark Udall is trying to take the seat of the retiring Allard ;
• New Hampshire , where former Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen is trying to oust Republican Sen. John Sununu ; and
• Alaska , where Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich is trying to oust Republican Sen . Ted Stevens , who is on trial in Washington on corruption charges .
Schumer said Democrats have a slight advantage in two other races for seats held by the GOP : North Carolina , where Sen. Elizabeth Dole is being challenged by Democratic state Sen. Kay Hagen ; and Oregon , where Sen. Gordon Smith is being challenged by Democrat Jeff Merkley .
Five other races for GOP - held seats -- in Mississippi , Maine , Georgia , Kentucky and Minnesota -- are " neck and neck , " Schumer said .
A recent CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey found that Americans blame Republicans by a 2 to 1 ratio over Democrats for the financial meltdown .
Forty - seven percent of those questioned found Republicans more responsible for the problems facing the financial institutions ; 24 percent said Democrats were more responsible .
Although Democrats say it 's too early to predict whether they will get 60 Senate seats , they acknowledge that the focus on the economy has given them a bounce across the map .
" The economy was already the No. 1 issue in voter 's minds , " said Matthew Miller , communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
" What the crisis did was focus attention like a laser on the fact that Republican economic policies have crippled the economy . "
Fisher , the GOP committee spokeswoman , said " Democrats should have learned from past experiences that it 's dangerous to predict victory this far out . "
" Polls show that most of the competitive Senate races are currently in dead heats .
That 's encouraging news for us going into Election Day since we have much stronger candidates , " she said .
Fisher said the GOP is " very confident that we are going to defend our incumbents and [ have ] a good shot at getting a majority of our open seats . "
Pointing to low congressional approval ratings , Fisher said it 's still uncertain which party will bear the brunt of the economic crisis .
" I think that people are generally unhappy with what 's going on in Congress and [ it 's ] not specifically aimed at one party , " Fisher said .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday found 76 percent of the registered voters questioned disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job ; only 23 percent said they approve .
Both the Democratic and Republican parties get fairly low approval ratings for their job performance in Congress .
Only 34 percent of those surveyed said they approve of the way Democratic leaders are handling their jobs , while 64 percent disapprove ; only 27 percent approve of Republican leaders ' job handling while 71 percent disapprove .
Rothenberg says Republicans will likely bear the brunt of the economic crisis despite the bleak assessment of Congress as a whole .
" Maybe Americans will say it is n't Republicans ' fault , " Rothenberg said .
" It 's possible that Republican prospects could improve over the next month , but if they do n't , this year will be as bad as 2006 for the Republicans and worse in Senate races . "
In 2006 , Republicans lost six seats in the Senate and 30 seats in the House , shifting the majority to the Democratic Party .
Rothenberg and Sabato agree that Virginia , New Mexico , Colorado and New Hampshire are all but a lock for Democrats .
" Minnesota , Mississippi , and Kentucky are the three states most likely to determine whether Democrats get to 60 , " Rothenberg said , adding the unexpectedly tight race in North Carolina could turn out detrimental for Republicans as well .
Both parties are feeling charged from the highly contested race for the White House between Sen. Barack Obama and McCain .
But Democrats and Republicans agree the outcome of the Senate elections could come down to how many people come out to vote .

All About U.S. Senate • Democratic Party • Republican Party
The mainstream media are , of course , full of campaign " news " , so it 's easy to forget about how all this started ... and that 's a shame , because that 's what this election is all about .
On August 3 , 2000 , Governor George Bush took the podium at the Republican national convention to accept the nomination for President of the United States , and the unending series of lies began .
Like these ( emphasis mine ) :
For me , gaining this office is not the ambition of a lifetime , but it is the opportunity of a lifetime , and I will make the most of it .
I believe great decision are made with care , made with conviction , not made with polls .
I do not need to take your pulse before I know my own mind .
I do not reinvent myself at every turn .
I am not running in borrowed clothes .
When I act , you will know my reasons .
And when I speak , you will know my heart .
I believe in tolerance , not in spite of my faith , but because of it .
I believe in a God who calls us not to judge our neighbors but to love them .
I believe in grace because I 've seen it , and peace because I 've felt it , and forgiveness because I 've needed it .
Reading these words so many years and so many avoidable tragedies later is a lesson in irony that is overwhelming .
Go ahead and read that speech , and see how many lies you can spot ( and you might want a separate list for just the ironies ) .
I suggest using a large pad of paper to keep track .
You might want a calculator , too .
I leave you with this :
So when I put my hand on the Bible , I will swear to not only uphold the laws of our land , I will swear to uphold the honor and dignity of the office to which I have been elected , so help me God .

There are many children 's parties we have to organize , since there are many reasons special in the lives of children .
And now we can not to miss any of these special dates because they are no longer a problem for decoration .
In the market we find many alternatives of decoration , so much so , that lend themselves to carry out themed parties .
What are the benefits of recreating a children 's Party ?
For the party I can choose any reason .
From the favorite superhero of my son , until my daughter 's favorite Princess .
Ultimately the party is thought in children and for the children , they should then be those who choose the theme of your party .
Children shall give priority to their superhero or action dolls and girls will prefer to be princesses or fairies of the film that most like them .
The market is all what is needed to achieve an authentic themed children 's Party , posters , posters , Pinatas , banners , tablecloths , caps , dishes , glasses , even the ponques can be decorated with the same theme .
Invitation cards , also lend themselves to be themed and the theme of the party , can explain making the guests and the host , correspond in their outfits .
The Festival will be great .
It will be full of all the characters involved in the film .

There are too many reasons for celebration in the lives of children .
Official site : General Hospital .
Day of the brujitas , triumphs sports or academics , religious initiations .
Each with a defined style of decoration .
The sporting achievements are they lend themselves to recreate awards shows , games and more to our initiative .
The exalt medals or trophies , allocate a site special in the House for display , is cause for celebration .
Prepare a feast for recreate a children 's Party , you should anticipate at this date , item , must be defined to participate to the guests on .
External details that can affect the event should be analyzed .
Weather , time , the same date and place , are decisive for the success of the party .
We must also have the option of companies re creationist , specialist and expert in the Organization of such events .
The development of these festivals , in the hands of professionals , is to have resources that , as individuals , would be very difficult .
Equipment as lights , sound , animators and up to photography and filming equipment .
They are responsible for all the details , decoration , animation , music and everything it represents the logistics of the event .
A children 's Party , is proud of the parents and a souvenir only for children and details are many , that many times it is better to resort to a large specialized company .

Antidrug officials in the Northwest have discovered that marijuana growers are cultivating and concealing illegal crops on a large scale among grapevines in Washington state .
Since July 8 , law - enforcement agencies in Washington 's Yakima Valley have seized from the region 's vineyards more than 200,000 marijuana plants , with an estimated street value of more than $ 165 million .
The agencies say they expect to find more of the plants in vineyards as the marijuana - growing season nears its conclusion in late September .
The Yakima Valley is about 150 miles southeast of Seattle .
Police say they believe Mexican cartels are tapping into networks of Hispanic immigrant workers who go to the Yakima Valley to pick fruits and vegetables .
In most cases , vineyard owners were n't aware of the illegal farming operations , said Washington state Patrol Sgt. Rick Beghtol , s upervisor for a multiagency antidrug task force .
Many vineyard owners do n't tend their vines , instead contracting with migrant workers and small cultivation and harvesting companies , he said .
This year , law - enforcement agencies have raided 13 vineyard operations and arrested 33 suspects , all of them Hispanic immigrant workers , he said .
Most were caught on the premises , he said .
Sheriff Joe Arpaio traded angry words and accusations with Mesa officials Thursday after 60 deputies and posse members armed with search warrants stormed City Hall and the public library in the middle of the night in a hunt for illegal workers .
" I believe the safety of our citizens was gravely compromised " when Maricopa County sheriff 's deputies in " battle gear " swept into city buildings about 2 a .m. while cleaning crews were at work , Mesa Mayor Scott Smith told reporters .
" I believe we had set the scene where bad things could have happened . "
Arpaio defended his tactics , claiming the raid came only after a former city employee called the sheriff 's illegal - immigration hotline to report that a cleaning company under contract with the city was hiring illegal immigrants .
Arpaio said the informant had tipped off a Mesa police lieutenant and said the lieutenant brushed off the request , saying it was a problem for the cleaning company .
But a city spokeswoman late Thursday said police Lt. Wade Pew and city staff met with the cleaning company , Management Cleaning Controls , on May 21 after he received the information .
A follow - up e-mail sent June 4 by facilities maintenance director Dennis Ray to cleaning company officials reiterated the city 's concerns over " several security issues that have recently been brought to our attention , " and included a section of the city 's contract requiring that contractors ensure all workers are legal .
Predawn raid
Arpaio said the raid was set up after a sheriff 's undercover detective infiltrated the cleaning business , claiming to be an undocumented immigrant , and was schooled by a manager in how to obtain false identification that would get him past federal identification verification software .
About 30 deputies and 30 volunteer posse members in bulletproof vests and carrying semi-automatic weapons prepared for the operation in Pioneer Park across from the Mormon Temple shortly after midnight .
The deputies , carrying 25 arrest warrants , headed for the library and City Hall , an eight - story building that houses several municipal departments as well as the mayor 's and council members ' offices .
Deputies fanned out and arrested three people ; 13 others , including a manager at Management Cleaning Controls , were arrested at residences later that morning , Arpaio said .
Ten were arrested on suspicion of identity theft and six for potentially being in the country illegally .
The 16 arrested included six people who were not named in the warrants .
Arpaio said they are still looking for 15 more company employees .
Smith said that most of the janitorial workers at the public buildings were either U.S. citizens or in the country legally and that they were terrified by the size and firepower of the sheriff 's force .
Deputies returned to Mesa about 8 a.m. seeking records related to contractors at the city 's Municipal Security Badging Office .
Smith said if the Sheriff 's Office wanted information about contractors and employees , it could have submitted a public - records request and easily obtained the information .
Smith said at a news conference that a Mesa officer came across the deputies about 12:30 a.m. as they staged at the park " dressed in battle gear , with canines and semi-automatic weapons . "
When the officer recognized the men as sheriff 's deputies , Smith said , " He was told they were not allowed to tell him what their purpose was .
. . .
He never got any information .
Approximately an hour later , the city was told that they were there for K - 9 training . "
Because of that , Smith said , there was enormous potential for death or injury had Mesa police responded to a 911 call from someone who had seen armed men gathering in the park .
Smith , who appeared distraught as he spoke with reporters , said he also took great offense that City Hall was targeted .
" The citizens of Mesa , Arizona , this is their City Hall .
( It ) was , in my belief , violated by another government agency .
I do n't believe that 's proper . . . and I believe that also crosses the line as to what law enforcement should do , " he said .
Questions denied
Arpaio denied questions about whether the raid was politically motivated or that it was timed to deflect attention from a videotape that surfaced Wednesday depicting the brutal death of an inmate at a county jail , which his office runs .
The inmate 's family has filed intent to sue the county .
Joining Arpaio in an afternoon press conference , Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas said the cleaning company had been under investigation for months .
When asked why Mesa police could not handle the case , Arpaio said , " It 's my jurisdiction , too .
You seem to forget . "
Then he suggested that there was something in the Mesa police " culture " that " they do not want to enforce the immigration laws . "
Smith denied that , saying Mesa police cooperate routinely with other law agencies .
Smith said he's not trying to pick a fight with Arpaio and hopes to meet with the sheriff to talk about how the city and county can cooperate in the future .
History of discord
Thursday 's raid is the latest in several immigration - related incidents this year involving the Sheriff 's Office and the Valley 's second - largest city .
In April , after Arpaio had begun conducting his controversial crime - suppression sweeps in the Valley , Mesa Police Chief George Gasc�n and the head of one of Mesa 's two police unions made a request .
They asked Arpaio for at least two days ' notice before conducting sweeps in the city , citing potential risks to officers and the public .
Arpaio responded by calling Mesa police uncooperative .
In early July , Smith and Gasc�n announced a new immigration - enforcement policy in the city , one in which every person arrested is asked about immigration status .
Arrested people suspected of being illegal immigrants are to be referred to federal authorities .
But Mesa 's policy specifies that police will not arrest everyone they think might be an illegal immigrant .
People pulled over for minor traffic violations , for example , would not be arrested even if they admit they 're here illegally .
Instead , their information would be turned over to federal officials .
Two weeks after that policy was announced , Arpaio was back in Mesa , arresting about 40 people , including 26 suspected of being undocumented immigrants .
A Mesa landscaping company was raided Aug. 27 , and three dozen people suspected of being in the country illegally were taken away .
It was later learned the city contracted with that firm to landscape its parks .
Database performance is one of the major bottlenecks for most web applications .
Most web developers are not database experts ( and I ’m no exception ) , there are however several basic methods to analyze and optimize database performance without resorting to expert consultants ( such as those , whose founders blogs are an invaluable source of MySQL knowledge ) .
The Performance Equation
Database performance is affected by many different variables – the running machine specs , OS , database engine and configuration , table schema and the queries running against it .
Since I ’m dealing mostly ( only ? ) with MySQL , this article covers it mainly ( though it is probably relevant to a large degree for other engines ) .
As for OS and machine specs , I ’ll take them out of the equation as I ’m interested in optimizing relative performance on the same machine .
Basically I ’m interested in optimizing :
The structure of my database tables ( schema )
The structure of my application - level queries ( SELECT , UPDATE , INSERT , DELETE )
Profiling Database Performance
Blindly optimizing queries and database schema is counter - productive .
First we should know what we should be optimizing , and for that we need data .
The act of gathering data for optimization is called profiling or performance analysis .
The first step I take when profiling database performance for a web app is to measure the running time of all the queries running in it .
Absolute run time of a query is not necessarily a good measure of how optimized / performant it is , since some queries are naturally more complex or pull more data –
It will give me a good idea however of where to start improving the response time of the application I ’m optimizing .
My main goal is not specific query performance , but overall system performance .
Measuring the run time of a query can be done with simple timers using microtime ( ) calls ( Check out this post for an abstraction ) , running it in a tool that automatically provides such statistics ( phpMyAdmin for example ) or using an integrated profiler .
I am using the Zend_Db_Profiler , which is convenient for me since I ’m using the Zend Framework and all database access converges to a Zend_Db_Adapter connection .
The profiler basically uses the microtime ( ) approach but integrates it transparently into all of the queries without me having to wrap them one by one .
Usage is pretty simple .
First you need to pass an extra parameter to your Zend_Db_Adapter instance to activate profiling :
$ params = array ( ' host ' => ' localhost ' , ' username ' => ' dbusername ' , ' password ' => ' dbpassword ' , ' dbname ' => ' dbname ' , ' profiler ' => true // turn on profiler , disabled by default ) ; $ db = Zend_Db : : factory ( ' PDO_MYSQL ' , $ params ) ;
The Zend Framework manual shows some advanced usage ( such as profiling directly into firebug , which is very convenient ) , however for our purposes we simply want to dump the queries and their run time .
$ profiler = $ db -> getProfiler ( ) ; $ profile = '' ; foreach ( $ profiler -> getQueryProfiles ( ) as $ query ) { $ profile .= $ query -> getQuery ( ) . "
" . ' Time : ' . $ query -> getElapsedSecs ( ) ; } echo $ profile ;
This snippet goes of course after the view has been rendered and all queries executed .
Using a relevant dataset
It ’s important to know whether the data you are profiling against is relevant for when you believe you will start hitting performance issues .
Granted , you can never really know when will that be , however it is always preferable to work with a dataset that resembles your ( projected ) production environment .
I will walk through a specific use - case I recently went through while preparing for the beta release of my startup , business platform Octabox ( since defunct ) .
Running the profiler on one of the views in the application produced the following output on my development machine :
SELECT `history`.`id` , `history`.`type` , `history`.`action` , `tags`.`color` , `tags`.`id` AS `tag_id` FROM `history` LEFT JOIN `tags` ON tags.id=history.tag_id AND tags.user_id=1 WHERE ( history.user_id=1 ) AND ( history.logged_on >= ' 2008-09-27 00:00:00 ')
ORDER BY `history`.`logged_on` DESC
Time : 0.00269
SELECT `tasks`.`id` , `tasks`.`task`,`lists`.`id` AS `list_id` FROM `tasks` INNER JOIN `lists` ON lists.id=tasks.list_id WHERE ( tasks.done IS NULL ) AND ( tasks.due IS NOT NULL ) AND ( tasks.user_id=1 ) ORDER BY `tasks`.`due` ASC
Time : 0.000592
SELECT COUNT (*) AS `count` FROM `dispatch` WHERE ( dispatch.user_id=1 ) AND ( dispatch.status=0 )
Time : 0.00044
At first sight it would appear that the first query would be our immediate suspect for optimization , though the gains would not be great ( completes in just over 0.002 seconds ) .
Switching to a database I ’ve prepared before hand with plenty of dummy data ( ~ 1.1 Gb , some tables over 5 M rows ) the output looks very different :
SELECT `history`.`id` , `history`.`type` , `history`.`action` , `tags`.`color` , `tags`.`id` AS `tag_id` FROM `history` LEFT JOIN `tags` ON tags.id=history.tag_id AND tags.user_id=1 WHERE ( history.user_id=1 ) AND ( history.logged_on >= ' 2008-09-27 00:00:00 ')
ORDER BY `history`.`logged_on` DESC
Time : 0.000426
SELECT `tasks`.`id` , `tasks`.`task`,`lists`.`id` AS `list_id` FROM `tasks` INNER JOIN `lists` ON lists.id=tasks.list_id WHERE ( tasks.done IS NULL ) AND ( tasks.due IS NOT NULL ) AND ( tasks.user_id=1 ) ORDER BY `tasks`.`due` ASC
Time : 58.16 // Hmmm … problem ?
SELECT COUNT (*) AS `count` FROM `dispatch` WHERE ( dispatch.user_id=1 ) AND ( dispatch.status=0 )
Time : 0.000322
A query that took just over 0.0005 seconds on a small database , took almost a minute to complete on a bigger one .
Surprisingly enough the other queries remained blazingly fast ( even faster than on my development machine with a small database , which is a credit to our server ’s power ) .
Optimizing The Errant Query
So I ’ve found a very problematic query to say the least .
Taking 58.1 seconds to complete is obviously not acceptable for any real time application .
Running EXPLAIN against the query revealed the following execution plan :
id select_type table type possible_keys key key_len ref rows Extra 1 SIMPLE tasks index user_id user_id 9 NULL 1868081 Using where 1 SIMPLE lists eq_ref PRIMARY PRIMARY 4 tasks .
list_id 1
The EXPLAIN results show the most immediate problem with the query – it was performing a join against every row in a 1.8 M row table .
Examining the details of the query plan , it appears both selects are using an index , the first one limited by a WHERE ( on the surface at least – since all rows were scanned ) .
Since despite using an index the entire table was scanned very slowly , I tried to see the query will respond if I removed the index .
Using IGNORE INDEX ( user_id ) , I re-ran the query ( this time in the Mysql command line ) :
304 rows in set ( 1.53 sec )
Wow , that ’s a big difference for not using an index .
Running EXPLAIN on this reveals :
id select_type table type possible_keys key key_len ref rows Extra 1 SIMPLE tasks ALL NULL NULL NULL NULL 1866244 Using where ; Using filesort 1 SIMPLE lists eq_ref PRIMARY PRIMARY 4 tasks .
list_id 1
Despite using filesort to sort the query , it was running almost 30 times faster than before .
By forcing it not to use an index which was not selective enough ( i.e. not at all ) , the query ran a full table scan instead and completed much faster due to a better execution plan .
So we ’ve improved greatly , but still not enough for my needs .
Having one query taking over a second to complete when all the others are completing in sub 0.01 second times means it will be a bottleneck as the database grows ( remember , the same query completed in just over 0.0005 seconds on a much smaller database ) .
Examining the structure of the table in question ( tasks ) revealed another interesting revelation – there is no index on the user_id column .
So what happened ?
it appears there used to be an index on the user_id column , however it was removed just before all the dummy data was inserted into the database .
Running ANALYZE TABLE tasks repaired the key information to the current state ( no index on user_id ) .
I wanted to try the original query , this time with an actual index on the filtering column ( user_id ) .
After adding the index , I re-ran the query :
( 304 total , Query took 0.0021 sec )
Much better !
but I was not done .
Running EXPLAIN yet again reveals the following execution plan :
id select_type table type possible_keys key key_len ref rows Extra 1 SIMPLE tasks ref user_id user_id 4 const 368 Using where ;
Using filesort 1 SIMPLE lists eq_ref PRIMARY PRIMARY 4 tasks .
list_id 1
So indeed , using an actual index was a big help , filtering the set to only 368 rows before processing the rest of the query .
However , you ’d notice it is running a filesort which we ’d like to avoid .
Preferably , I could set up an index combination that both filters and sorts using an index .
Creating an index composed of both the ‘ user_id ’ and ‘ due ’ columns got it right on the head , leading to :
( 304 total , Query took 0.0008 sec )
Not as dramatic as previous improvements , but still three times better than the last iteration .
Final Words
The entire process took several hours of head scratching to arrive at all the results I ’ve shown here .
I managed to take a query that would cripple our server ( 58 seconds for one completion ! ) to an extremely fast one ( 0.0008 seconds against a 1.8 M row table ) , through the use of some basic profiling and examining the execution plan .
Being an edge case ( a non existent index used to filter against a 1.8 M row table … ) , I gained valuable experience on potential pitfalls and on reading between the lines in the execution plan .
Some technical gibberish :
All queries were run with SQL_NO_CACHE to prevent caching from tampering with the results .
I ran each query at least 5 times to make sure I was getting the right readings .
The specs of the server machine that ran the queries are as follows :

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The drumbeat of the polls says Barack Obama will defeat John McCain on Nov. 4 .
Assuming that this outcome comes to pass , I predict that Sarah Palin will begin fielding offers -- on Nov. 5 -- for her next logical career move .
The pride of Alaska is a natural to reinvent herself on cable television .
Yes , Gov. Palin probably would n't rule out CBS CBS , - 4.76 % , NBC or ABC .
But it might require too much explaining for a network news operation to recruit Palin because she might not appeal to a general audience .
Cable affords someone a niche , which would seem to be an easier fit for Palin .
And what if McCain managed to confound the experts and win the presidential election ?
All would not be lost for the enterprising media .
The cable networks could then enlist the services of the NEXT - biggest star of the campaign so far .
Obama ?
No , not even close .
I 'm talking , of course , about Joe the Plumber .
The natural
The news networks are desperately looking for a gimmick that would give one an edge over the others .
Palin would be a natural as an anchor or commentator , and I write that respectfully .
Of course , I 'm projecting that Palin will weigh options other than what appears to be her obvious game plan : remain as governor of Alaska and serve out the remainder of her term .
Then , in two years , she can mount a run of her own for the White House in 2012 .
( But it 's fun to consider her as a TV star ! )
As they say in sports , she has all the tools .
On the stump she has proven to be vivacious , lively and charismatic and , with a large group of Americans , wildly popular .
Plus , she 'll need a friendly outlet to plug her inevitable campaign memoir .
Sure , Palin has done her share of excoriating the " media , " as if we 're all the same and not thousands of individual operations spanning across all news spectrums .
But that 's what happens under the stress of a high - pressure situation .
Let bygones be bygones .
It 's like what happens after two lawyers yell at one another in a courtroom .
As soon as the case is resolved , five will get you 10 that the former combatants will reach an understanding and adjourn to a friendly lunch .
Sarah superstar
Cable TV channels are always trying to find and capitalize on untapped markets .
The Fox News Channel , a division of News Corp. NWS , - 3.57 % , has scored big by presenting programming that resonates with conservative American voters .
( News Corp. also owns MarketWatch , the publisher of this column ) .
Likewise , MSNBC , a unit of General Electric GE , - 1.29 % , has made its mark by skewing its shows to appeal to an anti-Fox audience of liberal political junkies .
It would n't surprise me if Palin ( or her new agent ) got entreaties from every cable channel -- up to and including the Food Network .
It could feature her hand - me - down family recipes for elk , caribou and deer ( and just in time for the holiday season ) .
Here is how I envision the morning - line odds on Palin 's prospects :
6 -5 , NBC : Then , we'd have the dream pairing of Palin and Tina Fey on NBC's GE , - 1.29 % " Saturday Night Live " and " 30 Rock . "
7 - 5 , The Fox News Channel : Palin already has a rapport with Fox .
She has been interviewed by many of its stars along the campaign trail .
She sat down with Sean Hannity ( twice , including a joint interview with McCain ) , Greta Van Susteren and Carl Cameron .
2 -1 , The Lifetime Channel :
Is there a more suitable platform for a loving , respected mother of five children , one of whom , a teenager , is about to have a child of her own ?
3 -1 , The 700 Club :
The flagship news talk show of the Christian Broadcasting Network is a household name throughout the U.S. Palin could find a very sympathetic audience for many of her conservative views right here .
5 - 1 : Versus :
If Palin decided to bolt from the political jungle altogether , she 'd have no shortage of juicy opportunities .
Who better to preside over the Iditarod broadcast , bull riding , and any hunting segments ?
Come on !
The network 's devotion to unusual sports could be a great fit for the former sportscaster .
8 -1 , ESPN2 : The king of X - sports might also appeal to Palin , especially the hunting and fishing broadcasts .
12 -1 , ESPN : Who among us would n't want to glimpse Palin in one of those goofy " SportsCenter " commercials when on - air talent schmooze with sports stars ?
13 -1 , ABC : I 'd love to see ABC DIS , - 0.46 % resurrect a gender twist on " The American Sportsman , " starring The Unsinkable Sarah Palin .
15 - 1 , Discovery : Palin would feel right at home talking about the exotic locales of Alaska and Russia .
20 - 1 VH1 : Palin , a certified baby boomer , could be in her element here , too .
25 - 1 MTV : This network looks even more tired than McCain did at times on the stump .
Like him , it needs a jolt .
50,000 - 1 , MSNBC :
At first blush , it would be a stretch for Palin to fit in with those card - carrying lefties at MSNBC .
But as they say in the ads for the lottery , hey , you never know .
100,000 - 1: Time Warner 's TWX , cable news network CNN has been pretty tough on Palin .
Just the other day , Roland Martin wrote a commentary on its Web site , entitled , " Time for Palin to answer tough questions . "
To the cable channel that emerges as the winner of the Sarah Sweepstakes , I say , Bravo ( yet another cable channel in the running , come to think of it ) .
To the losers , good luck finding Joe the Plumber !
MEDIA WEB QUESTION OF THE DAY : Would you watch Palin if she landed a job on a cable channel ?

Sarah Palin cut Barack Obama some slack last week .
“ I know Obama loves America , ” she said during a brief give - and - take with reporters on her campaign plane Friday .
She continued , “ I ’m sure that is why he ’s running for president .
It ’s because he wants to do what he believes is in the best interest of this great nation .
. . .
I do n’t question at all Barack Obama ’s love for this great country . ”
But another Republican was n’t willing to concede that point .
Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota was parrying questions Friday from Chris Matthews on his MSNBC “ Hardball ” show , which is not for the faint of heart .
Still , she did not necessarily have to keep stepping deeper into the hole he kept digging for her .

Initially , they were discussing Obama , with Matthews quizzing her about the Republican - backed “ robocalls ” -- viewed by many as over the top -- that play the Bill Ayers / terrorist card against the Democrat .
Bachmann said of Obama : “ I ’m very concerned that he may have anti-American views . ”
Then she said : “ I think the people that Barack Obama has been associating with are anti-American , by and large . ”
Matthews wondered if that included Democratic leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
“ I ’m not going to say if they ’re anti-American or pro-American , ” Bachmann said .

Pressed by Matthews about members of Congress in general and whether , in essence , their patriotism should be called into question , Bachmann called on the media to launch a “ penetrating expose and take a look . . . at the views of the people in Congress and find out , are they pro-American or anti-American . ”
She added : “ I think people would love to see an expose like that . ”

Taking stock of debates
Advertisement
The culprit for the chaos in the financial markets has become clear .
Blame it on the just - concluded series of presidential and vice presidential debates .
True , on the day of the first one , Friday , Sept. 26 , stock traders were a friendly audience for a faceoff .
Before John McCain and Barack Obama took the stage that night in Mississippi , the Dow Jones industrial average rose 121 points .
But on its next workday , Sept. 29 , Wall Street was in a foul mood .
The Dow plunged 777 points .
OK , so maybe the drop had more to do with the surprise failure of the House late that morning to pass the first financial rescue plan .
But how do we explain what has happened since then ?
* Sarah Palin and Joe Biden met Oct. 2 for their sole debate .
The Dow that day : down 348 points .
Advertisement
* McCain and Obama conducted their town hall debate Oct. 7 . The Dow : down 508 .
* Wednesday ’s concluding faceoff took place a day the Dow plummeted 733 points .
Political junkies and undecided voters may yearn for more debates .
But for the markets , that might be a death blow .

A treat from Cindy McCain
Cindy McCain famously avoids contact with the reporters and photographers who cover her husband ’s quest for the White House .
She has never been known to stroll back from the jet ’s first - class compartment to chat with the 60 media members and Secret Service agents in the rear .
Until Friday .
On a morning flight , an aide announced a “ special surprise . ”
Cindy McCain pulled back the Oz - like curtain separating the two sections and emerged with a nervous smile .
Advertisement
Behind her came Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , John McCain ’s longtime friend and frequent traveling companion .
They held out bright orange , plastic pumpkins filled with Halloween candy .
Moving down the aisle , they offered the goodies to startled reporters , some of whom tried not to stare .
“ Take more , ” she urged softly .
How many days are left ?
someone asked .
“ Eighteen , but who ’s counting ? ” she said .
Someone asked Graham what he’d be for Halloween .
“ The government guy who comes to bail you out , ” he replied after a moment .
“ Now that ’s scary . ”

What about Cindy McCain ?
“ I ’ll be Lindsey Graham , ” she said quickly .
And then , with a whoosh of the curtain , she was gone .

Times staff writer Bob Drogin contributed to this report .
Brain is certainly the most amazing part of human body .
It becomes more interesting when it does not work the way you expect it should .
Psychology frequently establishes our intuitions about how human mind works , but it reveals a number of surprises as well …
Although some psychology students will have heard one or two of these before , here ’s a list of brain habits you probably did n’t realize you had :
1 ) The maximum capacity of your short - term memory is seven .
Humans have basically three forms of memory : Sensory , Long - term and Short - term .
Long - term memory is just like hard - drive space .
Similarly , Short - term memory functions like a very small RAM .
This Short - term memory is capable to hold only about five to nine ( seven is an average ) items at a time .
Retrieving information longer than this will need you to either pack it together into seven units or store it in Long - term memory .
Have you observed that the most phone numbers have only seven digits ?
2 ) The most visible color is Chartreuse .
Yellowish green , chartreuse , is naturally placed right in the middle of the frequencies of visible light .
Human eyes have receptors for green , blue and red colors .
Being placed in the middle , chartreuse actuates the most of these receptors to fire , making it distinct and easier to spot .
For the same reason , in some metropolises , firetrucks have been modified from red to a yellowish green color to make them more visible and obvious to the eye .
3 ) Subconscious is smarter than you .
Subconscious is smarter than you .
In other words , it is more powerful .
In a recent study , a square was attributed to a location on a computer screen through a complex pattern .
After watching it out , people began to get results better than the chance of recognizing where the square would crop up next .
However , when they were inquired to consciously find out the pattern , even given a few hours , nobody really did it !
4 ) There are two nervous systems .
We have two sets of nervous systems .
One controls excitation , while the other controls inhibition .
If you hold out your hand , you might observe minor tremors .
This is actually stimulated by slight , random differences in the amount each of the two systems are firing .
5 ) Brain is exceptionally bad at probability .
Your high - school math teacher might have told you about this one .
Here what ’s interesting is n’t that your brain is bad at probability .
But how ?
In one study , recipients were asked :
Jessica is 31 years old , single , candid , and very promising .
She graduated in philosophy .
As a student , she was anxious about discrimination issues and social justice , and also took part in anti-nuclear demonstrations .
Assign a rank to the following statements from most probable to least probable : Jessica is a teacher in an elementary school .
Jessica works in a bookstore and takes Yoga classes .
Jessica is active in the feminist movement .
Jessica is a psychiatric social worker .
Jessica is a member of the League of Women Voters .
Jessica is a bank teller .
Jessica is an insurance salesperson .
Jessica is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement .
Nearly 90 % of students responded that # 7 was more probable than # 5 .
This is despite the fact that to be a bank teller and in the feminist movement is entirely contained within the set of # 5 ( just being a bank teller ) .
It is observable that our minds like to think more details make events more probable , not less .
6 ) Memory is n’t great either .
Research has revealed that people are highly probable to misremember past events .
Even worse , it is quite easy to suggest a memory that never happened .
Due to this fact , so - called “ repressed ” memories should be given a lot of consideration .
It is extremely easier to suggest a memory of a situation that never encountered , than it is to recover one that actually did .
7 ) Depth is perceivable with one eye .
It ’s not quite true that depth perception is totally the result of having two eyes .
Binocular vision does help in making a three - dimensional image .
Still , most of your capability to perceive depth comes from inside your brain .
It has been wired to look at angles and proportions to measure distance .
If you needed two eyes to perceive depth , then most optical illusions would n’t work and it would be extremely difficult to gather information from two - dimensional images .
Not to mention a great number of one - eyed pirates walking overboard .
8 ) Long - term memory closes up during sleep .
The components of the brain that carry information to Long - term memory turn off while sleeping .
For the same reason , dreams quickly fade out after you wake up .
Although you may have quite a few dreams in a night , they are n’t being memorialized into Long - term memory .
Normally only the fragments of a dream left in Short - term memory have a possibility to be converted after you wake up .
9 ) The Brain has an amazing instant playback feature .
The last form of memory , i.e .
Sensory memory is actually your brain ’s equivalent to an instant playback feature .
Functioning for both your vision and hearing , your thalamus can resend signals a few seconds after they were originally sent .
Let ’s suppose being at a party and overhearing someone call your name .
Often you can recall what they said even if you were concentrating on another conversation .
This is because your sensory memory re-sends the signals when it feels something important , such as your name .
If you missed this form of memory , activities such as multitasking or taking notes from a speaker would not be practicable for you .
If you ’re supposed to repeat something you just said because the other person was n’t hearing , just wait for a few seconds .
Often they can replay the message in their head and cause to a reaction .

Four Pinocchios for Palin
By Michael Dobbs
On the campaign trail .
" I 'm very , very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing , any hint of any kind of unethical activity there .
Very pleased to be cleared of any of that . "
-- Sarah Palin , phone interview with Alaska reporters , October 11 , 2008 .
Sarah Palin has insisted that a formal investigation into the " Troopergate " controversy in Alaska has exonerated her of " unlawful or unethical " activity .
The Republican vice - presidential pick has told critics to read the report by an investigator appointed by the State Legislative Council to determine whether she had abused her power as Alaska governor to push for the firing of a state trooper formerly married to her sister .
But the report 's finding that Palin breached the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics
Act is very clear .
The Facts
Within weeks of becoming governor of Alaska in November 2006 , Sarah Palin began putting pressure on state officials to fire her former brother - in - law , Mike Wooten , who was embroiled in a bitter child custody dispute with Palin 's sister Molly .
She made her wishes clear in e-mails to her newly installed public safety commissioner , Walter Monegan .
Monegan resisted the pressure from Palin and her husband to fire Trooper Wooten , and was dismissed in July 2008 on the grounds of poor performance and not being " a team player . "
On August 1 , the Republican - dominated Alaska legislature hired an independent investigator , Stephen Branchflower , to look into the matter .
The Branchflower report , published on Friday and available in full here , concluded that Palin had the legal right to fire Monegan .
However , it also concluded that Palin had " abused her power by violating Section 39.52.119 ( a ) of the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act , " which is worded as follows :
The legislature reaffirms that each public officer holds office as a public trust , and any effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action is a violation of that trust .
The Branchflower report concludes that Palin " knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda , to wit : to get Trooper Michael Wooten fired . "
It adds that she and her husband Todd attempted " to get Trooper Wooten fired for personal family related reasons . "
Subordinates were placed in the situation where they had to choose whether to " please a superior or run the risk of facing that superior 's displeasure , " a clear conflict of interest .
According to Branchflower , the Palins declined to cooperate fully with his investigation .
The governor 's lawyer , Thomas Van Flein , has depicted the Branchflower report as a partisan attempt to " smear the governor by innuendo . "
Van Flein argues that Branchflower 's findings are flawed because Palin received " no monetary benefit " from her actions .
The Pinocchio Test
Whether or not the Branchflower report -- which was launched by a bipartisan committee -- was a partisan smear job is debatable .
What is not debatable is that the report clearly states that she violated the State Ethics Act .
Palin has reasonable grounds for arguing that the report cleared her of " legal wrongdoing , " since she did have the authority to fire Monegan .
But it is the reverse of the truth to claim that she was cleared of " any hint of any kind of unethical activity . "

Sony Australia Are Just Giving PS3 Games Away
Last month , we heard about a deal whereby Sony Australia would give away a free copy of LittleBigPlanet with every PS3 sold .
It was n’t a bundle or anything , you ’d pay what you normally pay for a PS3 , and just get LittleBigPlanet for free .
Well , that deal ’s now been expanded , with SCE Australia announcing that customers will , when buying a new PlayStation 3 console , be able to choose one of four games : LittleBigPlanet , SingStar Abba , MotorStorm 2 or Resistance 2 .
That should have just about everyone covered … if you ca n’t find something on that list you like , you should possibly reconsider why it is exactly you ’re buying a PS3 .
Taking a spin through the wikipedia entry for candidates in the 2008 United States presidential election , there are quite a few third party presidential candidates that have n't received the attention of the mainstream media .
Is this thanks to censorship , or common sense ?
Let 's take a look :
Charles Jay , Tea Party Candidate
In this post on his site , Jay inserts himself in the televised presidential debates , which is somewhat like Photoshopping yourself into other people 's family photos .
Notice how Jay always gives himself the last word , too , which is a unique ability that comes in handy when winning fictional debate transcripts .
Also note that nothing says ' commitment to a cause ' like an old version of Wordpress using the default theme .
Gene Amondson , Prohibition Party Candidate
Not only does Amondson 's website have him holding a bottle of wine and scowling ( thus demonstrating his commitment to the time - tested principles of Prohibition ) but he does so while wearing his pastor collar for extra Prohibition Points .
I 'm guessing if you choose to have your wedding in Gene 's secluded woodland chapel you wo n't want to commemorate your wedding with a round of champagne , lest you incur the Wrath of Gene .
Brian Moore , Vermont Liberty Union / Socialist Party
Taking a cue from the forceful use of Gotham in the Obama campaign , Moore makes an immediate impression with a choice of font equally at home on the header of a third - party candidate , or in an ad for a new ' Flintstones ' movie .
And while his running mate Stewart Alexander shares with us a long , involved , Timecube - like biography , Moore offers this succinct - yet - ominious message for Socialist voters : I urge all of our Socialist Party members to get out and vote , early , if possible , to avoid any problems on election day .
I do n't know what problems Socialists would face in the afternoon that they would not also face in the morning , but it 's always good to get an early start on losing an election by a landslide .

China has the world 's fifth largest fleet of wind turbines China 's rapid investment in low carbon technologies has catapulted the nation up the global renewable energy rankings , a report shows .
The Climate Group study said China invested $ 12bn ( £ 6 bn ) in renewables during 2007 , second only to Germany .
However , it was expected to top the table by the end of 2009 , it added .
The findings have been published as China faces criticism over its air quality ahead of the Beijing Olympic Games , which begin on 8 August .
The report , China 's Clean Revolution , brings together the latest data on the country 's burgeoning renewables sector in one publication .
Co-author Changhua
Wu , The Climate Group 's China director , said the rapid rise in investment was , in part , the result of the government realising that the western model of industrialisation was unsustainable .
" China has been experiencing similar problems during its industrial revolution that western nations saw during their period of rapid growth - pollution , environmental damage and resource depletion , " she told BBC News .
" Domestically , we are being constrained in many ways ; we do not have that many natural resources anymore .
" We have to rely on the international markets , so there is a big security concern there . "
Uncertainty over future energy supplies has seen global fuel prices reach record levels , which has resulted in renewable technologies becoming a more attractive option .
The report said China 's $ 12bn investment in renewables during 2007 was only just behind top - of - the - table Germany , which spent $ 14bn .
China will still burn its coal reserve , which is the world 's third largest
In order to meet its target of increasing the percentage of energy from low carbon technologies from 8 % in 2006 to 15 % by 2020 , China is expected to invest an average of $ 33bn annually for the next 12 years .
This was going to result in China becoming the leading investor by the end of 2009 , Ms Wu forecast .
Figures within the report showed that China was already the leading producer in terms of installed renewable generation capacity .
It has the world 's largest hydroelectricity capacity since the controversial Three Gorges project began producing electricity , and the fifth largest fleet of wind turbines on the planet .
Although its installed capacity of photovoltaic ( PV ) panels is still relatively low , it is already a leading manufacturer of solar panels .
Ms
Wu explained that the rapid growth of the sector was being driven by both government and business .
" In order to really drive towards a low carbon economy , policy incentives are crucial ; but it is not always the case , " she said .
" The wind sector 's fast growth was mainly a result of domestic policies , because the government offered incentives to developments so that private and public sector entrepreneurs would jump on it .
" But the solar PV sector benefitted mainly from the international market , such as demand from the US and EU .
" Even today , the policy incentives are still not there , yet it still has grown to the level it is now . "
Lingering legacy
However , despite the advances in low carbon technology , the legacy of rapid economic growth , which was primarily fuelled by burning coal , has been soaring greenhouse gas emissions .
Filthy air conundrum
In the final days before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Beijing , there has been growing international concern over the air quality in the Chinese capital as the world 's top athletes begin to arrive .
Organisers of the Games had promised that the city 's notorious pollution would be cleaned up , so failure to deliver would be seen as an embarrassing environmental shortcoming .
City officials said that they would introduce emergency measures , such as banning the use of private cars and closing some factories , if conditions did not improve .
Although Beijing 's troubles are currently under the media spotlight , air quality is a nationwide problem .
According to figures from the World Bank , 20 of the planet 's 30 most polluted cities are in China .
" In terms of total emissions , China is already the world 's biggest emitter , " Ms Wu said .
" That 's publicly available information , even the government is not denying it anymore .
" But if you look at emissions on a per capita basis , we are not the biggest emitters because we have 1.3bn people . "
The report suggests that if China 's population emitted as much as US citizens , its total emissions would be roughly equivalent to those of the entire planet 's human activity .
" But just looking at numbers does not help tackle global climate change , " Ms Wu added .
" In China , we are concerned about the speed of growth in emissions ; it is really scary . "
The report showed that China was only responsible for about 7 % of greenhouse gases emitted in the period before 2002 , when more than 90 % of emissions from human activity were released .
But since the turn of the century , it added , China 's portion has been growing steadily and now accounts for 24 % of the global total .
The government is looking to stabilise its emissions by 2020 , primarily through greater energy efficiency and the expansion of the nation 's renewable energy infrastructure , including electric cars .
Ms
Wu added that within the international climate negotiations , the Chinese were looking to developed nations to prove that they were serious about tackling climate change , such as delivering the mandatory cuts in emissions outlined in the Kyoto Protocol .
" If they are not able to do it with the technology available to them , then is it reasonable to expect China and India to do it ?
" China does not commit itself to a number and then not deliver , " she said , referring to whether China would sign up to legally binding targets in the ongoing UN climate negotiations about what system should replace the current Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2012 .
" If they commit , then they are very , very serious about ; so they have to figure out what is possible . "

What are these ?
It was about four years back into civilian life that Jason Franco decided he'd had enough of going nowhere .
He 'd gotten out of active duty for the Marines in 1997 and took on jobs as a drill instructor at a juvenile boot camp for three years and security at a nuclear plant for another .
" I just saw that this was n't a career and to get back in the military , " he says .
This time , though , he decided to go the Air Force route .
" In the Marine Corps we have a chow hall and in the Air Force we have a dining facility , " he says .
He opted for the Texas Air National Guard because he could keep his E4 noncom rank and be close to his family .
Franco has a lot of family , he 'll somewhat shamefacedly admit .
He 's been married three times and has a child by each marriage .
He 's 33 years old .
Info Texas Air National Guard
When he signed up with the Guard , he made sure they knew he did n't want one of those " traditional " jobs — the one - weekend - a - month duty .
He liked driving trucks and keeping track of supplies as he'd done in his Marine life , but he needed whatever job would give him a full week of work .
That 's how he became a security guard for the 147th Fighter Wing at Ellington Field , where he guarded planes and base personnel .
In late 2002 he was deployed to Al Jaber Air Base in Kuwait for six months , from November to May 2003 , where he once again spent his days guarding jets and their personnel .
He worked 13 - to 14 - hour days , six days a week .
He did well enough that he got some more medals , and was promoted to staff sergeant in 2004 after he returned .
Everything was rolling along well enough until the late summer of 2005 .
After a visit to the dentist , Franco noticed a swelling in his mouth .
A trip to a doctor got him an operation , a biopsy of his right tonsil and a diagnosis of throat cancer .
" My doctor asked me how long have I been smoking , " he says .
" I said I do n't smoke and never had .
No one in my family smokes .
The only thing I could come up with is all the aircraft exhaust I had to be around while guarding troops and supplies coming into Kuwait for the buildup of the Iraqi Freedom War . "
Franco and his family were covered by TRICARE health insurance , provided for members of the military .
No complaints there .
He had convalescent leave including six weeks of radiation treatment , Monday through Friday for six weeks in October and November of 2005 .
On Thursday , November 23 , 2005 , he went to Colonel James Matlock to have his leave extended with a doctor 's note saying he needed another three months for recovery .
Matlock denied the request and told him to be at work the following Monday .
Another supervisor told Franco to go home on his own leave and then come back with a doctor 's note , which is what he did .
Franco 's records of the months that follow , along with copies of e-mails and forms he either kept or was able to retrieve , show an ongoing battle between his superiors questioning why he can't be returned to full duty , and his doctors , who keep writing notes saying that Franco needs time to recover and can't do the job he used to do .
And in the end , the service agreed , in its own special way .
In February 2007 , a military medical board in San Antonio said that Franco — whose cancer was in remission — was fit for duty .
Because he was a National Guard member , a second determination was made by the office of the air guard 's surgeon general and that office found him " medically disqualified for worldwide duty . "
That meant Franco could n't be sent anywhere , could n't be an everyman .
He was fit , but unfit .
He was out .
He staved off the decision with an appeal to the San Antonio medical board — he was put on medical hold and allowed to work a desk job with four - hour days — but the reprieve lasted only five months .
With three days ' notice , he was told he was on his way out .
On the final day , a Sunday , when he went around trying to collect his paperwork , he was told to come back the next week .
They were only working a half day that day because of an annual celebration that Ellington has for its service members and their dependents .
On July 15 , 2007 , Jason Franco was cashiered out of the Texas Air National Guard .
He got no benefits or severance pay .
He had no prospects .
It was Family Day at the base .
_____________________
Just what is any soldier or sailor entitled to if he goes to war for the United States and comes back maimed or sick ?
Did Jason
Franco get any better or worse treatment than if he'd been shot by a sniper instead of enveloped in a haze of carcinogenic fumes ?
Well yes , no and maybe so .
According to Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Ryan , TANG 's designated representative for questions about Franco 's case , any soldier who gets hurt and honorably discharged is going to be referred to the Veterans Administration for his health care needs .
Which is what happened to Franco after he got out of the service , although since his service - related disability has been judged at 60 instead of 100 percent , he gets a smaller disability check , and his family is not medically covered through him .
( While the VA did find that Franco 's cancer is service - related , it assigned him zero monthly benefits for that , considering it cured .
Ten percent comes from the tinnitus he still suffers and 50 percent for a major depressive disorder caused by the change in his lifestyle because of the cancer .
He says his hearing loss , headaches and pain and tingling in other parts of his body are related to the cancer and its treatment , but the VA says they are not . )
As a full - time , active - duty soldier , it appears that Franco should have qualified for the " Transitional Assistance Management Program " under the military 's insurance , which would have provided him up to 180 days of health care benefits as someone who was " involuntarily separating from active duty under honorable conditions . "
28 Ways to Make Money with Your Website Daniel
There are several lists with “ ways to make money with a website ” on the Internet , but none of them seem to be complete .
That is why I decided to create this one .
If you know a method that is not listed below , just let us know and we ’ll update it .
Notice that ways to make money with a website are different from ways to make more money from it .
Methods to increase your traffic or click - through rate will help you make more money , but they do not represent a method of making money per se .
For example , one could suggest that blending AdSense ads with the content is a way to make money from a website .
In reality it ’s not ; it ’s just a way to make more money by improving your ad click - through rate .
The real monetization method behind it is a PPC ad network .
Just look at Mypaperdone.com , and how this company tops Google searches .
The list is divided into direct and indirect methods , and examples and links are provided for each point .
Enjoy !
Direct Methods
1. PPC Advertising Networks
Google AdSense is the most popular option under this category , but there are also others .
Basically you need to sign up with the network and paste some code snippets on your website .
The network will then serve contextual ads ( either text or images ) relevant to your website , and you will earn a certain amount of money for every click .
The profitability of PPC advertising depends on the general traffic levels of the website and , most importantly , on the click - through rate ( CTR ) and cost per click ( CPC ) .
The CTR depends on the design of the website .
Ads placed abode the fold or blended with content , for instance , tend to get higher CTRs .
The CPC , on the other hand , depends on the nice of the website .
Mortgages , financial products and college education are examples of profitable niches ( clicks worth a couple of dollars are not rare ) , while tech - related topics tend to receive a smaller CPC ( sometimes as low as a couple of cents per click ) .
The source of the traffic can also affect the overall CTR rate .
Organic traffic ( the one that comes from search engines ) tends to perform well because these visitors were already looking for something , and they tend to click on ads more often .
Social media traffic , on the other hand , presents terribly low CTRs because these visitors are tech - savvy and they just ignore ads .
List of popular CPC advertising networks :
Infolinks
Google Adsense
Yahoo !
Publisher Network ( YPN )
BidVertiser
Chitika
Clicksor
2. CPM Advertising Networks
CPM advertising networks behave pretty much as PPC networks , except that you get paid according to the number of impressions ( i.e. , page views ) that the ads displayed on your site will generate .
CPM stands for Cost per Mille , and it refers to the cost for 1,000 impressions .
A blog that generates 100,000 page views monthly displaying an advertising banner with a $ 1 CPM , therefore , will earn $ 100 monthly .
CPM rates vary with the network , the position of the ad and the format .
The better the network , the higher the CPM rate ( because they have access to more advertisers ) .
The closer you put the ad to the top of the page , the higher the CPM .
The bigger the format ( in terms of pixels ) , the higher the CPM .
You can get as low as $ 0,10 and as high as $ 10 per 1,000 impressions ( more in some special cases ) .
CPM advertising tends to work well on websites with a high page views per visitor ratio ( e.g. , online forums , magazines and so on ) .
List of popular CPM advertising networks :
Casale Media
Burst Media
Value Click
Advertising.com
Tribal Fusion
Right Media
3. Direct Banner Advertising
Selling your own advertising space is one of the most lucrative monetization methods .
First and foremost because it enables you to cut out the middleman commissions and to determine your own rates .
The most popular banner formats on the web are the 728×90 leaderboard , the 120×600 skyscraper , the 300×250 rectangle and the 125×125 button .
The downside of direct banner advertising is that you need to have a big audience to get qualified advertisers , and you will need to spend time managing the sales process , the banners and the payments .

4. Text Link Ads
After Google declared that sites selling text links without the nofollow tag would be penalized , this monetization method became less popular .
Many website owners are still using text links to monetize their sites , though , some using the nofollow tag and some not .
The advantage of this method is that it is not intrusive .
One can sell text links directly through his website or use specialized networks like Text - Link - Ads and Text - Link - Brokers to automate the process .
Text link marketplaces and networks :
LinkWorth
5. Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing is a very popular practice on the Internet .
Under this system you have a merchant that is willing to let other people ( the affiliates ) sell directly or indirectly its products and services , in exchange for a commission .
Sometimes this type of advertising is also called CPA ( cost per action ) or CPL ( cost per lead ) based .
Affiliates can send potential customers to the merchant using several tools , from banners to text links and product reviews .
In order to find suitable affiliate programs you can turn to individual companies and publishers like Dreamhost and SEOBook , or join affiliate marketplaces and networks .
Many businesses also create their own tempting affiliate programs in order to recruit marketers ( Amazon associates as one example ) .
Businesses all over the world are looking to bring top affiliate to promote their products because the financial rewards can be huge .
It is n’t uncommon for businesses with top affiliate programs to see more than 30 % of company revenue come directly from affiliate marketing .
List of popular affiliate marketplaces and networks :
Commission Junction
ClickBank
6. Monetization Widgets
The latest trend on the web are widgets that let you monetize your website .
Examples include Widgetbucks and SmartLinks .
Some of these services operate under a PPC scheme , others behave like text link ads , others yet leverage affiliate links .
Their main differentiator , however , is the fact that they work as web widgets , making it easier for the user to plug and play the service on its website .
7. Sponsored Reviews
PayPerPost pioneered this model , with much controversy on the beginning ( related to the fact that they did not require disclosure on paid posts ) .
Soon other companies followed , most notably Sponsored Reviews and ReviewMe , refining the process and expanding the paid blogging model .
Joining one of these sponsored reviews marketplaces will give you the opportunity to write sponsored posts on a wide range of topics .
Not all bloggers are willing to get paid to write about a specific product or website ( because it might compromise the editorial credibility ) , but the ones who do are making good money out of it .
If your blog has a big audience you could also offer sponsored reviews directly , cutting off the commissions of the middleman .
List of sponsored reviews and paid blogging networks :
PayPerPost
BlogVertise
8. RSS Feed Ads
With the quick adoption of the RSS technology by millions of Internet users , website owners are starting to find ways to monetize this new content distribution channel .
Feedburber already has its own publisher network , and you can sign - up to start displaying CPM based advertising on your feed footer .
Bidvertiser recently introduced a RSS feed ad option as well , with a PPC scheme .
Finally , some blogs are also opting to sell banners or sponsored messages on their feed directly .
John Chow and Marketing Pilgrim are two examples .

BidVertiser
9. Sponsors for Single Columns or Events
If you website has specific columns or events ( e.g. , a weekly podcast , an interview series , a monthly survey , a special project ) you could find companies to sponsor them individually .
This method increases the monetization options for website owner , while giving advertisers the possibility to target a more specific audience and with a reduced commitment .
Mashable illustrates the case well .
They have several advertising options on the site , including the possibility to sponsor specific columns and articles , including the “ Daily Poll ” and the “ Web 2.0 Invites . ”
Problogger also runs group writing projects occasionally , and before proceeding he publicly announce the project asking for sponsors .
10 . Premium Content
Some websites and blogs give away part of their content for free , and charge for access to the premium content and exclusive tools .
SEOMoz is a good example .
They have a very popular blog that gives advice and information on wide range of SEO related topics .
On top of that visitors can decide to become premium members .
It costs $ 48 monthly and it grants them access to guides , tools and other exclusive material .
11 . Private Forums
While the Internet is populated with free forums , there is also the possibility to create a private one where members need to pay a single or recurring fee to join .
SEO Blackhat charges $ 100 monthly from its members , and they have thousands of them .
Obviously in order to charge such a price for a forum membership you need to provide real value for the members ( e.g. , secret techniques , tools , and so on ) .
Performancing also launched a private forum recently , focused on the networking aspect .
It is called The Hive , and the monthly cost is $ 10 .
These are just two examples .
There are many possibilities to create a private and profitable forum , you just need to find an appealing angle that will make it worth for the members .
List of popular forum software :
vBulletin
Simple Machines Forum
phpBB
Vanilla
12 . Job Boards
All the popular blogs are trying to leverage job boards to make some extra income .
Problogger is a good example .
Needless to say that in order to create an active and profitable job board you need first to have a blog focused on a specific niche , and a decent amount traffic .
The advantage of this method is that it is passive .
Once you have the structure in place , the job listings will come naturally , and you can charge anywhere from $ 10 up to $ 100 for each .
List of popular job board software :
JobThread
Web Scribe Job Board
SimplyHired Job-o-matic
Jobbex
13 . Marketplaces
Sitepoint is the online marketplace by excellence .
Some websites and blogs , however , are trying to replicate that model on a smaller scale .
Depending on your niche , a market place that allows your visitors to buy , sell and trade products could work well .
Over the time you could start charging a small fee for new product listings .
The problem with this method is that there are no standard software on the web , so you would need to hire a coder to get a marketplace integrated into your website .
14 . Paid Surveys and Polls
There are services that will pay you money to run a small survey or poll on your website .
The most popular one is called Vizu Answers .
Basically you need to sign up with them , and select the kind of polls that you want to run your site .
Most of these services operate under a CPM model .
15 . Selling or Renting Internal Pages
Million Dollar
Wiki made this concept popular , but it was being used on the web for a long time around .
These websites sell for a single fee or rent for a recurring fee internal pages on their domain .
Usually they have either high Pagerak or high traffic , so that people purchasing a page will be able to benefit in some way .
Implementing this method on a small blog would be difficult , but the concept is interesting and could be explored further .
16 . Highlighted Posts from Sponsors
Techmeme probably pioneered this idea , but somehow it has not spread to other websites .
The tech news aggregator displays editorial posts on the left column , and on the sidebar they have a section titled “ Techmeme Sponsor Posts . ”
On that section posts from the blog of the advertisers get highlighted , sending qualified traffic their way .
Considering that the monthly cost for one spot is $ 5000 and that they have around 6 sponsors at any given time , it must be working well .
17 . Donations
Placing a “ Donate ” link or button on a website can be an efficient way to earn money , especially if your blog is on a niche where readers learn and gain value from your content .
Personal development and productivity blogs , for instance , tend to perform well with donation based systems ( one good example being Steve Pavlina ) .
A small variation of this method appeared sometime ago with the Buy Me a Beer plugin .
This WordPress plugin enables you to insert a customized message at the bottom of each article , asking the readers to chip in for a beer or coffee .
18 . In - text Adverting
In - text adverting networks like Kontera and Vibrant Media will place sponsored links inside your text .
These links come with a double underline to differentiate them from normal links , and once the user rolls the mouse over the link the advertising will pop .
Should the user click on it the site owner will make some money .
Some people make good money with this method , but others refrain from using it due to its intrusiveness .
It is also interesting to note that very few mainstream websites have experimented with in - text advertising .
19 . Pop-ups and Pop-unders
Pop-ups are a common yet annoying form of advertising on the Internet .
If you are just trying to make a much money as possible from your website , you could experiment with them .
If you are trying to grow the traffic and generate loyal visitors , however , you probably should stay away from them .
Just consider the hundreds of pop-up blockers out there : there is a reason why they are so popular .
Ad networks that use pop-ups :
Tribal Fusion
20 . Audio Ads
Also called PPP ( Pay Per Play ) , this advertising method was introduce by Net Audio Ads .
the concept is pretty simple : play a small audio advertising ( usually 5 seconds ) every time a visitor enters into your website .
The user should not be able to stop it , creating a 100 % conversion rate based on unique visitors .
The company is still rolling tests , but some users are reporting to get from a $ 4 to a $ 6 CPM .
Regardless of the pay rate , though , this is a very intrusive form of advertising , so think twice before using it .
21 . Selling the Website
Selling your website could be your last resource , but it has the potential to generate a big sum of money in a short period of time .
Market places on online forums like DigitalPoint and Sitepoint are always active with website buyers and sellers .
Keep in mind that they most used parameter to determine the value of a website is the monthly revenue that it generates , multiplied by a certain number ( the multiplier can be anything from 5 to 30 , depending on the expectations of the seller , on the quality of the site , on the niche and other factors ) .
Some people also make money trading and flipping websites .
They either create them from scratch or buy existing ones , and after some revamping they sell them for a profit .

22 . Selling an Ebook
Perhaps one of the oldest money making strategies on the web , using a website to promote a related ebook is a very efficient way to generate revenue .
You could either structure the website around the book itself , like SEOBook.com , or launch the ebook based on the success of the website , like Freelance Switch did we the book How to be a Rockstar Freelancer .

23 . Selling a Hardcover Book
Many authors and journalists leverage their blogs or websites to sell copies of hardcover books .
Examples include Guy Kawasaki , Seth Godin and Malcolm Gladwell .
While most of these people were already renowned authors before they created their website , one could also follow the other way around .
Lorelle VanFossen did exactly that with her Blogging Tips book .
First she built her authority on the subject via her blog , and afterwards she published the book .
List of self publishing and publishing services :
Lulu
Self Publishing
iUniverse
WordClay
24 . Selling Templates or WordPress Themes
As more and more people decide to get an online presence , website templates and WordPress themes become hotter and hotter .
On this segment you have mainstream websites like TemplateMonster , as well as individual designers who decide to promote and sell their work independently .
Brian Gardner and Unique Blog Designs are two examples of websites that make money with the sales of premium and custom WordPress themes .
25 . Offering Consulting and Related Services
Depending on your niche , you could make money by offering consulting and related services .
If you are also the author of your blog , the articles and information that you will share will build your profile and possibly certify your expertise on that niche , making it easier to gain customers .
Quikclicks , for example , offers consulting services related to web design and WordPress themes .
There are no ads on the website , but visitors can hire their design services .
Chris Garrett used a similar strategy .
First he created a highly influential blog on the blogging and new media niche , and afterwards he started offering consulting services to clients with related problems and needs .
26 . Creating an Email List or Newsletter
Email lists and newsletters represent one of the most powerful marketing and money making tools on the Internet .
They offer incredible conversion rates , and the possibility to call people to action in a very efficient way .
Creating a big list is a difficult task though , so if you have a popular website you could leverage it to increase the number of subscribers on your list .
Yaro Starak is a famous Internet marketer , and if you visit his blog you will notice that right on top he has a section encouraging visitors to subscribe to his email newsletter .
Yaro generates five figures in revenues each month from his email newsletters , proving that this method works .
List of software to manage email newsletters :
AWeber
SendStudio NX
PHP Autoresponder
Constant Contact
27 . Mentoring programs
People are willing to pay for someone or something that will teach them and give them knowledge ( as opposed to mere information ) .
Education is one of the biggest industries in the world , and the online landscape behaves in a similar way .
Creating a mentoring program related to the niche of your website could be very profitable if you manage to structure and promote it adequately .
There is a wide range of media and tools that you can use to deliver the information , from text articles to audio and video lessons .
Brian Clark leveraged the success of Copyblogger to launch a mentoring program teaching people how to build membership and how to sell content online .
The program is titled Teaching Sells , and it costs $ 97 monthly .
Sounds expensive , but they have over 1,000 members .
28 . Creating a conference around the website
If your website takes off and becomes an authority on its niche , you could create a conference around it .
Depending on the size of your audience , the event could attract thousands of people , and you could make money directly from conference passes and sponsors .
Search Engine Land , for instance , created a series of conferences that visit several cities on the United States and on other countries as well .
The conferences are called Search Marketing Expo , and the tickets and passes cost thousands of dollars .

Merry Christmas , American public !
Reuters is reporting that FBI is moving ahead with its plan to spend a billion US taxpayer dollars on what it calls the Next Generation Identification system , which it aims to make the largest biometrics cache in the world .
Because really , what could possibly go wrong in letting the government collect records of everyone 's faces , fingerprints , and palm patterns ( what , no retinal scans ? ) and even collude with private employers to automatically collect and add all the biometric data amassed during potential employees ' criminal background checks ?
Nothing , absolutely nothing .
Obviously .
P.S. - The only other document on NGI we were able to immediately turn up appears to come from 2006 , and it does n't like the same that Reuters is referring to .

Making High - Resolution Renewable Energy Maps Free to the Masses
October 13th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
I ’ve always had a thing for maps , both in terms of their personal utility , like finding that little tent icon symbolizing a campground on a road map ; but also in terms of their macro - level utility , like finding the optimal locations in a region to site renewable energy developments .
Fortunately , Seattle - based 3TIER is filling the niche in the latter with their bundle of high - resolution renewable energy resource maps .
Today , 3TIER added to their arsenal of wind , solar , and hydro maps with the release of the first comprehensive , high - resolution solar map for all of North , Central , and South America .
>> More on maps at CleanTechnica
The freely usable online map map is three times the resolution of existing industry solar data standards for the United States .
The map will allow policy - makers , developers and financiers to quickly identify potential sites and begin assessing their renewable energy potential .
Development of this solar map is part of 3TIER ’s ‘ REmapping the World ‘ initiative , which is intended to accelerate the adoption and integration of renewable energies worldwide , especially in less developed locales .
“ If we want developing nations to ‘ leapfrog ’ over fossil fuels , ” said 3TIER CEO Kent Westrick , “ they need information about what renewable energy resources or combination of resources exist . ”
The maps provide enough resolution so countries and organizations can begin to look at the potential wind and solar resources at a regional level .
The solar map is based on 11 years of half - hourly high resolution ( roughly 1 km ) visible satellite imagery that has been processed to create 11 years of hourly values .
Over the coming months , 3TIER plans to continue to map solar resources , country by country , based upon a priority order that takes into account such issues as solar development policies , availability of the sun and economic development status .

Almost three weeks after she was reported missing , a young teacher was spotted floating in New York ’s Upper Bay on Tuesday and was rescued by deckhands from a Staten Island ferry .
The teacher , Hannah Upp , 23 , was plucked from the swells , taken ashore and transported to Richmond University Medical Center on Staten Island , where officials said she was in stable condition .
The disappearance of Ms. Upp , a New York City teaching fellow set to begin her second year as a Spanish instructor at Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Harlem , baffled her relatives and friends and touched off a citywide search .
The teachers ’ union offered a $ 10,000 reward for information .
After she vanished  on Aug. 29 , just before the start of the school year  investigators found her keys , credit cards , wallet , cellphone and passport among her other belongings in her apartment in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood of Manhattan .
She is believed to have last withdrawn money from her bank account on Aug. 28 .
The Ruby Oniguruma gem pissed me off the other day .
I was trying to install the ultraviolet gem , and while building dependencies , compiling was done , that failed .
Ultraviolet depended on oniguruma .
gem did it ’s thing and started installing that , but oniguruma has extensions that must be compiled , and to do so needed some headers from oniguruma itself .
I ’m not a debian developer , but I like debs .
First , if I was doing this with debs instead of gems , a binary package compiled for my architecture would have been pulled in automatically and life would have moved on .
If I really wanted to build this from sources , libonig - dev would have been installed when I ran ‘ apt - get build - dep liboniguruma - ruby ’ .
I ’ve built a couple ruby debs in the past by stealing from other debs , but last night in my frustration I went out , read a bunch , chattered some , and started building more .

Jews on Thursday mark the Yom Kippur holiday with prayers for forgiveness of sins .
Hamas has added one more : stock market manipulation .
American Jews can add the " sin of market manipulation " to their transgressions recalled on the Yom Kippur Day of Atonement , according to allegations made by Hamas .
The party , labeled by the United States as an outlawed terrorist organization and formally shunned by the European Union ( EU ) , has blamed the American " Jewish Lobby " for the financial crisis that has gripped the entire world .
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhum blamed the monetary emergency on " bad administrative and financial management and a bad banking system put into place and controlled by the Jewish lobby . "
It also charged U.S. President George W. Bush with maintaining a silence about the alleged lobby and allowing it to " retain control of the American government and economy . "
The charges by Hamas follow by several days a marked increase of anti-Semitic messages on the internet directed against Jews and blaming them for the collapse of financial institutions .
Hamas has not limited Jewish or Israeli sins to market manipulation .
Its Syrian - based leader , Khaled Mashaal , blamed Israel on Monday for leaving kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit in captivity .
He said Israeli negotiators are guilty of " a lack of reliability . "
In an interview with the Italian Le Figaro newspaper , Mashaal accused the negotiators of going over the same issues on which it says there already is agreement .
Hamas previously has also claimed that Israel 's sins include staging the Holocaust by manipulating the mass murder of handicapped Jews in Europe in order to prevent having to support them .
The accusationwas aired in a documentary on the Hamas Al Aqsa television station earlier this year .
The program featured an " expert " named Amin Dabur , head of a " Center for Strategic Research . "
He explained , " The Israeli Holocaust -- the whole thing was a joke and part of the perfect show that Ben Gurion put on . "
Tony Hsieh : Zappos Billion Dollar Genius CEO
is an unassuming 34 year old who 's success defies normal logic .
He made his first $ 1 million by age 18 and that was just the beginning .
Hsieh , pronounced ' Shay ' , is the current CEO of online shoe seller Zappos.com .
Prior to joining them in 2000 , he co-founded LinkExchange .
In 1998 , at age 24 , he sold that little start up company to Microsoft for $ 250 million .
Hsieh , looking for his next triumph , became an adviser and investor in Zappos in 1999 , just months after it was founded .
He joined full time in 2000 and has grown the company , as CEO , from $ 1.6 million that first year to $ 800 million last year .
Projections indicate Zappos will gross a cool $ 1 billion in 2008 .
What started out as an online footwear business has since expanded to handbags , purses , eyewear , apparel and watches .
Zappos stated goal is to offer the " best service in the industry " .
They provide free shipping , offer a 365 - day return policy and a call center that is always open .
They put great emphasis on company culture and core values .
They strive to " deliver ' wow ' through service " .
Hsieh uses a loyalty business model and relationship marketing .
He cites Zappos ' rapid growth to repeat customers and world of mouth recommendations .
They boast 60 % repeat business .
Zappos offers all newly trained employees an opportunity to take $ 1,000 and leave the organization .
The 90 % who turn down the money in favor of the job turn out to love the job more than the money - his own philosophy .
He prefers a cubicle over a swank corner office .
He drives a Mazda , wears jeans and focuses on business rather than amassing money .
So what are his secrets to success ?
They 're really quite simple : live within your means , understand your value and focus on that , do n't get too big for your britches , be organized , and stick to your goals .

The Debate Post - Mortem : Mcplosion , Weird Faces and Lurchy - Lurch
The Third Presidential Debate : The Beauty and The Beast
In the third Presidential debate last Tuesday , John McCain was a cranky , befuddled and unpleasant embarrassment .
Jeff Schweitzer concluded that , “ The split screen TV killed the McCain campaign , delivering the final blow by offering the audience a clear view of the Beauty and the Beast .
On one screen we saw a calm Obama , attentively listening to his opponent , then responding with coherent , concise retorts .
On the other , we saw a squirming , smirking , eye - rolling , angry McCain looking uncomfortable in his own skin , stumbling through his anger to come up with a stuttering reply . ”
Marty Kaplan described McCain as coming across as angrier and meaner than ever before .
“ Every time Obama spoke , McCain grimaced , sneered , or rolled his eyes .
By contrast , every time McCain was on the attack , Obama smiled .
Ninety minutes of John McCain making faces was more than enough for a lifetime .
He smirked .
He grimaced .
He sneered .
He fake - smiled .
It ’s hard to imagine anyone willingly inviting that antic lemon - sucking grinfest into their homes for the next four years . ”
The more rage he felt , the more weird his expressions became , as he made increasingly odd faces .
It ’s ironic that it was McCain who more than once warned debate observers to beware of Obama ’s eloquence , because if you ignored McCain ’s words Tuesday night , there was nothing left to do but be mesmerized by the bizarre dance being done by his cheeks , his lips , his eyebrows and his eyes .

( Part of an Exclusive WebEcoist Series on Amazing Trees , Plants , Forests and Flowers )
From marijuana to catnip , there are hundreds of remarkably common herbs , flowers , berries and plants that serve all kinds of important medicinal and health purposes that might surprise you : anti-inflammatory , anti-fungal , insect repellent , antiseptic , expectorant , antibacterial , detoxification , fever reduction , antihistamine and pain relief .
Here are eighteen potent medical plants you ’re likely to find in the wild – or even someone ’s backyard – that can help with minor injuries , scrapes , bites and pains . *
Marijuana
Images via Current and Street Knowledge
Seriously .
Though marijuana is still illegal in the United States , it is legal in 12 states for medicinal purposes , and if a case of poison ivy in the woods is n’t a medicinal purpose , what is ?
Marijuana was * mostly * legal until 1970 when it became classified as a hard drug .
No one thought of it as a dangerous or illicit drug until the 20th century ; in fact , hemp was George Washington ’s primary crop and Thomas Jefferson ’s secondary crop .
The Declaration of Independence is written on it ; the Gutenberg Bible was printed on hemp , too .
There ’s actually an environmental dimension to legalizing marijuana – hemp is a remarkable and renewable plant , offering all kinds of foodstuff and product uses that surpass cotton and plastic .
But health benefits are well documented , from depression and anxiety relief to reduced blood pressure , pain alleviation and glaucoma treatment .
It is not addictive , does not kill brain cells and is not a “ gateway ” drug – in fact , when pot is more available , studies show that the use of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine actually decreases .
The bottom line for hikers : when your leg is broken from a misjudged boulder hopping attempt ( pain ) and a bear has eaten your friend ( depression ) and you ’re lost because you forgot the compass ( dumbass ) , consult the cannabis .
Lady Ferns

If you grew up in the Pacific Northwest you likely know what ferns are good for : treating stinging nettles .
One of the world ’s oldest plants , there are many varieties of ferns , but if you ’re lucky enough to spy the soft , delicate lady fern , grab some and roll it up between your palms into a rough mash .
The juices released will quickly ease stinging nettle burns and can also ease minor cuts , stings and burns ( fresh salt water also works in a pinch for bee stings ) .
Bracken fern are similar to lady fern and will work , as well .
The rougher , glossier , stiff sword fern and deer fern wo n’t be as effective , though .
( Learn about types of ferns . )
Lady ferns actually grow all over North America but are common in areas with high rainfall .
California Poppy

The brilliant blooms of the poppy make this opioid plant an iconic one .
The plant is an effective nervine ( anxiety reliever ) and is safe for use on agitated children .
Can be made into a a tea for quick relief of nervousness and tension .
A stronger decoction will offer pain relief .
( A decoction is made by “ stewing ” all safe plant parts , including stems and roots if possible , in water for several hours and , ideally , soaking overnight . )
Blood Flower
The blood flower ( also Mexican butterfly weed ) is a type of tropical milkweed with toxic milky sap that is emetic ( it makes you hurl ) .
It ’s also historically favored as a heart stimulant and worm expellent .
Pretty useful for a number of potential hiking disasters , if you think about it .
( Of course , if you ’d quit eating those poisonous berries you probably would n’t need to worry about finding a natural expectorant . )
Tansy
Image via Earth Heart Farm
If you ’ve decided to backpack through Europe instead of the mountains of Mexico ( but why ? ) , you ’ll want to know about a few helpful medicinal plants .
Tansy is an old - world aster and remedy , used for flavoring beer and stews as well as repelling insects .
Rubbing the leaves on the skin provides an effective bug repellent , but tansy can also be used to treat worms .
It is said to be poisonous when extracted , but a few leaves are not harmful if ingested .
Korean Mint ( hyssop )
Who does n’t want to be minty fresh ?
Most of the various types of “ mint ” or mentha – spearmint , Korean mint , applemint , regular old mint – offer reported health benefits and medicinal properties .
( Avoid pennyroyal , as it ’s poisonous . )
Mint is famous for soothing headaches , fighting nausea , calming the stomach and reducing nervousness and fatigue .
Korean mint , also called Indian mint and hyssop , is a fairly effective antiviral , making it useful for fighting colds and the flu .
Whatever continent you ’re on , some type of mint is usually to be found .
Eat whole , garnish food or make tea to get the all purpose health benefits .
Alfalfa
Image via In Advance
Alfalfa is fodder for livestock for a reason : it ’s incredibly rich in minerals and health - promoting nutrients and compounds .
With roots that grow 20 to 30 feet deep , alfalfa is considered the “ father of all plants ” .
( It also contains a high amount of protein for a green . )
Alfalfa originally grew in the Mediterranean and Middle East but has now spread to most of Europe and the Americans .
It can treat morning sickness , nausea , kidney stones , kidney pain and urinary discomfort .
It is a powerful diuretic and has a bit of stimulant power , helping to energize after a bout with illness .
It ’s a liver and bowel cleanser and long - term can help reduce cholesterol .
You can purchase seeds and sprouts , but it ’s fine to eat the leaves straight from the earth .
Catnip

The cannabis of the cat kingdom .
Famous for making cats deliriously crazy , catnip has health properties that are great for humans , too .
Catnip can relieve cold symptoms ( helpful if you ’re on a camping trip and do n’t have access to Nyquil ) .
It ’s useful in breaking a fever as it promotes sweating .
Catnip also helps stop excessive bleeding and swelling when applied rather than ingested .
This mint plant ( yep , another one ) is also reportedly helpful in treating gas , stomach aches , and migraines .
Catnip can stimulate uterine contractions , so it should not be consumed by pregnant women .
It grows in the Northern Hemisphere .
Sage

Sage is an incredibly useful herb , widely considered to be perhaps the most valuable herb .
It is anti-flammatory , anti-oxidant , and antifungal .
In fact , according to the noted resource World ’s Healthiest Foods , “ Its reputation as a panacea is even represented in its scientific name , Salvia officinalis , derived from the Latin word , salvere , which means ‘ to be saved ’ . ”
It was used as a preservative for meat before the advent of refrigeration ( eminently useful : you never know when you ’ll be forced to hunt in the wild ) .
Sage aids digestion , relieves cramps , reduces diarrhea , dries up phlegm , fights colds , reduces inflammation and swelling , acts as a salve for cuts and burns , and kills bacteria .
Sage apparently even brings color back to gray hair .
A definite concern when lost in the woods .
Blackberries

Did you know blackberries have useful healing properties ?
Of course they ’re loaded in antioxidants and vitamins , but the leaves and roots have value , too .
Native Americans have long used the stems and leaves for healing , while enjoying the young shoots peeled as a vegetable of sorts and the berries , either raw or in jams .
The leaves and root can be used as an effective treatment against dysentery and diarrhea as well as serving usefulness as an anti-inflammatory and astringent .
Ideal for treating cuts and inflammation in the mouth .
Wild Quinine

According to Alternative Nature Online , wild quinine is a potent herb that “ is used as an antiperiodic , emmenagogue , kidney , lithontripic , poultice .
It has traditionally been used in alternative medicine to treat debility , fatigue , respiratory infection , gastrointestinal infection , and venereal disease . ”
Whatever the ailment , quinine is famously helpful in treating it .
Only the root and flowers are edible ; avoid the plant .
Navajo Tea
Also called greenthread , Plains Tea or Coyote Plant , this plant has been used for centuries by Native Americans to quickly relieve that most brutal and irritating of infections : the UTI ( urinary tract infection ) .
Best when made into a tea or decoction .
Red Clover

Native to Europe , Northern Africa and Western Asia , red clover is now ubiquitous worldwide .
The plant ’s reddish pink blossoms can be used for coughs and colds , but they are an excellent detoxifier and blood cleanser as well .
Sweet Marjoram

Marjoram and oregano are often used interchangeably , but the aromatic sweet marjoram is slightly different .
The Greeks called it the “ Joy of the Mountain ” and it was revered throughout the Mediterranean for its fragrance , flavor and medicinal value .
The famous French herbs de provence and Middle Eastern za’atar both use sweet marjoram .
Marjoram has many uses ( it ’s a famous digestive aid ) but it is effective as an antifungal , antibacterial and disinfectant treatment in a pinch .
Burdock Herb

Burdock , or cocklebur , is a prickly , thistle - like plant that grows commonly in many parts of the world .
It can get fairly big and its leaves resemble the elephant ear plant .
Though the burs often get caught in pets ’ and livestock ’s fur , do n’t think of it only as an annoying plant .
It is a highly effective treatment against poison ivy and poison oak ( claims that it cures cancer are slightly * less * substantiated ) .
Feverfew
Image via Earth Heart Farm
Feverfew is a plant that has well - known and documented health properties and medicinal benefits .
This anti-inflammatory can treat rheumatism , arthritis and , most famously , migraine headaches and tension headaches .
It ’s also good for alleviating tension and general anxiety ( it is a natural serotonin inhibitor ) .
It also helps to reduce swelling and bruising .
Though feverfew is most effective when taken daily , it can be a helpful pain reliever when no Advil is on hand .
Sweet Violet

Native to Europe and Asia , sweet violet is cultivated around the world and is a pleasant , delicate purple color .
When brewed into a syrup the plant is effective as a treatment for colds , flu and coughs or sore throat .
However , when made as a tea , it is wonderfully effective for relieving headaches and muscle and body pain .
Winter Savory

Winter savory is your savior against insect bites and stings .
One of the most effective natural plant treatments for bug bites is originally from Europe and the Mediterranean but often shows up elsewhere thanks to global trade .
In addition to being an antiseptic , it is delicious – used for flavoring meats and stews – and all parts are edible .

[ Who Killed the Constitution ?
The Fate of American Liberty from World War I to George W. Bush .
By Thomas E. Woods Jr. and Kevin R.C. Gutzman .
Crown Forum , 2008 .
Viii + 259 pages . ]
The question posed by the title of this book raises a further question , as the authors are well aware .
If the Constitution is indeed dead , why does this matter ?
American conservatives have in past days been accused of " Constitution worship " : why should we care whether actions of the government conform to this particular legal document ?
Woods and Gutzman respond that the Constitution provides a way to limit the government .
It is far from the best conceivable arrangement ; but while we stand under its legal authority , we should use it as a weapon against the state 's continual grasp for power .
They put the point with characteristic force :
To be sure , our federal government has perverted beyond recognition the system that the Founding Fathers created .
The chief restraint on government officials is merely their sense of what they can get away with .
Nonetheless , the Constitution can still serve a purpose , as it remains a useful bludgeon to employ against government power grabs .
By calling attention to what the Constitution really says , we can alert the people to just how consistently and dramatically their fundamental law has been betrayed .
( p. 202 )
Woods and Gutzman have selected twelve cases to illustrate this disregard of the Constitution .
By no means are all of these examples of judicial misconduct ; the legislative and executive branches have been at least as guilty as the judicial in seeking to enhance government power .
One instance of what we are up against took place immediately after World War I .
In 1917 , Congress passed the Espionage Act and in the following year , the Sedition Act .
These forbade with heavy criminal penalties attempts to interfere with the American war effort , especially with recruitment of troops .
Under this harsh legislation , many people were imprisoned , including the famous socialist Eugene V. Debs , who ran for the presidency in 1920 from his jail cell .
The legislation blatantly violated the text of the Constitution .
The First Amendment states that " Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech " ; and as Justice Hugo Black liked to say , " ' no law ' means ' no law ' . "
Congress had earlier violated the First Amendment with the Sedition Act of 1798 ; but along with the Alien Act of the same year , it was repudiated by Thomas Jefferson and was generally regarded as a disaster .
Nevertheless , the Supreme Court said that the Espionage Act was constitutional .
How did they reach this perverse verdict ?
The authors rightly concentrate on the opinion of the sainted Oliver Wendell Holmes in the case of Schenck v. United States ( 1919 ) .
Holmes is widely regarded as the foremost American jurist , and Judge Richard Posner has edited , with a fawning introduction , a collection of his legal writings .
In fact , as the authors show , Holmes used his considerable literary gifts to subvert the Constitution .
Holmes argued that in order to justify restriction on free speech , there must be a " clear and present danger that they [ the offending words ] will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent .
It is a question of proximity and degree " ( pp. 16–17 ) .
Holmes 's standard at first glance may appear reasonable , but it rests on a false premise .
Holmes assumes that two interests are locked in conflict : the right of free speech and the authority of Congress to prohibit various evils .
His task as a judge is to balance these warring interests .
Of course the Constitution says nothing of this .
To the contrary , it absolutely prohibits Congress from enacting legislation that abridges free speech .
There is no question at all of " balancing " this right against other goals .
In Robert Nozick 's phrase , it imposes a side constraint on the government 's pursuit of its goals and is not itself a goal .
Further , Holmes interpreted the clear - and - present - danger test in an expansive way .
It was " apparently malleable enough to bring about the criminalization of a wide variety of speech and action , for nothing in the trial [ of Schenck ] showed that the [ antidraft ] leaflet posed a ' clear and present danger ' of producing any kind of ' evils ' " ( p. 11 ) .
Holmes 's opinion illustrates how war emergencies often serve permanently to enhance government power : subsequent Supreme Court opinions have never abandoned Holmes 's false contention that free speech must be balanced against other considerations .
Harry Truman , that malignant haberdasher , put forward if anything a more expansive view of federal power during wartime , or other " emergencies , " than Holmes had done .
Truman in 1952 seized America 's steel mills to avert an imminent strike that , he claimed , would impede the war effort in Korea .
In giving this order , he relied on no acts of Congress .
Instead , he advanced the incredible opinion that he could do whatever he wished to deal with an emergency .
( The war emergency , as the authors note , had itself come about as the result of unconstitutional action .
Truman involved the United States in a costly war , even though there had been no declaration of war by Congress , as the Constitution manifestly prescribes . )
[ W ] hen asked on April 17 [ 1952 ] whether in his view his inherent power to seize private property extended to the possible seizure of American newspapers and radio stations , the president replied : " Under similar circumstances the President of the United States has to act for whatever is for the best of the country . " ( p. 30 )
Truman 's Assistant Attorney General Holmes Baldridge clarified Truman 's position when he pled the steel seizure case in federal court .
In response to Judge David Pine 's question " So you contend that the Executive has unlimited power in time of an emergency ? "
Baldridge said : " He has the power to take such action as is necessary to meet the emergency " ( p. 27 ) .
He went on to say that it was for the president to determine whether an emergency existed and that his decision could not be challenged in court .
Truman may have advanced these extreme views , but did not the Supreme Court rap him sharply on the knuckles in Youngstown ( 1952 ) ?
The court did indeed hold unconstitutional Truman 's seizure of the mills ; but , our authors note , the court did not deny that the president had inherent unstated powers to act in emergencies .
Rather , the question that largely concerned it was that Truman had acted against procedures mandated by Congressional legislation .
Truman 's claims of executive power unfortunately are by no means a thing of the past .
The present occupant of the White House , compared to whom the autodidact Truman is a veritable intellectual giant , has also claimed the right to act as he deems best , the Constitution and laws to the contrary notwithstanding .
John
Yoo , a Boalt Hall law professor who worked in the attorney general 's office , has spun webs of sophistical argument in support of the president 's aspirations after tyranny ; and for me the highlight of Who Killed the Constitution ? is the expert demolition of Yoo 's intellectual pretensions .
Yoo makes much of the word " the . "
Article I of the Constitution assigns to Congress " all legislative powers herein granted , " but Article II states that " the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America " ( emphasis added ) .
According to Yoo , contained in this simple word are undreamed of powers .
" The executive power , " he contends , refers to the powers that an eighteenth - century consensus recognized as inhering in that phrase .
It is these that the Constitution grants to the president , and the enumerated powers in Article II merely exemplify , rather than fully specify , what he can do .
A sillier argument would be difficult to imagine .
Is it likely that the Framers of the Constitution hid a controversial doctrine in a single word ?
" Far from recognizing such an expansive meaning of executive power , the Founders took the phrase to refer to the mere execution of the laws and nowhere suggested that it meant anything else .
Much less did they contend that it conferred a bundle of unspecified powers on the president …
There is also the little problem that Article II lists specific powers that the Constitution confers on the president " ( p. 176 ) .
Why list specific powers if they are already included in " the executive power " ?
No more successful is Yoo 's endeavor to conjure away the power of Congress to declare war .
True enough , the Constitution does grant exactly this power to Congress , but , claims
Yoo , the grant does not limit at all the right of the president to start wars .
Yoo maintains that Congress has not been given the power to initiate or to make war ; all that is given is the power to proclaim that a state of war exists , bringing the laws of war into effect .
Our authors counter that though Grotius did employ this usage of " declare war , " it was not the meaning the Framers intended .
Grotius 's usage was by the time the Constitution was drafted obsolete ; and the early historical record of the US government is decisive against Yoo 's interpretation .
If declarations of war were in fact merely rhetorical , as Yoo argues , we should expect presidents to initiate military force boldly and not to be concerned about the will of Congress .
Unfortunately for Yoo , … George Washington specifically disclaimed the power to take the country to war without congressional authorization … ( p. 173 ) .
John Adams , Jefferson , and Madison held the same view .
So excellent is this book that it puts me in an uncomfortable position .
It is difficult for me to find fault with it , and this will never do for The Mises Review .
I am able to come up with only some trivial points .
Perhaps I have misunderstood , but it seems to me that Chief Justice Burger was perfectly right when he claimed that the language of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act that forbade busing to achieve racial balance merely says that no power to require such transportation can be derived from the act : the act does not alter the Court 's power to interpret the equal - protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .
I am at a loss to see why the authors claim , " Typically , Burger 's explanation was false " ( p. 64 ) .
For once , he got something right .
Woods and Gutzman are of course correct that the act does not authorize busing ; but Burger in the passage they quote does not claim the contrary .
Burger was likewise mistaken to think that the Fourteenth Amendment does authorize busing ; but he was not at fault in denying that the act determines the meaning of the amendment .
This is not determined by the laws passed by Congress a century after the amendment .
Also , it goes too far to say " soon after Franklin Roosevelt became president in 1933 , he reneged on his campaign vows of traditional Democratic laissez - faire economic policy " ( p. 106 ) .
Roosevelt had strongly criticized Hoover for excessive government spending , but his campaign speeches indicate that he planned an activist government policy to combat the Depression .
Much to my regret , I can find nothing else to quibble about in this outstanding book .
I have given an account of only a few of the excellent discussions contained in it .
Understanding Wills And Trusts
Wills and trusts are two commonly utilized tools to ensure the proper transfer of assets after death .
While both wills and trusts describe in detail how assets are to be distributed , they differ greatly on how the specific distribution is carried out .
After reading this article , you should have a better understanding of how wills are trusts work , as well as their many differences .
Creating A Will
A will is a written document that a person uses to define how their possessions and property will be distributed upon his or her death .
Their accumulated property is known as an estate .
The creator of the will is referred to as the testator .
The testator designates , or names , beneficiaries in the will document .
A beneficiary is someone or something that will receive a share of the testator ’s estate upon the testator ’s death .
The testator can name one or multiple beneficiaries .
The testator also designates an executor .
An executor is the person in charge of carrying out the directions of the will .
In order for a will to be valid , the circumstances surrounding the creation of the document , as well as the document itself , must adhere to certain requirements .
Since wills are governed by state law and these laws vary from state to state , it ’s important to verify the specific requirements of the state in which the will is to be created .
Here are some general requirements that are common for valid will creation :
The testator must be of majority age , which generally means he or she must be at least 18 years of age ;
He or she must have the intent to create a will ;
He or she must have the physical and mental capacity to create a will ;
The will is typically required to be signed by the testator and a certain number of witnesses .
Executing A Will
It is believed that , once signed by a testator and validated , a will can not be revoked .
This is , however , incorrect as a testator can still revoke their will up until their death .
A will can typically be revoked in three different ways :
A subsequent written instrument such as a new will or a letter of revocation is created ;
A physical act such as tearing up the will ;
An operation of law , such as a subsequent marriage or a court determining the will to be invalid .
After the testator ’s death , their will is put through the probate process .
Probate is the legal process in which a will ’s validity or invalidity is determined .
If the will is held to be valid , the testator ’s estate will be distributed according to the directions in the will .
While this may sound simple , probate proceedings tend to be complicated , time - consuming , expensive , and confusing .
To get an idea of the process and complications , check out our guide to understanding the probate timeline .
Probate Timeline
The majority of courts have local rules that can further delay the process .
It is a good idea to research probate law and various probate attorneys ahead of time .
Read more .
Establishing A Trust
A trust is a separate entity whereby a person ’s real and personal property is held and remains for the benefit of another persons .
In general , a trust must have a settlor , an identifiable beneficiary , and a trustee .
The settlor is the person creating the trust .
The beneficiary of the trust are the designated individuals who hold inheritance rights of the trust property .
The settlor can name one or multiple beneficiaries .
The trustee is the person or organization that manages the trust .
The trustee holds legal title to the trust property and must hold and manage the property for the benefit of the beneficiaries .
The settlor can designate one or more trustees .
If there is more than one trustee , each is referred to as a co-trustee .
The settlor can , and should , also designate an alternative trustee .
This person will serve as trustee if the original trustee cannot or will not perform their obligations .
In order for a trust to be correctly managed , the settlor usually creates a trust document .
The trust document is commonly referred to as a Trust Deed .
The trustee is obligated to manage and administer the trust in accordance with the terms of the trust document and law .
Trusts are governed by state law and each state ’s trust laws vary , so you should check your respective state ’s requirements .
Remember , when deciding on what type of will or trust you should implement , it is always best to consult a qualified probate attorney in your area .
BAGHDAD ( CNN ) -- Fifteen Turkish soldiers were killed in an overnight clash with Kurdish rebels in southeastern Turkey along the country 's border with Iraq , President Abdullah Gul said .
Turkish tanks on the move earlier this year in southeastern Turkey .
Two others were missing and 20 were wounded , two of them seriously , the Turkish military said .
" The terror group wants to show that it is still alive , " Gul told reporters .
" That 's the reason for this attack . "
Gul was referring to the Kurdish Workers Party , or PKK , the leading Kurdish rebel group in the region .
The Associated Press reported at least 23 rebels were killed when Turkish troops later returned fire .
Most of the casualties in the attack , which was launched from northern Iraq , were caused by heavy arms fire , the military said .
The attack comes prior to Tuesday 's scheduled vote by the Turkish government that would extend the authority of the Turkish military to launch attacks on PKK positions in northern Iraq .
The attack , which began Friday and ended Saturday , occurred in Semdinli , a town in the southeastern province of Hakkari , said the state - run Anatolia news agency .
Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh condemned the " terrorist act , " saying it " creates a serious threat to the security of the border areas and the joint security of Iraq and Turkey . "
He called on the Turkish government to deal with this " criminal act wisely and with self - restraint . "
" The Iraqi government expresses its support for the measures the Turkish government will take within Turkish territory to guarantee its [ Turkey 's ] security and stability , " he said .
The central Iraqi government has labeled the PKK a terrorist organization , banning its activities and shutting its offices in the country two years ago .
But the PKK continues to operate in the Qandil Mountains in northern Iraq bordering Turkey and Iran .
A PKK spokesman acknowledged the attack on a Turkish military post , but called the casualty figure given by the Turkish authorities " an exaggeration . "
Afterward , Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan canceled a planned visit to Mongolia .
The PKK has been a separatist faction fighting for self - rule in southeastern Turkey .
But the group 's leader recently said he would settle for less than a Kurdish state .
In an interview held in the group 's Qandil Mountain hideout , the PKK 's military commander , Bahoz Erdal , told CNN that the PKK was defending Kurdish rights and attacked only military targets .
" We are ready for a political solution , " Erdal said .
He said they would lay down their arms if Kurds were guaranteed equal rights within Turkey .
The Turkish government , in response to CNN 's query , said last week that it did not negotiate with " terrorists . "
In February , Turkish military ground forces launched a week - long offensive against the rebels in northern Iraq .
The Iraqi government opposes the PKK presence , but views Turkish military incursions as a violation of its sovereignty .
The United States labels the PKK a terrorist organization .

Obama : McCain trying to ' hoodwink ' public with smears David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday October 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama lashed out at his opponent's
campaign Sunday , depicting Sen. John McCain as more interested in attacking Obama 's character than solving the economic crisis .
Even after Congress passed a $ 700 billion bailout signed by President Bush , the next president will face daunting housing and credit problems , the Associated Press reported .
" Yet instead of addressing these crises , Senator McCains campaign has announced that they plan to ' turn the page ' on the discussion about our economy and spend the final weeks of this campaign launching Swiftboat - style attacks on me , " Obama said .
" ... We 're not going to let John McCain distract us , we 're not going to let him hoodwink you , " Obama said .
The McCain campaign shifted gears recently , with a campaign strategist saying it will spend the last month of the election focused on criticisms of Obama 's experience instead of the faltering U.S. economy , Reuters reported .
Palin kicked off that effort Saturday with a speech that accused Obama of " palling around with terrorists , " referencing his alleged connection to 1960s radical Bill Ayers .
The campaign has stepped up attacks after Obama widened his lead in the wake of the debates to eight points .
Polls continue to show more Americans trust Obama to deal with the financial meltdown than McCain , the Baltimore Sun reported .
" Senator McCain and his operatives are gambling that he can distract you with smears rather than talk to you about substance , " Obama said .
" They 'd rather try to tear our campaign down than lift this country up . "
" It 's what you do when you 're out of touch , out of ideas and running out of time , " Obama said at a campaign event in Asheville , NC .

Globalisation may be breaking down international boundaries , but children are increasingly confining themselves to their immediate neighbourhoods .
Many of them inhabit a world where stepping onto the wrong side of the road is insult enough to justify attack , where postcodes mark out borders that can't be crossed and where urban tribes spend their lives patrolling areas as small as 200 sq metres .
In Sunderland , youth centres now lay on minibuses for kids who dread walking through certain streets .
In Bradford , getting to school has become a strategic exercise for children who have to avoid particular areas and get escorted through others .
In Tower Hamlets , east London , which borders the Thames , one youth worker taking a group of local teenagers on a boat ride discovered that they had never seen the river .
These children live with a stifling awareness of territory .
Until now , this psychological geography has been unchartered , but the Joseph Rowntree Foundation ( JRF ) today publishes a national investigation into its harmful effects .
Over the past two years , researchers have talked to young people in Bradford , Peterborough , London , Glasgow , Sunderland and Bristol to find out where they feel safe , where they feel at risk and why .
The maps on the following pages - drawn by the children interviewed for the study - show just how strong , and sometimes dangerous , these territorial loyalties are .
Take diagrams 1 and 2 : two 11 - year old boys were asked to draw maps of their neighbourhood in Glasgow .
The boys sit next to each other in the same class at school but , because they live on opposite sides of the block , the areas they have marked " safe " and " do n't go " in their illustrations are mirror opposites .
They might be friends in the classroom , but they know that visiting each other 's homes is - literally - " out of bounds " .
We are familiar with divides based on race , class , gang membership or family ; we are less familiar with divides based on geography alone .
Take diagram 5 : a young white girl from Yorkshire has neatly labelled the neighbourhood stereotypes , crosshatching the " Asian " areas brown and the " chavs " in pink ( the small number of " poshos " are in yellow ) .
While drawing , this 15 - year - old explained that there is a long rivalry between the " all chavs no asians " estate in the top lefthand corner and the " all chavs " estate to the right of it .
Similarly , the blue arrow indicates conflict between the two Asian groups nearer the centre .
In these two areas , local boundaries trump race as the key source of conflict in the community .
In some cases , young people are confining themselves to areas that are less than a couple of blocks wide .
In diagram 4 , an 18 - year - old man has drawn the boundaries of where he lives , noting the position of CCTV cameras .
In total , the mapped space is less than 200 metres square .
The areas crosshatched in blue , however , are out of bounds .
The areas marked in orange - which include a smoking den behind a shop and the local pub - are the only places he feels safe .
This is more than a natural apprehension about growing up and moving out ; this is self - imposed isolation .
Chris Thompson , a young resident from Rowley Way estate in north London , says that he and his neighbouring mates feel safe in the one - and - a - half - mile stretch from Swiss Cottage to Kilburn , but certain areas not far beyond that are totally off limits .
" If you 're on a different estate and they do n't know you , you 're going to get into trouble .
It 's just how it is , " he says .
" I 've robbed people because they 've been in my area .
It 's happened quite a few times .
It starts with a question : ' Where are you from ? '
Then there 's a fight and no one thinks of the consequences .
It 's like , if you do n't live here , then you have no reason to be here - it 's just roads and blocks .
It 's a pride thing .
No one wants to back down . "
I asked Thompson if he had ever been attacked for stepping into someone else 's territory .
" Nah , I would n't be caught slipping like that , " he says .
" Slipping is when you 're out of your area , when you 're on your own with no weapons - it 's vulnerability .
It 's when you 're on a bus with no one to protect you .
I do n't put myself in that position . "
For Thompson and others like him , crossing certain borders raises a genuine threat of attack .
But for a wider set of young people who are n't directly involved in territorial behaviour , the threat of violence is less obvious .
For them , stepping beyond their three blocks does n't necessarily feel dangerous - it just feels inappropriate .
" Not leaving or going anywhere , that 's just normal , that 's just life .
It 's the right thing to do , " says Thompson .
" Most of the kids here have never been past Camden Town - not on their own .
They 've just sat on the same corner for five years .
Once you 've done that it 's hard to get out . "
Obviously , this trend has crippling implications .
As well as increasing young people 's risk of getting involved in violence , territorial thinking shuts down their opportunities .
It means that young people are n't leaving their areas to go to better colleges , seek decent jobs or even get better healthcare .
How can young people benefit from taking diplomas in the college of their choice if they 're scared to walk to their local school ?
What 's the point of opening up hospitals to competition if young people are terrified of the journey to their local GP ?
Keith Kintrea , senior lecturer in urban studies at Glasgow University and co-author of the JRF report , believes that territoriality is limiting social mobility .
" At a time when young people are supposed to be making the transition to adulthood and widening their horizons , they do n't seem to be able to see life beyond their borders .
This is reinforcing poverty in some of the UK 's most deprived urban areas . "
Kintrea believes this behaviour may also be driving up crime rates .
" In some places , it seems to be acting as a mechanism through which young people get involved in organised crime like drug distribution . "
The link between drugs and territories came up clearly in some of the young people 's drawings .
In diagram 3 , an 18 - year - old from Tower Hamlets has drawn a seemingly innocent community of halal butchers , restaurants and mosques .
But all the figures depicted on the streets are drug dealers , and the cars - all Rolls - Royces - belong to local suppliers .
The boundaries of his area are defined by the margins of the local drugs market .
Kintrea found that territoriality was most likely to affect young boys , most intensely between the ages of 14 and 17 .
Territory has always been a stereotypically male concern , and the gender divide was reflected in the research .
A map drawn by a 15 - year - old boy , depicting exactly the same neighbourhood as the girl 's map in diagram 5 , also highlighted two rival estates .
But when he was asked why his map was so much emptier , he says it was because there was " nothing to do " in his neighbourhood .
The researcher who interviewed him explained : " The shops and services that the girl had recognised simply did not exist on this boy 's mental map .
Because they were located in territory out of bounds , they were n't open to him .
The girls we interviewed seemed less affected by these barriers . "
JRF 's research suggests that territoriality adversely affects young people who are not actively involved in conflicts .
Not knowing that the territorial line exists , it seems , is no excuse for crossing it .
As James Heath , 23 , from north London , explains : " It does n't matter if you 're not looking for trouble .
One of my mates got on the bus down the road and started getting intimidated by another guy : ' Are you from Zone [ Harlesden , north London ] ?
Then why have n't I seen you before ? '
He got beaten up just for being there . "
Heath says that he is now " too old " to be involved in territorial conflict , but that the problem has escalated since he was a teenager .
" There always was territory .
Different estates and rival gangs would fight each other , but not to the same extent - and not over postcodes . "
At present , there is no national research to show whether young people 's sense of territory is growing .
The anecdotal knowledge of youth workers and worried parents is all we have to go by .
What is clear , however , is that territoriality is taking new forms .
A new vocabulary has sprung up to describe local neighbourhoods : words such as " hood " and " area " are being replaced with talk of " endz " and " boundaries " .
These new terms have an inbuilt sense of limits .
Your area is no longer just where you return to ; it 's where you stay .
Technology is reinforcing these subcultures .
The internet was supposed to be about widening horizons , but in small bedrooms on estates , young people are using their computers to shut them down .
Facebook groups are devoted to tiny physical localities ; MSN groups help to coordinate territorial fights .
The rise of grime music , spreading through digital stations such as Channel U , has also been blamed .
Young people are seeking to emulate these new grime celebrities , posting hundreds of homemade tunes on YouTube to " rep their endz " .
Music , technology , art and lyrics are all being used to celebrate some of the most deprived urban areas in the UK , areas where territoriality is at its strongest and most violent .
This presents an intriguing paradox - why does a community 's connection to place get stronger the worse that area becomes ?
According to JRF 's report , territoriality often springs from " very positive motivations " .
Respect and recognition , personal protection and entertainment were all identified as key drivers of territorial behaviour .
All human beings have a need for these things , but in some of the UK 's poorest urban enclaves , they are hard to find .
Territoriality helps to plug the gaps .
" In a place where there 's nothing , you need to find a way of getting respect , " says Heath .
" These kids want it , but they do n't want to work for it .
It 's not because they 're lazy exactly - they 've just never been taught .
And controlling an area does n't just feel like respect .
It is respect .
Whether you 're a rich banker or whoever , you feel scared when you walk down a street that someone has marked as their territory - so it 's real . "
In a country that has very little need for people without skills and qualifications , Thompson believes territoriality may also be a way of salvaging self - esteem : " Pride is a big part of it - people are trying to show who they are and what they can do .
But there 's no money round here , it 's hard to find a job and there 's nothing to do .
People think that if you can show you are the biggest man , you will get respect . "
The challenge , then , is a difficult one .
Young people need alternatives if they 're to stop being territorial , but the behaviour itself will have to be broken down before they have the confidence to move beyond their self - imposed borders .
Youth workers are already doing a lot - bussing young people to different areas and running conflict - resolution programmes - but little is being done to address the fundamental problem : the feeling in some communities that the opportunities of the wider world are not for them .
If young people are to cross these invisible lines , they need help to connect with something better on the other side .

In the report above on neighbourhood territories as perceived by the young people who live in them , we said that an 18 - year - old had drawn a diagram that included a zone of safety of less than 200 square metres .
That should have been less than 200 metres square , or 40,000 square metres .
This has been corrected .
There are at least two anti-choice ballot initiatives this year , Prop 4 in California and Prop 11 in South Dakota .
One expects a great many propositions on the always enormous California ballot , but the South Dakota proposition is pernicious , since South Dakotans voted on this issue ( and turned down radical restrictions on reproductive choice ) just two years ago .
The South Dakota Campaign for Healthy Families is at the forefront of proving just how intrusive and illogical these measures , which are purely an imposition of one religious position onto every citizen , can be .

As the presidential election draws near , we increasingly read and hear about the importance of the Latino vote , as pollsters and pundits alike claim that Latino voters as a group may determine the fate of Barack Obama and John McCain , especially in the all - important battleground states .
Indeed , in Florida , Nevada , New Mexico and Colorado , Latinos are critical swing voters that may hold the key to unlocking the door to the Oval Office .
Most would agree that the advantage is on Obama ’s side , even in Florida , where Cuban - Americans — historically the large majority of the Hispanic population — have consistently voted Republican .
But today Latinos in the Sunshine State are much more diverse , as Puerto Rican , Central and South Americans have reduced the Cuban - origin people to minority status .
In addition , second - and third - generation Cuban - Americans do n’t necessarily hold the same anti-Fidel Castro sentiments that pushed their elders into the Republican Party ranks .
For the first time in Florida history , Hispanic Democrats outnumber their Republican counterparts .
The latest polls indicate that Obama and McCain are running head to head , but Latino voters , here as elsewhere , may determine the outcome in this highly coveted state with 27 Electoral College votes .
Moving from the Southeast to the Southwest , Obama appears to have an even better chance to garner Hispanic votes in states such as New Mexico and Colorado .
( California is already a lock for the Democrat , partly because of the Latino vote . )
Yet the Obama campaign realizes it can not take Latino voters for granted , despite their traditional alignment with the Democratic Party in this region .
A Los Angeles Times article recently noted , for example , that 1 in 5 Hispanic voters in New Mexico is still undecided in a state in which the most recent polls show Obama increasing his slim lead over McCain .
In Colorado , by contrast , a recent poll revealed that Latinos are lining up in far greater numbers behind Obama ( 68 percent ) than for McCain ( 26 percent ) .
This low level of support for the Republican candidate is also reflected in a recent Gallup Poll among Hispanic voters across the nation .
Both presidential campaigns have learned that Latinos are not a single - issue electorate .
For example , although an issue such as a kinder and gentler immigration policy reform may motivate more Latinos to join the Obama camp in Colorado or Nevada , this is not necessarily the case in New Mexico , a state that has been far less affected by both legal and undocumented immigration from Mexico .
The conservative tendencies of Latino Catholics on pro-life issues also might draw many to the family values agenda of the Republican Party .
But vital concerns about improving the quality of public education can eclipse other issues and tip them towards Democrats .
Latinos , like Americans across the land , are scared about the looming economic crisis .
As a group , they are more heavily concentrated in the ranks of the working class .
Although the Latino middle class has expanded considerably in recent decades , it is still fragile and subject to enormous downward pressure during economic bad times .
Consequently , I venture to say that the escalating problems of the domestic economy , the loss of jobs and homes , and a growing uncertainty about their well - being will drive masses of Latino voters to Barack Obama .
As critical swing voters , they are poised to give Obama a possible electoral vote landslide victory on Tuesday in several battleground states — “ red ” states they are helping to paint “ blue . ”

Clayton has kindly given us permission to excerpt some information from their monthly RMBS performance newsletter , InFront .
Clayton 's report suggests that we may have now seen the beginning of the end of the subprime meltdown , but we are only at the end of the beginning of the Alt - A wave that is following it .
According to Clayton , subprime delinquencies appear to have peaked in December of 2007 , and subprime foreclosure starts may have peaked in January of 2008 .
The volume of foreclosures in process will remain elevated for a long time as these things work their way through lengthy foreclosure timelines , but the peak in FC starts is good news .
Unfortunately , Alt - A seems nowhere near its peak yet .
Clayton 's report , based on May data , indicates that both new delinquencies and foreclosure starts in Alt - A pools are still rising .
Fannie Mae 's recent conference call suggesting that Alt - A deteriorated even more sharply in July is yet more evidence that the Alt - A mess is still ramping up .
These two charts from Clayton , on subprime and Alt - A ARM resets , tell the same tale .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
When it comes to RMBS , it ’s not about the sheer volume of securities issued ; it ’s about the credit enhancement that exists to protect investors once collateral defaults occur .
And comparing Alt - A issues to subprime , it ’s no contest : Alt - A is so much thinner in its padding for losses that a lower default rate could hurt investors in Alt - A deals far worse than anything we saw in subprime .
The only saving grace here is reach ; because Alt - A deals did n’t yield what subprime did , fewer got pulled into CDO issues .
There are large chunks of Alt - A that did n’t get securitized , but instead were held in portfolio for the interest income benefits : and that would be your option ARMs .
Which means that while mushrooming defaults may not hit RMBS investors , they will hit the loan portfolios of more than a few commercial banks .
Based on remaining active loans , we are at about the peak for subprime rate resets .
However , Alt - A is a different picture :
As Housing Wire reported yesterday : If the " subprime crisis " was about " exotic securities , " the " Alt - A crisis " is going to be about bank balance sheets .
And the fun is only beginning .

Just a few feet in front of me stands a balding , wiry man who wants to kill me .
He snaps at me with a loathsome tone for asking a line of ethical questions about his occupation of slave trader .
Sun -weathered skin cracks around his mouth as he barks " get yer ass out of here if you do n't like it then ! "
I relent and cool him down a bit .
I inform him that I would like to inspect and possibly acquire several of his goods , but I am swiftly denied .
Perhaps he knows of my true intent , to rescue two children who have recently vanished from a neighboring shantytown .
He hints to me that I can gain entrance to his slave pen if I offer him the right sum of caps , which are the legal tender in the Wastelands .
Better yet , giving him a slave from a nearby town might improve my odds .
I question whether I should even continue this harrowing discussion as I eye the road behind me .
I notice a raggedy man in a hockey mask standing behind him , holding a rifle .
I quickly pull out my combat shotgun and literally blow the balding slaver 's head right off .
The grunt in the background raises that shotgun of his , but I put an end to things before he can even pull the trigger .
I have found a more favorable solution and fashioned my own means of entry outside of the dialog tree .
I 'll continue my search for those kids , but first I 'll pick these bodies clean of munitions and rations .
This was my way of doing things in one of the numerous side - quests in Bethesda 's long - awaited and skeptically - approached take on the Fallout franchise , Fallout 3 .
My RPG gaming roots run reasonably deep , beginning with the King 's Quest series back in 1985 .
Countless hours were dedicated to the Baldur 's Gate titles , Ultima , Neverwinter Nights , World of WarCraft , Mass Effect , and , of course , Oblivion .
Despite my love for RPGs , I regrettably missed the Fallout boat when the title first docked 11 years ago .
Nonetheless , like every other RPG lover out there , I have been anticipating the release of Fallout 3 since Bethesda first announced it was working on the title back in 2004 .
Poised to use gameplay elements and upgraded technology from Oblivion , including Gamebryo , Havok , and Speedtree , I could not help but wonder if the team would alter some of the maddening game play elements I felt hindered Oblivion ’s experience .
Previously , enemy skill levels automatically adjusted to match the player , destroying the player 's ability to overpower enemies who once proved difficult .
Or how about enemies repopulating dungeons that were cleared out during a prior quest ?
I felt Oblivion pleading with me to paint all over its huge canvas , but despite my effort , it would inexplicably wipe my work clean .
I want to exist in the world in a way that makes more sense , and that 's what I was hoping for from Fallout 3 .
The only thing more pronounced than the hand - wringing over this title was the hope that it would actually live up to its name .
We 're happy to report that the humor , violence , and open - ended nature of the original games arrived intact .
While most $ 60 games only last eight hours or less , we put 50 hours into the game before writing this review .
Come with us to see what we found .
Sarah Palin speaks to supporters at a rally at in Richmond , Va. , on Monday .
Palin : Obama must ‘ rein in ’ ACORN
Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin suggested Tuesday that Barack Obama shares responsibility for recent reports of voter fraud conducted by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now .
“ Obama has a responsibility to rein in ACORN , ” Palin said during an interview with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh .

Palin said the group is responsible for the “ unconscionable situation we are facing now with voter fraud ” and attacked the Obama campaign for not addressing the problem after the McCain campaign sent a letter to the Democratic camp urging action against voter fraud in September .
Shortly before Palin went on the air , the Obama campaign e-mailed around its response , dated Sept. 23 , characterizing the McCain campaign ’s concern as “ a starkly political maneuver to deflect attention from the reality of the suppression strategies pursued by national , state and Republican Party committees . ”
The community organizing group has been a favorite target of the McCain campaign recently , which frequently points to reports of teenagers , professional athletes and even Mickey Mouse being registered by the group .
The Obama campaign has condemned the reports of voter registration fraud but has called the charges leveled by the McCain campaign “ completely transparent and false . ”
Despite the Obama campaign ’s rebuttal , Palin insisted that there is more to the story than is being reported by major media outlets .
The Alaska governor said that like Obama ’s association to 1960s radical Bill Ayers , there is still “ too much ignorance and ignoring of his association ” with the group .
As much as we all love “ Also sprach Zarathustra , ” the only soundtrack to space travel is probably going to be the low hum of your spaceship ’s engines .

See below for a rather breathtaking " Round - up of Problems Facing Voters Nationwide " , such as registration backlogs , illegal voting roll purges , deceptive practices and dirty tricks , etc. , now plaguing American voters across the country with just 17 days left before our country 's biggest election ever .
All of that , while Fox " News " ( whose asked me to come on live tomorrow , Sunday , at 2:40 pm PT , btw , along with my old friend John Fund " for balance " ) continues to misreport , alarm and deceive their viewers in regard to the GOP 's phony ACORN " voter fraud " fraud .
Unfortunately , it 's not just
Fox who is irresponsibly and dangerously misreporting that scam --- though they seem to have made a small cottage industry out of it of late --- CNN and MSNBC have been filed loads of equally inaccurate and misleading reports on it as well .
But take a look at the " Round - up " below , sent this afternoon via email by the 866 ourvote.org Election Protection coalition of non-partisan election watchdogs .
And keep in mind that their summary below does n't even mention the myriad electronic voting issues we 've been reporting here of late --- touch - screen votes flipping , paper ballot electronic tabulators that can't count correctly or that add thousands of " phantom votes " or that drop thousands of real ones etc. --- cropping up , yet again , across the country ...
STATE OF THE VOTE : 17 DAYS TO GO
A Round -up of Problems Facing Voters Nationwide
Voter registration application backlogs .
The unprecedented registration and get - out - the - vote efforts by both parties , along with the historic nature of this election , promise to elicit a record number of voters on Election Day .
Mountains of new voter registrations are causing backlogs in voter data entry - which partisans are using as reasons to keep these applicants from making it onto the rolls , as we 've just seen in Ohio .
Backlogs often force local election offices to send out verification and polling place information late or not at all .
In Colorado : election officials are struggling to verify thousands of voter registration forms before October 20 when early voting opens .
In Georgia : a week ago , in DeKalb County about 30,000 registrations were sitting in boxes waiting to be entered .
In New York , in Dutchess County , officials are telling voters that if their backlogged registrations are n't processed in time , they should request a court order to vote .
In Alabama , a controversy is raging over who can be registered , contributing to the backlog of requests .
Allegations of voter registration fraud .
The recent controversy over ACORN 's voter registration program emphasizes the critical need for a comprehensive system to handle the quadrennial crush of registration applications .
We currently have effective systems in place for flagging duplicate and ineligible applications , but the burdens created by this deadline - driven process could be eliminated with smart , federal voter registration reform .
Several opinion writers and editorial boards across the country have weighed in on the issue , skeptical of the partisan nature of the allegations .
Many offer a pragmatic approach to dealing with these accusations , including articles in the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , GateHouse News Service and the Baltimore Sun .
No match , no vote .
Under our current patchwork of election laws , each state ( and sometimes each county ) has a different way of comparing voter lists to state databases to make sure rolls are " clean " and updated , These matching requirements could mean that a simple misspelling or misplaced hyphen could knock tens of thousands of eligible voters off the rolls .
In Florida : a controversial " no- match " law has taken effect , calling into question the validity of several thousand voters ' registrations filed after September 8 .
In Ohio : the United States Supreme Court rejected attempts by the Ohio Republican Party to require that Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner provide access to a database of voters whose registration information does not match state records .
The decision protects 200,000 newly registered Ohioans .
The Social Security Administration has sent requests to six states - Alabama , Georgia , Indiana , Nevada , North Carolina and Ohio - asking that they investigate whether improper social security number checks are being run on newly registered voters .
In Arizona , a disabled veteran filed a lawsuit saying he was deprived of his right to vote last year because the military ID he presented did not include his address .
Although he should have been allowed to file a provisional ballot , poll workers forbid him from doing so .
Poorly designed application forms .
About 6,400 new voters in Colorado may not be allowed to cast regular ballots on Election Day because they failed to check a box on a voter registration form .
Voting rights groups have asked the state to accept registration applications that contain all necessary identifying information , but lack a checkmark in a superfluous box .
Currently , the state is considering these applications " incomplete . "
Earlier this month , the Ohio Supreme Court ordered Democratic Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner to reverse her ruling and direct election boards to accept absentee ballots that lacked one checkmark on ballot applications sent from Republican John McCain 's campaign .
Purging .
The true impact of purging legitimate voters from the polls may not be known until people are turned away on Election Day , but we already know of instances where purging is taking place .
For example , in Michigan , a federal judge ordered Secretary of State Terry Lynn Land to restore more than 1,500 Michigan voters to the rolls who were illegally purged based on undeliverable mail or because they applied for a driver 's license in another state .
In Georgia , a coalition of civil rights groups filed a lawsuit against Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel , claiming her office is possibly purging thousands of voters based on challenges to citizenship although federal law prohibits such activity less than 90 days before the election .
Deceptive practices .
Following allegations that a Michigan Republican county chairman said the party will challenge the voting status of homeowners facing foreclosure , officials in Ohio , Maryland , Illinois , Nevada and elsewhere were forced to quickly reassure their constituents that foreclosure does not exclude voters from participating in the election .
In Indiana , Marion County GOP Chairman Tom John said he would not rule out challenging the votes of individuals whose homes had been foreclosed .
Students are also the victims of misinformation and deceptive practices .
Students at Drexel University in Pennsylvania reported seeing flyers around campus that warned students that police would be at the polls on Election Day , arresting anyone with a prior offense , including unpaid parking tickets .
Old Dominion University students registered to vote in Virginia received questionnaires from Norfolk election officials asking for tax , driver 's license and vehicle registration information .
This came on the heels of similar misinformation by the local election board in Blacksburg , which warned that Virginia Tech students could lose scholarships and impact their parents ' tax status if they registered at their campus address .
Lack of standard rules confuse voters .
Georgia residents who mailed in their voter registration applications received official letters that incorrectly stated ID requirements .
These are just a few examples of the many problems facing voters in the days leading up to Election Day .

Conway ’s Game of Life has fascinated computer scientists for decades .
Even though its rules are ridiculously simple , Conway ’s universe gives rise to a variety of gliders , spaceships , oscillators , glider guns , and other forms of “ life ” .
Self - printing programs are similarly curious , and – rather surprisingly – have an important place in the theory of computation .
What happens when you combine the two ?
You are about to find out , but one thing is for sure : the geekiness factor should be pretty high .
I wrote a little C# program that contains a Game - of - Life grid .
The program advances the game grid to the next generation and prints out a copy of itself , with the grid updated .
You can take the output , compile it with a C# compiler , run it , and you ’ll get the next generation of the game .
You can iterate the process , or change the initial grid state manually .
Here is the source code :
using System ; class G /* GAME OF LIFE by Igor Ostrovsky */ { static string [ ]
S={ "############################################################################ " , " # * * # " , " # *** * # " , " # * * # " , " # * * * * # " , " # ** ** ** *** # " , " # * * ** ** # " , " # ** * * ** # " , " # ** * * ** * * # " , " # * * * # " , " # * * # " , " # ** # " , " # ** ** # " , " # ** ** * * # " , " # * * * * * * * # " , " # *** ** ** *** * * # " , " # * * * * * * **** # " , " # *** *** # " , " # # " , " # *** *** # " , " # * * * * * * * # " , " # *** ** ** *** * * * *** # " , " # * * * * * * * * * # " , " # ** ** *** * * ** * # " , " # ** ** **** * # " , " # * * # " , "############################################################################ " , } ; static void Main ( ) { string T= " \ " , r=\" using System ; class G /* GAME OF LIFE b " + "y Igor Ostrovsky \" +\" */ { static string [ ]

\ " " ;p=1; }} foreach ( var c in T ) {r+=c ; if ( ++p%79==0 ) r+= '
' ;} Console .
Write(r ) ;}}
And is here the output the program prints .
The output is the same as the source code , except that the game has advanced to the next generation :

Write(r ) ;}}
If you want to see the program iterate , save the source code into a file named life.cs , and run this command repeatedly from a Visual Studio console :
csc.exe life.cs && ( life > life.cs ) && life

( Part 3 in a 4 - Part Series on Elemental Art Featuring Natural Wonders of the World )
Continuing the quest for the most inspiring and powerful art of nature , here are over 50 images and videos depicting the most spectacular shooting sun flares , unusual fires , shocking lightning , delicate smoke patterns and stunning meteor showers .
All are fierce examples of nature ’s artistic displays for which the price of admission is being in the right place at the right time to have your imagine sparked .
Lightning
These images highlight some of the profoundly beautiful , yet ephemeral artworks created by lightning displays .
Lightning , of course , is simply a discharge of electricity .
Yet it is startling and stunning to behold .
Lightning can strike anywhere .
View the above incredible clips of lightning striking Toronto in 2004 and a personal “ art show ” of lightning at a beach residence ( warning : profanity ) .
( Images via Smeter and pics.ww.com )
Even the most incredible fireworks shows cannot compare to nature ’s own light shows .
Aurora
( Images via Geekologie and Borealis2000 )
The famous “ northern lights ” are a beloved phenomenon that can startle the first time viewer with their haunting hues reminiscent of an impressionist painting or surreal watercolor .
They are created with electrically charged particles ( like electrons ) , directed by the earth ’s magnetic fields , crash into gas atoms .
The result is the aurora flash .
Aurora Borealis
There are actually both northern and southern polar lights .
Aurora , Latin for “ light ” , are most commonly seen in the northern hemisphere ( “ borealis ” for northern , as in the Boreal Forest ) but are also displayed in the southern hemisphere ( “ astralis “ … think Australia ) .
( Image via wikipedia )
The aurora borealis displays are colorful and dynamic , but the aurora astralis are remarkable in their own right , seeming to light up the frigid southern polar expanse with their intense vibrance .
Watch the slideshow below for more incredible images of nature ’s “ paintbrush ” on the skies .
Meteors
( Image via EarthSky )
Meteor showers ( also known as meteor storms or outbursts ) are bits of debris from space that enter the earth ’s atmosphere at extreme speeds .
Hitting the air causes them to vaporize , which leaves the famous spark of light behind – hence the nickname “ shooting star ” .
The Ids Above Us
No , it ’s not your boss ’s selfish demands bellowing from the office upstairs .
The “ ids ” refer to meteor showers that can be seen each month of the year .
Meteors are quite frequent , and usually very small , but some meteor showers are recurrent and well - known for their brilliant shower of blazing artistry .
Perseids
( Images via bazaar99 and Makezine )
The Perseids , in the images and video above , and the Geminids below are most famous , but , for example , the Orionids are coming up on October 21 - 22 .
Geminids
The Geminid meteor shower happened last fall - winter 2007 , but its peak was December 13 - 14 .
Driving a few hours up into the Sierra Nevadas , away from the light pollution and in the sharp cold , and you ’ll see a spectacular art show .
Fireballs
A fireball is an especially bright meteor , typically so bright it is confused for a planet .
The Leonid fireball is one of the most famous in the world .
Fire
( Images via National Geographic and travelalltheworld )
Forest fires that spring up in nature due to weather conditions can wreak phenomenal havoc ; but they can also cleanse the land and at times , create beautiful vistas and memorable images .
Bitterroot Fire Deer
( Image via Beautiful Sensations )
This Bitterroot Fire nearly engulfed two deer .
The image was thought to be Photoshopped but evidence later revealed that it was in fact real .
Wildfires
These stunning portraits show fires from Canada to Alaska to Africa , both during the day and in the stark contrast of night .
Though wildfires can be frightening and destructive , they can also be beneficial , clearing the land for new growth by eliminating underbrush and dead trees .
Native Americans learned by watching nature ’s self - sustaining wisdom ; they would strategically manage forests by periodically burning certain portions .
Firewhirls
( Images via Fire21 , elanso and USDA )
Firewhirls are simply fire tornados .
They ’re often spawned by wild fires , though they can be caused by other elemental conditions .
The look is both eerie and alive – as if made of molten glass .
Sun
Solar Flares
Some solar flares have been large enough to easily wipe out Earth with their heat ; we ’ve luckily been missed and instead can take in the fiery beauty of the sun ’s flares as cosmic art .
Others are powerful enough to make the sun itself quake .
Funny enough , scientists declared the sun in a rather dormant cycle of minimum activity , but the sun became incredibly active in March of this year with a spate of new eruptions , flares and other bursts .
Sun Dogs
A sun dog , or parhelion , is an exceedingly bright spot on a solar halo .
According to wikipedia a sundog “ is an atmospheric optical phenomenon primarily associated with the reflection or refraction of sunlight by small ice crystals making up cirrus or cirrostratus clouds .
Often , two sun dogs can be seen ( one on each side of the sun ) simultaneously . ”
Pretty cool to observe .
Smoke
( Images via Klachak and Frank Notes )
No art about nature ’s fiery art would be complete without a few glimpses at the at times opaque , delicate , complex and swirling beauty of fire ’s dissipation : smoke .

Welcome to Magic Pen .
This fascinating little game displays a delightful plethora of physics principles in action .
The object of Magic Pen -- as in some similar games , like Crayon Physics Deluxe -- is to roll a ball into a goal .
The catch is that you can't touch the ball directly : you can only interact with it by drawing shapes with the mouse .
These shapes then interact with the ball , obeying basic principles of physics .
For example , draw a rock .
The rock then falls due to gravity , collides with the ball , and pushes it towards the goal , which is marked by a flag .
It 's impressive how many different physics concepts are embedded into the software .
It 's not just that objects are affected by gravitational acceleration , which is something pretty commonly seen in computer games and simulations , but they also display a variety of more complex real - world physical behaviors within the simple third - grade - art - project - like environment .
Let 's highlight some of the major physics principles incorporated into the game :
Objects released above the ground accelerate due to the effect of a constant gravitational force .
Objects projected off of a ledge move in a parabolic trajectory under the influence of gravity .
When objects collide they exert equal and opposite forces on each other , in accordance with Newton 's Third Law .
During the collisions , they accelerate according to Newton 's Second Law .
They also display conservation of momentum : the total momentum of the colliding objects is the same before and after impact .
After a collision , objects continue with a constant velocity , adhering to Newton 's First Law of Motion .
Perhaps the most intriguing phenomenon is the way the game demonstrates rotational dynamics .
Elongated objects that are subject to a net torque react with physically accurate angular accelerations .
They even oscillate around a balancing point when disturbed , if the center of gravity remains above the base of the object .
On top of all that , the music creates a pleasant atmosphere that makes Magic Pen an addicting yet Zen - like computer physics experience worth looking into .

A meteoroid around the size of a Smart Car is predicted to burn up in Earth 's atmosphere over Sudan tonight , marking the first time scientists have made such a forecast .
There 's no danger from an object this size , but the burn - up could be spectacular for those who witness it .
" A typical meteor comes from an object the size of a grain of sand , " Gareth Williams of the International Astronomical Union 's Minor Planet Center , which made the prediction , said in a statement Monday .
Objects this size are what cause the nighttime streaks that many people think of as shooting stars .
" This meteor will be a real humdinger in comparison ! "
For perspective , the meteoroid that created Meteor Crater in Arizona was probably 150 feet across .
Astronomers at the Minor Planet Center are among the scientists working to keep track of any potentially dangerous asteroids , known as Near - Earth Objects .
The Center is tasked with collecting all the observations from around the world , checking them , calculating orbits and then disseminating the information .
The small meteoroid was discovered earlier today by the Mt. Lemmon Observatory in Arizona , and quick calculations showed it was headed for Earth .
" We estimate objects this size enter Earth 's atmosphere once every few months , " Don Yeomans of the Near - Earth Object Office at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , said in a statement Monday .
" The unique aspect of this event is that it is the first time we have observed an impacting object during its final approach . "
This will give professional and amateur astronomers alike the chance to catch a close - up view of the event with their telescopes .
The burn , a very bright fireball streaking across the sky , should be visible at 10:46 p.m. EDT from northern Africa , the Middle East and potentially southern Europe .
" We 're eager for observations from astronomers near the asteroid 's approach path , " Williams said .
" We really hope that someone will manage to photograph it . "

En todo 2007 se reportaron 2 mil 673 , cifra que se superó este año desde el 5 de junio
La velocidad alcanzada por la violencia no tiene precedente .
En los últimos 60 días , el promedio de muertos derivados de la lucha contra el crimen organizado es de 16.6 cada 24 horas , un muerto cada 85 minutos .
En este periodo la cifra de víctimas rompió récord , al ocurrir 987 homicidios ; 10 de las víctimas eran menores de edad y 68 ocupaban puestos de mando o eran agentes de las diferentes corporaciones policiacas .
En lo que va del año suman ya 3 mil 4 homicidios .
La cifra de los primeros 2 mil muertos de 2008 , de acuerdo con estadísticas diarias de EL UNIVERSAL , se alcanzó el pasado 4 de julio .
De ahí en adelante , la racha de homicidios ha sido imparable en la mayor parte del país , principalmente en Chihuahua y Sinaloa , entidades que se mantienen a la cabeza .
El pasado agosto ha sido el más violento , con 547 asesinatos .
En 2007 la cifra de fallecidos en hechos ligados a la delincuencia organizada cerró con 2 mil 673 , cifra que se superó este año desde el 5 de junio .
Esta espiral de violencia alcanzó a Yucatán , considerado uno de los cinco estados más seguros del país , y que hasta julio sólo tenía registrados cuatro homicidios .
Sin embargo , el pasado 28 de agosto fueron hallados 12 cuerpos decapitados y con huellas de tortura , 11 en la Comisaría de Chichi Suárez , en Mérida , y otro en el municipio de Buctzótz .
El único antecedente que se tenía de decapitados en serie ocurrió el 6 de septiembre de 2006 , cuando en un bar llamado Sol y Sombra , cercano a la central camionera de Uruapan , Michoacán , varios hombres armados irrumpieron con disparos al aire para someter a los asistentes y luego arrojaron al centro de la pista de baile las cabezas de cinco hombres .
Los cinco días posteriores al hallazgo de los cuerpos cercenados en Yucatán se reportaron más decapitados en el país ; el viernes 22 , en Sonora fueron hallados los cuerpos de tres hombres ; al siguiente día , en Durango dos mujeres fueron degolladas .
El domingo pasado fue hallada la cabeza de un ganadero , que dos días antes había sido levantado , y el lunes un empresario tabasqueño fue decapitado .
De julio a la fecha , cada día se han cometido al menos cinco homicidios , siendo el 18 de agosto el más violento , con 28 .
En lo que va del año , en Chihuahua van mil 194 homicidios ; le sigue Sinaloa como el estado con más violencia , donde suman 567 .
Baja California tiene 168 y Durango 164 .
Ayer , un policía federal y dos presuntos secuestradores murieron en un operativo en Villa Nicolás Romero , estado de México ; en Sinaloa ocurrieron seis homicidios ; ocho más en Chihuahua , dos en Zacatecas y uno en Durango .
De los hombres ultimados en Sinaloa , uno era Juan Carlos de 17 años y se presume vendía drogas .
En hechos diferentes , cinco personas más fueron asesinadas en territorio sinaloense .
Frente a una escuela primaria de Ciudad Jiménez , Chihuahua , fue acribillado a balazos Tomás Beltrán , quien viajaba en una camioneta tipo pick up .
En Ciudad Juárez , la ciudad con más violencia del país , se reportaron tres homicidios ; otros dos tuvieron lugar en Guerrero , donde las víctimas fueron abandonadas en un vehículo Yukon , y dos más en los municipios de Uruachi y Parral .
Dos cadáveres fueron encontrados en Zacatecas y uno más en Durango .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
OP -ED :
In winning over 50 percent of the popular vote , President - elect Barack Obama can claim a popular mandate , but in order to unify the nation and its position abroad he must govern from the center of the American political spectrum .
Doing so will not be easy , as Americans remain divided on many foreign policy concerns and pressure to live up to huge international expectations grows .
Overall , the 2008 election was void of real debate on foreign policy , with both candidates offering more rhetoric than substance .
U.S. foreign policy now requires more realism and results and less rhetoric .
The world today is marked by newly emerging geographical centers of power , particularly in the developing world , coupled by the rise of non-state actors ( such as NGOs , multinational corporations , and terrorist groups ) and newly emerging non-geographical centers of power , particularly virtual centers of power , such as the realm of cyberspace .
Multitasking in a multicentric world remains an absolute priority .
The comparisons between JFK and Mr. Obama are inevitable , but the times are completely different .
Today ’s threats are not just conventional but asymmetric and non-traditional .
Few disagree on the need to upgrade America ’s image abroad but expectations may prove unrealistic , at least for the immediate future .
Mr. Obama ’s international honeymoon is unlikely to last long and America ’s foreign policy challenges will , if anything , only grow more complex .
A key question throughout the campaign was Mr. Obama ’s preparedness in dealing with critical foreign policy challenges , but the status quo begs a broader question , that is , whether America possesses a foreign policy establishment able to deal with the challenges of the 21st century .
Much of it still remains grounded in Cold War mode , and many of its elite struggle to grasp contemporary realities .
The Manichean black - and - white , us - versus - them approach is surprisingly prevalent across the political spectrum , much more than most would like to admit .
In the foreign policy realm , it is essential that President - elect Obama directly engage the American public and bridge the widening gap between elected officials and citizens .
He must explain America ’s challenges analytically and not just rhetorically .
For too long , politicians and media have underestimated the appetite and ability of ordinary Americans to participate in the foreign policy process .
Simply put , it is time to move beyond campaign mode and encounter the foreign policy realities and challenges head on .
This month ’s G - 20 summit to address the global economic crisis in Washington must provide the president - elect with an opportunity to seize the diplomatic initiative two months before his inauguration .
Ultimately , the extent of the president - elect ’s participation in the summit is determined by Mr. Bush .
The demands and dangers of the global economic crisis require statesmanship .
Mr. Bush must rise above the political fray and allow Mr. Obama a significant role and necessary visibility .
It is essential for the president - elect to consolidate and nurture existing relationships , particularly with European allies , and cultivate greater ties with new strategic partners , especially the emerging powers of the developing world .
Forging better relations with states such as Turkey in the broader Middle East , Brazil in Latin America , South Africa and Nigeria in sub-Saharan Africa , will strengthen U.S. interests abroad and are likely to leave a less visible footprint .
Afghanistan not only requires a greater and more efficient allocation of U.S. and allied resources and troops , but convincing European publics of the importance of the international mission .
No matter how committed certain European leaders may be , they are limited in what they can deliver without greater public support .
Mr. Obama must use his new diplomatic capital and goodwill to convince all European leaders and , more importantly , European publics to commit to a long - term presence in Afghanistan .
With respect to Iran , much depends upon the results of Iran ’s presidential election in June and the willingness of the supreme leader to engage in serious talks to reduce tensions and reach an accord , perhaps a comprehensive agreement , that will include the nuclear issue .
In Iraq , realities on the ground will ultimately determine if and when reduction of troops takes place .
Reduction must be based on rational and pragmatic decision - making , together with U.S. military leaders and the Iraqi government , and must not be determined by political convenience and ideological conviction in the United States .
Mr. Obama is inheriting leadership of a global power with immense internal and external challenges .
He must seize this historic opportunity as president of all Americans , and with all Americans , to confront these challenges in a spirit of cooperation at home and collaboration abroad .

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan is determined to defend its territorial integrity , the country ’s foreign minister said on Thursday , as anger mounted over a raid by U.S. - led troops on a remote border village .
The pre-dawn helicopter - borne ground assault on the village of Angor Adda on the Afghan border on Wednesday was the first known incursion into Pakistan by U.S. - led troops since the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 .
Twenty people , including women and children were killed , officials said , and a new civilian government , more sensitive to public anger than the previous government , summoned the U.S. ambassador to lodge an angry protest .
Foreign Minister Shah Memood Qureshi said the raid was a shameful violation of rules of engagement agreed with U.S. - led forces in Afghanistan .
“ We will not compromise on any violation of our sovereignty , ” Qureshi told the National Assembly .
“ We will defend and ... we have a resolve and we have national consensus in Pakistan to defend our territorial integrity , ” he said .
Both houses of parliament later adopted resolutions condemning the attack .
The United States , a major source of aid to nuclear - armed Pakistan , has not officially commented on the raid but there is little , if any , doubt it was carried out by U.S. troops .
The United States says al Qaeda and Taliban militants lurk in sanctuaries in northwest Pakistan ’s ethnic Pashtun tribal areas on the Afghan border , where they orchestrate attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan and plot violence in the West .
Pakistan has been a close U.S. ally in the unpopular campaign against terrorism and has tens of thousands of troops battling militants but it rules out incursions by foreign troops .
There have , however , been numerous missile strikes on militants in Pakistan , most believed launched by U.S. - operated pilotless drone aircraft .
NATO ’s Afghan peacekeeping force , led by a U.S. general , denied involvement .
The United States leads a separate , counter - insurgency force in Afghanistan .
Asked about the raid in South Waziristan , a Pentagon spokesman , Bryan Whitman , said : “ I have nothing for you on those reports . ”
The CIA referred questions to the Pentagon .
“ FURIOUS ”
Analysts said the raid will test ties between the allies .
“ The people of Pakistan are furious , ” said former foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed Khan .
“ At a minimum they want an apology ... and an assurance that this kind of operation will not be repeated ...
It could have an irreparable effect on long - term relations . ”
Since the emergence of a civilian - led government after February elections , there has been growing concern that U.S. military operations were becoming more aggressive .
The number of missile attacks launched by drones has multiplied , and there had been fears U.S. forces would use helicopter gunships or put troops on the ground for “ hot pursuit ” or commando - style raids to destroy al Qaeda nests .
“ This is what Pakistan feared , ” said military affairs analyst Ayesha Siddiqa , adding she expected more U.S. strikes .
“ The government has protested , there will be a lot of anger , but the situation will continue ... the relationship wo n’t break down but there ’s going to be more bitterness . ”
While in the past , the government led by former president Pervez Musharraf could virtually ignore public anger , the civilian government led by the widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto will feel pressure .
Asif Ali Zardari , who looks set to become president in an election by legislators on Saturday , is seen as close to the United States but ordinary Pakistanis , many of whom harbor anti-American feelings , will expect him to take a stand .
Zardari , in a commentary published in the Washington Post , repeated his determination to defeat the Taliban insurgency in Pakistan and ensure that Pakistani territory is not used for attacks into Afghanistan .
He did not mention the raid .
Pakistani military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said such raids risked forcing people into the arms of the militants and inciting an uprising in the tribal lands .
Khan said the raid looked like an act of U.S. desperation : “ They are in election mode and apparently the Bush administration is desperate to score points . ”

A note before beginning .
This article focuses on today ’s financial and economic crisis .
Not affairs of state , war and peace or geopolitics .
No guessing who ’s number one under those headings .
That said :
With so many good choices , it ’s hard just picking one .
But given the gravity of today ’s financial crisis , one name stands out above others .
The “ maestro , ” as Bob Woodward called him in his book by that title .
The “ Temple of Boom ” chairman , according to a New York Times book review .
Standing “ bestride the Fed like a colossus . ”
Now defrocked as the “ maestro ” of misery .
Alan Greenspan .
From August 11 , 1987 to January 31 , 2006 , as head of the private banking cartel euphemistically called the Federal Reserve .
That Ron Paul explains is n’t Federal and has no reserves .
It represents bankers who own it .
Big and powerful ones .
Not the state or public interest .
It prints money .
Controls its supply and price .
Loans it out for profit and charges the government interest it would n’t have to pay if Treasury instead of Federal Reserve notes were issued .
People , as a result , pay more in taxes for debt service .
The nation is more crisis - prone .
Over time they increase in severity .
The current one the most serious since the Great Depression .
Potentially the greatest ever .
The result of Greenspan ’s 18 year irresponsible legacy .
He championed deregulation and presided over an earlier version of today ’s crisis .
The Reagan - era savings and loan fraud .
It bankrupted 2200 banks .
Cost taxpayers around $ 200 billion and for many people their savings in S & Ls they thought safe .
In the 1990s , he engineered the largest ever stock market bubble and bust in history through incompetence , subservience to Wall Street , and dereliction of duty .
In January 2000 , weeks short of the market peak , he claimed that “ the American economy was experiencing a once - in - a - century acceleration of innovation , which propelled forward productivity , output , corporate profits , and stock prices at a pace not seen in generations , if ever … .
Lofty stock prices have reduced the cost of capital .
The result has been a veritable explosion of spending on high - tech equipment … .
And I see nothing to suggest that these opportunities will peter out anytime soon ….
Indeed many argue that the pace of innovation will continue to quicken …. to exploit the still largely untapped potential for e-commerce , especially the business - to - business arena . ”
A week later , the Nasdaq peaked at 5048 .
Lost 78 % of its value by October 2002 .
The S&P 500 49 % from its March 2000 high to its October 2002 bottom .
Individual investors were left high and dry as a result .
For Mr. Greenspan , it was back to engineering multiple bubbles with 1 % interest rates and a tsunami of easy money .
He advocated less regulation , not more .
Voluntary oversight .
The idea that markets work best so let them .
Government intervention as the problem , not the solution .
In the mid-1990s , he told a congressional committee :
“ Risks in financial markets , including derivative markets , are being regulated by private parties .
There is nothing involved in federal regulation per se which makes it superior to market regulation . ”
On October 23 before the House Government Oversight and Reform committee , he refused to accept blame for the current crisis , but softened his tone and admitted a “ flaw ” in his ideology .
Confessed his faith in deregulation was shaken .
Said he was in a “ state of shocked disbelief . ”
Unclear on what went wrong .
Not sure “ how significant or permanent it is , ” and added :
— “ We are in the midst of a once - in - a century credit tsunami ( requiring ) unprecedented measures ; ”
— “ This crisis has turned out to be much broader than anything I could have imagined ; ”
— “ fears of insolvency are now paramount ; ”
— significant layoffs and unemployment are ahead ;
— a “ marked retrenchment of consumer spending ” as well ;
— containing the crisis is conditional on stabilizing home prices ;
— at best , it ’s “ still many months in the future ; ”
What went wrong with policies that “ worked so effectively for nearly four decades , ” he asked ?
Securitizing home mortgages .
“ Excess demand ” for them , and failure to properly price them he answered .
Unmentioned was unbridled greed .
The greatest ever fraud .
No oversight , and a predictable crisis only surprising in its magnitude and how it grew to unmanageable severity .
Greenspan is now softening on regulation but barely enough to matter .
Too little , too late by any standard , and only to restore stability after which chastened investors “ will be exceptionally cautious . ”
In the end , in his view , “ This crisis will pass , and America will reemerge with a far sounder financial system . ”
Until another Fed chairman repeats his mistakes .
Creates a crisis too big to contain .
Destroys unfettered capitalism as we know it .
Changes the world irrevocably as a consequence .
Unless this time is the big one and does it sooner .
In March 1999 , Greenspan was optimistic at the end of a robust decade ( that James Petras calls “ the golden age of pillage ” ) with no worries about new millennium meltdowns .
He addressed the Futures Industry Association and said it would be “ a major mistake ” to increase rules on how banks assess risks when they use derivatives .
He added : “ By far the most significant event in finance during the past decade has been the extraordinary development and expansion of financial derivatives . ”
By a compounded 20 % rate throughout the decade .
Around 30 % alone by banks in 1998 .
And , according to Greenspan , “ The reason that ( derivatives ) growth has continued despite adversity , or perhaps because of it , is that these new financial instruments are an increasingly important vehicle for unbundling risk ….
the value added of derivatives themselves derives from their ability to enhance the process of wealth creation ( and ) one counterparty ’s market loss is the ( other ’s ) gain . ”
Overall , they ’ve increased the standard of living of people globally , he claimed .
In fact , they contributed to global crises in the 1990s .
Hot money in , and meltdowns when it exited .
The problem is derivatives work well in bull markets , but are disastrous when they ’re down .
Going up they do nothing for ordinary people , but during downturns receding tides sink all boats and all in them and are n’t the zero sum game Greenspan suggested .
Worst of all are so - called credit default swaps ( CDSs ) .
The most widely traded credit derivative .
In the tens of trillions of dollars .
A $ 43 trillion market , according to PIMCO ’s Bill Gross .
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association ( ISDA ) estimates it at $ 54.6 trillion .
Down from $ 62 trillion at yearend 2007 .
Others place it higher , but key is what they are and how they ’re used .
They resemble insurance ( on risky mortgages ) , but , in fact , are for little more than casino - type gambling .
Unregulated with no transparency in the shadow banking system that dwarfs the traditional one in size and risk .
Gross describes it this way .
It “ craftily dodges the reserve requirements of traditional institutions and promotes a chain letter , pyramid scheme of leverage , based in many cases on no reserve cushion whatsoever . ”
CDSs are at the center of shadow banking , and Gross and others warn about possible financial Armageddon if things begin collapsing .
A “ Cheerleader for Imprudence ”
That , according to James Grant , editor of Grant ’s Interest Rate Observer .
Greenspan ’s “ biggest mistake was inciting people to do imprudent things . ”
He called him “ marble - mouthed ” for his “ Greenspeak ” and not simply admitting he “ was as blind as those ( he ) pretended to lead .
This sense of security that people invested in the idea of perfect control by an all - knowing brain at the top , that idea ’s been shattered . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In July , Grant was outspoken in a Wall Street Journal op - ed titled “ Why No Outrage ? ”
He quoted Mary Elizabeth Lease from the Populist era haranguing farmers to “ raise less corn and more hell . ”
He asked why today ’s financial victims are n’t protesting Fed policy “ of showering dollars on the ( monied ) people who would seem to ( least ) need them . ”
Where are the “ uncounted improvident ? ”
Have they “ not suffered ( enough ) at the hands of what used to be called The Interests ?
Have the stewards of other people ’s money not made a hash of high finance ?
Where is the people ’s wrath ? ”
In the wake of the “ greatest ( ever ) failure of ratings and risk management . ”
Greenspan ’s
Fed cut interest rates to 1 % .
“ House prices levitated as mortgage underwriting standards collapsed . ”
He claimed earlier that property appreciation was a sign of prosperity and a strong economy and “ while home prices do on occasion decline , large declines are rare . ”
Most homeowners experience “ a modest but persistent rise in home values that is perceived to be largely permanent . ”
Especially , according to Grant , at a time that “ credit markets went into speculative orbit , and an idea took hold .
Risk ….was yesterday ’s problem . ”
It led to “ one of the wildest chapters in the history of lending and borrowing . ”
As a consequence , an $ 8 trillion home valuation wealth bubble and an unprecedented oversupply of unsold properties .
Now in even more oversupply as owners default .
Are foreclosed on or simply walk away from unaffordable underwater assets .
They sit empty with no one to buy them except for those able in distressed sales .
The whole episode criminal and avoidable had the Fed used its authority under the 1994 Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act .
It authorized the central bank to monitor abuses and intervene , if necessary , to prevent abusive lender practices .
It failed to do it .
The result was predictable .
People and the economy in crisis .
Greenspan orchestrated it .
His successor Bernanke did nothing to curb it .
Wall Street was on a roll until it crashed .
Huey Long once compared JD Rockefeller to “ the fat guy who ruins a good barbecue by taking too much . ”
Wall Street thrives on it .
Fed largesse enables it .
The problem is their indigestion affects everyone .
A stomachache spreading round the world .
How bad it ’ll get and where it stops nobody knows .
Blame it on Greenspan .
Our “ former clairvoyant , ” according to Grant .
The New York Times – Uncharacteristically Critical
Usually a “ free - market ” cheerleader , even The New York Times voiced criticism .
In an October 8 Peter Goodman article titled “ Taking Hard New Look at a Greenspan Legacy . ”
It quoted him in 2004 saying : “ Not only have individual financial institutions become less vulnerable to shocks from underlying risk factors , but also the financial system as a whole has become more resilient . ”
As already explained , he abhorred regulation and championed derivatives .
The latter what investor George Soros wo n’t touch “ because we do n’t really understand how they work . ”
What long - time investment banker Felix Rohatyn calls potential “ hydrogen bombs . ”
What Warren Buffett describes as financial “ weapons of mass destruction . ”
What Alan Greenspan thought regulating would be a huge mistake and even today his faith in these instruments remains unshaken .
Others see things differently “ and the role that Mr. Greenspan played in setting up ( the current ) unrest . ”
Law professor Frank Partnoy says “ derivatives are a centerpiece of the crisis . ”
Given their purchased market value in the hundreds of trillions of dollars .
Up from a fraction of that years back .
The fact that much of it is toxic junk , and the fear that writing enough off will bankrupt their holders and send shock waves through world economies .
They ’re already being felt .
Especially in emerging markets .
None of this should have happened .
“ If Mr. Greenspan had acted differently during his tenure as Federal Reserve chairman , many economists say , the current crisis might have been averted or muted .
Over the years , Mr. Greenspan helped enable an ambitious American experiment in letting market forces run free .
Now , the nation is confronting the consequences . ”
It was argued throughout the 1990s “ that derivatives had become so vast , intertwined and inscrutable that they required federal oversight to protect the financial system . ”
Even so , “ Mr. Greenspan banked on the good will of Wall Street to self - regulate as he fended off ( suggestions of ) restrictions . ”
As the housing bubble burst and prices began collapsing , “ Mr. Greenspan ’s record has been up for revision .
Economists from across the ideological spectrum have criticized his decision to let the nation ’s real estate market continue to boom with cheap credit , courtesy of low interest rates , rather than snuffing out price increases with higher rates . ”
He championed adjustable rate mortgages and ignored the clear fraud from subprime ones .
In a 2004 speech , he said that “ American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed - rate mortgage . ”
He , in fact , endorsed the type abuses and the housing bubble they produced that Fed action should have prevented .
It will be a chapter in his legacy .
Along with “ the spectacular boom and calamitous bust in derivatives trading . ”
He declined a Times interview request and referred instead to his record in his memoir , “ The Age of Turbulence . ”
In it , he stated that it ’s “ superfluous to constrain trading in some of the newer derivatives and other innovative financial contracts of the past decade . ”
Instead he “ preached the transcendent , wealth - creating powers of the market . ”
Not for Main Street .
For Wall Street .
What a friend of this writer calls “ laissez - unfair . ”
Despite convincing evidence to the contrary , he claimed markets are best able to handle risks .
Former Fed vice - chairman Alan Blinder said “ Proposals to bring even minimalist regulation were basically rebuffed by Greenspan and various people in the Treasury .
I think of him as consistently cheerleading on derivatives . ”
In congressional testimony , he claimed the potential for serious crisis “ extremely remote ” and dismissively suggested that “ risk is part of life . ”
He also warned that too many rules would damage Wall Street and prompt traders to do business overseas .
Until the present , every debacle under him was resolved ( enough at least ) and markets stabilized and advanced .
He got credit for his “ steady hand at the Fed , ” and former Senator Phil Gramm said “ You will go down down as the greatest chairman in the history of the Federal Reserve Bank . ”
That comment may go down as the greatest misstatement in the history of the Senate .
This is the same Phil Gramm behind the 1999 Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act that repealed ( 1933 enacted ) Glass - Steagall .
It let commercial and investment banks and insurance companies combine and opened the door to rampant speculation , fraud and abuse .

Bloomberg is reporting Argentina Default Looms as Pension Funds Seizure Roils Markets
Argentina 's planned seizure of $ 29 billion of private pension funds stoked concern the nation is headed for its second default in a decade .
Investors say President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 's decision may further hurt markets already reeling from slumping commodity prices and slower growth .
The retirement system , set up in 1994 to help bolster capital markets , owns about 5 percent of companies listed on the Buenos Aires stock exchange and 27 percent of shares available for public trading , data compiled by pension funds show .
Argentine bond yields soared above 24 percent before the announcement late yesterday , and the benchmark Merval stock index tumbled 11 percent .
The last time the government sought to tap workers ' savings to help finance debt payments was in 2001 , just before it stopped servicing $ 95 billion of obligations .
" It 's the final of many nails in the coffin from an institutional investor perspective , " Bill Rudman , who helps manage $ 3 billion of emerging - market equity at WestLB Mellon Asset Management in London .
Argentina is " disappearing into irrelevance . "
Bond markets also have tumbled .
Yields on the government 's 8.28 percent bonds due in 2033 have almost tripled to 24.69 percent from 8.83 percent a year ago .
Double Default
" It 's horrible , " said Jaime Valdivia , who manages $ 1 billion of assets for Emerging Sovereign Group in New York .
" We 're going back to the dark ages .
Not even in times of the worst financial stress did the government ever think about taking over the private pension system . "
During first period , they arrive late or fall asleep at their desks – if they are there at all .
Schools have been known to avoid scheduling math classes early on because students are still bleary - eyed .
In fact , one Toronto collegiate looked at its data and found just how tough the early hours are for teens :
From attendance to punctuality , test scores to credits earned , period one is by far the worst .
In a unique pilot project , that school – Eastern Commerce – will next fall shift its entire school day so classes start at 10 a.m. , about one hour later than secondary students across the city , and close at 4:13 p.m .
It 's giving nod to the latest research showing once puberty hits , the brain is wired to go to bed late and sleep in .
" There are two main points to this , the first being the adolescent brain and the second , optimal learning time , which is late morning , " says Principal Sam Miceli .
Add to that two other facts :
More than 80 per cent of Eastern 's 500 students live outside the area and may face long commutes ; others have part - time jobs working every night – some even work overnights as cleaners – making money their families depend on .
" We are being responsive to the best research on how students learn , " said local Trustee Cathy Dandy , who came up with the idea for a late - start school .
" We also have to work with the realities in 21st century Toronto . "
Teens need roughly nine hours of sleep per night , although almost three - quarters of them do n't get nearly that much .
At puberty to about age 20 , the chemical that helps induce sleep is secreted later at night , around 11 p.m. , and turns off later in the morning , around 8 a.m .
Watching TV or being on the computer at night also delays sleep .
In the U.S. , studies on the handful of late - start schools report less student depression , fewer dropouts , less absenteeism and better test scores and grades – although a late start there is often 8:30 or 9 a.m .
Closer to home , in York Region , Huron Heights secondary in Newmarket begins at 9:20 a.m. , in part because of brain research but also to accommodate busing schedules .
Dr. Judith Owens of Brown University in Rhode Island , who researches delayed - start schools , says 10 a.m. is the latest she 's heard of .
However , she adds , it 's key to educate parents , teachers and especially teens on the importance of sleep so students resist the temptation to stay up later knowing they do have extra time in the morning .
Eastern has already begun to do so .
" The ( Toronto ) board is trying to identify programs that meet the diverse needs of our students , " said Gerry Connelly , the board 's director of education .
If successful , she says the model could be expanded to other schools .
However , one trustee , Josh Matlow , says he's not sure this is best for students and would like the move to be debated by the board .
Eastern Commerce , just steps from the Donlands subway station , offers specialty business courses and has a top - ranked basketball program for both boys and girls .
It draws students from across Greater Toronto and even Mississauga .
The school has consulted with teachers , parents and students on the changes , addressing their concerns about the shortened lunch period , and about the 4:13 p.m. dismissal , which could interfere with jobs and pose safety issues in the winter when it gets dark early .
Dandy and superintendent Jill Worthy say student achievement and attendance under the new system will be tracked for at least two years to see if it 's making a difference .
While the school 's student council still has some serious concerns with the idea , members do agree it will be better for some .
" I think people who come from far away should have the fair start that we have without killing themselves , " says Nicole Lecka , a Grade 12 student who lives close to the school .
She works at the Eaton Centre , starting at 4 p.m. almost every day , so the new schedule would n't work for her – although she wo n't be back next fall .
She also thinks the 45 - minute lunch hour is much too short – right now , she uses the current 65 minutes to finish up homework .
Fitzroy Thompson , 18 , does n't think the new start prepares students for university .

But there 's one bonus :
With classes slightly longer Monday to Thursday , students will be dismissed at 2:31 p.m. on Fridays .
The shortened day also gives Muslim students , who comprise one - third of the school 's population , time to attend Friday prayers without having to miss classes .
To accommodate the shortened lunch hour and to keep students on school property , the school is offering a free lunch program .
The new schedule is not about going easy on teens or indulging them , says Mergim Shena , who heads Eastern 's co-op program .
" We are still starting on time " and students are expected to be punctual , he said .
But the extra time will help .
Right now , " students are on their way to school , they 're looking at their watch and they 're already stressed out , " he said .
" What a terrible way to start the day . "
He liked the idea of the late start " from the word go " as did a majority of his colleagues .
" We as teachers are caught between a rock and a hard place .
We want to teach students about punctuality but we do n't want to turn them away when they arrive late , " he said .
" Even if they are here , they are n't necessarily alert .
Some work to 2 a.m . "
Wayne Erdman , the school 's math department head , said at first he opposed the late start .
" I think we have to teach kids punctuality , " he said , but was convinced once he saw the research on teens and sleep .
He said sports practices will still be in the morning – possibly later than they are now – and athletes will miss class for afternoon games , as they already do .
Parent Hanif
Shaikh , whose son Hamza is in Grade 11 , said at first he had mixed feelings :
While it will benefit student sleep and learning , he worries they 'll just stay up an hour later .
But overall , " it will be very positive , " he said .
Also , as president of the nearby mosque , he 's pleased Muslim students will have time to pray .
" What 's happening is that kids are signing out and either not coming to the mosque or they might be leaving an important class , " he says .
" Now they can fulfill their obligation without missing class . "

In last week ’s presidential debate , Democrat Senator Barack Obama declared his intention to link energy and the environment to the solutions that will help us out of our current economic mess .
Kate Sheppard reports at Grist that Barack Obama has expanded on how and why he will continue to focus on energy , despite the current economic downturn .
At a campaign stop in Reno , Nevada , Obama said that in light of the current economic situation , some portions of any platform would have to be pared , simply because there is less money flowing into the Treasury .
But he also said other programs are critical components of an economic recovery , and should not be abandoned .
Obama said :
“ To create new jobs , I ’ll invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure — our roads , schools , and bridges .
We ’ll rebuild our outdated electricity grid and build new broadband lines to connect America .
And I ’ll create the jobs of the future by transforming our energy economy .
We ’ll tap our natural - gas reserves , invest in clean coal technology , and find ways to safely harness nuclear power .
I ’ll help our auto companies re-tool so that the fuel - efficient cars of the future are built right here the United States of America .
I ’ll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars .
And I ’ll invest $ 150 billion over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy — wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels — an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and ca n’t ever be outsourced . ”

Britain 's security agencies and police would be given unprecedented and legally binding powers to ban the media from reporting matters of national security , under proposals being discussed in Whitehall .
The Intelligence and Security Committee , the parliamentary watchdog of the intelligence and security agencies which has a cross-party membership from both Houses , wants to press ministers to introduce legislation that would prevent news outlets from reporting stories deemed by the Government to be against the interests of national security .
The committee also wants to censor reporting of police operations that are deemed to have implications for national security .
The ISC is to recommend in its next report , out at the end of the year , that a commission be set up to look into its plans , according to senior Whitehall sources .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The ISC holds huge clout within Whitehall .
It receives secret briefings from MI5 , MI6 and GCHQ and is highly influential in forming government policy .
Kim Howells , a respected former Foreign Office minister , was recently appointed its chairman .
Under the existing voluntary code of conduct , known as the DA - Notice system , the Government can request that the media does not report a story .
However , the committee 's members are particularly worried about leaks , which , they believe , could derail investigations and the reporting of which needs to be banned by legislation .
Civil liberties groups say these restrictions would be " very dangerous " and " damaging for public accountability " .
They also point out that censoring journalists when the leaks come from officials is unjustified .
But the committee , in its last annual report , has already signalled its intention to press for changes .
It states : " The current system for handling national security information through DA - Notices and the [ intelligence and security ] Agencies ' relationship with the media more generally , is not working as effectively as it might and this is putting lives at risk . "
According to senior Whitehall sources the ISC is likely to advocate tighter controls on the DA - Notice system – formerly known as D - Notice – which operates in co-operation and consultation between the Government and the media .
The committee has focused on one particular case to highlight its concern : an Islamist plot to kidnap and murder a British serviceman in 2007 , during which reporters were tipped off about the imminent arrest of suspects in Birmingham , a security operation known as " Gamble " .
The staff in the office of the then home secretary , John Reid , and the local police were among those accused of being responsible – charges they denied .
An investigation by Scotland Yard failed to find the source of the leak .
The then director general of MI5 , Dame Eliza Manningham - Buller , was among those who complained to the ISC .
" We were very angry , but it is not clear who we should be angry with , that most of the story of the arrests in Op Gamble were in the media very , very fast ...
So the case was potentially jeopardised by the exposure of what the story was .
My officers and the police were jeopardised by them being on operations when the story broke .
The strategy of the police for interrogating those arrested was blown out of the water , and my staff felt pretty depressed ... that this has happened . "
The ISC report said the DA - Notice system " provides advice and guidance to the media about defence and counter - terrorism information , whilst the system is voluntary , has no legal authority , and the final responsibility for deciding whether or not to publish rests solely with the editor or publisher concerned .
The system has been effective in the past .
However , the Cabinet Secretary told us ... this is no longer the case : ' I think we have problems now . ' "
The human rights lawyer Louise Christian said : " This would be a very dangerous development .
We need media scrutiny for public accountability .
We can see this from the example , for instance , of the PhD student in Nottingham who was banged up for six days without charge because he downloaded something from the internet for his thesis .
The only reason this came to light was because of the media attention to the case . "
A spokesman for the human rights group Liberty said : " There is a difficult balance between protecting integrity and keeping the public properly informed .
Any extension of the DA - Notice scheme requires a more open parliamentary debate . "
DA - Notice : a gagging by consent
The D - Notice system was set up in 1912 when the War Office ( the Ministry of Defence in its previous incarnation ) began issuing censorship orders to newspapers on stories involving national security .
In 1993 it became known as a DA - Notice with four senior civil servants , with an eminent military figure as secretary , and 13 members nominated by the media to form the Defence Press and Broadcasting Advisory Committee .
Contrary to popular conception DA - Notices are a request and not legally enforceable .
Civil servants fear making the agreement legally binding would lead to hostility from the media .
There would be apprehension among journalists about new restrictions , as the committee has in recent times been robust in resisting pressure from the Government to send DA - Notices if it thinks the motives are political .
At present most DA - Notices are issued regarding military missions , anti-terrorist operations at home and espionage .
Chinese exports have been a key driver of the economy China 's economic growth rate has fallen for the third quarter in succession , amid fears that the economy could be heading for a severe downturn .
The National Bureau of Statistics said the economy had grown at a rate of 9 % in the three months to September - down from 10.1 % over the previous quarter .
Spokesman Li Xiaochao said the impact of the global financial crisis had far exceeded the government 's expectations .
Meanwhile shares rose in Asia .
Japan 's Nikkei index ended the day up 3.59 % .
Share values also rose in Hong Kong , Australia , and South Korea .
No signs of recovery '
The third quarter growth rate announced on Monday marked a significant fall from the 10.4 % growth of the first half of 2008 , and the 12.2 % growth seen in the first three quarters of 2007 .
" There are no signs of a definite recovery from the financial crisis , " statistics bureau spokesman Li Xiaochao told a news conference .
Export growth is slowing , and some companies are running into trouble
Li Xiaochao
National Bureau of Statistics
" The growth rate of the world economy has slowed down noticeably .
There are more uncertain and volatile factors in the international economic climate , " he said .
" All these factors have started to release their negative impact on China 's economy . "
Correspondents say indicators from steel prices to housing sales suggest a severe economic slowdown could be in prospect .
Chinese factories are reporting that export orders are down sharply .
Last week , the government said that half the country 's toymakers had gone out of business .
Mr Li said the government had initiated timely measures to deal with the economic slowdown and cushion the impact from the global credit crisis , including falling exports and a restricted credit supply .
These included changing its focus from preventing the overheating of the economy and preventing structural inflation to the " preserving growth " and " controlling " inflation , he added .
Officials said over the weekend that the government was preparing to announce tax cuts and increased infrastructure investment .

So as I said in the previous post , I ’ve started taking interest in making real drawings using just CSS .
This had led me to create a parrot , which is made purely in CSS .
It consists only of axis - aligned right - triangles , and so can be articulated using only DIVs and borders .
Go see the parrot !
And be sure to have a glimpse at the source .
Note it wo n’t work in IE6.0 , but should work on any real web browser ( IE7 , FF2 + , Opera , etc. ) .
Special thanks goes to ragestorm .
net for hosting my page ( WordPress.com wo n’t allow it ) .
It ’s also an interesting website for programmers , so check it out .
On Drawing the Parrot
I produced the parrot from this picture .
Drawing the parrot was in many ways a puzzle .
Since I could only use axis - aligned right - triangles , I had to figure out how to produce many basic shapes .
I tried to keep the count of the triangles low — I could just as well get a program to produce a pixel - by - pixel copy of the parrot — but what I wanted was a rough sketch that browsers can download and draw quickly .
The beak was paricularly challenging .
I wanted to make a convincing curve , without using too many angles .
The lighting on the beak helped me get a good effect with very few triangles ( considering ) .
I had a constant battle between detailing and using few triangles .
I used creative superimposing to create several details with the same triangle .
In a “ blurry ” picture , detail represents focus .
I left the origin of the wing undetailed on purpose .
I did n’t want it to draw attention from what I think are the main features of the image : the face and the tip of the wing ( I now regret detailing the stand so much ) .
What I found curious in the process of drawing it , is that there seemed to be a certain order of drawing which was right to follow .
Because it ’s made of layers on top of layers , the drawing order is affected by the z - placement .
In what way – depends on your method .
I found it easier — in the parrot ’s case — to draw the top - level triangles first , and background triangles last .
Deciding which details fit in and which do n’t , was a completely artistic choice .
You ’ll notice the legs are rather blurry in that aspect .
In the original image you could see the leg in much more detail , and also a hint of another leg .
I thought it ’s not really relevant to the Big Picture .
However , the little yellowish strip on the wing I not only drew , but even emphasized it .
I thought it adds realism to an otherwise rather abstract body .
Comments and ideas are welcome .
I ’m also planning on making another drawing , so if you have a picture which you think I should reproduce , I ’d be happy to consider it .

WASHINGTON , June 17 ( Reuters ) - Republican John McCain 's camp accused Democratic presidential rival Barack Obama on Tuesday of being weak on terrorism , drawing a sharp rebuke from Obama on the politically charged issue of how to deal with Islamic extremists .
In an exchange reminiscent of the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign , McCain 's advisers pounced on Obama for saying terrorism suspects could be treated as criminals " within the constraints of the Constitution . "
They said his comments reflected a dangerous failure to understand the threat posed by terrorism .
" We have seen that Senator Obama is a perfect manifestation of a September 10th mindset , " McCain adviser Randy Schuenemann said .
The comment echoed Karl Rove , the former political adviser to President George W. Bush , who in 2006 accused Democrats of a " pre-9/11 " world view .
" He brings the attitude , the failures of judgment , the weakness and the misunderstanding of the nature of our adversaries , " Schuenemann said .
The Illinois senator quickly fired back , saying Republicans had little standing to criticize him on the issue .
" These are the same guys who helped engineer the distraction of the war in Iraq at a time when we could have pinned down the people who actually committed 9/11 , " Obama said on his campaign plane .
" What they 're trying to do is to do what they 've done every election cycle , which is to use terrorism as a club to make the American people afraid , " Obama said .
McCain and Obama will face off in November 's presidential election .
McCain , a former Navy pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war , has stressed national security and tried to paint Obama as too inexperienced to be trusted as commander in chief .
ECHO OF 2004
In the 2004 campaign , Bush questioned Democrat John Kerry 's approach to battling terrorism and accused him of being soft on the issue because he said he would treat terrorists as regular criminals .
Obama set off the exchange in an ABC News interview on Monday night , when he contrasted the indefinite detention of Guantanamo Bay detainees with the criminal prosecution of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers .
" Let 's take the example of Guantanamo .
What we know is that in previous terrorist attacks , for example , the first attack against the World Trade Center , we were able to arrest those responsible , put them on trial .
They are currently in U.S. prisons , incapacitated , " Obama said in the interview .
" And the fact that the administration has not tried to do that has created a situation where not only have we never actually put many of these folks on trial , but we have destroyed our credibility when it comes to rule of law all around the world , " he said .
The campaigns sponsored dueling conference calls with advisers from each side trading accusations on the issue .
Kerry participated in the Obama call and said McCain was " the candidate of the Iraq war mindset , a mindset that completely misunderstands and dangerously underestimates the threats of the 21st century . "
Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani , who won a reputation for strong leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks in the city , said in a statement Obama " appears to believe that terrorists should be treated like criminals -- a belief that underscores his fundamental lack of judgment regarding our national security . "
Obama said the Republican strategies of 2004 would not work in 2008 .
" I 'm looking forward to having a robust argument about these situations , " he said .
" I do n't shy away from it .
The way these issues have been framed have done a great disservice to America . "

Australians will be unable to opt- out of the government ’s pending Internet content filtering scheme , and will instead be placed on a watered - down blacklist , experts say .
Under the government ’s $ 125.8 million Plan for Cyber - Safety , users can switch between two blacklists which block content inappropriate for children , and a separate list which blocks illegal material .
Pundits say consumers have been lulled into believing the opt - out proviso would remove content filtering altogether .
The government will iron - out policy and implementation of the Internet content filtering software following an upcoming trial of the technology , according to the Department of Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy .
A spokesman for Communications Minister Stephen Conroy said the filters will be mandatory for all Australians .

With digital distribution becoming more and more prominent , online stores hawking downloadable games are a dime a dozen .
But standing out from the pack is a new site called Good Old Games that focuses on bringing old , time - tested games into the downloadable era with low prices and no DRM .
Though the service , currently in beta , is still young , it already shows signs of being a big deal for PC gamers .
Drawing from a pool of Interplay and Codemasters Windows classics , GOG currently features the likes of Fallout , Fallout 2 , Freespace , Giants : Citizen Kabuto , Descent , and many more .
The site updates every Tuesday with a handful of new titles , and there are more games due " soon , " including Soldiers : Heroes of World War 2 , Operation Flashpoint , and Colin McRae Rally 2005 .
Prices on the classics currently range from $ 5.99 for games like Fallout 2 to $ 9.99 for games like Perimeter .
Weekly sales bring down the prices on some of the old games , as well .
The true selling point here , though , is that all of the games are completely DRM free and available by direct download through the site .
Users can access their purchased games list just by logging into the site and they are free to re-download the game files , manual , and even other tasty bits like stand - alone game soundtracks , desktop wallpapers , and more — all without having to download a special download client or install any invasive software .

In addition , the team at GOG has put much time into ensuring the old classics play on new computers .
Working with groups like DOSBox to pack a powerful DOS emulator into games that require it and offering Audiere for high - level audio APIs , the GOG team has ensured that your old PC favorites play as you remember them on your fancy new gaming rig .
A game profile , with ratings , reviews , and requirements ( click for a better look )
For a small upstart , the actual website itself is surprisingly polished and sharp - looking in its beta form .
Games can be sorted by a number of criteria , including price , publisher , rating , genre , and so forth .
Best sellers for the week are made prominent on the store section , as are sales and recommendations based on your purchasing habits .
Account information is kept to a relative minimum , and credit card information is n't stored through sessions .
Payment options are currently limited to Visa and Mastercard .

The site also features a relatively large , though currently quiet , community section .
Games can be rated and reviewed by GOG users and rewards are handed out to contributing users .
Moreover , each game in the library has a forum where players can discuss the title , find modding information , and organize multiplayer matches .
The helpful team has already posted a number of how - to guides and modding links for players diving into old titles for the first time .
In an age of increasing amounts of invasive DRM , the GOG store look like a dream for PC gamers .
Most of these games are impossible to find on store shelves these days , and GOG has made some PC staples available at reasonable prices with no DRM .
With an expanding library , a support staff already hard at work building a strong community even in the early beta stages , and some excellent policies , Good Old Games is a stand - out new portal for our favorite games of yore .

Team Bush Paid Millions to Nathan Sproul -- and Tried to Hide It
RNC VOTE FRAUD ?
Team Bush Paid Millions to Nathan Sproul — and Tried to Hide It by Mark Crispin Miller and Jared Irmas
All the payments by the RNC to Sproul add up to a whopping $ 8,359,161 .
Where did all that money come from ?
Why did the RNC suppress their real expenditures ?
And what exactly did Sproul do for all that pay ?
I n the months before the 2004 presidential election , a firm called Sproul & Associates launched voter registration drives in at least eight states , most of them swing states .
The group -- run by Nathan Sproul , former head of the Arizona Christian Coalition and the Arizona Republican Party - - had been hired by the Republican National Committee .
Sproul got into a bit of trouble last fall when , in certain states , it came out that the firm was playing dirty tricks in order to suppress the Democratic vote : concealing their partisan agenda , tricking Democrats into registering as Republicans , surreptitiously re-registering Democrats and Independents as Republicans , and shredding Democratic registration forms .
The scandal got a moderate amount of local coverage in some states -- and then the election was over .
Now anyone who brought up Nathan Sproul , or any of the other massive crimes and improprieties committed on or prior to Election Day , was shrugged off as a dealer in " conspiracy theory . "
It seems that Sproul did quite a lot of work for the Republicans .
Exactly how much did he do ?
More specifically , how much did the RNC pay Sproul & Associates ?
If you went online last week to look up how much money Sproul received from the Republicans in 2004 , you would have found that , according to the party ( whose figures had been posted by the Center for Responsive Politics ) , the firm was paid $ 488,957 .
In fact , the RNC paid Sproul a great deal more than that .
From an independent study of the original data filed by the Republicans with the Federal Election Commission , it is clear that Sproul was paid a staggering $ 8.3 million for its work against the Democrats .
How the true figures came to be revealed On Dec. 3 , 2004 , the Republican National Committee filed their Post - General Report with the FEC , accounting for all expenditures between Oct. 14 and Nov. 22 .
Among the Itemized Disbursements there were listed six expenditures to Sproul & Associates , amounting to a total sum of $ 4.5 million .
Three of them were for " Political Consulting , " and the other three were for " Voter Registration Costs . "
The RNC paid Sproul the biggest amount on the day before the election : $ 1,668,733 .
On Jan. 7 , 2005 and again on May 3 , 2005 , the RNC sent in revised reports .
Those items were unchanged in all of them .
After they received the RNC 's second revised report , the FEC expressed dissatisfaction with the vague phrase " Voter Registration Costs . "
In a May 18 letter to Michael Retzer , Treasurer of the RNC , the FEC requested that itemized disbursements labeled thus be further clarified .
On June 17 , the RNC submitted a ( third ) revised report .
In it , those three suspicious Sproul expenditures labeled " Voter Registration Costs " had been changed to " Political Consulting . "
As a " clarification , " it was as vague as possible .
Although it only raised more questions , there seems to be no letter in the FEC database concerning that unedifying correction .
Moreover , there are some big surprises buried in the paperwork .
It turned out that the RNC paid Sproul not only for their pre-election work , but also paid them for work after the election .
According to their Year - End Report , filed on Jan. 28 , 2005 , the RNC paid Sproul for " Political Consulting " in December -- long after all the voter registration drives had ended .
And two months later , when the RNC filed their amended Year - End Report on May 3 , the dates of those December expenditures mysteriously changed .
A payment of $ 210,176 , once made on Dec. 20 , was changed to Dec. 22 .
A payment of $ 344,214 , initially recorded on Dec. 22 , was changed to Dec. 9 .
As to why Sproul was being paid in December , and why the dates were changed , one can only speculate .
But it may be worth noting that the Ohio recount took place from Dec. 13 through Dec. 28 .
Because these amendments were made in 2005 , the Center for Responsive Politics ' website mistakenly allocated that money to the 2006 cycle .
When we informed them of these missing numbers yesterday , CRP was quick to adjust them .
They also included two more expenditures : a $ 323,907 payment for more " Political Consulting " ( 10/12/04 ) and $ 450,257 for " Mailing Costs " ( 10/04/04 ) .
And there was more -- much more .
Fuzzy math
The documents also suggest that the RNC may have changed the dates of nine payments to suggest expenditures in 2005 , thereby shifting focus from the 2004 election .
In going through the documents , CRP located nine expenditures from the future : Sproul somehow received a total of $ 1,323,154 between Sept. 2 and Sept. 29 , 2005 .
Another $ 472,642 is hidden in 2005 .
Four of those prospective items were ( or will be ) for " Generic Media Buys " or " Lodging , Transportation . "
The other four are ( or will be ) for " Voter Registration Efforts " -- surely an expense incurred in September of last year , not this year .
Larry Noble , executive director of CRP , considers such future expenditures for , say , " Lodging , Transportation " rather odd , but he gives the RNC the benefit of the doubt .
" My guess is that it 's an error , " he suggests .
" It 's possible that they 're cleaning up voter registration lists in September , but it 's also possible they made a mistake . "
Even if that mistaken date is just a typo , it is , to say the least , not likely that they made the same mistake in nine uniquely dated items for 2004 .
In any case , all the payments by the RNC to Sproul add up to a whopping $ 8,359,161 -- making it the RNC 's eighth biggest expenditure of the 2004 campaign .
Sproul is currently under investigation by the Oregon Attorney General 's office , for altering the voter registration forms of several thousand students in that state .
Whether the new numbers are in part mistaken , they represent a huge expense for the Republicans .
Given Sproul 's history of serious electoral mischief , affecting countless Democratic voters in the last election , it is important that we ask some sober questions :
Where did all that money come from ?
Why did the RNC suppress their real expenditures ?
And what exactly did Sproul do for all that pay ?
If we 're going to get some reasonable answers , the FEC must undertake a very thorough audit of the books .

Sen. Elizabeth Dole ’s latest advertisement suggests her Democratic opponent , Kay Hagan , is a godless heathen .
“ A leader of the Godless Americans PAC recently held a secret fundraiser for Kay Hagan , ” the 30 - second spot says , showing footage of the group ’s members talking about their atheist beliefs on cable news .
“ Godless Americans and Kay Hagan .
She hid from cameras .
Took godless money , ” the ad concludes .
“ What did Kay Hagan promise in return ? ”
At the very end of the ad , a voice sounding like Hagan 's says : " There is no God . "
The ad is airing across North Carolina .
The ad bases the charge on Hagan ’s attendance at a netroots fundraiser on her behalf that was hosted by two advisers of the Godless Americans ’ political action committee .
According to its website , the group advocates for atheists ' rights .
Hagan is holding a press conference with her pastor and family this afternoon to rebut the charges .
Hagan is an member ( and elder ) at the First Presbyterian Church in Greensboro .
UPDATE : Hagan just held a conference call , where she said she was " appalled by Elizabeth Dole 's vile tactics " with the ad , and threatened a lawsuit against the Dole campaign to force them to take the ad down .
“ This is politics of the worst kind .
It is so unbecoming of a woman like Elizabeth Dole , " Hagan said .
" This is a fabricated , pathetic ad ...
Is Elizabeth Dole that desperate to keep this Senate seat ? ”
Hagan added that the voice saying " there is no God " at the end of the ad was not hers , and was a voice impersonator .
UPDATE 2 : At a pen-and - pad briefing this afternoon , DSCC Chairman Chuck Schumer called Dole 's campaign " desperate " for airing the ads .
" Liddy Dole is getting a little desperate , if you 've seen the ad she put out yesterday , " Schumer said .
Schumer added that Hagan still holds a comfortable lead in the committe 's internal polling , even though several public polls show Dole gaining a little momentum .

Interesting :
Jon used a desktop computer attached to a GPS satellite simulator to create a fake GPS signal .
Portable GPS satellite simulators can fit in the trunk of a car , and are often used for testing .
They are available as commercial off - the - shelf products .
You can also rent them for less than $ 1 K a week — peanuts to anyone thinking of hijacking a cargo truck and selling stolen goods .
In his first experiments , Jon placed his desktop computer and GPS satellite simulator in the cab of his small truck , and powered them off an inverter .
The VAT used a second truck as the victim cargo truck .
“ With this setup , ” Jon said , “ we were able to spoof the GPS receiver from about 30 feet away .
If our equipment could broadcast a stronger signal , or if we had purchased stronger signal amplifiers , we certainly could have spoofed over a greater distance . ”
During later experiments , Jon and the VAT were able to easily achieve much greater GPS spoofing ranges .
They spoofed GPS signals at ranges over three quarters of a mile .
“ The farthest distance we achieved was 4586 feet , at Los Alamos , ” said Jon .
“ When you radiate an RF signal , you ideally want line of sight , but in this case we were walking around buildings and near power lines .
We really had a lot of obstruction in the way .
It surprised us . ”
An attacker could drive within a half mile of the victim truck , and still override the truck ’s GPS signals .
SAN FRANCISCO — Nintendo gaming guru Shigeru Miyamoto and his top designers had a heck of a time making Wii Music , and he admits that they did n't quite nail it .
Now Nintendo is having a difficult time selling the somewhat inscrutable Wii Music to gamers hooked on * Guitar Hero * and Rock Band .
Released a week ago , Wii Music has n't been the sort of lightning - hot hit that Nintendo was hoping for .
Although it topped the Japanese game sales charts , it sold fewer than 100,000 copies in its first week .
Now Nintendo must figure out how to sell a music game that 's not about getting a high score .
" Anybody who has played it has responded very positively to it , " said Miyamoto ( pictured above , far right ) to about a dozen members of the videogame press in a hotel conference room here Oct. 23 .
" One thing that I 'm really struggling with is , what did we do in creating * Wii
Music * that made it so difficult for people to understand until they actually get their hands on it ? "
That question never did get answered .
* Wii Music * was the first game that Nintendo ever showed publicly for Wii : Miyamoto kicked off the console 's grand unveiling in 2006 by playing the game 's orchestra - conducting mode in a tuxedo .
But it took Nintendo years to finish the game , which it released last week to mixed reviews and slow sales — an uncharacteristically slow start for a much - hyped release on the white - hot console .
In the time between that first peek at Wii Music and now , rival titles have established the ground rules for what a music game is , and it's not clear that Nintendo 's offering will catch on like the company 's other big hits , Wii Sports and Wii Fit .
Wii Music is a cousin of Wii Sports , Wii Play and Wii Fit .
It is the most inscrutable of the four , the weird black sheep of the family .
Wii Sports
makes sense instantly : Hand someone a Wii remote and serve them a tennis ball , and odds are they 'll return it back to you on the first try .
Likewise , in Guitar Hero , if you strum the guitar at the wrong moment during a song , you hear an agonizing squelch and lose points .
In Wii Music , the game attempts to make every button - press pleasing by inserting harmonic grace notes into the song 's melody .
Add in the game 's 60
different virtual instruments , and you can see how many options you have for changing the way the tunes sound .
* Wii Music * does penalize you for playing badly , but it penalizes you with cacophonous music .
The challenge is not to complete the song " perfectly " — it's to create something that sounds nice by artfully arranging your playing style and choosing complementary instruments .
Aside from a few snags in the process , it works .
The problem is that it 's hardly pick - up - and - play .
Even though Rock Band is considered to be a hard - core game and Wii Music a casual one , Rock Band is arguably far more of a pick - up - and - play experience .
Sitting someone down in front of a Rock Band
drum set and tell them to hit the red drum when the red button lights up on the screen is much easier to understand than saying , " OK , take this controller , hold it like you 're sitting at a piano , then tap out a jazz arrangement of ' Happy Birthday . ' "
During the Wii Music design process , Miyamoto , the legendary creator of Super Mario , learned that putting first - time directors in charge of a huge game is far from the path of least resistance , and that games that never give you a " game over " screen are n't necessarily easy to pick up and play .
While any videogame writer worth his salt would kill to get an audience with Miyamoto , the round - table discussion was more of a lecture .
Questions were restricted to Wii Music only — no asking the man about his 30 - year legacy of hit games at Nintendo — and the entire first hour of the 90 - minute session was a one - way presentation in which Miyamoto ran down the bullet - point list of features in Wii Music , something any PR flack could have handled just as easily .
The goal was clear :
If getting people to grok Wii Music truly means getting them to play it first , Nintendo has a massive Catch - 22 situation on its hands .
Short of mailing out free copies to every
Wii owner , the best Nintendo could do was to lure journalists into an educational session hosted by Miyamoto in hopes of generating detailed reports about the product 's features .
" I 'm hoping that all of you will help get the word out that it really is a game that you need to play to understand , " Miyamoto told the group .
Miyamoto has a personal stake in * Wii Music* , as it is something that he has wanted to create for a long time .
The first time I ever interviewed him , in 2003 , I asked why he , an accomplished guitar and banjo player , had never made a music game .
" We 're not intentionally avoiding making music games , " he said at the time .
" We have such good music composers here , and I often say to them , ' Why do n't you come up with a great music game rather than always trying to attach music to the games that others are making ? ' "
That 's precisely what Nintendo did with Wii Music .
The game 's director , Kazumi Totaka , has been with the company since the 16 - bit era , but as a music composer , not a director .
Miyamoto must have imagined that Totaka 's great success as the musical wizard behind Animal Crossing would have translated perfectly into being able to design a music - oriented game .
This did not turn out to be the case .
" I thought it would be a pretty natural progression ( from composer to director ) , " Miyamoto said , " but what we found in the process was that it was difficult . "
A musician 's job , said Miyamoto , is to " explore the depths " — add more songs to the game , add more parts to the songs and create as expansive and grand a scope for their work as the game will allow .
But a game director 's job is the exact opposite , he says .
" It 's very important for the director of a game to be able to take his thoughts and ideas and distill them down into a way that you can explain to other people , and have other people understand what it is you 're trying to achieve , " he said .
" I think that 's something that perhaps is difficult to do if you do n't have a lot of experience ....
I thought that because we'd been working together for so many years , it would be a little easier than it was . "
Wii Music 's development troubles are evident just by a glance at the credits .
Not only did Totaka have three " subdirectors " working underneath him from more traditional game design backgrounds , there were three producers stepping in to supervise the work — Wii Sports ' Katsuya Eguchi , Super Mario's Takashi Tezuka and Miyamoto himself .
Miyamoto says he looked to Tezuka — his right - hand man ever since the first Legend of Zelda in 1987 — for feedback on Wii Music , though not for the reasons you might expect .
" [ Tezuka ] knows absolutely nothing about music and cannot play music whatsoever , " Miyamoto said .
" I was keenly watching how he responded to Wii Music , and whether or not he , who was not musically inclined , would think it was fun . "
What Miyamoto and his crew of experts were attempting to create was a music game that broke away from the Guitar Hero mold .
While Miyamoto says he enjoys playing traditional music games , he likened the experience of having to stick rigidly to the melody to being in a " cover band " that simply copies other writers ' songs .
" Cover bands can only get so far , and if , as a musician , all you do are cover bands , you really wo n't develop .
It 's when people break out of that and start making their own music , bringing their own creativity to song creation ... that really makes music fun for people . "
Part of the reason that Wii Music spent so long in development , I am sure , is that Miyamoto and crew did all they could to ease players into the experience .
The game 's much - maligned song list was chosen , Miyamoto said , because the designers wanted to find songs that as many people as possible already knew by heart , and ones that could be arranged in a variety of ways .
" We were looking for music that had a very high degree of freedom to allow people to arrange them in a way that would allow them to express themselves , " Miyamoto said .
" We were n't able to go with more popular music , because what you find with popular music these days is that the progression of the song is very much tied to chord progression .
And when you are so tied to chord progression in your song , the harmony and the melody then become one , and it becomes more difficult to break away from the original composition . "
That 's why you 're playing " Daydream Believer " and " Do - Re - Mi " in Wii Music .
But future editions might be centered on contemporary music or even videogame tunes , mused Miyamoto .
Wii Music topped the Japanese game sales charts last week , but sold fewer than 100,000 copies , which is low for a high - profile Nintendo title that has the full brunt of the company 's massive marketing machine behind it .
It 's not fair to compare Wii Music 's sales potential to Wii Sports or Wii Fit , says Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Michael Pachter .
" Wii Sports is free , so of course everyone liked it . "
And Wii Fit 's balance board , which works with a variety of other games , makes it more of a " platform " than a mere game .
Pachter does think that the casual audience will buy Wii Music even if the hard - core audience will find it " too simple . "
He estimates that the game will sell 2 million copies in the United States this year , and from 500,000 to 1 million annually starting in 2009 .
Miyamoto shrugged off the Japanese sales numbers at the round table , saying that it was about what Nintendo expected .
The company is clearly crossing its fingers that Wii Music 's hidden strengths will propel it to strong sales as more people discover what it is all about .
" In my mind , if you 're the kind of person who taps your hands on your desk when you 're listening to music , or humming to the song , you 'll find this game interesting , " Miyamoto said .

During the last year we had several maintenance releases of Amarok 1.4.x " Fast Forward " , but the really interesting stuff happened on the bleeding edge development front .
Amarok 2 made it to beta and a final release is getting closer .
There is a lot of exciting stuff to discover in the new Amarok : biased and fuzzy playlists , integration of internet services like magnatune , Jamendo or LibriVox , the new playlist , a reworked context view and a lot more .
Thanks to Google , several of these improvements were made as part of Google 's Summer of Code program , which brought several highly motivated students to our team .
At this point many distributions already provide regular packaged snapshots so if you can , check us out when Beta2 is released next week .
We were also more active than ever in promoting Amarok .
For the first time in Amarok history we had a ( well visited ) booth at the world 's largest IT expo , CeBIT in Hannover , Germany .
We were also at LinuxTag in Berlin and several others .
All in all , we participated at not less than ten events , giving talks and presenting Amarok at booths wherever possible .
Oh , and we have been chosen as music management application on the EeePC which led to a trip to Taiwan for two Amarok developers
So , as you can see we were very busy and worked hard to help people around the world to rediscover their music .
We spent every cent from last year 's fund drive to work in our free time on Amarok .
Thank you for your great support to make that possible !
Slave grave : Researchers find evidence behind 150 - year - old tale
by Gregory R. Norfleet · News · August 27 , 2008
Theres a story that persists from the North Liberty Cemetery , just north and east of Springdale , that 17 escaped slaves died and were buried along this stop in the Underground Railroad .
Lending credence to the 150 - year - old tale is that the west half of the three - acre , fenced - in parcel of land has not a single headstone or marker anywhere on it .
Cemetery caretakers seemed to have deliberately kept this section undisturbed .
 It s the most unusual cemetery Ive ever seen ,  archeologist Steve De Vore said .
These clues got state and local historical agencies thinking this might be a legitimate place to scan for signs of underground , man -made disturbances .
And theyve found some .
De Vore , who works for the National Park Services Midwest Archeological Center in Lincoln , Neb. , said his ground - penetrating instruments show evidence that there were once rectangular holes , measuring roughly 3 feet by 6 feet , dug around the northwest section of the cemetery .
De Vores experience tells him they are burial sites .
In fact , the rectangular holes probably reach outside the fence as well .
 We will want to check outside the grid , too ,  Sandy Harmel , Cedar County Historical Society secretary , said .
However , outside the fence line is a corn field , so it is unknown how deep soil disturbance reached there .
Springdale was once heavily populated by Quakers , so Harmel said historians think the Friends , which abhorred the idea of slavery , took great care in burying the freedom seekers . 
But opposing slavery was one thing , serving as a conductor on the Underground Railroad was something much more serious .
To protect themselves from angry slaveowners on the trail of missing slaves , conductors left gravesites unmarked , Doug Jones , archeologist with the State Historical Society of Iowa , said .
And rarely did anyone record the burials .
That s why possible burial sites such as is suspected in North Liberty Cemetery carries on only by word of mouth .
But more than 100 years after the height of the Underground Railroad , author Gordon Smith would write in a 1959 article about cemeteries in Cedar County that there is a story that 17 negroes  were buried at the site .
 That s part of the reason why were here ,  Jones said .
 To investigate whether its true .
If we do find evidence , it would lend credence to other activities in this area . 
The search is part of the Iowa State Underground Railroad Project , and nearby houses and sites of former houses are known to be stops on the route fugitive slaves took to escape to the north .
The William Maxson home , which is nearby the cemetery and now only depicted by a Daughters of the American Revolution marker , hosted the famous abolitionist John Brown and served as a military training ground for Browns men before the Harpers Ferry Raid in Virginia ( now West Virginia ) in 1859 .
Jones adds that the 150th anniversary of Browns last visit is this December .
Harmel noted that the Quakers also shunned violence , so even though Brown felt his mission to free slaves was God - given , the Quakers would not have offered their homes or property for raid preparations .
But both Quaker and Maxsons home are near North Liberty Cemetery , so it is unclear who dug the burial sites .
De Vore said his instruments would not be able to detect a body after 150 years .
But archeologists know about some of the burial practices of the time , and excavation of the site could reveal more clues .
Harmel said the county historical society does not have the resources to conduct an excavation now , but it could set up a new marker and possibly plan digging in the future .
The Iowa State grant , Jones said , is running out .

Advertisement Thabo Mbeki has formally resigned as the president of South Africa , a day after accepting a call by the governing African National Congress to quit .
In a televised address , Mr Mbeki said he had handed a resignation letter to the speaker of the National Assembly .
He said he would leave his post as soon as a new president was chosen .
Correspondents say it is not clear who will succeed him , but the ANC appears to favour the parliamentary speaker , Baleka Mbete , as acting president .
Mr Mbeki's speech followed an emergency cabinet meeting .
He is stepping down before his final term expires next year .
I have been a loyal member of the African National Congress for 52 years ... and therefore respect its decisions
Thabo Mbeki
Mbeki left with few choices Rise and fall of Thabo Mbeki Send us your comments
The move comes days after a high court judge suggested that Mr Mbeki may have interfered in a corruption case against his rival , ANC leader Jacob Zuma .
But during his address , Mr Mbeki made an impassioned defence of his position .
There had been no effort at all to meddle with the judicial process , he said .
And Mr Mbeki dismissed any suggestion he had been trying to shape the judgement for his own political ends .
The BBC's Karen Allen , in Johannesburg , said this was a very measured and reflective speech .
Mr Mbeki began by saying that the ANC would decide the date of his leaving .
" I have been a loyal member of the African National Congress for 52 years .
I remain a member of the ANC , and therefore respect its decisions , " he said .
This was a very clear signal that he like so many others is keen to make the transition as smooth as possible , our correspondent says .
Mr Mbeki , who succeeded Nelson Mandela as president in 1999 , thanked the nation and his party , the ANC , for giving him the opportunity to serve in public office .

He went on to list some of his achievements , notably the country 's solid economic growth .
He said there was still much to be done in South Africa , and he urged the incoming leadership to continue to combat poverty and social injustice .
" Trying times need courage and resilience .
Our strength as a people is not tested during the best of times For South Africa to succeed there is more work to be done and I trust that we will continue to strive to act in unity , " he said .
' For stability ' Parliament is likely to meet in the coming days to formalise his resignation , and select a caretaker leader .
Jacob Zuma : Comeback kid Mr Zuma is widely expected to succeed Mr Mbeki in scheduled elections next year .
The decision to call for Mr Mbeki 's early resignation was taken at a meeting of the ANC 's National Executive Committee ( NEC ) .
The ANC 's secretary general said the decision to seek Mr Mbeki 's early departure as president had been taken for " stability and for a peaceful and prosperous South Africa " .
This was not punishment for Mr Mbeki , Gwede Mantashe told reporters on Saturday , adding that the president would be given the chance to continue his role as mediator in Zimbabwe .
ANC cabinet members are being urged to remain in government to ensure continued stability .
Political interference Mr Mbeki fired Jacob Zuma as deputy president in 2005 after his financial adviser was found guilty of soliciting a bribe on his behalf .
But Mr Zuma returned to the political stage to topple his rival as ANC leader in bitterly contested elections last year .
Earlier this month a High Court judge dismissed corruption and other charges against Mr Zuma , saying there was evidence of political interference in the investigation .
In his ruling the judge said it appeared that Mr Mbeki had colluded with prosecutors against Jacob Zuma as part of the " titanic power struggle " within the ANC .
HAVE YOUR SAY Mbeki has definitely done what he had to do as a responsible ANC member Tilak , Nepal The accusation was strongly denied by Mr Mbeki .
Mr Mbeki became leader of South Africa in 1999 and won a second term in 2004 .
Perhaps his biggest policy success has been South Africa 's rapid economic growth since the end of apartheid and the rise of a black middle class - but to the anger of many , wealth is more unevenly distributed than ever before .
He has failed to convince the trade unions and the poorest South Africans that the government has acted in their interest - providing space for Mr Zuma to mobilise a powerful constituency .
Domestically , his government 's handling of the HIV / Aids crisis and failure to stem violent crime in the country also weakened his hand .

Times interview that I was asked to give for no discernible reason , it 's my discretion who I want to give my money to , it 's not for the government to decide I make a little too much and so I need to share it with other people .
That 's not the American dream .
That is a belief I will hold until the day I die :
The government does n't decide who I give my money to .
I do .
Also , I 've decided not to give it to anyone .
" I 'd like to see you try to take my money , Senator Obama "

Senator Obama thinks of himself as a " Robin Hood " figure , taking money from the greedy , evil corporations and redistributing it to the peasants .
Again , as stated in the Times , I resent being called a " peasant . "
And if , as some have pointed out , Obama meant that I 'm the greedy , evil corporation , I resent that , too .
Hell , even if I 'm supposed to be Robin Hood in this tricky , poorly - conceived metaphor , I 'm still full of resentment .
Basically I just do n't want anyone touching my money .
America , I 'm a simple man .
All I want in this life is all of the money in the world .
That 's it .
I want to be rich , and I just do n't want anyone screwing with my hard - earned toilet money .
I 'm just your average plumber earning a quarter of a million dollars a year , looking to expand my empire and make sure the government is n't involved in any way .
So what if I refuse to pay taxes and am not technically a licensed plumber ?
Should that stop me from being a plumber who wants the government to play fair ?
If I 'm president , it will not .
This is , really , the only issue I can concretely say I 'm running on .
If elected , I promise the American People that
Home built CD changer / duplicator I built this hack back in 2002 for batch burning CDs - such as making a backup of my my digital photo archive , or batch ripping of CDs .
The machine is essentially a robot that allows sequencing thru a batch of disks unattended .
Its not random access - just has an input and an output stack .
Random access would have been more fun , but also more pointless .
The mechanicals
My first thought was to come up with something extremely simple , with no electronics .
Ideally , the motion of the cd tray would trip some sort of mechanism that would eject the CD from the tray and insert the next one .
After months of thinking , I still had n't thought of a cd changing mechanism that had a hope of actually working .
The next idea was to pick up the CD , but how to pick it up ?
Vacuum came to mind , but that would get complicated , vacuum pump , solenoid valves , and all .
Finally I decided to just pick up the CD by the hole , with an expanding finger , shown at right .
The finger 's end consists of a cone that inserts in the CD hold up to the shoulder .
The whole finger is cut in half , and pivoted .
The pivot is just to the right of the blue rubber band .
Its a nail , which rests in a grove in either half .
The rubber band is the only thing holding it together .
The solenoid on the right pulls the pieces together on the back , which spreads the front of the finger , and holds the CD by friction fit .
The shape of the cone is a bit tricky .
It has to be made in such a way that it will hold one CD securely , but never a second .
I tweaked the shape of the cone a bit after taking this photo .
the next challenge was moving the head around .
It has to go up and down , as well as side to side .
Stepper motors come to mind , but they do require a fair bit of electronics to drive , with 4 separate coils that need to be switched .
Plus they need very precise timing , and still need some sort of " home " switch .
Thinking about this a bit , I realized that plain old DC motors with a few micro switches for sensing key positions would be sufficient .
The horizontal travel only needs to stop in three positions .
The vertical travel only needs to go all the way in either direction .
By making down travel gravity based , I did n't have to worry about mashing the stack of CDs or the tray with excessive down travel .
I mounted the pickup mechanism on a block with a hole thru it .
This slides along a shaft for vertical guidance .
The wheel to its right winds the string to pull the CD pickup mechanism up .
Gravity pulls it down .
The pickup , pulley , and gear head motor ( hidden ) make up the carriage , which slides on a smooth metal rod from an old Selectric typewriter ( one of the shafts to hold the pinch rollers .
The vertical rod also came from that same typewriter .
If you ever get a chance to disassemble a selectric , do it .
Its a fascinating marvel of IBM engineering from the mechanical adding machine days .
The metal rod , being very smooth , bears the weight of the carriage without too much friction .
The wooden rail along the top is mostly to keep the carriage from tipping either way , and to hold the limit switches .
The carriage is pulled back and forth by a string which is driven by the motor on the left .
I had n't installed the string when I took the photo .
The string is wound twice around the drive pulley , which gives more than enough friction to drive the carriage .
And even if it does slip a bit , its the switches that the carriage hits that determine when to stop .
The Electronics I was fortunate enough to have a PCB with some solid state relays on it , of the type " ODC - 5 " from Potter & Brummfield .
Solid state relays are essentially an electronic equivalent of a mechanical relay .
However , solid state relays only take about 15 miliamperes at 3 volts to drive , and so can be driven directly from digital logic lines or the PC printer port .
This saved me from having to wire up a transistor amplifier to drive the relay coils with , like I did in the past .
I also had some input relays .
I could have hooked the switches directly to the parallel port , but the isolating relays gave me some flexibility in terms of schematic , and are handy for protecting the printer port .
Hard to find printer ports that are n't on the motherboard these days , so I can't afford to blow it up .
The relays already came on a relay board with a bank of 24 sockets .
I did n't need that many , so I cut off the circuit board to just 16 channels .
I soldered a cut off printer cable directly to the edge connector .
Luckily , the cable manufacturer followed the black - brown - red - yellow - green - blue - violet colour numbering convention , so I did n't have to probe around with the ohmmeter too much to figure out which wire belonged to which pin .
The picture shows the board with eight output relays ( red ) and five input relays ( white ) .
The LEDs on the board are a nice touch .
I actually ended up using just four output channels and four input channels .
The messy wiring board towards the top right of the image is the interconnect to the switches , power supply , and motors .
This also includes two mini DPDT mechanical relays ( the yellow bricks on the underside ) .
These are used for reversing the motor 's polarity .
If you want to build your own setup like this , and do n't want to buy solid state relays ( they cost about $ 17 Canadian each ) , any old bipolar junction transistor ( BJT ) hooked up directly to the printer port should give you enough gain to drive a mechanical relay with .
Do n't ask me how to hook up a BJT - get an electronics textbook and learn about transistors .

The Software The software for this gadget is relatively simple .
I wrote a simple command line driven program that sequences the machine through picking a CD from the tray and dropping it in the middle , and piking up a CD from the stack on the left , and dropping it in the tray .
The software also has some manual controls , which I use for debugging and aligning the machine .
It does do direct I/O to the printer port .
under Linux , this is easy to do if the program runs as root .
Under Windows NT / 2000 / XP , this is much more difficult .
But the machine that this is hooked up to runs Linux anyway , so no issue there .
Source code : changer .c
The rest is done by cdrecord .
cdrecord is a suite of command line driven CD authoring programs .
Obviously , the cd recording has to be done from command line , so that it is possible to run it in batch mode from shell scripts .
Comes standard with Linux distributions .
To my surprise , I found it also runs under Windows , provided that you have an ASPI driver .
It even worked with my HP 8200 USB cd burner !
So the whole setup could be run under Windows as well , although getting at the printer port is much harder .
I wanted to use this setup with my external HP8200 USB burner with my basement Redhat 7.2 Linux file server / web server box .
Experiments my Linux wizard brother Markus had done earlier suggested that this should work .
Running with RedHat 7.2 , I could n't get it to work , even after a kernel upgrade .
It would n't always be usable , even though it showed up under / proc / scsi .
And when it was usable , I got kernel panics when I tried to record with it .
The machine has too many other tweaks and scripts running on it for me to just upgrade the whole system , so I eventually gave up , took the HP 8200 out of its USB case , and hooked it directly to the IDE cable .
That worked .
Seeing that I had the machine right in front of the PC , and the ribbon cable was long enough , I could even close the case and not move the machine !
I subsequently bought a 4x4x24 " refurbished " CD burner for $ 50 Canadian from Radio Shack and used that instead .
Now what ...
There is n't much that I plan on using this gadget for .
I guess mostly its for bragging rights .
That , and I had n't hooked up anything to a PC 's printer port in ages .
If I wanted to , I could SSH log into it while at work , load a CD in the tray , burn it , and remove it all remotely .
Of course , the CD would still be in my basement , so the exercise would be somewhat pointless !
I will probably dismantle it again after a few months .
The relay board just has too many potential other uses .
Certainly , I have no hope of recovering the time I spent building it , because I mostly burn CDs one at a time .
I already ripped all the CDs in my CD collection that I like , so no point in writing bulk MP3 ripping scripts .
I do have a 20 gig collection of digital photographs , which I back up form time to time .
CD Duplication
Video clip of CD changer in action People sometimes email looking for CD duplicators , asking for plans and such .
But the machine is really not that practical .
It was reliable enough to go through a stack of 12 CDs , but with the speed of burners nowadays , aligning and setting everything up just right is just not worth it anymore .
Maybe if I burned 50 CDs at a time , but I do n't have a need for that , and I suspect the machine may not be reliable enough to just let it do 50 at a time on its own .
If you really need to duplicate a few hundred CDs or DVDs , the best option is probably to attach several drives to your computer .
If you can automate the software enough to run multiple burns simultaneously , you 'd probably spend most of your time just reloading drives .
For larger batches , you can find plenty of commercial machines .
Look for " CD duplicator " , because " CD changer " will give you too many references to those 5 CD changer stereo components .
For batches of 500+ , consider CDs pressed from a master ( as opposed to recorded CD / Rs ) Another home made CD changer of similar design , made of legos !

Barack Obama should not pick Hillary Clinton as his vice - presidential nominee , former president Jimmy Carter has told the Guardian .
" I think it would be the worst mistake that could be made , " said Carter .
" That would just accumulate the negative aspects of both candidates . "
Carter , who formally endorsed the Illinois senator last night , cited opinion polls showing 50 % of US voters with a negative view of Clinton .
In terms that might discomfort the Obama camp , he said : " If you take that 50 % who just do n't want to vote for Clinton and add it to whatever element there might be who do n't think Obama is white enough or old enough or experienced enough or because he's got a middle name that sounds Arab , you could have the worst of both worlds . "
Carter , who insisted that he would have been equally against an Obama - Clinton pairing if the former first lady had won the nomination , made the remarks in an interview with the Guardian 's Weekend magazine , to be published on Saturday .
The interview was conducted before the final round of voting last night confirmed Obama as the party 's presumptive nominee .
The intervention of the former president - regarded as the senior elder of the Democratic party by some , and as a walking reminder of electoral failure by others - comes just as speculation of a joint Obama - Clinton ticket is building in the US .
Lanny Davis , a close Clinton adviser and friend , has launched a petition drive and website - and written directly to Obama - urging him to appoint his defeated rival .
Meanwhile , Bob Johnson , the Clinton backer and founder of Black Entertainment Television , has announced that he hopes to persuade the Congressional Black Caucus - the umbrella group for African - American members of Congress - to lobby for an Obama - Clinton partnership .
Carter 's remarks could slow that momentum , as they come from the only living Democrat to have won more than 50 % of the popular vote in a presidential election , even though the former president , who left office in 1981 , insisted he was " on the outside " and no longer had any role in internal Democratic affairs .
His comments are likely to be seized on by those Democrats who privately argue that the combination of a black man and a woman on a ticket will represent more change than the US electorate can swallow in one go .
This camp believes Obama needs to pick an experienced , white and probably southern man to " balance " the ticket .
The former president said : " What he needs more than a southerner is a person who can compensate for his obvious potential defects , his youthfulness and his lack of long experience in military and international affairs . "
For that reason , Carter says he favours Sam Nunn , the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , who hails from his own state of Georgia .
" That would be my preference , but there are other senior Democrats who would have similar credentials to Sam Nunn , " he said .

It occurred to me , as I sat with my wife and two boys watching the Best of Both Worlds Concert : The 3 - D Movie : Extended Edition tonight , that gender stereotypes in my geeky household are far less pronounced than you might find elsewhere .
And I 'm cool with that .
My boys ' best buddy down the block is a classic pre-jock .
He plays something like a dozen different sports , and he plays them well .
My boys have a ton of fun with him ; he 's a good kid .
But I wonder if my boys must mystify him sometimes .
Sure , my older boy is in little league , but he also loves to cook , and you 're more likely to find him on the couch in front of an episode of Good Eats than you are watching cartoons or playing videogames .
My younger , who is the kind of kid who can make friends anywhere he goes , has a bed full of stuffed animals .
So it strikes me that geekery makes gender stereotpying , if not obsolete , at least old - fashioned
But I wonder if this is just a conclusion based on a look in the mirror .
We are pretty laid - back California types , and seperating the Barbie dolls from the GI Joes has never been all that important .
What I 'd like to know from you , our readers , is what the experience is like in your households ?
If you consider yourself a geekdad , are you raising your kids in distinct blue and pink worlds , or does the game console equalize all , and your daughter it just as likely to frag you in Halo as your son ?
Do you play table - top RPGs with your children , and daddy 's little girl likes being a half - orc anti-Paladin with a vorpal blade ?
Is your son more of the Crafting type , and into making his own felted laptop cases ?
Tell us what it 's like in your geek - influenced households .
Updated : I completely forgot I 'd taken these snapshots at our local big - box store the other day when I noticed some mildly disturbing gender stereo - typing on display with the early Halloween costume items .
Is n't is a little sad that the wings are a " Girl 's Accessory " and the screaming psycho knife is a " Boy 's Accessory ? "
Acorn pushes back , hugs McCain
The beleaguered Democratic - leaning community group Acorn sends over this photograph : John McCain , in March of 2006 , sitting beside Florida Rep. Kendrick Meek at an event Acorn co-sponsored in Florida .
The immigration event , which other photos show was packed with red-shirted Acorn member , was co-sponsored by the local Catholic Archdiocese , the SEIU , and other groups .
McCain , still spiting much of his party on immigration at the time , was the headliner .
Bertha Lewis , Acorn 's chief organizer , said in a statement that came with the photo , “ It has deeply saddened us to see Senator McCain abandon his historic support for ACORN and our efforts to support the goals of low - income Americans . "
” We are sure that the extremists he is trying to get into a froth will be even more excited to learn that John McCain stood shoulder to shoulder with ACORN , at an ACORN co-sponsored event , to promote immigration reform , " she said .
I do n’t know that it was always this way , but , for as long as I can remember , just as we move into the final weeks of the Presidential campaign the focus shifts to the undecided voters .
“ Who are they ? ” the news anchors ask .
“ And how might they determine the outcome of this election ? ”
Then you ’ll see this man or woman — someone , I always think , who looks very happy to be on TV .
“ Well , Charlie , ” they say , “ I ’ve gone back and forth on the issues and whatnot , but I just ca n’t seem to make up my mind ! ”
Some insist that there ’s very little difference between candidate A and candidate B .
Others claim that they ’re with A on defense and health care but are leaning toward B when it comes to the economy .
I look at these people and ca n’t quite believe that they exist .
Are they professional actors ?
I wonder .
Or are they simply laymen who want a lot of attention ?
To put them in perspective , I think of being on an airplane .
The flight attendant comes down the aisle with her food cart and , eventually , parks it beside my seat .
“ Can I interest you in the chicken ? ” she asks .
“ Or would you prefer the platter of shit with bits of broken glass in it ? ”
To be undecided in this election is to pause for a moment and then ask how the chicken is cooked .
I mean , really , what ’s to be confused about ?
When doubting that anyone could not know whom they ’re voting for , I inevitably think back to November , 1968 .
Hubert Humphrey was running against Richard Nixon , and when my mother could n’t choose between them she had me do it for her .
It was crazy .
One minute I was eating potato chips in front of the TV , and the next I was at the fire station , waiting with people whose kids I went to school with .
When it was our turn , we were led by a woman wearing a sash to one of a half - dozen booths , the curtain of which closed after we entered .
“ Go ahead , ” my mother said .
“ Flick a switch , any switch . ”
I looked at the panel in front of me .
“ Start on the judges or whatever and we ’ll be here all day , so just pick a President and make it fast .
We ’ve wasted enough time already . ”
“ Which one do you think is best ? ” I asked .
“ I do n’t have an opinion , ” she told me .
“ That ’s why I ’m letting you do it .
Come on , now , vote . ”
I put my finger on Hubert Humphrey and then on Richard Nixon , neither of whom meant anything to me .
What I most liked about democracy , at least so far , was the booth — its quiet civility , its atmosphere of importance .
“ Hmm , ” I said , wondering how long we could stay before someone came and kicked us out .
Ideally , my mother would have waited outside , but , as she said , there was no way an unescorted eleven - year - old would be allowed to vote , or even hang out , seeing as the lines were long and the polls were open for only one day .
“ Will you please hurry it up ? ” she hissed .
“ Would n’t it be nice to have something like this in our living room ? ” I asked .
“ Maybe we could use the same curtains we have on the windows . ”
“ All right , that ’s it . ”
My mother reached for Humphrey but I beat her to it , and cast our vote for Richard Nixon , who had the same last name as a man at our church .
I assumed that the two were related , and only discovered afterward that I was wrong .
Richard Nixon had always been Nixon , while the man at my church had shortened his name from something funnier but considerably less poster - friendly — Nickapopapopolis , maybe .
“ Oh , well , ” I said .
We drove back home , and when asked by my father whom she had voted for , my mother said that it was none of his business .
“ What do you mean , ‘ none of my business ’ ? ” he said .
“ I told you to vote Republican . ”
“ Well , maybe I did and maybe I did n’t . ”
“ You ’re not telling me you voted for Humphrey . ”
He said this as if she had marched through the streets with a pan on her head .
“ No , ” she said .
“ I ’m not telling you that .
I ’m not telling you anything .
It ’s private — all right ?
My political opinions are none of your concern . ”
“ What political opinions ? ” he said .
“ I ’m the one who took you down to register .
You did n’t even know there was an election until I told you . ”
“ Well , thanks for telling me . ”
She turned to open a can of mushroom soup .
This would be poured over pork chops and noodles and served as our dinner , casserole style .
Once we ’d taken our seats at the table , my parents would stop fighting directly , and continue their argument through my sisters and me .
Lisa might tell a story about her day at school and , if my father said it was interesting , my mother would laugh .
“ What ’s so funny ? ” he ’d say .
“ Nothing .
It ’s just that , well , I suppose everyone has a different standard .
That ’s all . ”
When told by my father that I was holding my fork wrong , my mother would say that I was holding it right , or right in “ certain circles . ”
“ We do n’t know how people eat the world over , ” she ’d say , not to him but to the buffet or the picture window , as if the statement had nothing to do with any of us .
I was n’t looking forward to that kind of evening , and so I told my father that I had voted .
“ She let me , ” I said .
“ And I picked Nixon . ”
“ Well , at least someone in the family has some brains . ”
He patted me on the shoulder and as my mother turned away I understood that I had chosen the wrong person .
I did n’t vote again until 1976 , when I was nineteen and legally registered .
Because I was at college out of state , I sent my ballot through the mail .
The choice that year was between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford .
Most of my friends were going for Carter , but , as an art major , I identified myself as a maverick .
“ That means an original , ” I told my roommate .
“ Someone who lets the chips fall where they may . ”
Because I made my own rules and did n’t give a damn what anyone else thought of them , I decided to write in the name of Jerry Brown , who , it was rumored , liked to smoke pot .
This was an issue very close to my heart — too close , obviously , as it amounted to a complete waste .
Still , though , it taught me a valuable lesson : calling yourself a maverick is a sure sign that you ’re not one .
I wonder if , in the end , the undecideds are n’t the biggest pessimists of all .
Here they could order the airline chicken , but , then again , hmm .
“ Is n’t that adding an extra step ? ” they ask themselves .
“ If it ’s all going to be chewed up and swallowed , why not cut to the chase , and go with the platter of shit ? ”
Ah , though , that ’s where the broken glass comes in . ♦
San Francisco May Name Sewage Plant After President Bush
I have to admit , this is pretty funny .
It made me laugh when I read it .
San Francisco may name a sewage treatment plant after President Bush .
San Francisco ’s Oceanside Water Pollution Control Plant may soon become the George W. Bush Sewage Plant .
The idea was hatched over drinks one night and is n’t expected to go anywhere , the Bush haters ca n’t stand to have anything named after him .
Even something that would be considered an insult to him .
As recently as a month ago I would have gone off on “ San Francisco liberals ” and that they were just full of hatred and anger towards the president .
I probably would have said that it was time for them to get a life and get over it .
I would have felt the urge to defend him , even against something as trivial as this .
Than was then , this is now .
After the government takeover of the economy and the banking system I no longer have the desire or the will to defend him .
Let the ribbon cutting ceremony begin .

Advertisement Supporters of Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr have staged a mass demonstration in Baghdad in protest against plans to extend the US mandate in Iraq .
An estimated 50,000 protesters chanted slogans such as " Get out occupier ! " .
Iraqi and US negotiators drafted the deal after months of talks but it still needs approval from Iraq 's government .
Under the agreement US troops would withdraw by 2011 , and Iraq would have the right to prosecute Americans who commit crimes while off - duty .
The UN mandate for US - led coalition forces expires at the end of this year .
About 144,000 of the 152,000 foreign troops deployed there are US military personnel .
Political battle Chanting slogans and waving banners , tens of thousands of Shias , mainly young men , marched on the eastern suburb of Sadr City towards the centre of Baghdad .
Iraq regards blanket immunity for US troops as undermining its sovereignty The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says Moqtada Sadr 's militant opposition to the US presence has strong grassroots support among many Shias - and this was a physical manifestation of that opposition .
He says leaders of the 30 - strong Sadr bloc in the Iraqi parliament will have expressed that rejection at a meeting of Iraq 's Political Council for National Security late on Friday .
The meeting of top political leaders and the heads of parliamentary factions was convened to discuss the draft agreement covering the US military presence after its mandate expires .
No decisions were taken but the Council is to meet again to hear back from military experts on what is a very complex and detailed document .
Our correspondent says its passage through parliament may follow naturally if it is approved by the Council , but this is by no means assured and a tough political battle is already shaping up .
In Washington , US defence chief Robert Gates has been courting support for the deal from key members of Congress - although their approval is not mandatory .

What are these ?
It use to be that video game developers were geeks in their basements crunching code for hours on end until their eyes bled , with hardly a business plan behind them , never mind a justifiable business case that would support making a career out of their artform .
In fact , gaming itself only really took off in the mass market as recent as the past ten years or so .
Let 's face it , back then , with a customer base of predominantly kids in their teens or less , the average PC or Console game consumer just did n't have the disposable income to support anything more than a niche ' market .
Likewise , if you were a gifted computer programmer , cinematographer or the like , you probably would n't have thought of devoting your career to something as trivial as a " video game " .
It 's almost hard to believe how insignificant the computer gaming industry was back then and how times certainly have changed now .
These days , there is obviously big money in the video game industry and with a market opportuntity in the tens of billions of dollars , brand - name universities are sitting up and taking notice .
Investing in this relatively new form of entertainment that now spans generations with a customer and fan base that easily rivals professional sports and the movie industry , makes perfect business sense and more than a few of the big schools now have big programs .
Take USC Viterbi School of Engineering 's GamePipe Lab for example and you 'll know higher education has seen the light ( and the green ) with respect to the legitimacy of the video game development industry .
Perhaps a Master of Science in Game Development is in your future ?

And do n't think for a minute that it 's all fun and games .
From 3D Graphics Rendering , to Analysis of Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence , you can bet the cirriculum is challenging , exhausting and requires the usual herculean acts of caffeine - infused cram - a - thons in the lab and library .
A team - based approach , Carnegie Mellon 's Jesse Schell , a Professor in Game Design notes game design is , " ... mind - bending technology , combined with clever game design , combined with glorious artwork , combined with beautiful audio , " ... " There 's no one person on the team who can do it all .
We think of it like team inventing . "
According to the LA Times , " About one - third of Carnegie Mellon 's graduates go directly to work at EA ( Electronic Arts ) , said Cindy Nicola , the company 's vice president of talent acquisition .
The Redwood City , Calif. , company soaks up close to 300 new graduates each year from various universities . "
Alas it certainly does appear that the " age of the geek " has arrived .
Just ask game developer rock stars like John Carmack , driving his Ferrari to work , if they made the right career decision .
That 's right kids , stay in school , get good grades , and maybe you too can play games for a living -- or better yet , create them .
That sound you heard ?
It 's the sound of Michelle Bachmann 's campaign falling apart .
The Washington Post 's Chris Cizzilla summarizes it right in his blog entry today called , " Bachmann Goes Boom ! "
Who is she ?
Who is Michelle Bachmann ?
A Republican Congresswoman from Minnesota .
She was in a relatively safe district .
All signs were that she would win re-election .
All she had to do was run out the clock .
Instead , she appeared on Chris Matthews ' show " Hardball , " which is the equivalent of running the ball when all you have to do is take a knee .
She obviously does not know who Joe Piscarcik is .
Be cool
Matthews can get pointed on his program and may just egg you on -- wanting you to say something that will get repeated five billion times .
But you do n't have to acquiese .
You do n't have to give him a soundbite you 'll regret .
Or many soundbites you 'll regret .
But in a pretty fair conversation ( judge for yourself -- see video below ) when the two were discussing Weather Underground co-founder Bill Ayers , Matthews said to Bachmann , " You believe Barack Obama may - because of this relationship - have anti-American views ? "
" Absolutely .
I 'm very concerned that he [ Obama ] may have anti-American views , " she said .
Digging deeper
But she did n't stop there .
Matthews asked her , " How many in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American ?
You already suspect Barack Obama -- is he alone or do you think there are others ? "
You can't tell at this point if she knows she 's already stepped in it .
There does n't appear to be a deer - in - the - headlights or as the saying goes this year , a moose - in - the - headlights reaction .
" The news media should do a penetrating expose ... on the views of the people in Congress and find out if they 're pro-America or anti-America , " she answered .
Ka-ching
Her opponent Elwyn Tinklenberg was the immediate recipient of this interview raising more than $ 800,000 since that remark .
That 's Obama - like money .
The Minneapolis Star - Tribune reports that Tinklenberg 's fundraising efforts over the last few days have eclipsed the total amount of money he pulled into the campaign for the entirety of the third quarter .
Game - changer
As Cillizza points out , these remarks have changed the course of the race .
And , the Cook Political Report -- one of the most highly respected handicappers of Congressional races and The Fix alma mater -- moved the race ( subscription required ) from likely Republican to toss up yesterday .
Of the race , Cook House editor David Wasserman wrote : " Bachmann 's comments likely changed the complexion of her reelection race overnight and helped to turn the race into even more of a referendum on her . "
Crisis communications
Not afraid of television cameras , she went back on the air Sunday morning -- this time on appeared on WCCO - TV , Minneapolis , and was asked about her Hardball statement on Obama .
Not immediately backing down from the remark , she said the issue is about " the associations that Barack Obama has " before calling on the media once again to investigate Obama 's views , relationships , and associations .
On an Obama presidency she said the public should expect tax increases , socialized medicine , a $ 40 trillion climate change tax , and the removal of the secret ballot during labor union organization votes .
Anti-American ?
But what about the anti-American views that she said Obama harbors ?
" I 'm not saying his views are anti-American , " she said .
" That is a misreading of what I said .
I do n't believe that that is my position .
I 'm calling on the media to take a look at what his views are .
Because I think they 've had an appalling lack of curiosity . "
More clarification
She appeared on John McCaslin's " Inside the Beltway " radio program yesterday to further clarify her point of view .
" It is amazing to me how the wind tunnel and spin can go around and around in an echo chamber , " she said .
" And this is simply a lie .
I did not question Barack Obama 's patriotism , I did not say he was anti-American . "
Remember him ?
Governor Tim Pawlenty , a short - lister for VP a couple months ago , spoke out about the controversy yesterday and stood in the safest spot possible -- right in the middle .
" I do n't think it 's fair or appropriate to suggest that Barack Obama is anti-American , " he said .
" If you do a lot of interviews , eventually you are going to say something that you wish you had said differently .
It 's just the nature of talking all day . "

Advertisement US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has urged a key Congressional hearing not to delay a $ 700 bn ( £ 382 bn ) bail - out of the US banking system .
Mr Paulson told the Senate Banking Committee that the personal savings of US citizens are at risk if the rescue plan is not implemented .
The Treasury wants unlimited authority to buy back the bad debt that is clogging the financial markets .
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has backed him by saying urgent action is needed .
Regulation call During the almost five - hour hearing , both Mr Bernanke and Mr Paulson also said that once the immediate financial crisis was over , regulation of the markets needed an overhaul .
In his testimony to the committee , Securities and Exchange Commission chief Christopher Cox urged Congress to regulate credit default swaps , a type of corporate debt insurance that figured prominently in the US financial crisis .
" I urge you to provide in statute the authority to regulate these products to enhance investor protection and ensure the operation of fair and orderly markets , " Mr Cox said .
Mr Paulson 's leadership credentials are not in doubt
Fresh challenge for Henry Paulson Q&A : US bail - out plan Earlier - opening the hearing - Democrat chairman of the committee , Chris Dodd , said : " We all recognize the gravity of the situation . "
He added that the " economic maelstrom " was caused by a combination of " private greed and public regulatory neglect " .
Doubts over how soon the rescue plan can be applied have emerged over the past days from both the Democrats and Republicans .
Under the draft Treasury plans , financial institutions with " significant operations in the US " are eligible to sell or auction their bad debts to the Treasury fund .
That would mean a number of US - based British banks could sell their " toxic assets " to the Treasury - owned bank via an auction .
The fund will aim to sell off these mortgage - related debts in the future when , it says , their value may have risen .
' Mother of all bail - outs '
But senators from both parties have voiced concerns taxpayers would be paying the price of mistakes made by banks .
They also said it was crucial not to rush through the bail - out , without carefully considering how it would work .
BBC Business Editor Robert Peston said the US Treasury Secretary 's proposal to buy bad mortgage debts from banks represented " the mother of all bail - outs " .
He said that during the hearing Fed chairman Mr Bernanke disclosed that the Treasury would attempt to buy these debts from banks at close to their " hold - to - maturity " value , not the market value .
" In practice , it means banks who sell their debts to the Treasury would receive cash equivalent to something like twice the value in their books of these poisonous assets , " our correspondent said .
" In other words they would book a profit from selling to taxpayers .
" It would represent a massive injection of new capital into the US banking system - for which taxpayers would receive nothing in return , except for the assurances from Mr Paulson and Chairman Bernanke that their banking system would not collapse , " he added .
' Decisive action ' " We saw market turmoil reach a new level last week , and spill over into the rest of the economy , " Mr Paulson said .
" We must now take further , decisive action to fundamentally and comprehensively address the root cause of this turmoil . "
He added : " When the financial system does n't work as it should , Americans ' personal savings , and the ability of consumers and businesses to finance spending , investment and job creation are threatened . "
Ben Bernanke 's testimony followed Mr Paulson's .
He has defend the Federal Reserve 's action to save insurer AIG from collapse .
" A disorderly failure of AIG would have severely threatened global financial stability and , consequently , the performance of the US economy , " he said .
He then said that despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , and other agencies , that global financial markets remain under extraordinary stress .
" Action by the Congress is urgently required to stabilise the situation and avert what otherwise could be very serious consequences for our financial markets and for our economy , " Mr Bernanke added .
' Great confidence ' President Bush has been closely involved with the proposed rescue plan .
" This is not a step that we have taken lightly .
It 's a very big plan .
It was something we felt we had no choice but to do at this point , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a conference call with reporters .
" But we 're going to move forward with it with great confidence that it will have the impact that we expect it to have and to allow growth to continue in this economy , " he said .

What are these ?
I read the ACLU ’s statement , on its official blog , describing its position on the DC v. Heller decision .
For those of you who are not aware , the Supreme Court ( for the first time ever ) heard a case that hinged on whether the 2nd Amendment of the United States Constitution protected an individual or collective right to keep and bear arms .
Just for those who chose willful ignorance of the obvious interpretation of the 2A , the Supreme Court ’s justices made it official : the RKBA is an individual right .
It ’s not just a “ right ” of state controlled militias .
The ACLU position , from the relevant weblog post , is :
The ACLU interprets the Second Amendment as a collective right .
Therefore , we disagree with the Supreme Court ’s decision in D.C. v. Heller .
While the decision is a significant and historic reinterpretation of the right to keep and bear arms , the decision leaves many important questions unanswered that will have to be resolved in future litigation , including what regulations are permissible , and which weapons are embraced by the Second Amendment right that the Court has now recognized .
Not one single comment out of the first 100 ( I have n’t read all 800 comments ) agrees with the ACLU position .
Mostly , they take the ACLU to task for its willful ignorance , its picking and choosing tactic with regard to which rights it supports and defends , its hypocrisy , and so on .
There are a few notable comments that stand out above the others , and I ’ll quote some of them below .
One comment tries to apologize for the ACLU ’s hypocrisy without actually endorsing the position itself , and two others suggest ways the ACLU can give itself an “ out ” so its board members can continue to think whatever they like about the 2nd Amendment without actually making an ass of itself like this in the future .
Of all the comments , though , I think my favorite is this gem from Mark Jaquith — the inspiration for the title of this SOB entry .
He said :
A “ collective ” is a group of individuals .
How can a collective have a right that the individuals in that collective do n’t have ?
Which of the members of the group gets to exercise that right on behalf of the others ?
Who decides who that person is ?
What about the First Amendment ?
It talks about freedom of the press , and “ the right of the people peaceably to assemble . ”
That ’s the same “ the people ” as in the Second Amendment , which you ’ve asserted is a “ collective right . ”
Maybe we should limit freedom of speech to registered press members ( who will , of course , be required to store their typewriters in a disassembled and locked state , so that they are not able to exercise that collective right at a moment ’s notice ) .
We ’ll take their fingerprints , run a background check , and make them demonstrate competency at composing headlines .
Of course , no press will be allowed to operate within Washington D.C. — to keep illegal typewriters off the streets .
After all , all constitutional freedoms have limits .
The government needs to have the power to regulate especially dangerous free speech and typewriters that are capable of performing automatic carriage returns ( “ assault typewriters ” ) .
Among the other comments are the following winners .
Samuel said :
The ACLU long based its “ collective right ” interpretation on the Supreme Court ’s ruling in US v. Miller .
The Supreme Court has now clarified what was meant by US v. Miller , that the Second Amendment never concerned a collective right , and that those who read US v. Miller to that meaning were incorrect .
In other words , the very basis for the ACLU ’s “ collective right ” interpretation has been invalidated , and the individual right to keep and bear arms has been recognized as a vital liberty of equal standing as all those protected by the Bill of Rights .
I do n’t want to hear any more about the ACLU prevaricating on how they “ disagree ” with this individual right protected by the Bill of Rights .
What I ( and many other members ) now want is for the ACLU to step to the forefront of protecting our Second Amendment rights so that the damned NRA will stop being the only place liberal gunowners can turn to .
Will you just get with the program ?
Numerous polls show ~ 75 % of US voters know the Second Amendment protects an individual right , and ~ 65 % of registered DEMOCRATS agree with that position .
We need you to show some leadership and embrace our rights , not leave the Second Amendment neglected for the NRA to continue to wrap in right - wing rhetoric .
Does n’t your sense of decency demand you treat all of our Constitutional rights equally ?
Joe Huffman said :
Fortunately it is the Supreme Court and not organizations such as the KKK or the ACLU that is the binding interpreter of the U.S. Constitution .
We now have the ACLU explicitly denying what the Supreme courts calls a specific enumerated right .
This is even more egregious than the KKK demanding segregated bus seating , water fountains , and restrooms since the Constitution does n’t enumerate the right for integration of public and private accommodations .
I had supported the ACLU in their support of the KKK because I thought the issue was one of free speech .
Perhaps I was wrong in my assumption .
Perhaps the issue was the ACLU enjoys the company of similarly minded bigots .
Mastiff said :
I am sorry to say that the ACLU has disappointed me .
I have consistently defended you to my firearm owning friends .
I pointed out that both you and the NRA are defending the Bill of Rights and our civil liberties , both with equal zeal .
The NRA was taking care of defending the one amendment you were not defending .
While Miller gave you cover , your ignoring the 2nd Amendment was permissible .
Your are refusing to accept the Supreme Court decision in Heller , which is now the law of the land .
There can now be no reason for this outside of the fact that you do not believe Americans deserve to have the right to keep and bear arms , no matter what the law is .
I no longer find it in my heart to defend you guys .
You are just as bad as the Bush Administration , picking and choosing what rights protected by the Constitution they will let us have .
I used to have hope in the ACLU .
I am very sorry to discover that I was mistaken .
Lonnie Wilson said :
I ’m sorry to say that I ’m ripping up my membership to the ACLU and sending it back to your HQ .
By calling the Second Amendment a “ collective right ” when all NINE Supreme Court Justices disagree with that statement , you completely undermine your organization ’s moral authority to attack against the MCA , FISA changes , and so on .
Patrick said :
The hypocrisy of the ACLU apparently knows no bounds .
Picking which “ rights ” you support based on politics is beneath you ( well , actually I guess it is n’t ) .
I ’ll stop there .
There are far too many scathing indictments of the ACLU ’s laughable position to list all the good examples here .
For the second time in six weeks , John McCain has challenged the press and the public to " name a single issue " where 's he changed positions since 2000 .
Sadly for the supposed maverick , his growing list of reversals , flip - flops and turnabouts now numbers in the dozens .
None of which deterred McCain from pretending otherwise in an interview Wednesday with the CBS affiliate in Washington , DC .
Asked , " where is the John McCain from 2000 ? " and " has something changed , " Mr. Straight Talk responded :
" You ’ll have to tell me what ’s changed .
I love it when they say , ' Oh McCain has changed . '
And I say , ' What have I changed on ? '
They ca n’t name a single issue or they ’ll name an issue and it 's false .
I ’m the same guy .
I ’m proud of our campaign . "
Last month , McCain threw down the same gauntlet during his disastrous appearance on ABC's The View .
When host Joy Behar lamented , " I do n’t see the old John McCain … I understand why - you want to get elected , " McCain instinctively went to battle stations :
" I ’ve been through this litany before , where I say , 'ok , what specific area have I quote changed ? '
Nobody can name it ... I am the same person and I have the same principles . "
As it turns out , not so much .
At almost every turn , John McCain in his eternal quest for the White House reversed long - held positions , compromised core principles and swallowed his pride in order to curry favor with both the leading lights of the conservative movement and right - wing Republican primary voters .
With the nomination sewn up , McCain then retreated in a desperate about - face back to the political center .
The numbers tell the tale .
By this March , McCain had flip - flopped on the religious right , the Bush tax cuts , immigration reform , a first - term balanced budget pledge , overturning Roe v. Wade , detainee torture and even his relationship with President Bush .
In June , McCain set a new record with 10 more reversals in the span of just two weeks .
All in all , ThinkProgress now puts the McCain Flip - Flop count at 44 across the gamut of issues foreign and domestic .
The Washington Monthly 's Steve Benen tabulated 76 changes of tune for " Jukebox John " .
Another online McCain flip - flop tracker insists the mythical maverick 's U - turns now top 100 .
Unashamed , undeterred and apparently unencumbered by reality , John McCain went on the offensive against Barack Obama again today .
Obama , he told supporters , would " say anything " to get elected .
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 2008 with one half to Yoichiro Nambu , of the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago , " for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics , " and the other half jointly to Makoto Kobayashi , of Japan 's High Energy Accelerator Research Organization ( KEK ) and Toshihide Maskawa , of the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics ( YITP ) at Kyoto University , " for the discovery of the origin of the broken symmetry which predicts the existence of at least three families of quarks in nature . "
Passion for symmetry
The fact that our world does not behave perfectly symmetrically is due to deviations from symmetry at the microscopic level .
As early as 1960 , Yoichiro Nambu formulated his mathematical description of spontaneous broken symmetry in elementary particle physics .
Spontaneous broken symmetry conceals nature ’s order under an apparently jumbled surface .
It has proved to be extremely useful , and Nambu ’s theories permeate the Standard Model of elementary particle physics .
The Model unifies the smallest building blocks of all matter and three of nature ’s four forces in one single theory .
The spontaneous broken symmetries that Nambu studied , differ from the broken symmetries described by Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa .
These spontaneous occurrences seem to have existed in nature since the very beginning of the universe and came as a complete surprise when they first appeared in particle experiments in 1964 .
It is only in recent years that scientists have come to fully confirm the explanations that Kobayashi and Maskawa made in 1972 .
It is for this work that they are now awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics .
They explained broken symmetry within the framework of the Standard Model , but required that the Model be extended to three families of quarks .
These predicted , hypothetical new quarks have recently appeared in physics experiments .
advertisement
As late as 2001 , the two particle detectors BaBar at Stanford , USA and Belle at Tsukuba , Japan , both detected broken symmetries independently of each other .
The results were exactly as Kobayashi and Maskawa had predicted almost three decades earlier .
A hitherto unexplained broken symmetry of the same kind lies behind the very origin of the cosmos in the Big Bang some 14 billion years ago .
If equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created , they ought to have annihilated each other .
But this did not happen , there was a tiny deviation of one extra particle of matter for every 10 billion antimatter particles .
It is this broken symmetry that seems to have caused our cosmos to survive .
The question of how this exactly happened still remains unanswered .
Perhaps the new particle accelerator LHC at CERN in Geneva will unravel some of the mysteries that continue to puzzle us .
Yoichiro Nambu , a US citizen , was born in 1921 in Tokyo , Japan .
He obtained his D.Sc. in 1952 at University of Tokyo , Japan .
And he is now Harry Pratt Judson Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at Enrico Fermi Institute , University of Chicago .
Makoto Kobayashi , a Japanese citizen , was born in 1944 in Nagoya , Japan .
He obtained his Ph.D. in 1972 at Nagoya University , Japan .
And he is now Professor Emeritus at High Energy Accelerator Research Organization ( KEK ) , Tsukuba , Japan .
Toshihide Maskawa , also a Japanese citizen , was born in 1940 .
He obtained his Ph.D. in 1967 at Nagoya University , Japan .
And he is now Professor Emeritus at Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics ( YITP ) , Kyoto University , Japan .
The prize amount is SEK 10 million .
Nambu receives one half and Kobayashi and Maskawa share the other half .
Peter the Great is one of Russia 's most prestigious warships
The Russian navy has announced that some of its ships will visit Venezuela in November and may hold joint exercises in its territorial waters .
A senior Venezuelan naval official said earlier there were plans to hold exercises involving four Russian warships and 1,000 Russian troops .
Confirming a visit would be made , Russia said its ships would include the heavy cruiser Peter the Great .
Anti-submarine planes would also be sent to Venezuela temporarily , it said .
Correspondents say the move is likely to raise concern in the US , whose relations with Russia have been soured by Moscow 's recent conflict in Georgia .
Washington already has rocky relations with Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez .
Mr Chavez welcomed news of the Russian naval visit in his weekly broadcast .
Referring to possible US concerns , he was quoted by the Associated Press as saying : " Go ahead and squeal , Yankees . "
In July , he called for a strategic alliance with Russia to protect Venezuela from the US .
Caracas and Moscow agreed to extend bilateral co-operation on energy , with three Russian energy companies to be allowed to operate in Venezuela .
' Great importance '
Confirming plans for the visit in November , Russian foreign ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko said it was not aimed against any third country .
Nor , he added , had it any connection to events in Georgia .
As well as the nuclear - powered Peter the Great , the Russian ships will include the anti-submarine ship Admiral Chabanenko .
On Saturday , Venezuelan Rear Admiral Salbatore Cammarata Bastidas said Venezuelan aircraft and submarines would be involved in exercises with the Russians .
" This is of great importance because it is the first time it is being done [ in the Americas ] , " he said in a statement quoted by the AFP news agency and local media .
President Chavez supported Russia 's intervention in Georgia last month and has accused Washington of being scared of Moscow 's " new world potential " .
In his weekly broadcast , Mr Chavez said : " Russia 's naval fleet is welcome here .
If it 's possible , we 'll stage an exercise in our Caribbean waters . "

What are these ?
By GEORGE JOHNSON
January 12 , 1999 cientists , intent on categorizing everything around them , sometimes divide themselves into the lumpers and the splitters .
The lumpers , many of whom flock to the unifying field of theoretical physics , search for hidden laws uniting the most seemingly diverse phenomena :
Blur your vision a little and lightning bolts and static cling are really the same thing .
The splitters , often drawn to the biological sciences , are more taken with diversity , reveling in the 34,000 variations on the theme spider , or the 550 species of conifer trees .
But there are exceptions to the rule .
When two biologists and a physicist , all three of the lumper persuasion , recently joined forces at the Santa Fe Institute , an interdisciplinary research center in northern New Mexico , the result was an advance in a problem that has bothered scientists for decades : the origin of biological scaling .
How is one to explain the subtle ways in which various characteristics of living creatures -- their life spans , their pulse rates , how fast they burn energy -- change according to their body size ?
As animals get bigger , from tiny shrew to huge blue whale , pulse rates slow down and life spans stretch out longer , conspiring so that the number of heartbeats during an average stay on Earth tends to be roughly the same , around a billion .
A mouse just uses them up more quickly than an elephant .
Mysteriously , these and a large variety of other phenomena change with body size according to a precise mathematical principle called quarter - power scaling .
A cat , 100 times more massive than a mouse , lives about 100 to the one - quarter power , or about three times , longer .
( To calculate this number take the square root of 100 , which is 10 and then take the square root of 10 , which is 3.2 . )
Heartbeat scales to mass to the minus one - quarter power .
The cat 's heart thus beats a third as fast as a mouse 's .
The Santa Fe Institute collaborators -- Geoffrey West , a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory , and two biologists at the University of New Mexico , Jim Brown and Brian Enquist -- have drawn on their different kinds of expertise to propose a model for what causes certain kinds of quarter - power scaling , which they have extended to the plant kingdom as well .
In their theory , scaling emerges from the geometrical and statistical properties of the internal networks animals and plants use to distribute nutrients .
But almost as interesting as the details of this model , is the collaboration itself .
It is rare enough for scientists of such different persuasions to come together , rarer still that the result is hailed as an important development .
" Scaling is interesting because , aside from natural selection , it is one of the few laws we really have in biology , " said John Gittleman , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Virginia .
" What is so elegant is that the work makes very clear predictions about causal mechanisms .
That 's what had been missing in the field . "
Brown said : " None of us could have done it by himself .
It is one of the most exciting things I 've been involved in . "
It might seem that because a cat is a hundred times more massive than a mouse , its metabolic rate , the intensity with which it burns energy , would be a hundred times greater -- what mathematicians call a linear relationship .
After all , the cat has a hundred times more cells to feed .
But if this were so , the animal would quickly be consumed by a fit of spontaneous feline combustion , or at least a very bad fever .
The reason : the surface area a creature uses to dissipate the heat of the metabolic fires does not grow as fast as its body mass .
To see this , consider ( like a good lumper ) a mouse as an approximation of a small sphere .
As the sphere grows larger , to cat size , the surface area increases along two dimensions but the volume increases along three dimensions .
The size of the biological radiator cannot possibly keep up with the size of the metabolic engine .
If this was the only factor involved , metabolic rate would scale to body mass to the two - thirds power , more slowly than in a simple one - to - one relationship .
The cat 's metabolic rate would be not 100 times greater than the mouse 's but 100 to the power of two - thirds , or about 21.5 times greater .
But biologists , beginning with Max Kleiber in the early 1930s , found that the situation was much more complex .
For an amazing range of creatures , spanning in size from bacteria to blue whales , metabolic rate scales with body mass not to the two - thirds power but slightly faster -- to the three - quarter power .
Evolution seems to have found a way to overcome in part the limitations imposed by pure geometric scaling , the fact that surface area grows more slowly than size .
For decades no one could plausibly say why .
Kleiber 's law means that a cat 's metabolic rate is not a hundred or 21.5 times greater than a mouse 's , but about 31.6 -- 100 to the three - quarter power .
This relationship seems to hold across the animal kingdom , from shrew to blue whale , and it has since been extended all the way down to single - celled organisms , and possibly within the cells themselves to the internal structures called mitochondria that turn nutrients into energy .
Long before meeting Brown and Enquist , West was interested in how scaling manifests itself in the world of subatomic particles .
The strong nuclear force , which binds quarks into neutrons , protons and other particles , is weaker , paradoxically , when the quarks are closer together , but stronger as they are pulled farther apart -- the opposite of what happens with gravity or electromagnetism .
Scaling also shows up in Heisenberg 's Uncertainty Principle : the more finely you measure the position of a particle , viewing it on a smaller and smaller scale , the more uncertain its momentum becomes .
" Everything around us is scale dependent , " West said .
" It 's woven into the fabric of the universe . "
The lesson he took away from this was that you cannot just naively scale things up .
He liked to illustrate the idea with Superman .
In two panels labeled " A Scientific Explanation of Clark Kent 's Amazing Strength , " from Superman 's first comic book appearance in 1938 , the artists invoked a scaling law : " The lowly ant can support weights hundreds of times its own .
The grasshopper leaps what to man would be the space of several city blocks . "
The implication was that on the planet Krypton , Superman 's home , strength scaled to body mass in a simple linear manner :
If an ant could carry a twig , a Superman or Superwoman could carry a giant ponderosa pine .
But in the real universe , the scaling is actually much slower .
Body mass increases along three dimensions , but the strength of legs and arms , which is proportional to their cross-sectional area , increases along just two dimensions .
If a man is a million times more massive than an ant , he will be only 1,000,000 to the two - thirds power stronger : about 10,000 times , allowing him to lift objects weighing up to a hundred pounds , not thousands .
Things behave differently at different scales , but there are orderly ways -- scaling laws -- that connect one realm to another .
" I found this enormously exciting , " West said .
" That 's what got me thinking about scaling in biology . "
At some point he ran across Kleiber 's law .
" It is truly amazing because life is easily the most complex of complex systems , " West said .
" But in spite of this , it has this absurdly simple scaling law .
Something universal is going on . "
Enquist became hooked on scaling as a student at Colorado College in Colorado Springs in 1988 .
When he was looking for a graduate school to study ecology , he chose the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque partly because a professor there , Brown , specialized in how scaling occurred in ecosystems .
There are obviously very few large species , like elephants and whales , and a countless number of small species .
But who would have expected , as Enquist learned in one of Brown 's classes , that if one drew a graph with the size of animals on one axis and the number of species on the other axis , the slope of the resulting line would reveal another quarter - power scaling law ?
Population density , the average number of offspring , the time until reproduction -- all are dependent on body size scaled to quarter - powers .
" As an ecologist you are used to dealing with complexity -- you 're essentially embedded in it , " Enquist said .
" But all these quarter - power scaling laws hinted that something very general and simple was going on . "
The examples Brown had given all involved mammals .
" Has anyone found similar laws with plants ? " Enquist asked .
Brown said , " I have no idea .
Why do n't you find out ? "
After sifting through piles of data compiled over the years in agricultural and forestry reports , Enquist found that the same kinds of quarter - power scaling happened in the plant world .
He even uncovered an equivalent to Kleiber 's law .
It was surprising enough that these laws held among all kinds of animals .
That they seemed to apply to plants as well was astonishing .
What was the common mechanism involved ?
" I asked Jim whether or not we could figure it out , " Enquist recalled .
" He kind of rubbed his head and said , ' Do you know how long this is going to take ? " '
They assumed that Kleiber 's law , and maybe the other scaling relationships , arose because of the mathematical nature of the networks both animals and trees used to transport nutrients to all their cells and carry away the wastes .
A silhouette of the human circulatory system and of the roots and branches of a tree look remarkably similar .
But they knew that precisely modeling the systems would require some very difficult mathematics and physics .
And they wanted to talk to someone who was used to trafficking in the idea of general laws .
" Physicists tend to look for universals and invariants whereas biologists often get preoccupied with all the variations in nature , " Brown said .
He knew that the Santa Fe Institute had been established to encourage broad - ranging collaborations .
He asked Mike Simmons , then an institute administrator , whether he knew of a physicist interested in tackling biological scaling laws .
West liked to joke that if Galileo had been a biologist , he would have written volumes cataloging how objects of different shapes fall from the leaning tower of Pisa at slightly different velocities .
He would not have seen through the distracting details to the underlying truth : if you ignore air resistance , all objects fall at the same rate regardless of their weight .
But at their first meeting in Santa Fe , he was impressed that Brown and Enquist were interested in big , all - embracing theories .
And they were impressed that West seemed like a biologist at heart .
He wanted to know how life worked .
It took them a while to learn each other 's languages , but before long they were meeting every week at the Santa Fe Institute .
West would show the biologists how to translate the qualitative ideas of biology into precise equations .
And Brown and Enquist would make sure West was true to the biology .
Sometimes he would show up with a neat model , a physicist 's dream .
No , Brown and Enquist would tell him , real organisms do not work that way .
" When collaborating across that wide a gulf of disciplines , you 're never going to learn everything the collaborator knows , " Brown said .
" You have to develop an implicit trust in the quality of their science .
On the other hand , you learn enough to be sure there are not miscommunications . "
They started by assuming that the nutrient supply networks in both animals and plants worked according to three basic principles : the networks branched to reach every part of the organism and the ends of the branches ( the capillaries and their botanical equivalent ) were all about the same size .
After all , whatever the species , the sizes of cells being fed were all roughly equivalent .
Finally they assumed that evolution would have tuned the systems to work in the most efficient possible manner .
What emerged closely approximated a so - called fractal network , in which each tiny part is a replica of the whole .
Magnify the network of blood vessels in a hand and the image resembles one of an entire circulatory system .
And to be as efficient as possible , the network also had to be " area - preserving . "
If a branch split into three daughter branches , their cross-sectional areas had to add up to that of the parent branch .
This would insure that blood or sap would continue to move at the same speed throughout the organism .
The scientists were delighted to see that the model gave rise to three - quarter - power scaling between metabolic rate and body mass .
But the system worked only for plants .
" We worked through the model and made clear predictions about mammals , " Brown said , " every single one of which was wrong . "
In making the model as simple as possible , the scientists had hoped they could ignore the fact that blood is pumped by the heart in pulses and treat mammals as though they were trees .
After studying hydrodynamics , the nature of liquid flow , they realized they needed a way to slow the pulsing blood as the vessels got tinier and tinier .
These finer parts of the network would not be area - preserving but area - increasing : the cross sections of the daughter branches would add up to a sum greater than the parent branch , spreading the blood over a larger area .
After adding these and other complications , they found that the model also predicted three - quarter - power scaling in mammals .
Other quarter - power scaling laws also emerged naturally from the equations .
Evolution , it seemed , has overcome the natural limitations of simple geometric scaling by developing these very efficient fractal - like webs .
Sometimes it all seemed too good to be true .
One Friday night ,
West was at home playing with the equations when he realized to his chagrin that the model predicted that all mammals must have about the same blood pressure .
That could not be right , he thought .
After a restless weekend , he called Brown , who told him that indeed this was so .
The model was revealed , about two years after the collaboration began , on April 4 , 1997 , in an article in Science .
A follow - up last fall in Nature extended the ideas further into the plant world .
More recently the three collaborators have been puzzling over the fact that a version of Kleiber 's law also seems to apply to single cells and even to the energy - burning mitochondria inside cells .
They assume this is because the mitochondria inside the cytoplasm and even the respiratory components inside the mitochondria are arranged in fractal - like networks .
For all the excitement the model has caused , there are still skeptics .
A paper published last year in American Naturalist by two scientists in Poland , Dr. Jan Kozlowski and Dr. January Weiner , suggests the possibility that quarter - power scaling across species could be nothing more than a statistical illusion .
And biologists persist in confronting the collaborators with single species in which quarter - power scaling laws do not seem to hold .
West is not too bothered by these seeming exceptions .
The history of physics is replete with cases where an elegant model came up against some recalcitrant data , and the model eventually won .
He is now working with other collaborators to see whether river systems , which look remarkably like circulatory systems , and even the hierarchical structure of corporations obey the same kind of scaling laws .
The overarching lesson , West says , is that as organisms grow in size they become more efficient .
" That is why nature has evolved large animals , " he said .
" It 's a much better way of utilizing energy .
This might also explain the drive for corporations to merge .
Small may be beautiful but it is more efficient to be big . "
Flashes of lightning against clouds create an otherworldly effect .
What is the science behind this beautiful -- but dangerous -- natural phenomenon ?

Lightning is one of the most beautiful displays in nature .
It is also one of the most deadly natural phenomena known to man .
With bolt temperatures hotter than the surface of the sun and shockwaves beaming out in all directions , lightning is a lesson in physical science and humility .
­ Beyond its powerful beauty , lightning presents science with one of its greatest local mysteries :
How does it work ?
It is common knowledge that lightning is generated in electrically charged storm systems , but the method of cloud charging still remains elusive .
In this article , we will look at lightning from the inside out so that you can understand this phenomenon .

Lightning begins with a process that 's less mysterious : the water cycle .
To fully understand how the water cycle works , we must first understand the principles of evaporation and condensation .
Evaporation is the process by which a liquid absorbs heat and changes to a vapor .
A good example is a puddle of water after a rainfall .
Why does the puddle dry up ?
The water in the puddle absorbs heat from the sun and the environment and escapes as a vapor .
" Escape " is a good term to use when discussing evaporation .
When the liquid is subjected to heat , its molecules move around faster .
Some of the molecules may move quickly enough to break away from the surface of the liquid and carry heat away in the form of a vapor or gas .
Once free from the constraints of the liquid , the vapor begins to rise into the atmosphere .
Condensation is the process by which a vapor or gas loses heat and turns into a liquid .
Whenever heat is transferred , it moves from a higher temperature to a lower temperature .
A refrigerator uses this concept to cool your food and drinks .
It provides a low - temperature environment that absorbs the heat from your beverages and foodstuffs and carries that heat away in what is known as the refrigeration cycle .
In this respect , the atmosphere acts like a huge refrigerator to gas and vapors .
As the vapors or gases rise , the temperatures in the surrounding air drop lower and lower .
Soon , the vapor , which has carried heat away from its " mother " liquid , begins to lose heat to the atmosphere .
As it rises to higher altitudes and lower temperatures , eventually enough heat is lost to cause the vapor to condense and return to a liquid state .
­
Let 's now apply these two concepts to the water cycle .
" "
Water or moisture on the earth absorbs heat from the sun and the surroundings .
When enough heat has been absorbed , some of the liquid 's molecules may have enough energy to escape from the liquid and begin to rise into the atmosphere as a vapor .
As the vapor rises higher and higher , the temperature of the surrounding air becomes lower and lower .
Eventually , the vapor loses enough heat to the surrounding air to allow it to turn back into a liquid .
Earth 's gravitational pull then causes the liquid to " fall " back down to the earth , thereby completing the cycle .
It should be noted that if the temperatures in the surrounding air are low enough , the vapor can condense and then freeze into snow or sleet .
Once again , gravity will claim the frozen forms and they will return to the earth .
In the next section , we 'll see what causes electrical storms .
Warren E. Buffett , the country ’s most famous investor and one of the world ’s richest men , announced on Tuesday that he would invest $ 5 billion in Goldman Sachs , the embattled Wall Street titan , in a move that could bolster confidence in the financial markets .
Until now , Mr. Buffett , who has navigated the stock market with legendary prowess , has largely refrained from investing in the stricken financial industry , saying repeatedly that things could get worse .
Thousands of people on and off Wall Street follow Mr. Buffett ’s moves , so his decision to invest in Goldman immediately heartened investors .
“ Buffett is saying he ’s confident , ” said Brad Hintz , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company .
Mr. Buffett ’s conglomerate , Berkshire Hathaway , unveiled the move only days after Goldman , long the premier investment house on Wall Street , embarked on a radical plan to transform itself into a traditional bank to ensure its survival .
Goldman , which examined various options over the last week as its shares tumbled and some clients abandoned the firm , also said Tuesday it would sell at least $ 2.5 billion of common stock to the public .
Looks like an entire team of translators was brought in for this task .
Or maybe it was just one guy making them up .
In which case , he forgot " el picko nicko " and " piazza del pica nica . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group
Inc plans to cut 10 percent of its total staff , or almost 3,300 jobs , a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday .

Goldman Sachs has suffered less than most of its peers from the global financial crisis and remains the leading adviser to mergers and initial public offerings worldwide .
But its transition from an investment bank to a traditional bank holding company means the Federal Reserve will use its new regulatory authority to limit the bank ’s risk taking and encourage longer - maturity funding .
Analysts expect the New York - based bank to shrink businesses in prime brokerage and securitization .
Goldman Sachs declined to comment .
In June , Goldman laid off hundreds of support staff and junior bankers due to slowing markets following a round of cuts in leveraged lending and mortgage securities jobs in April .
The company had 32,569 employees worldwide at the end of August .
Compensation and benefits accounted for 57 percent of its total operating expenses in the three months to August , down from 67 percent in the second quarter and 73 percent a year ago .
Goldman ’s move comes as Wall Street firms saw the worst September in the capital markets in decades including the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , the bailout of AIG , the acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co Inc by Bank of America Corp and the takeover of Wachovia by Citi .
Wall Street ’s job force peaked at 200,300 in December 2000 and stood at about 181,000 workers in July 2008 , according to the state Labor Department .
New York City Comptroller William Thompson estimates there could be 35,000 job losses in the securities industry .
London will suffer an even bigger hit .
The Center for Economics and Business Research ( CEBR ) expects the credit crunch to cost 62,000 financial jobs in 2008 and 2009 .

BBC News , Helmand
Almost three thousand British troops in southern Afghanistan have successfully transported a huge hydroelectric power turbine through Taleban territory .
In one of their biggest operations in Helmand , a convoy of 100 vehicles took five days to move the massive sections of the turbine 180 km ( 112 miles ) .
The $ 6 m ( £ 3.4 m ) turbine will produce electricity for an extra 1.9 m people .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the operation was a reminder of Nato's " fundamental purpose " in Afghanistan .
The operation to increase the output of the Kajaki dam in southern Afghanistan is part of a development project which has been planned for two years .
Late at night
The convoy travelled the length of the Helmand river valley - through areas insurgents have controlled for more than two years - carrying seven 20 - 30 tonne sections .
A spokesman said it was the largest route clearance operation the British military has carried out since World War II .
Mr Brown said : " It is yet another example of the skill and courage of our forces , but also a reminder of the fundamental purpose of why they are there - the long term development of Afghanistan , giving the people a stake in the future . "
Around 1,000 other Nato troops from the US , Australia , Denmark and Canada were involved and 1,000 Afghan soldiers protected the turbine through one of the most dangerous parts of the journey .
Canadian forces took the convoy on the first leg late at night on Wednesday 27 August .
The sections were surrounded by layers of steel to make them look like ordinary containers
Map : Key points on route
They moved out from Kandahar airbase along the main highway and up the Helmand valley to a meeting point in the desert where British forces took over responsibility .
It was slow going from there , where the road is little more than a dirt track .
Hundreds of British and American special forces troops went in first , sweeping through the green zone of trees , fields , deep irrigation ditches and high - walled compounds where the Taleban are concentrated .
Although it is impossible to verify , British commanders estimated they killed more than 200 insurgents - without any losses or injuries to Nato soldiers - in heavy fighting which included artillery fire and air strikes .
Unmanned drones Lt Col James Learmont from 7 Para Royal Horse Artillery said they then tricked the Taleban into thinking the convoy was heading straight up the valley , but actually went through the desert on a track used by local people .
Planning for the massive operation began two years ago Fifty Viking armoured vehicles drove alongside the main convoy which stretched 4 km .
It included fuel trucks and the eight heavy equipment transporters carrying a crane and the Chinese - made turbine .
The sections were surrounded by layers of steel to make them look like ordinary containers and to offer some defence against small arms fire , or rocket propelled grenades .
Protection from the air was provided round the clock by British Harrier jump jets and Apache helicopters , as well as French , Dutch and American aircraft .
Unmanned drones watched the area ahead of the convoy for any impending insurgent attack .
Infantry troops from all three battalions of the Parachute Regiment covered both sides of the route - leapfrogging ahead of each other in 13 Chinook British and ISAF helicopters , as the slow - moving load edged towards the Kajaki lake at the head of the valley .
Royal Engineers stayed out in front , clearing improvised bombs and strengthening the road as they went along .
There was a serious risk of direct attack or roadside bombs , so Pathfinder reconnaissance troops were sent ahead weeks before and discovered the alternative route .
Although much rougher and slower it was considered a lot safer .
They took , and held , high ground to protect the vehicles and called in airstrikes in the full knowledge of how damaging any civilian casualties would be to the support of their presence in Helmand .
There were many breakdowns along the way with tyres blowing out and air brake pipes being damaged on the bumpy road .
The Royal Regiment of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers did the rolling repairs and kept the convoy moving as quickly as possible , which at times was only 4 km per hour .
Oqab Tsuka
Planning to get the turbine into the Kajaki hydroelectric plant started in 2006 - 30 years after it was originally built by USAID , which has paid for the turbine and is responsible for the development project .
The parts were covered in steel to protect and disguise them For the past four months , 60 British officers have been planning for every eventuality and war - gaming what might happen on the ground .
They were surprised how well the mission had gone - there had been criticism of the plan from military and non-military quarters , saying it should wait until next spring because the Taleban had been so active .
The power station only ever had two turbines with power lines heading off down to the provincial capital Lashkar Gah , but a space was left between turbines one and three for this latest addition .
Indeed , the operation was codenamed Oqab Tsuka , but known as " T2 " among the troops .
When turbine two eventually comes online , and when a new grid of power lines are put up in the dangerous valley , it will be able to provide 51 megawatts of power .
But this could take two years or more depending on the security situation and the fear is that people 's expectations are high now the turbine has been delivered and they will be expecting electricity very soon .
At least getting the turbine in and achieving one of the main aims of the last three years is a sign of progress in the Helmand valley where most of Britain 's 8,000 troops are based .
7 sections of turbine , each weighing 20 - 30 tonnes 100 vehicles in convoy , stretching for 4 km 50 Viking armoured vehicles alongside Round - the - clock air protection from British , US , French and Dutch aircraft and unmanned drones 3,000 British forces involved 1,000 other Nato troops and 1,000 Afghan soldiers helping protect convoy 200 insurgents killed , according to British commanders

At a Qods Day rally in that year , Mr Ahmadinejad first said that Israel would be " wiped from the map " .
He has since used similarly aggressive language .
Council Members Urge Bloomberg to Order Car - Free Prospect Park Trial
Last month , as school - age volunteers presented 10,001 signatures in support of a car - free Prospect Park , three City Council Members — David Yassky , Bill de Blasio and Letitia James — issued a letter to Mayor Bloomberg requesting a three - month car - free pilot program .
The full text appears below .
The latest push to remove auto traffic from the park has prompted Brooklyn Community Boards 7 and 14 , along with Assembly Member Jim Brennan ( 718-788-7221 ) , to demand an environmental review before such a trial is implemented .
In other car - free parks news , Mobilized Moms will lead a Central Park rally today at 4:30 at 72nd St. & Central Park West .
The Moms are expected to be joined by Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer and City Council Member Gale Brewer .
Dear Mayor Bloomberg ,
As Brooklyn representatives , we ask you to explore a simple and inexpensive policy change that could greatly improve the lives of our constituents — to study the possibility of making Prospect Park car - free with a three - month car - free trial .
We call upon your office , the New York City Department of Transportation and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to implement a three - month pilot program to close the Prospect Park drives to vehicular traffic and to study the effect of this policy on park use and traffic on local streets .
McCain's Media is finally waking up to the fact that despite his impressive biography and ( now defunct ) honesty and straightforwardness , John McCain has some serious character flaws .
WaPo :
Under the pressure of the financial crisis , one presidential candidate is behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high .
It is not Barack Obama .
Conservatives who insist that electing McCain is crucial usually start , and increasingly end , by saying he would make excellent judicial selections .
But the more one sees of his impulsive , intensely personal reactions to people and events , the less confidence one has that he would select judges by calm reflection and clear principles , having neither patience nor aptitude for either .
It is arguable that , because of his inexperience , Obama is not ready for the presidency .
It is arguable that McCain , because of his boiling moralism and bottomless reservoir of certitudes , is not suited to the presidency .
Unreadiness can be corrected , although perhaps at great cost , by experience .
Can a dismaying temperament be fixed ?
When this election first started , I opposed John McCain because I fundamentally disagreed with his position on the issues .
But as the campaign has progressed , I 've come to realize that McCain -- not Obama -- is the truly dangerous choice to succeed George W. Bush .
He simply does n't have the right temperament to lead in an increasingly dangerous and perilous world .
For another perfect example of McCain " losing his head , " see this notorious episode from 1989 during the Keating Five hearings .
Manlio Fabio Beltrones , coordinador del PRI en el Senado , consideró que es " un absurdo inverosímil " ; por su parte , Gustavo Madero Muñoz , presidente del Senado y coordinador del PAN , dijo que con esta acción no se busca a quien sancionar sino quien la pague .

Oh boy .
Looks like the long - friendly relationship between Sen. John McCain and David Letterman may be on the skids .
The late - night comedian was none too pleased that McCain decided to bail on an appearance on the “ Late Show ” tonight so he could rush back to Washington to deal with the economic crisis –- particularly since he stopped and gave an interview to CBS News anchor Katie Couric along the way .
The Republican presidential nominee was supposed to make his 13th appearance tonight on Letterman ’s show , the venue where he originally announced his White House bid in 2007 .
But he backed out late Wednesday afternoon , saying he was suspending all campaign activities to focus on getting a financial bailout plan through Congress .
During the taping of tonight 's show , Letterman told the audience that McCain had called him personally to apologize for standing him up and said he was rushing to the airport to get back to Washington .
The late - night host called McCain “ an honest - to - God hero , ” and questioned why he needed to halt his campaign .
Could n’t his running mate , Sarah Palin , take over while he was in Washington , Letterman asked .
“ I ’m more than a little disappointed by this behavior , ” he said .
“ We ’re suspending the campaign .
Suspending it because there ’s an economic crisis , or because the poll numbers are sliding ? ”
The audience whooped and applauded .
“ You do n’t suspend your campaign , ” Letterman added .
“ Do you suspend your campaign ?
No , because that makes me think , well , you know , maybe there will be other things down the road –- if he ’s in the White House , he might just suspend being president .
I mean , we 've got a guy like that now ! ”
Things got worse for McCain when Letterman , in the midst of interviewing substitute guest Keith Olbermann , learned that the GOP candidate was actually still in New York .
Not only that , but McCain was about five blocks away at the CBS News headquarters , sitting down for a last - minute exclusive interview with Katie Couric .
Incredulous , Letterman interrupted his chat with Olbermann to show the audience a live shot on the internal CBS news feed of McCain getting touched up by a makeup artist as he waited to talk to Couric .
“ He does n’t seem to be racing to the airport , does he ? ” Letterman said , shouting at the television monitor : “ Hey John , I got a question !
You need a ride to the airport ? ”

Chronicling The News And Events Of The End Times As We Await The Second Coming of Jesus Christ

Where now for capitalism ?
Noam Chomsky
BBC News , September 19 , 2008
Markets have inherent and well - known inefficiencies .
One factor is failure to calculate the costs to those who do not participate in transactions .
These “ externalities ” can be huge .
That is particularly true for financial institutions .
Their task is to take risks , calculating potential costs for themselves .
But they do not take into account the consequences of their losses for the economy as a whole .
Hence the financial market “ underprices risk ” and is “ systematically inefficient , ” as John Eatwell and Lance Taylor wrote a decade ago , warning of the extreme dangers of financial liberalization and reviewing the substantial costs already incurred – and also proposing solutions , which have been ignored .
The threat became more severe when the Clinton administration repealed the Glass - Steagall act of 1933 , thus freeing financial institutions “ to innovate in the new economy , ” in Clinton ’s words — and also “ to self - destruct , taking down with them the general economy and international confidence in the US banking system , ” financial analyst Nomi Prins adds .
The unprecedented intervention of the Fed may be justified or not in narrow terms , but it reveals , once again , the profoundly undemocratic character of state capitalist institutions , designed in large measure to socialise cost and risk and privatize profit , without a public voice .
That is , of course , not limited to financial markets .
The advanced economy as a whole relies heavily on the dynamic state sector , with much the same consequences with regard to risk , cost , profit , and decisions , crucial features of the economy and political system .
There is something odd -- and dare I say novel -- in American politics about the crowds that have been greeting Barack Obama on his campaign trail .
Hitherto , crowds have not been a prominent feature of American politics .
We associate them with the temper of Third World societies .
We think of places like Argentina and Egypt and Iran , of multitudes brought together by their zeal for a Peron or a Nasser or a Khomeini .
In these kinds of societies , the crowd comes forth to affirm its faith in a redeemer : a man who would set the world right .

The Oct. 11 Affliction event scheduled for the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas has been postponed , Nevada State Athletic Commission Executive Director Keith Kizer confirmed Wednesday to Sherdog.com .
Affliction contacted Kizer on Wednesday morning to inform him that the event would be moved to a January date at the Honda Center in Anaheim , Calif .
Advertising for the Oct. 11 pay - per - view event had already begun , including in New York , where scheduled headliners Andrei Arlovski and Josh Barnett were featured on a billboard in Times Square .
Arlovski ’s management said they had not been contacted by Affliction with the cancellation as of this morning , and were “ shocked ” and “ extremely disappointed ” by the news .
Arlovski -- who delivered one of his more rousing performances of late with a third - round TKO over former IFL standout Ben Rothwell at Affliction ’s first event on July 19 –- signed a non-exclusive , three - fight contract with the new promotion in early July .
He had spent nearly eight years with the UFC , where he was a former heavyweight champion .
Arlovski’s management declined to comment on their fighter ’s next move .
“ Andrei was six weeks into his 10 - week training cycle .
He traveled from Chicago to L.A. to train for this bout , which he very much looked forward to , ” said one of his representatives .
Calls to Affliction Vice President Tom Atencio were not immediately returned .
