Medical experiments to be done without patients ' consent Five - year project aims to improve car crash , cardiac , other treatments
WASHINGTON —
The federal government is undertaking the most ambitious set of studies ever mounted under a controversial arrangement that allows researchers to conduct some kinds of medical experiments without first getting the patients ' permission .
The $ 50 million , five - year project , which will involve more than 20,000 patients in 11 sites in the United States and Canada , is designed to improve treatment after car accidents , shootings , cardiac arrest and other emergencies .
The three studies , organizers say , offer an unprecedented opportunity to find better ways to resuscitate people whose hearts suddenly stop , to stabilize patients who go into shock and to minimize damage from head injuries .
Because such patients are usually unconscious at a time when every minute counts , it is often impossible to get consent from them or their families , the organizers say .
The project has been endorsed by many trauma experts and some bioethicists , but others question it .
The harshest critics say the research violates fundamental ethical principles .
The organizers said the studies are going forward only after an exhaustive scientific and ethical review by the National Institutes of Health , which authorized the funding in 2004 , and the Food and Drug Administration , which approved the first phase about a year ago and the second phase six months ago .
The first experiments , involving nearly 6,000 patients , focus on people who are in shock or have suffered head injuries from a car crash , a fall or some other trauma .
About 40,000 such patients show up at hospitals each year , and the standard practice is to give them saline infusions to stabilize their blood pressure .
For the study , emergency medical workers are randomly infusing some patients with " hypertonic " solutions containing much higher levels of sodium , with or without a drug called dextran .
Animal research and small studies involving people have indicated that hypertonic solutions could save more lives and minimize brain damage .
The next experiment , which will involve about 15,000 patients , is designed to determine how best to revive those whose hearts suddenly stop beating .
About 180,000 Americans suffer these sudden cardiac arrests each year .
Emergency medical workers often shock these patients immediately to try to get their hearts started again .
But some do a few minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation first .
Researchers want to determine which strategy works better by randomly trying one or the other — both with and without a special valve attached to devices used to push air into the lungs during CPR .
That study is expected to start next month .
" We will never know the best way to treat people unless we do this research .
And the only way we can do this research , since the person is unconscious , is without consent , " said Myron Weisfeldt of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , who is overseeing the project .
" Even if there are family members present , they know their loved one is dying .
The ambulance is there .
The sirens are going off .
You can't possibly imagine gaining a meaningful informed consent from someone under those circumstances . "
Before starting the research at each site , researchers complete a " community consultation " process .
Local organizers try to notify the public about the study and gauge the reaction through public meetings , telephone surveys , Internet postings and advertisements and through stories in local media .
Anyone who objects can get a special bracelet to alert medical workers that they refuse to participate .
The project proceeds only after also being vetted by a set of local independent reviewers known as an institutional review board .
Another group of independent advisers known as a data safety monitoring board will periodically review the study for any signs of problems .
Despite such oversight , some previous similar projects have sparked intense debate .
Most recently , a study testing a blood substitute called PolyHeme was criticized for putting patients at risk without consent .
In fact , concerns raised by the PolyHeme study and others prompted the FDA to launch a review of the entire program that permits experiments to be done without consent in emergency situations .
" The ethics and policy concern is how you balance the streamlining of research to get the best information to treat patients against the moral imperative to get consent , " said Nancy M.P. King , a bioethicist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine .
" The emergency consent exception is supposed to carve out a very narrow window .
What 's been happening is that narrow window seems to be expanding . "
Some bioethicists say the new research is more ethical than some of the earlier studies in several ways , including that patients are not being denied highly effective therapies .
Most patients who receive the current treatments do not survive .
" I understand why there might be concerns , but I think ethically this is permissible , " said Arthur Derse , a bioethicist at the Medical College of Wisconsin , which refused to participate in the PolyHeme study .
" The treatments we currently have are unsatisfactory . "
But others say that the studies could be done by finding patients or family members who are in a position to provide consent , even though that might make such studies more difficult .
" This just seems like lazy investigators not wanting to try to get informed consent in situations where it is difficult to get it , so they say it is impossible , " said George Annas , a Boston University bioethicist .
" I do n't think we should use people like this . "
Annas was particularly disturbed that children as young as 15 might be included in the research .
" Suppose a 15 - year - old child is in the back of a car that is in a terrible accident , " Annas said .
" The EMTs arrive and say : ' We are doing an experiment with two techniques .
We think they are about equal .
Is it okay if we flip a coin to see how we treat your son ?
Or would you rather we just give him the treatment we think is best ? '
Unless you think all parents would have the EMTs flip a coin , consent here is necessary . "
Others are concerned patients may be getting experimental therapies that could turn out to be inferior to standard treatments .
" The most promising experimental medical interventions have often been shown to be less effective than standard treatment , " said Kenneth Kipnis , a University of Hawaii bioethicist .
The " community consultation " process has also come under fire .
" Community consultation is intended to be a collaboration with the community of potential subjects , not just letting them know what the plan is , " said King , the Wake Forest bioethicist .
But Weisfeldt at Johns Hopkins said the critics would be unhappy under any circumstances .
" Some people object to the whole concept of doing any study whatsoever without permission , " Weisfeldt said .
" We try to explain all the layers of approval we 've gone through and that this is the only way we can do the kind of research that could save many more lives in the future . "
It may be possible to glimpse before the supposed beginning of time into the universe prior to the Big Bang , researchers now say .
Unfortunately , any such picture will always be fuzzy at best due to a kind of " cosmic forgetfulness . "
The Big Bang is often thought as the start of everything , including time , making any questions about what happened during it or beforehand nonsensical .
Recently scientists have instead suggested the Big Bang might have just been the explosive beginning of the current era of the universe , hinting at a mysterious past .
To see how far into history one might gaze , theoretical physicist Martin Bojowald at Pennsylvania State University ran calculations based on loop quantum gravity , one of a number of competing theories seeking to explain how the underlying structure of the universe works .
Past research suggested the Big Bang was preceded by infinite energies and space - time warping where existing scientific theories break down , making it impossible to peer beforehand .
The new findings suggest that although the levels of energy and space - time warping before the Big Bang were both incredibly high , they were finite .
Scientists could spot clues in the present day of what the cosmos looked like previously .
If evidence of the past persisted after the Big Bang , its influence could be spotted in astronomical observations and computational models , Bojowald explained .
However , Bojowald also figures some knowledge of the past was irrevocably lost .
For instance , the sheer size of the present universe would suppress precise knowledge of how the universe changed in size before the Big Bang , he said .
" It came as a big surprise that some properties of the universe before the Big Bang may have only such a weak influence on current observations that they are practically undetermined , " Bojowald said of findings detailed online July 1 in the journal Nature Physics .
One implication of this " cosmic forgetfulness , " as Bojowald calls it , is that history does not repeat itself — the fundamental properties of the current era of the universe are different from the last , Bojowald explained .
" It 's as if the universe forgot some of its properties and acquired new properties independent of what it had before , " he told SPACE.com .
" The eternal recurrence of absolutely identical universes would seem to be prevented by the apparent existence of an intrinsic cosmic forgetfulness , " he added .
These findings differ from a cyclic model of the cosmos from cosmologist Paul Steinhardt at Princeton and theoretical physicist Neil Turok at Cambridge , which envisions an infinite series of Big Bangs preceding our universe caused by additional membranes or " branes " of reality perpetually colliding and bouncing off each other .
Steinhardt said he felt Bojowald 's calculations were concrete , but needed further elaboration to include the interplay of different kinds of matter and radiation .
Cosmologist Carlo Rovelli at the Center of Theoretical Physics in Marseilles , France , found it " remarkable " that the new work could delve past the Big Bang .
He added the work had to lead to predictions that could be compared to cosmological observations " in order to become credible . "
Hundreds of thousands of farmers grow cocoa in Ivory Coast
Ivory Coast is the world 's largest cocoa grower and the strike means no cocoa will be registered for export at one of the busiest times of the year .
The Ivorian cocoa sector has been hit by strikes this year , though usually it is farmers who strike in protest at low prices and corruption .
Work will resume on Thursday , when unions will meet managers .
" The strike is carrying on today .
No worker will be at his post .
No cocoa will be registered ( for export ) today , " Augustin Kouassi N'Goran , secretary general of the SYNASGFICC workers ' union , told Reuters .
" Work will start again on Thursday , " he added .
A separate strike by farmers in the west of the country , set for Wednesday , has been postponed .
Cocoa cash
About two - thirds of the world 's cocoa comes from West Africa and much of this is harvested between October and January .
Ivory Coast is as reliant on its income from cocoa as the chocolate industry is on supply from the West African country .
Hundreds of thousands of farmers grow the crop , between them delivering about 40 % of the world 's cocoa beans .
But the sector has been fraught with allegations of wrongdoing .
In October , President Laurent Gbagbo called for an inquiry into the cocoa sector , amid allegations of corruption and money laundering .
Revenues from cocoa fuelled years of conflict in the country - with political leaders only recently reconciled after a 2002 - 2003 civil war - a report from Global Witness said earlier in the year .
Anthony Bourdain , author , traveler , and host of Travel Channel ’s No Reservations , joins us this week for another round of Gadling ’s Talking Travel .
Mr. Bourdain was born in New York City , where he attended the Culinary Institute of America .
He became executive chef at the famous New York City French restaurant , Brasserie Les Halles , and wrote the critically acclaimed and New York Times best - selling book , Kitchen Confidential : Adventures in the Culinary Underground .
He hosts the travel - cum - culinary show , Anthony Bourdain : No Reservations , which begins its new season on the Travel Channel tonight , July 30 , at 10:00 PM ET .
Gadling got the chance to sit down and talk travel with Anthony Bourdain — check out what he had to say .
Where are you writing this from ?
I ’m writing this from the Raleigh Hotel in Miami–on short break between shoots for NR .
How did you get interested in travel ?
Were your foreign experiences limited to your trips to France as a kid , or did you get the opportunity to travel to other places ?
What right minded person would NOT travel the world if and when given the chance ?
I began to travel seriously as soon as I COULD .
It took a successful book–and an indulgent network to allow me the opportunity –and I ’m making the most of it .
Until Kitchen Confidential at age 44 , I ’d been hardly anywhere .
France as a kid .
A brief trip to the UK .
The Caribbean , and a week or so in Mexico .
One thing I ’ve always enjoyed about both your writing and your television presence is that you ’re never afraid to speak the truth .
If a particular dish is bad , or a particular place dreadful , you ’re not afraid to be up front about it .
I know you love Vietnam , but what places have you been that you have no interest in returning ?
Not crazy about Uzbekistan .
Borat was dead right on that count .
Where in the world does the new season take you ?
We ’re planning to visit Laos , Tokyo , rural Spain , Uruguay , Vancouver , Papua New Guinea , England , San Francisco , Singapore … and elsewhere .
What ’s the process for selecting an area to visit ?
Do you throw a dart and see where it lands ?
Do you pull out your list of dream destinations and go down the list ?
Or is the choice more methodical ?
I choose where we go .
I make those choices based on a number of criteria : I ’ve been before on book tour and made friends among the chef and cook subculture .
I ’ve always been curious about the place , read about it in books or saw it in a cool or intriguing movie .
Somebody said it was a great place .
Or
My producers pushed me until I finally said , “ Why Not ? ” I think previous reading –or an earlier visit ( as with Singapore ) are the most frequent factors .
Some travelers shy away from street food when traveling under the assumption that while absolutely delicious and mind - numbingly cheap , it can be unsafe .
Nonsense !
But … have you ever had any close calls ?
My Namibian warthog experience with the Bushmen of the Kalahari caused an unplanned Dr. ’s visit about a week later–and a long course of antibiotics .
Other than that , most problems are either temporary ( extra time in the bathroom ) or alcohol related .
Nothing serious .
Sometimes it ’s tough to tell which you are most : an eater or a traveler .
You seem to really get to the heart of a culture through its food , so much that the viewer forgets they ’re watching a culinary - focused show .
Which comes first ?
Do you travel to eat , or eat to travel ?
Eat first .
It seems to open doors if you show people that you ’re willing , eager and appreciative of their food .
Food , of course , is the purest expression of a culture and a region and a history –and people tend to be proud of their food .
Eating and drinking –breaking bread with our subjects ( my crew as well ) is what makes so much of what we get to see and do–and the unique way we see it–possible .
You usually travel with the help of a local guide on the show — how does their involvement shape the show ?
Are they essential for truly learning about a place ?
A lot counts on our local “ fixer ” .
And their involvement can shape the show a lot–as with the case of our three time guide and friend Zmir ( in Russia and Uzbekistan ) or hardly at all–as in Singapore , where I knew EXACTLY what I wanted to do and where to go–and who with before hand .
In a place like China–knowing no one , a good fixer like ours ( China Matt ) is invaluable – but it ’s essential in our case that they “ get ” the show –that they understand that we ’re not a normal travel show , that we do n’t want to see the monuments or landmarks–or the best restaurant in town .
We send Fixer candidates tapes of prior shows and make sure they respond appropriately –that they have a sense of what we do and what we want to see and NOT see .
We REALLY try and avoid official Tourist Board involvement whenever possible–and when they are mandatory , we usually manage to escape their clutches .
How much traveling do you do outside of the show ?
Is this a different type of travel for you , or do you still get to know a place via its food , sans a camera crew ?
I do a lot of additional travel for speaking engagements all over the world .
For promotional trips for foreign broadcasters and networks who show the program ( often in Asia–where the show does very well and seems to be particularly appreciated ) , book tours–foreign and domestic .
I regard these as scouting trips for the show .
Oh .. yeah .. and I take the occasional vacation .
Usually seeking nothing more exciting than a palm tree , some sand and a hammock .
Anthony Bourdain : No Reservations , begins its new season on the Travel Channel tonight , July 30 , at 10:00 PM ET .

By Rich Karpinski
These events have basically become match - up services : startups meet venture capitalists and the press / bloggers meet the " next - big - thing . "
Neither of these exchanges necessarily mean the products and services these Web 2.0 startups will be useful or successful -- although that depends on your definition of success .
If success means registering tons of users , driving millions of page views and getting your VC cash and aligning yourself for an acquisition -- then at least some of these startups will succeed .
But if it means providing products that users will come to rely on -- in the case of small businesses , rely on to drive their own businesses -- than success stories are much more unlikely .
It 's that dichotomy that explains why so few Web 2.0 startups today target small business with their offerings .
The game is rigged today toward launching consumer services -- or sometimes , large enterprise services -- because that is where the cash ( the sell - out ) is .
Here 's a few reasons Web 2.0 startups do n't target small business :
1. Small business owners are impervious to hype .
They do n't have time to try the latest new thing for the sake of it .
They need tools and services that make a meaningful impact on their small business today .
They do n't try tools just to try them .
2. Small businesses will pay for tools that matter to them .
This may seem counter - intuitive , but this fact makes it much easier for a small software developer versus a Web 2.0 startup to target the small biz market .
Web 2.0 startups need to deliver scale -- millions of users , tens of millions of page views .

Normal development of the prepuce :
Birth through age 18
Introduction
The genital organs are in a very immature stage of development at birth .
The growth and development continues through puberty and into adulthood .
This page and the indexed articles provide information on that normal development .
Articles are indexed in chronological order .
" The Phony Phimosis Diagnosis "
The normal growth and development of the prepuce of the human male has been greatly misunderstood both by the medical community and by the public .
This misunderstanding has led to many unnecessary , contraindicated circumcisions being performed on young boys .
Typically , when a baby boy is born , the prepuce is long with a narrow tip .
4,5 Retraction is not possible in the majority of infants because the narrow tip will not pass over the glans penis .
Moreover , the inner mucosal surface of the prepuce is fused with the underlying mucosal surface of the glans penis .
2,4,6,11
This also prevents retraction .
This normal developmental narrowness is sometimes improperly diagnosed as phimosis ( a fairly rare pathological condition , characterized by hardening of the tip of the foreskin , and a whitish ring of hardened tissue ) .
In fact , the normal developmental narrowness is not phimosis .
It is simply a normal stage of development .
The fusion of the foreskin to the underlying glans penis is often improperly called " adhesions . "
The fused foreskin and glans sometimes will separate by age 3 - 5 , but usually this takes longer .
Øster observed boys in which this normal process was not completed until after puberty .
6
Fig. 1 Non-retractile foreskin of infant boy
( normal for age ) BMJ 1996;312:299 .
As the infant matures into a boy and the boy into a man , a number of changes occur :
The tip of the prepuce becomes wider , the tip seems to become shorter as the shaft of the penis grows .
The membrane that bonds the inner surface of the prepuce with the glans penis spontaneously disintegrates and releases the prepuce to separate from the glans .
The prepuce spontaneously becomes retractable .
Fig. 2 Normal foreskin at 15 months of age .
Many medical doctors in the United States receive no training in the normal development of the prepuce .
Thus they improperly diagnose a normal developmental condition as " phimosis . "
9
As noted above , a large number of medical doctors have not had the benefit of the information contained on this page , because it has not become part of the standard medical curriculum .
Many physicians today are unable to distingish between normal developmental tightness ( as described here ) and clinical phimosis .
Nor are they able to answer with accuracy when the prepuce should become retractable .
9
These ill - trained doctors may attempt to prematurely retract the foreskin which is traumatic for the child .9
Parents should guard against this possibility .
The prepuce contains muscle fibers that work to keep the tip closed when the child is not urinating .
1,9
This may cause parents and physicians to believe that the opening is smaller than it really is .
Catzel explains how to examine a child 's prepuce correctly to avoid misdiagnosis.11
The false diagnosis of phimosis in boys is very common in the United States and the United Kingdom .
See here for more information .
Ballooning
There is a phase of development during which some boys may experience " ballooning . "
Ballooning is the inflation of the prepuce during urination by the pressure of urine inside .
This can occur if the inner layer of the prepuce is separating or has separated from the glans , which typically happens around three years of age , before the prepuce has become fully retractable .
Ballooning is an indication that the normal separation of the foreskin from the glans penis has occurred .
Ballooning is a transient condition that goes away as the prepuce continues its natural growth and development and the opening at the tip further enlarges .
Babu et al. report that ballooning does not interfere with voiding .
20 Ballooning is not injurious , and it is not a cause for concern .
Ballooning is not an indication for circumcision .
The maturation of the penis may take years to complete .
Each boy develops at his own rate .
The maturation of the prepuce continues beyond puberty as described below .
The appearance of the infant penis does not reflect on the appearance of the adult penis .
Sexual development after puberty causes many changes , which include retractibility of the foreskin .
Douglas Gairdner ( 1949 )
Gairdner , a British pediatrician , observed 100 newborns and about 200 boys of varying ages through age 5 .
Gairdner reported that 4 % of newborns had a fully retractable prepuce , In 54 % the glans could only be uncovered enough to reveal the external meatus , and in 42 % even the tip of the glans could not be uncovered .
He also said that , in boys of six months of age , four out of five or 80 % still had non-retractable prepuces .
By 1 year of age , 50 % still had non-retractable prepuces .
By two years about 20 % and by 3 years about 10 % of boys still had a non-retractable prepuce .
4
Gairdner also noted that the separation of the prepuce was incomplete at these ages and this incomplete separation is the cause of the non-retractabality .
He said the surfaces should not be torn apart because this causes bleeding and infection .
Gairdner provided a table which showed :
Age Percent retractable .
Birth 4 Age 1 50 Age 2 75 Age 3 90 Age 4 91 Age 5 92
Gairdner in 1949 had collected no data beyond age 5 , which led some authors improperly to assume that circumcision was necessary if the prepuce was not retractable by that age .
Gairdner 's figures on percentage of retractability , collected in the 1940s , 4 are now known to be too high .12 17,18 Unfortunately , many doctors still erroneously use these outmoded figures and this causes improper diagnosis of phimosis in normal boys and leads to unnecessary circumcisions .
Later studies 6,13,14 , 16 have indicated that only about 40 - 50 percent of boys have fully retractable foreskins at age ten .
( see below ) .
Jakob Øster ( 1968 )
The normal development of the prepuce beyond age 5 was first documented by Jakob Øster , a Danish pediatrician , who published his work in 1968.6
Øster reported progressive increase in the retractability of the prepuce with increasing age .
Øster , a school health officer , was responsible for the physical examinations of large numbers of boys of school age .
Neonatal circumcision is not practiced in Denmark , so all of the boys were intact .
Øster conducted examinations of boys aged 6 to 17 years old from school year 1957 - 58 through 1964 - 65 .
Øster classified two grades of tightness of the prepuce : A non-retractable prepuce was termed phimosis , and a prepuce that could be retracted with difficulty he called tight prepuce .
He found that the percentage of boys with " phimosis " or " tight prepuce " steadily declined with increasing age .
Dr. Øster 's work is presented in his article in such a fashion that it is somewhat difficult to understand .
He presented findings on " phimosis " , " tight prepuce " and " adhesions " separately .
Actually , all of those conditions prevent free and easy retraction of the foreskin so it is necessary to consider incidence of the three conditions together to determine the percentage of boys that have complete retractability .
The Circumcision Reference Library restates Øster 's work here by combining his findings into one table .
The combined total of boys by age who do not have complete retractability is shown in the table :
Øster 's6 Retraction Data Restated17 Age Phimosis Tight
prepuce Not fully
separated Total percent
non-retractable Total percent
retractable 6 - 7 8 % 6 % 63 % 77 % 23 % 8 - 9 6 % 2 % 58 % 66 % 34 % 10-11 6 % 2 % 48 % 56 % 44 % 12-13 3 % 3 % 34 % 40 % 60 % 14-15 1 % 1 % 13 % 15 % 85 % 16-17 1 % 1 % 3 % 5 % 95 %
Øster 's figures refute Gairdner 's claims that 90 percent are retractable at age five , Øster found that the 90 percent retractable stage is not reached until about age 16 .
Grogono ( 1979 )
E. B. Grogono , a school medical officer , observed that boys , with a non-retractile prepuce at age 11 , have a fully retractile prepuce by age 14 or 15 .
Grogono further reported that the non-retractile prepuce caused no problems .
8
Hiroyuki Kayaba ( 1996 )
Kayaba , a Japanese doctor , recorded the findings on examination of 603 Japanese boys .13 Kayaba classified the prepuce types into five categories .
Kayaba noted a steady progression to increasing retractability with increasing age .13
Kayaba 's work refutes the findings of Gairdner and confirms the work of Øster .
Kayaba reported that about 40 percent of boys in the 8 - 10 age group are fully retractable , this leaving about 60 percent with some degree of non-retractability , He also reported that 62.9 percent of the boys in the 11 to 15 year old age group had completely retractable prepuces , thus leaving 37.1 percent with some degree of non-retractability .
The prepuce is still developing in the 11 - 15 - year - old group .
Kayaba 's findings are similar to those of Øster .
Kayaba made no reports beyond age 15 .
Kayaba 's report thus confirms the work of Øster ; we see that full retractability is not reached by about 1 / 2 of boys until the teen - age years .
This is normal , and treatment is usually not required .
Imamura ( 1997 )
Imamura 's study , carried out in Japan , shows that the non-retractile prepuce is the normal condition in preschool age boys .
14 Imamura found that only 38.4 percent of children three years old have a fully retractable prepuce .
Imamura 's data are similar to that of Kayaba .13 Imamura advises that no treatment is necessary for non-retractile prepuce .
14 Imamura 's findings14 provide further evidence of the incorrectness of Gairdner ' s4 data .

The tight preputial ring is shown in green and the type IV and V as red ; a type IV prepuce retracts to the glans corona and type V retracts to completely expose the glans .
Drs. Christopher J. Cold and John R. Taylor have included a discussion of the normal development of the prepuce under the " Embryology " heading of their landmark article on the human prepuce .
15
The development of retractability is shown in graphic form .
Concepción - Morales ( 2002 )
A study performed in Cuba by Concepción - Morales et al. further confirms the work of Øster and Kayaba .
The work , published in Spanish , has an English language abstract .

Ishikawa and Kawakita ( 2004 )
Ishikawa and Kawakita investigated preputial retractability in 242 Japanese boys .
They found that no boys had a retractable prepuce at birth but in the age group 11 - 15 , 77 percent had a retractable prepuce while 23 percent remained non-retracable .
This confirms previous evidence that , for many boys , the prepuce does not become retractable until after puberty .
19
Thorvaldsen and Meyhoff ( 2005 )
Thorvaldsen conducted a survey of young men in Denmark .
They found that the average age of first foreskin retraction is 10.4 years .
21
Agawal , Mohta , and Anand ( 2005 )
Agawal , Mohta , and Anand carried out a study in Delhi , India of boys up to age 12 .
Their study found that preputial retractability continues to develop through age 12 , confirming the work of Oster ( 1968 ) , Kayaba et al. ( 1996 ) , and Thorvaldsen ( 2005 ) .
22
Beyond age 18
There are no studies in the medical literature of development of the prepuce beyond age 18 .
Anecdotal evidence indicates that most of the few males who still have a tight prepuce at age 18 find that the prepuce eventually stretches and enlarges so that full retractability of the foreskin is obtained in the early 20s .
Conclusion
Almost all boys are born with narrow non-retractile foreskin which are fused with the glans beneath .
This is a normal developmental physiological condition and is not a cause for concern .
Some parents needlessly worry that the opening is not large enough .
Retraction of the foreskin should never be forced .
It will retract when it is ready .
There is no " right " age for retraction to occur .
A narrow non-retractable prepuce in boys is within the normal range of development and usually causes no problems .
The prepuce usually will spontaneously widen until complete retractability is obtained .
About 50 - 60 percent of boys at age ten do not have fully retractable foreskins .
17 This is normal .
17
After puberty , the percentage of boys with full retractability rapidly increases spontaneously .
17
If a narrow or non-retractile prepuce becomes a problem , a wide variety of conservative alternative treatments to circumcision are are now available .
Circumcision is an outmoded , radical , traumatic , disproportionate , unnecessary surgery for a minor problem .
After you have studied this page and its linked articles , you will know more about the normal development of the prepuce than most medical doctors .

Information for parents
The following pamphlets have been prepared for the information of parents :
External irritants can sometimes cause a previously retractable prepuce to become non-retractable due to swelling of the tissues .
If a child whose prepuce was retractable becomes non-retractable , environmental factors should be investigated .
One known culprit is bubble bath .
If a child is taking bubble baths and the prepuce becomes non-retractable , the bubble bath should be discontinued .
See Penile Hygiene in the Intact Non-circumcised Male for comprehensive information on foreskin care .

The new discoveries have been named Wasp - 1 , 2 and 3 respectively .
They are all gas giants similar to our Jupiter .
Using equipment they built themselves , the scientists from the University 's Astrophysics Research Centre have been observing hundreds of thousands of stars for several months .
An artist 's impression of an Exoplanet

The team is hunting what are known as exoplanets .
These are planets outside our Solar System .
They orbit their own stars , or suns , many of them in just a couple of days , unlike the Earth which takes a year to make a full orbit .
Indeed , some of the planets discovered so far are so close to their stars that their " surface " temperatures probably exceed 2000C .
So there is little chance of life being present .
The search is based on a simple idea .
Astronomers know that if a planet is big enough , as it passes in front of a star it will partly screen a star 's light from Earth .
By watching for this tiny change in light , the astronomers are alerted to the possibility of a planet .
Don Pollacco from Queen 's University watches the output from their SuperWasp project every night .
" The little dip in the light tells that maybe there is a planet there .
SUPERWASP ROBOTIC TELECOPES
Comprises 8 scientific cameras ; lenses just 11 cm in diameter Field of view 2,000 x greater than conventional telescope State - of - the - art detectors feed automated data analysis System can monitor entire sky several times per night Detects hundreds of thousands of stars in a single snap - shot One night 's observing run generates up to 60 GB of data SuperWasp based in Canary Islands and South Africa
When they have identified a star with a candidate planet , they train a massive 4.2 m telescope , the William Herschel , on the star and watch it night after night .
Eventually , if there is a planet passing , or transiting the star , they will see the light dip .
By measuring the speed and amount of dip , the astronomers can quickly calculate the size of the planet and its distance from the star .
SuperWasp is really eight very sophisticated digital cameras that scan a wide arc of the sky every night .
It logs the position and brilliance of hundreds of thousands of stars .
The Wasp sits on top of an extinct 2,500 m - high volcano on La Palma in the Canaries .
It gets a clear view of the sky most nights and is far above the clouds that often surround the island .
Using computers , the astronomers in Belfast then sift through the data looking for the subtle changes of light .
Wasp stands for Wide Angle Search for Planets .
The sheer quantity of stars it checks out every night means it 's more likely to discover new planets on a regular basis .
A SuperWasp system has also started operating in the Southern Hemisphere , in South Africa .
It has also discovered two exoplanets , Wasp - 4 and Wasp - 5 .
Don Pollacco from the university watches the output each night
It is also proving to be a very economical exercise .
The Wasp on La Palma cost about £ 400,000 .
So far , that works out at just over £ 130,000 a planet ; and it will get cheaper by the planet if they find more .
SuperWasp has also received recognition from its peers .
Normally astronomers would be delighted to get one or two nights on a major telescope such as the William Herschel on La Palma .
Queen 's University has already been given 100 nights - because of the potential of SuperWasp .
Already the three planets that have been confirmed in the Northern Hemisphere have had their coordinates and other details made available through a link - up between Queen 's University and the BBC .
Details , including the coordinates can be found by clicking here .
SomeFoolThe SomeFool first - generation worm ( Netsky . D according to some folks ) actually installs its winlogon .
exe file under Wine , and , as an added bonus , seems to get stuck in an endless loop , thus really having a negative performance impact on my Linux machine !
I 'll give this one 4/5 penguins for not only running and sort of doing what it was supposed to , but actually doing mildly bad things to Linux -- at least until I hit Control - C in the terminal from which I was running Wine to stop it dead .
It 's important that we remember what makes the Internet so interesting and unique .
There are two crucial characteristics :
It 's fundamentally decentralized , meaning you can cut out any part without affecting the rest ,
It allows freedom of access , meaning you have the same ability to access and write it as anyone else .
Because they permit extraordinary flexibility and rapid growth , both of these characteristics have brought the Internet way beyond any other network .
Today , they are endangered .
How come , and what can we do about it ?
Ones and zeros are boring
Traditionally the cost involved with " Internet " , for the end - user , was access .
It was measured in kB /s and hours per month â€ “ the idea was that you paid a company to transport data ( ones and zeros ) from and to your computer .
Progressively though , all of these companies out there have understood that there is not much money to be made simply transferring data .
Carrying ones and zeroes is mostly a matter of managing hardware , a domain where competition is tough and standing out is hard .
Providing content , however , is much more interesting and lucrative .
Because there is some consumer decision involved , there is branding to be made - and therefore , room for differentiation and high profit margins .
VoilÃ !
Suddenly my Internet Access Provider becomes Internet Services Provider ( ISP ) .
Regular and mobile phone access , digital TV or pay - per - view movies , nation - wide wireless subscription , mobile phone ringtones , portable music player with legal music downloads ...
There is no media that they are not into , providing access , and , especially , content .
Controlling both sides of the cables
To keep control of the content , the key idea is to be at both ends of the cables .
The result is currently sitting in my living - room .
It 's a box that replaces what was formerly merely a modem ; now a sleek device , it stays on permanently and can manage ethernet , wi-fi , phone and TV .
It 's also the reason my mobile phone only surfs " selected " websites , or why iPods wo n't allow to exporting music .
What happens inside these boxes ?
How do the operating systems inside manage the data I am sending through them ?
There is no way to know .
Because we have no freedom over that software , we have no knowledge nor real control over it .
Combine this with our ever increasing use of on - line services ( something I have called the disappearance of the operating system ) , and you have created a network that is different depending on who you access it with .
Of course , if the information you can find and read depends on your access provider , there are chances that your thinking and writing also depends on them .
Do we want the Internet , or just some networking ?
So all of this concurs to creating something that 's not the Internet .
Remember the two key characteristics above ?
When we ask ourselves whether a particular service contributes or detriments to the Internet , we have to answer two questions :
1 . Does it create a closed private network ?
Facebook , Linkedin and their peers are n't part of the Internet .
Anything you do inside stays inside .
If you cannot take your information home , then you should n't give somebody the legal and technical means to manage it â€ “ be it at zero price or for a fee .
Yahoo !
Messenger , Skype and their siblings are n't part of the Internet .
When you use a black - box program to chat , which connects to a black - box server , which only accepts people with a registered account within that black - box world , you are part of a closed , private network .
The incentive for a company to close up its network is great , because it binds users to their products .
This is n't mandatory for them to generate revenue , however .
For example , Facebook earns money by re-selling demographic consumer information ( ex : how many campus students under 20 have watched this or that movie ) and displaying targeted advertising .
There is nothing wrong in that , if the users are free to leave .
But these private networks stay under the control of the entity that owns them .
Only they can decide and influence their growth and evolution .
2 . Does it create a non-removable block ?
Imagine one single computer that would be necessary for the web to work .
Imagine every single user in the world systematically turning to this unique giant directory , in order to access anything in the network .
Imagine every creator / participant in the network having to register in the directory to exist inside the network .
Imagine that computer rating every page of the network with a 10 - point grade .
Imagine the company behind that computer earning its revenue from the lowest - rated pages .
And imagine the grade - attribution algorithm being entirely secret .
You 've got it !
It 's Google , of course .
As strange as it might sound , Google is certainly into networking â€ “ but it 's not helping the Internet .
There is n't an influential website which can afford not feeding Google with its content .
There is n't a low - ranking commercial website that can afford not buying their advertising .
Simply because we users have consecrated it as our do - everything Internet service .
Crumb : a hint of an answer
We can change the course of things .
The two keys to success are open protocols and a decentralized system .
Suggestion
Vision : Instead of signing up into different services and logging in into different private networks , Joe user has all of his social Internet uses met by one application , Loaf .
He can do either of the following :
1 . Run a limited version of Loaf at no cost , through various Internet companies , similar to today 's blog providers .
2 . Run the full application with a web host of his choice ( at the cost of a hosting fee ) .
Loaf is free software , and is based on an open set of protocols called Crumb ( for the sake of finding a modest name ) .
Anyone can develop / adapt an application to read a Crumb profile .
A decentralized social network
The key idea is to create a social network that does not rely on a private server .
Joe creates his Crumb profile through Loaf , and interacts with other users who also have a Crumb profile .
Any of them can host their profile where they choose â€ “ it is the working principle of the Jabber instant messaging , applied to social networking as a whole .
Here are a few aspects :
An ID and a buddy list â€ ”
The focus should be on private communication , regulated with identification similar to that of Jabber .
Joe lets Janet access his profile by adding her Crumb ID ( [ email protected ] ) in his buddy list .
Text and picture sharing â€ ”
The core of the exchange will of course be text , in the form of blog - like entries , and picture sharing , with a system of comments .
From basic functionality , we can later evolve into more advanced , Facebook - like interaction .
IM integration â € ” Thanks to the maturity of Jabber / XMPP , it should not be difficult to integrate a Jabber account into the Crumb profile , and an XMPP server into Loaf .
Instant messaging could be done directly on - line through the Loaf interface , or more traditionally with a PC client .
Room for plenty more â€ ”
Once the features above are working , a set of plug-ins could be developed for Loaf .
Some ideas include a full webmail , private file exchange ( ex. allowing arbitrary people to access one large file ) , public blog , and streaming video hosting .
In the long term , Loaf could evolve into a complete personal work and leisure space , provided by companies like Facebook , but which would give users the possibility to leave with their data at any time and host their profile elsewhere .
And does it all matter in the end ?
Yes it does .
More and more of our computing is networked , and the day might come when the only software used on your personal computers is a set of hardware drivers .
The core of our activities and information will stay online â€ ” it 's now up to us to decide whether this will be inside a few competing , closed private networks , or within a mesh with no center nor owner , otherwise known as the Internet .
It 's not that difficult .
The majority of what we need is here : RSS for dynamic content , XHTML for text , PHP - capable hosting , XMPP for instant messaging , high quality blogging software .
We 're only lacking a single , attractive platform to compete with the Facebooks out there .
Perhaps Crumb exists already somewhere ; if so , it 's time we heard more about it .
So everyone can contribute to the Internet again .

Telecommunications Minister Stephen Conroy says new measures are being put in place to provide greater protection to children from online pornography and violent websites .
Senator Conroy says it will be mandatory for all internet service providers to provide clean feeds , or ISP filtering , to houses and schools that are free of pornography and inappropriate material .
Online civil libertarians have warned the freedom of the internet is at stake , but Senator Conroy says that is nonsense .
He says the scheme will better protect children from pornography and violent websites .
" Labor makes no apologies to those that argue that any regulation of the internet is like going down the Chinese road , " he said .
" If people equate freedom of speech with watching child pornography , then the Rudd - Labor Government is going to disagree . "
Senator Conroy says anyone wanting uncensored access to the internet will have to opt out of the service .
He says the Government will work with the industry to ensure the filters do not affect the speed of the internet .
" There are people who are going to make all sorts of statements about the impact on the [ internet ] speed , " he said .
" The internet has n't ground to a halt in the UK , it has n't ground to a halt in Scandinavian countries and it's not grinding the internet to a halt in Europe .
" But that is why we are engaged constructively with the sector , engaging in trials to find a way to implement this in the best possible way and to work with the sector . "
Iowahawk Guest Commentary

Board Certified Gastroenterologist and former Jihad Associate , al Qaeda UK
Ever have " one of those days ? "
Sure , all of us go through the occasional rough patch , but I swear there are times when I think Allah must really have it in for me .
I mean , I know the " Big Guy " is supposed to have a sense of humor , but do I always have to be the punchline ?
Take for example this last week .
A few mates and I had been planning a big martyrdom weekend for quite a while ; it 's something we first began discussing a few years ago in medical school back in Amman .
We were sitting around the dorm eating pizza , cramming for a big anatomy final , when Ali said " you know , after graduation , we should get together for something really big . "
We talked about a fishing trip to Canada or something , but most of the guys thought that sounded pretty boring .
Abdul suggested a golf weekend in Cancun , but the all - inclusives there can get pretty pricey in - season .
Hassan ( who 's really into motorcycles ) suggested renting Harleys and going to Sturgis for the Biker Rally , but we heard that crowd can get pretty rowdy .
Anyhoo , Achmed finally says , " how about packing cars with explosives and killing hundreds of random infidels in a coordinated series of gigantic fireballs ? "
And we 're like , fuckin ' A !
Not only would it be an awesome bonding experience ( with plenty of Paradise poontang , LOL ) , we would be doing a valuable community service .
Okay , so we high - fived and made a solemn promise that we 'd target two years after graduation for the big weekend prank blowout .
I know how it usually goes with these kinds of fraternity things ; what with starting up a medical practice , honor killing obligations , and starting a family , it 's easy to lose touch with the old school buddies .
But this thing -- our thing -- was serious , you know ?
Thanks to email we were able to keep in touch and keep the plan going .
As luck would have it , we all won Achmedinijad scholarships to do our residencies in England for the National Health Service .
We got our families together most every weekend for backyard cookouts and self - flagellation and TV football matches .
Afterwards me and the other guys would slip out to the garage for cigars , and to pack shrapnel .
So okay , the big weekend arrives , and the guys come over to my place bright and early , everybody 's jazzed about rolling up some kufr carnage .
All the propane tanks and propellant and nail cannisters are ready to go .
I look at Ali and say , " okay mate , back up your car to the garage and I 'll start loading it up . "
He gets this dumbstruck look on his face and says , " my car ?
I thought Hassan was going to do the martyrdom . "
And then Hassan does a massive spit - take with his tea , and he 's like , " whoa dude , I rigged the cell phones , I did n't agree to blow up .
I thought Mohammed was going to do the blowing up . "
Then Mohammed 's like , " do n't look at me , pal , I thought I was just providing the spiritual guidance .
Plus my car 's in the shop for transmission work . "
From there it just descended into this big shouting match .
Holy frickin ' prophet , two years of planning this prank and now everybody wants to pussy out on the actual martyrdom .
Long story short , we decided to draw straws .
And guess who wins ?
Yep , yours truly , good old sucker Khalid , the same guy with a pile of charge card receipts for petrol and propane and hardware .
The same guy who ended up having to host two thirds of the martyrdom planning parties at HIS house , because his good old college " pals " always have some convenient excuse about " kitchen remodeling " or " MI6 surveillance , " and never lift a finger to help clean up the empty bottles or paper plates or the C5 mess .
Well , you know what they say : no good deed goes unpunished .
Then the other short straw get pulled by Bilal , and I 'm like , oh , great .
Now I 'll be banging some celestial virgin with that wanker looking over my shoulder .
So , I 'm like , " okay , whose donating the cars ? "
And these dicks just look around at each other , and ANOTHER big argument breaks out , because " I still have 28 payments left , " or " it 's due for a tyre rotation , " or some other lame excuse .
So we draw straws again to pick the explosion cars , and guess who wins ?
Yup , my Benz , the same fucking car I just paid £ 129.95 to have detailed .
So I go to the house and tell my wife Jumanah about the whole deal , and here it comes -- The Look . complete with the whole exasperated eye roll and head shake .
I swear , if her dad was n't my uncle , I 'd be tempted to smack that irritating sneer right off her face .
So she 's like , " fine , go have your fun with your lazy jihad buddies and your 72 virgins .
Just leave me the keys to the Jeep so I can get groceries . "
After that , I guess I was pretty much ready to get it over with .
I called up the office and had them cancel the rest of my patient appointments for the day and drove the Benz to London , which incidentally cost me another £ 40 for gas and tolls .
When I got to Picadilly and parked in front of the nightclub and called Achmed on my cell to let 'er rip .
Nothing .
I sat there waiting 3 minutes waiting for the cell phone detonator to go off , nothing .
I saw a cop walking toward the Benz , so I hopped out and started booking it and almost got run over by a double decker .
I got on the Tube , thinking I was safe , but then all the stupid racist kufrs started giving me the stinkeye because apparently they 're freaked by panting Arabs smelling of gasoline .
I got out in Ealing and went to the mosque where the other guys were supposed to be , and they 're all standing around like a bunch of sheepish idiots .
So I 'm like , " WTF ?
What happened with the detonation ? "
Get this :
Mohammed , whose only job it was to call in a simple fucking detonation code , switched his cell carrier to get the new iPhone and forgot to transfer his goddamn detonation contact list .
So I 'm like , " how about Bilal ?
Did he explode ?
Please tell me exploded . "
The dopey expressions around the room told me otherwise .
Faaaack .
Now there 's NO dead infidels , NO horny virgins , and I 'm out one leased Mercedes with a £ 12,000 balloon payment .
So I go , " here 's the deal guys .
I just put my ass on the martrydom line , and it was Allah 's will that it did n't happen .
So why do n't we just call it good , and try again in another two years . "
Crissakes , you would have thought I just took a dump in their falafel .
They started talking about " Ummah Pride , " and " giving it all for ol ' Central Jordan U.. "
So I said fine , let 's draw straws again .
Because , hey , what are the odds of me pulling martyrdom duty twice in a row ?
Guess I should have been a stat major , because there I was holding the short stick again .
When Bilal pulled the other short stick , I just went ahead and volunteered my Jeep because I figured the way this day was going it was gonna get blown up one way or the other .
When Bilal and I got back to my house Jumanah had just gotten back from Tesco and was unloading groceries .
" I thought you were supposed to be in Paradise by now , " she said , in that stupid irritating voice .
" Change of plans , " I said .
" We need to head up to Glasgow to blow up the airport . "
Here it came again .
The Look .
" Um , and we need to use the Jeep . "
The Look X 2 .
" And our faces are all over the TV , so we need you to drive us . "
I wo n't even bother trying to describe her face at that point .
We loaded up the rest of the explosive cannisters in the back of the Jeep and headed north on the M1 in the middle of the out - of - town holiday rush traffic .
Jumanah pretty much seethed the entire way , complaining about the traffic and the gasoline fumes .
Needless to say when we finally got to Glasgow and dropped her off at a roadside cafe , I was pretty much geared up for the sweet release of death .
Okay , so Bilal and I get psyched up , check all the equipment to make sure it 's ready for a big boom , point the Jeep at the terminal , and mash the throttle .
I 'm shouting " Allahu Akbar , " and Bilal 's shouting " Allahu Akbar " and " Go Martyrs " just like the old pep squad days at CJU .
And I 'm thinking , " oil up them virgins Allah , ' cause Dr. K's luck is about to change . "
BAAAAM !
Right into the glass .
I was probably out for a two , three seconds .
Bilal and I peeled our broken noses out of the airbags , which meant we were still alive , which meant the goddamn cannisters did n't explode , again .
Maybe we went through into the terminal and killed some infidels , I thought , then I saw we had n't made it in more than a couple inches into the terminal .
I mean , WTF ?
The Jeep salesman kept going on about how the Jeep was this awesome unstoppable American SUV that crusader cowboys use to bulldoze their way through mountain forests , with an easy payment plan , and the damn thing can't make it through a bloody plate glass window .
I restart the engine and now the piece of shit just sits there spinning the tyres .
" All wheel traction , " my arse .
Okay , plan B. Bilal and I start pushing backup detonation buttons and cell codes .
A couple of pops , but they were all duds .
Then I see the cops coming at me .
As Allah is my witness , I really can't explain what happened next ; maybe it was stress , or confusion , or frustration .
Whatever the reason , I decided it was a reasonable idea at that point to pour a can of petrol over my head and hit the Bic .
Here 's a handy health tip from Doctor K : if you ever get a wild urge to start yourself on fire , sit down and relax until it goes away .
Because ( A ) it 's not a particularly useful method for killing infidels , and ( B ) it . hurts .
like .
a. motherfucker .
So much that I almost enjoyed the distraction those high - pressure water canons and getting my lights punched out by that crazy mumble - mouthed Scottish baggage handler .
By the way , did I mention I also started the Jeep on fire ?
Only 37 more payments of £ 438 to go .
After that , I really did n't mind getting bludgeoned by those angry bagpipers .
The sound was horrible , but at least they got the rest of the flames out .
I was almost relieved when the cops were cuffing me face down on the pavement , because by that point I was pretty much reconsidering this whole college martyrdom pledge prank thIng and I figured the worst was over .
No such luck .
Here 's another handy health tip from Doctor K : if your skin is half melted and bubbly hot , avoid laying down on any surfaces that are n't Teflon coated .
And please note : the Glasgow sidewalks are n't .
After a half hour with a spatula and ten cans of Pam , the cops finally got 95 % or so of me peeled off the sidewalk .
I looked down at my legs and realized that I 'll be saving a lot of money on clothes from now on , because I 'm sporting a permanent pair of melted - on black polyester trousers .
And then the kicker : I looked down at my package and noticed " Little Khalid " was AWOL .
As they were loading me into the the police wagon I glanced back over my shoulder and saw what was was left of him charbroiling on the sidewalk .
Then one of the bomb sniffing dogs gobbled him down like a snausage .
A fat lot of good those 72 virgin are going to me now .
Final box score : I 'm out one Mercedes , one Jeep , £ 2000 in miscellaneous bomb materials , three layers of skin , and one very low - mileage penis .
Infidels killed : nil .
So the next time you want to bitch to me about how bad your day is going , do n't expect a lot of sympathy .
Well , gotta go .
The interrogators are coming , and afterwards I 've got an appointment to have my arse skin grafted on to my face .
But I will leave you with one more handy tip from Doctor K : no matter how many virgins they promise , do n't ever join a fraternity .
Constitutional scholar : ' At least six identifiable crimes ' possible in CIA tape affair David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday December 19 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This White House involvement in the CIA 's decision to destroy videotapes documenting severe interrogation techniques of suspected terrorists could constitute as many as six crimes , according to constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley .
Turley appeared on CNN to discuss a new report from the New York Times , which indicates that four White House attorneys , including then - White House counsels Alberto Gonzales and Harriet Miers , participated in discussions with the CIA about whether or not the tapes should be destroyed .
The talks also reportedly included David Addington , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former counsel and current chief of staff ; and former senior National Security Council lawyer John Bellinger .
" Just when you think this scandal can't get worse , it does , " the George Washington University Law School professor told CNN's John Roberts .
" I mean , this is a very significant development because it shows that this was not just some rogue operator at the CIA that destroyed evidence being sought by Congress and the courts .
It shows that this was a planned destruction , that there were meetings , and those meetings extended all the way to the White House . "
Turley went on to say that the high - level discussions , particularly those involving Miers and Gonzales , were " a hair 's breath away from the president himself . "
Asked whether " through inference " the talks might have extended to the Oval Office , Turley suggested the possibility existed .
" I think it 's more than an inference at this point , which is one of the reasons there 's a call for a special prosecutor , " he said .
" There are at least six identifiable crimes here , from obstruction of justice to obstruction of Congress , perjury , conspiracy , false statements , and what is often forgotten : the crime of torturing suspects .
Added Turley , " If that crime was committed it was a crime that would conceivably be ordered by the president himself , only the president can order those types of special treatments or interrogation techniques . "
The Times reports that a former senior intelligence official told the paper that there was a " ' vigorous sentiment ' among some top White House officials to destroy the tapes . "
Other officials said that there was no White House push for their destruction .
US District Judge Henry Kennedy , who in 2005 ordered that the US preserve " all evidence and information " regarding torture and other abuses , has scheduled a Friday hearing to investigate the destruction of the tapes .
" Judge Kennedy is obviously not taking the advice of the Justice Department , that told him not to interfere , " Turley said of the upcoming hearing .
" Courts do n't understand when the government destroys evidence -- particularly evidence that was sought by Congress and other courts .
So it 's not going to be a good day for the Justice Department . "
This video is from CNN's American Morning , broadcast on December 19 , 2007 .
Beneath a moonlit Arctic sky , Joe Swan Jr. and most of his 12 - person crew were taking a cigarette break when a dump truck arrived and emptied another load of black sand at their feet .
The backhoe driver , who happened to be his wife , gunned the engine , spewing a diesel haze into the air as she dug into the pile and filled another 2,500 - pound sandbag for the sea wall shielding the island from the Chukchi Sea .
The crew has been repairing the $ 3 - million wall almost since the day it was completed in October 2006 .
They bring more sand .
The ocean takes it away .

Kivalina is disappearing , the victim of a warming world and a steady natural erosion that probably began long before the Eskimos settled here 100 years ago .
“ You see the white water out there ? ” Swan said , pointing to some ripples a couple hundred feet offshore .
“ That ’s where the beach used to be . ”
When he was growing up here in the 1970s , the ocean would freeze each fall into a slush the thickness of mashed potatoes .
Waves from the storms would crash into the ice , not the shore .
Lately , the autumn ocean has been a vast , iceless expanse that leaves the beach vulnerable to waves .
The island is now a sliver of sand and permafrost less than 600 feet across at its widest point .
The Army Corps of Engineers estimates it will be 10 to 15 years before the ground beneath the clump of clapboard houses washes away .

The prospect of Kivalina ’s disappearance has set off its own storm , jarring a place that , like most of global warming ’s early victims , has long struggled on the fringes of the planet .
Most of the 400 residents -- filled with dreams of a new village with running water , better homes and , perhaps , a chance at a job -- want to leave .
The big questions are : To where ?
And how ?
Village leaders have squabbled for years with state and federal officials over relocating , which could cost as much as $ 250 million .
No one has offered to pay .
Advertisement
Residents themselves are divided over where to go .
Some want to move to higher ground .
Others want to stay on the coast , even at the risk of seeing their new homes eventually disappear to erosion and rising seas .
It ’s an impasse that has left them stuck on a shrinking mound of sand that even their ancestors thought was a lousy place to build a town .
“ We ’d love to move -- get off this island , ” Swan said .
There is no heroic battle to stop the advancing water .

“ Every time they do something , the surge comes in and destroys all their work , ” said tribal administrator Colleen Swan , who walks by the wall every day .
“ It ’s like a bucket that keeps developing holes . ”
From the air , the island of Kivalina looks like a giant tadpole .
The tail is a barren wisp of sand six miles long .
The ocean steadily laps at one side .
A silty lagoon fed by two rivers is on the other .
“ Kivalina is nothing but fine sand , ” said Oscar Swan , 84 , as a grandson served him canned sausages for lunch while static buzzed over a citizens band radio .

Located 85 miles north of the Arctic Circle , Kivalina was once an occasional hunting camp for the Eskimos , who moved with the seasons in their constant search for seals , caribou and fish .
When the U.S. government started building a settlement here in 1905 , it chose the widest section of the island -- the head of the tadpole .
As the story goes , a sea captain delivering lumber for construction of a school saw a couple of Eskimos along the shore .
It was as good a spot as any to unload .
Today , about 70 homes sit on short stilts above the permafrost .
Most homes have no running water and the standard toilet is a 5 - gallon bucket .
A shower costs $ 3 at the “ washeteria . ”
Life in Kivalina can be as bleak as the landscape .

There is little work in town , and those who want to make a decent living have to head to the borough seat in Kotzebue or the Red Dog Mine , the world ’s largest zinc operation , about 45 miles away .
For those who stay , the center of social life is the city - run bingo hall , where the average adult loses $ 750 a year .
Last year , three people committed suicide .
In the last eight years , there have been three killings .
“ Some have gotten numb to their pain , ” said Lowell Sage , the pastor at Kivalina Friends Church , whose brother was stabbed to death by a neighbor several years ago .
Despite the problems , most people choose to stay .
It ’s a familiar place at the junction of the ocean , the tundra and two rivers .
Whaling expeditions set out each spring .
And all over town , the hides of freshly killed caribou and seals hang from wooden racks .
Advertisement
“ You take our hunting , fishing , gathering away , you take our culture , ” Sage said as he pulled a beaver - skin cap over his ears during a hunting trip up the Wulik River .
It ’s often biting cold , but in recent years , people have begun noticing tiny changes .
For the first time anybody could remember , it rained in January .
Furnaces were turned off after May .
When Joe Swan Sr. , 72 , checked his cold cellar , a deep hole in the ground where meat is aged over the summer , he found that his caribou and seal had rotted .
The surrounding permafrost had thawed , filling the pit with water .
He had heard about global warming , and some of his neighbors embraced the idea , especially after storms in 2004 and ’05 cut huge swaths out of the beach .
Advertisement
But he has remained skeptical because Kivalina has always been eroding .
An 1838 explorer ’s account said the island was about 1,800 feet wide , three times what it is today .
Most of that was lost long before anybody talked about global warming .
But what really got people uncomfortable was when the rest of the world started pointing at them as the leading edge of an impending climatic apocalypse .
An April report by the U.N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change named Kivalina as an example of the costs of relocating coastal communities .
The village was mentioned last year on “ The Oprah Winfrey Show ” as an example of global warming ’s toll .
Fears of global warming came to a head in September , when weather reports warned that a powerful storm was on track to strike Kivalina .
Bad storms usually came in the fall , but this time borough officials ordered an evacuation and dispatched small planes to whisk away the elders .
Advertisement
Mayor Austin Swan and Vice Mayor Enoch Adams Jr. went door to door , warning residents to get off the island .
All - terrain vehicles were loaded onto metal skiffs , and evacuees crossed the narrow channel at the south end of the island , then rumbled down the beach in a ragged caravan .
It was dark by the time they reached the DeLong Mountain Terminal , a port 17 miles away serving the zinc mine , and boarded buses for the mine headquarters .
Raymond Hawley , 74 , a hunter and carpenter , could n’t figure out what all the fuss was about .
It always stormed in the fall , and from what he had heard on the radio , this one did n’t sound particularly bad .
Two of his children were already off the island , in prison .
He and the rest of his family were staying .
Advertisement
Hawley went to church and prayed .
Then he went home to bed .
“ I woke up early the next morning , expecting a big wind , ” he said .
“ I looked out , but there was no storm . ”
As the villagers returned , some grumbled that the town administrators had ordered the evacuation to impress other government officials with Kivalina ’s plight .
In the old days , everybody just waited out the storm .
This is , after all , the Arctic .
But Adams said that with the ocean so close to homes , the village could n’t afford to take any chances .
The $ 3 - million sea wall , their last line of defense , was n’t much protection .
“ If we get a southwest storm , this is all going to wash away faster than you can say , ‘ Oh my God , ’ ” he said .
Advertisement
The good news , at least for those lucky enough to have a job on the wall , was that the storm had knocked out a few more chunks .
That meant a couple weeks of longer shifts , at $ 22.50 an hour .
The work could continue for years -- and so could the strife it caused .
When the city announced it was hiring for the wall , it received 65 applications for 26 slots .
Amos Hawley , a clerk at the general store , said those who did n’t get hired were resentful because so many who got the jobs were part of the Swan family .
“ They ’re always getting the jobs , ” Hawley said .
“ This repair is all Swans . ”
Advertisement
City Administrator Janet Mitchell said the city simply hired the best - trained workers .
Her sister , Colleen Swan , added : “ All people can do is complain about not having enough money , being broke . ”
The aftermath of the storm was a hectic time .
The City Council passed a resolution declaring a “ disaster emergency . ” Colleen Swan flew to Anchorage to testify about coastal erosion before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery .
Adams spent days on the phone with borough officials in Kotzebue .
Advertisement
As he pleaded for more sandbags , the CB radio crackled in the background : Somebody had stolen a seal skin and some beluga meat during the evacuation .
“ These children need to behave , ” the voice on the radio ranted .
All in all , global warming made for a chaotic autumn .
“ We ’ve got to get off the island .
It ’s obvious , ” Adams said .

A class at the high school was assigned to write to President Bush .
“ Erosion is destroying our island , ” wrote Kelly Hawley , 17 , a senior .
“ We ask if you can provide help for our poor island . ”
Propping her 8 - month - old baby on her lap at home , Hawley explained that the issue is n’t just about erosion , it ’s about making a new start in life .
“ I want to move , ” she said .
“ We have no flush toilets or running water .
There ’s not many places to hang out . ”
The idea of moving has simmered for decades .
In the early 1950s , the village held a vote on moving after some minor flooding , but the proposal failed .
The village formed a relocation committee in 1990 , and held referendums in 1998 and 2000 .
In the last vote , a rutty patch of oceanfront tundra known as Kiniktuuraq , just a couple miles down the coast , beat out three other candidates , garnering 53 votes out of the 99 cast .
Advertisement
There were no offers to pay for relocation , but Adams , the vice mayor , thought the village ’s chances were good because of all the publicity that had turned Kivalina into an icon of climatic disaster .
“ The federal government will give us the money , ” he said .
“ Global warming is going to sell itself . ”
But after a two - year study of possible relocation sites , the Army Corps of Engineers concluded last year that Kiniktuuraq was no good .
It too was vulnerable to erosion , flooding and permafrost thawing -- and would become more vulnerable as the planet warmed .
Building there would require depositing a layer of gravel at least 9 feet thick , adding $ 100 million to the cost of relocation , according to the report .
Advertisement
The corps favored two inland sites on higher ground : Imnakuk Bluffs and Tatchim Isua .
The report put village officials in a bit of a bind .
The specter of global warming was now sinking their chances of moving to the site they wanted .
At the congressional hearing last month , Colleen Swan downplayed global warming ’s effects on the northwest Alaskan coast , saying there was n’t enough evidence and many people had doubts .
In October , amid grumbling over job shortages and the lack of progress on relocation , the mayor and vice mayor were voted out of office .
Advertisement
Pastor Sage said he was still confident Kivalina would eventually be moved .
It will just take a big enough storm .
“ If Kivalina floods or something really bad happens , then they ’ll move us , ” he said .
“ That ’s the only time we ’ll get money . ”
The corps ’ estimate for the cheapest site is $ 155 million , or about $ 387,000 a person .
The idea has come up of simply paying everyone to move to Kotzebue or Nome , but it has n’t generated much enthusiasm .
The only other option residents see is a stronger sea wall , one made of rock .
The corps estimates it would cost $ 33 million to protect the southern tip of the island .
For now , the workers bring more sand .
Advertisement
They stack sandbags Monday through Friday but stop on the weekends because there is n’t enough money .
Just before the winter ice finally began to form , Joe Swan Jr.'s wife , perched at the backhoe controls , swung another bag over the crumbling shoreline and lowered it into place .
Several empty bags , long ago stripped of their sand , bobbed in the tide like massive jellyfish .

Beginning each New Year and lasting for nearly a week , the Quadrantid Meteor Shower sparkles across the night sky for nearly all viewers around the world .
Its radiant belongs to an extinct constellation once known as Quadran Muralis , but any meteors will seem to come from the general direction of bright Arcturus and BoÃ¶tes .
This is a very narrow stream , which may have once belonged to a portion of the Aquarids , but recent scientific data points to a what may have been a cosmic collision .
According the most recent data , the Quandrantid meteors may have been formed about five centuries ago when a near - Earth asteroid named 2003 EH1 and a comet smashed into one another .
Historic records from ancient China put comet C/1490 Y1 in the path of probability .
As Jupiter ’s gravity continues to perturb the stream , another 400 years may mean this shower will become as extinct as the constellation for which it was once known …
But NASA scientists and astronomers are taking to the skies to study the event .
A Gulfstream V aircraft will fly scientists and their instruments for 10 continuous hours over the Arctic to observe and record meteor activity .
From above the Earth , the stream can be studied without light pollution and clouds to determine when the activity peaks and how the stream is dispersed .
â€ œWe will fly to the North Pole and back to compensate for Earth ’s rotation and to keep the stream in view throughout the flight , â€ ? said Peter Jenniskens , a principal investigator at NASA ’s Ames Research Center .
According to NASA , scientists believe this could be the most brilliant meteor shower in 2008 with over 100 visible meteors per hour at its peak .
Best viewing times with the highest meteor rates are expected to be in either the late evening of Jan. 3 over Europe and western Asia or the early morning of Jan. 4 over the eastern United States .
For the USA : 6 pm â€ “ 2 am ( Pacific Time ) on Jan. 3 and 4 , 2008 .
For Northern Europe : 2 am â€ “ 10 am ( London ) on Jan. 4 , 2008 .
For Northern Asia : 11 am â€ “ 7 pm ( Tokyo ) on Jan. 4 , 2008 .
For almost of us , this means bundling up against the cold and battling the remnants of the waning Moon …
But the sight of even one “ shooting star ” can make the trip worthwhile !
Will the Quadrantid Meteor Shower live up to its expectations ?
No one knows for sure …
But we ’ll be watching !
Is There a God ? by Bertrand Russell ( commissioned - but not published - by Illustrated Magazine in 1952 )
The question whether there is a God is one which is decided on very different grounds by different communities and different individuals .
The immense majority of mankind accept the prevailing opinion of their own community .
In the earliest times of which we have definite history everybody believed in many gods .
It was the Jews who first believed in only one .
The first commandment , when it was new , was very difficult to obey because the Jews had believed that Baal and Ashtaroth and Dagon and Moloch and the rest were real gods but were wicked because they helped the enemies of the Jews .
The step from a belief that these gods were wicked to the belief that they did not exist was a difficult one .
There was a time , namely that of Antiochus IV , when a vigorous attempt was made to Hellenize the Jews .
Antiochus decreed that they should eat pork , abandon circumcision , and take baths .
Most of the Jews in Jerusalem submitted , but in country places resistance was more stubborn and under the leadership of the Maccabees the Jews at last established their right to their peculiar tenets and customs .
Monotheism , which at the beginning of the Antiochan persecution had been the creed of only part of one very small nation , was adopted by Christianity and later by Islam , and so became dominant throughout the whole of the world west of India .
From India eastward , it had no success : Hinduism had many gods ; Buddhism in its primitive form had none ; and Confucianism had none from the eleventh century onward .
But , if the truth of a religion is to be judged by its worldly success , the argument in favor of monotheism is a very strong one , since it possessed the largest armies , the largest navies , and the greatest accumulation of wealth .
In our own day this argument is growing less decisive .
It is true that the un-Christian menace of Japan was defeated .
But the Christian is now faced with the menace of atheistic Muscovite hordes , and it is not so certain as one could wish that atomic bombs will provide a conclusive argument on the side of theism .
But let us abandon this political and geographical way of considering religions , which has been increasingly rejected by thinking people ever since the time of the ancient Greeks .
Ever since that time there have been men who were not content to accept passively the religious opinions of their neighbors , but endeavoured to consider what reason and philosophy might have to say about the matter .
In the commercial cities of Ionia , where philosophy was invented , there were free - thinkers in the sixth century B.C. Compared to modern free - thinkers they had an easy task , because the Olympian gods , however charming to poetic fancy , were hardly such as could be defended by the metaphysical use of the unaided reason .
They were met popularly by Orphism ( to which Christianity owes much ) and , philosophically , by Plato , from whom the Greeks derived a philosophical monotheism very different from the political and nationalistic monotheism of the Jews .
When the Greek world became converted to Christianity it combined the new creed with Platonic metaphysics and so gave birth to theology .
Catholic theologians , from the time of Saint Augustine to the present day , have believed that the existence of one God could be proved by the unaided reason .
Their arguments were put into final form by Saint Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century .
When modern philosophy began in the seventeenth century , Descartes and Leibniz took over the old arguments somewhat polished up , and , owing largely to their efforts , piety remained intellectually respectable .
But Locke , although himself a completely convinced Christian , undermined the theoretical basis of the old arguments , and many of his followers , especially in France , became Atheists .
I will not attempt to set forth in all their subtlety the philosophical arguments for the existence of God .
There is , I think , only one of them which still has weight with philosophers , that is the argument of the First Cause .
This argument maintains that , since everything that happens has a cause , there must be a First Cause from which the whole series starts .
The argument suffers , however , from the same defect as that of the elephant and the tortoise .
It is said ( I do not know with what truth ) that a certain Hindu thinker believed the earth to rest upon an elephant .
When asked what the elephant rested upon , he replied that it rested upon a tortoise .
When asked what the tortoise rested upon , he said , " I am tired of this .
Suppose we change the subject . "
This illustrates the unsatisfactory character of the First - Cause argument .
Nevertheless , you will find it in some ultra-modern treatises on physics , which contend that physical processes , traced backward in time , show that there must have been a sudden beginning and infer that this was due to divine Creation .
They carefully abstain from attempts to show that this hypothesis makes matters more intelligible .
The scholastic arguments for the existence of a Supreme Being are now rejected by most Protestant theologians in favor of new arguments which to my mind are by no means an improvement .
The scholastic arguments were genuine efforts of thought and , if their reasoning had been sound , they would have demonstrated the truth of their conclusion .
The new arguments , which Modernists prefer , are vague , and the Modernists reject with contempt every effort to make them precise .
There is an appeal to the heart as opposed to the intellect .
It is not maintained that those who reject the new arguments are illogical , but that they are destitute of deep feeling or of moral sense .
Let us nevertheless examine the modern arguments and see whether there is anything that they really prove .
One of the favourite arguments is from evolution .
The world was once lifeless , and when life began it was a poor sort of life consisting of green slime and other uninteresting things .
Gradually by the course of evolution , it developed into animals and plants and at last into MAN .
Man , so the theologians assure us , is so splendid a Being that he may well be regarded as the culmination to which the long ages of nebula and slime were a prelude .
I think the theologians must have been fortunate in their human contacts .
They do not seem to me to have given due weight to Hitler or the Beast of Belsen .
If Omnipotence , with all time at its disposal , thought it worth while to lead up to these men through the many millions of years of evolution , I can only say that the moral and aesthetic taste involved is peculiar .
However , the theologians no doubt hope that the future course of evolution will produce more men like themselves and fewer men like Hitler .
Let us hope so .
But , in cherishing this hope , we are abandoning the ground of experience and taking refuge in an optimism which history so far does not support .
There are other objections to this evolutionary optimism .
There is every reason to believe that life on our planet will not continue forever so that any optimism based upon the course of terrestrial history must be temporary and limited in its purview .
There may , of course , be life elsewhere but , if there is , we know nothing about it and have no reason to suppose that it bears more resemblance to the virtuous theologians than to Hitler .
The earth is a very tiny corner of the universe .
It is a little fragment of the solar system .
The solar system is a little fragment of the Milky Way .
And the Milky Way is a little fragment of the many millions of galaxies revealed by modern telescopes .
In this little insignificant corner of the cosmos there is a brief interlude between two long lifeless epochs .
In this brief interlude , there is a much briefer one containing man .
If really man is the purpose of the universe the preface seems a little long .
One is reminded of some prosy old gentleman who tells an interminable anecdote all quite uninteresting until the rather small point in which it ends .
I do not think theologians show a suitable piety in making such a comparison possible .
It has been one of the defects of theologians at all times to over - esti-mate the importance of our planet .
No doubt this was natural enough in the days before Copernicus when it was thought that the heavens revolve about the earth .
But since Copernicus and still more since the modern exploration of distant regions , this pre-occupation with the earth has become rather parochial .
If the universe had a Creator , it is hardly reasonable to suppose that He was specially interested in our little corner .
And , if He was not ,
His values must have been different from ours , since in the immense majority of regions life is impossible .
There is a moralistic argument for belief in God , which was popularized by William James .
According to this argument , we ought to believe in God because , if we do not , we shall not behave well .
The first and greatest objection to this argument is that , at its best , it cannot prove that there is a God but only that politicians and educators ought to try to make people think there is one .
Whether this ought to be done or not is not a theological question but a political one .
The arguments are of the same sort as those which urge that children should be taught respect for the flag .
A man with any genuine religious feeling will not be content with the view that the belief in God is useful , because he will wish to know whether , in fact , there is a God .
It is absurd to contend that the two questions are the same .
In the nursery , belief in Father Christmas is useful , but grown - up people do not think that this proves Father Christmas to be real .
Since we are not concerned with politics we might consider this sufficient refutation of the moralistic argument , but it is perhaps worthwhile to pursue this a little further .
It is , in the first place , very doubtful whether belief in God has all the beneficial moral effects that are attributed to it .
Many of the best men known to history have been unbelievers .
John Stuart Mill may serve as an instance .
And many of the worst men known to history have been believers .
Of this there are innumerable instances .
Perhaps Henry VIII may serve as typical .
However that may be , it is always disastrous when governments set to work to uphold opinions for their utility rather than for their truth .
As soon as this is done it becomes necessary to have a censorship to suppress adverse arguments , and it is thought wise to discourage thinking among the young for fear of encouraging " dangerous thoughts . "
When such mal - practices are employed against religion as they are in Soviet Russia , the theologians can see that they are bad , but they are still bad when employed in defence of what the theologians think good .
Freedom of thought and the habit of giving weight to evidence are matters of far greater moral import than the belief in this or that theological dogma .
On all these grounds it cannot be maintained that theological beliefs should be upheld for their usefulness without regard to their truth .
There is a simpler and more naive form of the same argument , which appeals to many individuals .
People will tell us that without the consolations of religion they would be intolerably unhappy .
So far as this is true , it is a coward 's argument .
Nobody but a coward would consciously choose to live in a fool 's paradise .
When a man suspects his wife of infidelity , he is not thought the better of for shutting his eyes to the evidence .
And I can not see why ignoring evidence should be contemptible in one case and admirable in the other .
Apart from this argument the importance of religion in contributing to individual happiness is very much exaggerated .
Whether you are happy or unhappy depends upon a number of factors .
Most people need good health and enough to eat .
They need the good opinion of their social milieu and the affection of their intimates .
They need not only physical health but mental health .
Given all these things , most people will be happy whatever their theology .
Without them , most people will be unhappy , whatever their theology .
In thinking over the people I have known , I do not find that on the average those who had religious beliefs were happier than those who had not .
When I come to my own beliefs , I find myself quite unable to discern any purpose in the universe , and still more unable to wish to discern one .
Those who imagine that the course of cosmic evolution is slowly leading up to some consummation pleasing to the Creator , are logically committed ( though they usually fail to realize this ) to the view that the Creator is not omnipotent or , if He were omnipotent , He could decree the end without troubling about means .
I do not myself perceive any consummation toward which the universe is tending .
According to the physicists , energy will be gradually more evenly distributed and as it becomes more evenly distributed it will become more useless .
Gradually everything that we find interesting or pleasant , such as life and light , will disappear -- so , at least , they assure us .
The cosmos is like a theatre in which just once a play is performed , but , after the curtain falls , the theatre is left cold and empty until it sinks in ruins .
I do not mean to assert with any positiveness that this is the case .
That would be to assume more knowledge than we possess .
I say only that it is what is probable on present evidence .
I will not assert dogmatically that there is no cosmic purpose , but I will say that there is no shred of evidence in favor of there being one .
I will say further that , if there be a purpose and if this purpose is that of an Omnipotent Creator , then that Creator , so far from being loving and kind , as we are told , must be of a degree of wickedness scarcely conceivable .
A man who commits a murder is considered to be a bad man .
An Omnipotent Deity , if there be one , murders everybody .
A man who willingly afflicted another with cancer would be considered a fiend .
But the Creator , if He exists , afflicts many thousands every year with this dreadful disease .
A man who , having the knowledge and power required to make his children good , chose instead to make them bad , would be viewed with execration .
But God , if He exists , makes this choice in the case of very many of His children .
The whole conception of an omnipotent God whom it is impious to criticize , could only have arisen under oriental despotisms where sovereigns , in spite of capricious cruelties , continued to enjoy the adulation of their slaves .
It is the psychology appropriate to this outmoded political system which belatedly survives in orthodox theology .
There is , it is true , a Modernist form of theism , according to which God is not omnipotent , but is doing His best , in spite of great difficulties .
This view , although it is new among Christians , is not new in the history of thought .
It is , in fact , to be found in Plato .
I do not think this view can be proved to be false .
I think all that can be said is that there is no positive reason in its favour .
Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them .
This is , of course , a mistake .
If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit , nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes .
But if I were to go on to say that , since my assertion cannot be disproved , it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it , I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense .
If , however , the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books , taught as the sacred truth every Sunday , and instilled into the minds of children at school , hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time .
It is customary to suppose that , if a belief is widespread , there must be something reasonable about it .
I do not think this view can be held by anyone who has studied history .
Practically all the beliefs of savages are absurd .
In early civilizations there may be as much as one percent for which there is something to be said .
In our own day ....
But at this point I must be careful .
We all know that there are absurd beliefs in Soviet Russia .
If we are Protestants , we know that there are absurd beliefs among Catholics .
If we are Catholics , we know that there are absurd beliefs among Protestants .
If we are Conservatives , we are amazed by the superstitions to be found in the Labour Party .
If we are Socialists , we are aghast at the credulity of Conservatives .
I do not know , dear reader , what your beliefs may be , but whatever they may be , you must concede that nine - tenths of the beliefs of nine - tenths of mankind are totally irrational .
The beliefs in question are , of course , those which you do not hold .
I cannot , therefore , think it presumptuous to doubt something which has long been held to be true , especially when this opinion has only prevailed in certain geographical regions , as is the case with all theological opinions .
My conclusion is that there is no reason to believe any of the dogmas of traditional theology and , further , that there is no reason to wish that they were true .
Man , in so far as he is not subject to natural forces , is free to work out his own destiny .
The responsibility is his , and so is the opportunity .

An interview with Nicholas Francis from Otee , the makers of the Unity game development system .
The Unity folks have been reusing the Mono JIT engine as a game engine , here is a nice blurb about what Mono got them :
If I have to pull out a specific feature it would be our scripting interface :
We use Mono to get C# , JavaScript and Boo languages in there for gamecode .
This means you get a scripting language running incredibly fast ( * footnote : Initially , we used Python for GooBall .
With that we were spending 50 % of the CPU time inside scripting code .
When we switched to Mono , the same functionality dropped to 1 - 2 % CPU usage - we were completely blown away with how fast it is . ) so this is what you make your games in ( we also have C++ plugins for people who are passionate about C++ or need to use an existing library ) .
When you make a Mono class , all public variables show up in the inspector for easy modification .
So basically , Scripts are 1st class citizens of Unity .
We 're also using Mono for extending Unity -
It really is that good .
Hopefully , when I have some spare cycles ( hahahaha ) I would like to assist the Unity folks in porting their game engine to Linux .
Once we have a port to Linux , we could run most of the games unmodified ( the only exception would be those that require C++ plugins ) , educational software , architecture and advertising software that is being built today with Unity .
Human behavior , where it intersects with neuroscience , has the potential to be highly contentious .
The concept of free will is central , at least in monotheistic cultures , to most people 's understanding of behavior .
And no one likes being told that what they quite naturally consider to be their own ideologies or beliefs are a result of neurophysiological predestination .
There are other pitfalls associated with delving into the neurocognitive roots of behavior ; assume a genetic factor is discovered to be central to a behavior we deem aberrant ?
How long before the spectre of eugenics is raised ?
On the other hand , can we reasonably expect science to simply ignore what is a fascinating and highly complex field ?
Because some might find the results challenging to their world view or unpalatable , ought we not ask the questions ?
Such research is conducted however , and thankfully we currently find ourselves living in a society where no one is being genotyped for behavior just yet .
An example of the research in question is published in Nature Neuroscience this week , and it's one that 's making headlines .
The study in question , from psychologists at NYU and UCLA , looks at how political self - identification relates to how the brain handles conflict .
Volunteers rated their political affiliation on a scale from - 5 to +5 , and then had their brain activity measured as they performed a Go / No - Go test .
This involved being shown either a letter M or W on a screen .
When they saw the M , they were to press a button ( Go ) , but when they saw the W they were to refrain ( No Go ) .
To begin with , almost all of the signals are Go , resulting in a habitual effect where subjects instinctively press the button when they see the signal .
When a No Go appears , the brain has to process the conflict between the habitual response to press the button and the knowledge that the letter is actually a W .
The researchers measured brain activity corresponding to an incorrect response , and discovered that political liberals showed significantly greater brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex , and that liberalism , as compared to conservatism , was associated with greater sensitivity to cognitive conflict .
Now , that ’s not to say that liberals have better brains than conservatives , regardless of how it might be spun , but the results of previous studies show that liberals show higher tolerance for ambiguity and complexity on psychological tests , and that conservatives tend towards needing greater structure and order .
When one thinks about it logically , conservatives , by their own label , are not disposed to change , and it appears that we can see the evidence of this in brain activity .
Of course , the results should not be taken as pejorative ; they do n't claim to show that conservatives have lesser brains or neurocognitive function , despite how such conclusions might be spun .
It does show that the way our brains are hardwired affects the decisions we make , even in the voting booth .

A new business model emerges
Why the United Auto Workers supports Cerberus ’ take - over of Chrysler
By Barry Grey
16 May 2007
Click here to download this article as a leaflet
The United Auto Workers ’ backing for the sale of Chrysler to the Wall Street private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management has far - reaching and dire implications not only for Chrysler workers , but for all US auto workers .
Behind the union ’s embrace of a firm notorious for realizing huge profits by slashing jobs and wages and selling off corporate assets are moves to offload the US auto makers ’ retiree health care liabilities to a new UAW - controlled company .
The union officials are looking to go into the health care business and enrich themselves by directly imposing massive cuts in benefits on their own members .
According to an article published in Tuesday ’s Wall Street Journal , plans currently under discussion at the highest levels of the Big Three US auto companies and the UAW “ would make the UAW one of the largest private - sector providers of health care in the US . ”
This would mark a qualitatively new stage in the degeneration and transformation of the unions .
Auto workers could very well find themselves in the position of paying dues to the very institution that is making a profit by gutting their health care .
One of the most extraordinary aspects of Monday ’s announcement of the sale of Chrysler to Cerberus was the response of the union .
Only last month , UAW President Ron Gettelfinger had denounced any such deal , saying speculative investment firms such as Cerberus were only out to “ increase their wealth by stripping and flipping companies . ”
No one who has followed the US auto industry would accept Gettelfinger ’s declaration as good coin and anticipate a serious struggle by the union to oppose the sell - off of Chrysler to Wall Street speculators .
Ever since the UAW ’s acceptance of plant closures and wage cuts as part of the government bailout of Chrysler in 1979 - 80 , the union has functioned essentially as an ancillary arm of corporate management , suppressing workers ’ resistance and helping to impose one round of layoffs and concessions after another .
Nevertheless , the abject and immediate character of the union ’s capitulation took auto and financial analysts by surprise .
Gettelfinger had already issued a statement endorsing DaimlerChrysler ’s offloading of its Chrysler Group to Cerberus in the early morning hours of May 14 , even before DaimlerChrysler had officially announced the deal at a press conference in its Stuttgart headquarters .
In a Monday afternoon union news conference and an interview on a local Detroit radio station the same day , Gettelfinger promoted the deal and cited unspecified assurances he had been given in the course of a four - hour private meeting held last Saturday in Stuttgart between himself and the chief UAW negotiator at Chrysler , UAW Vice President General Holiefield , and DaimlerChrysler CEO Dieter Zetsche and Chrysler Group President Tom LaSorda .
The exact nature of the assurances was privileged information , the union leader said .
“ That conversation , ” the Detroit News remarked in an article published Tuesday , “ led to one of the biggest surprises in the deal to sell Chrysler :
The decision by one of the most powerful labor organizations in the United States to ultimately back the very option it had vocally opposed for months . ”
Tuesday ’s Wall Street Journal article provides insight into the considerations that underlie the union ’s enthusiastic embrace of the Cerberus take - over , and may very well shed light on the discussion that occurred over the weekend between the UAW leaders and DaimlerChrysler bosses .
The article , entitled “ Chrysler Deal Heralds New Direction for Detroit , ” begins by stressing the far - reaching implications of the Chrysler deal for all of the US auto companies and the North American auto industry as a whole .
“ The New York investment firm and the German auto company , ” the Journal writes , “ have set an ambitious goal :
To work with the powerful United Auto Workers union to restructure the $ 18 billion that Detroit ’s No. 3 auto maker estimates it will eventually owe for UAW retiree health - care benefits ...
“ If Cerberus can devise a formula for doing so outside of bankruptcy court , Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. would almost certainly try to follow suit , potentially affecting some $ 95 billion in total retiree health - care obligations .
Discussions among Big
Three executives are underway ‘ at the highest levels , ’ one person familiar with the situation says . ”
Cerberus ’s acquisition of Chrysler , the newspaper continues , could foreshadow similar takeovers of GM and Ford by Wall Street speculators .
“ With stock market valuations of $ 15.7 billion and $ 16.7 billion respectively , Ford and GM are potential targets for private equity buyers , especially if their retiree health - care liabilities can be engineered to more manageable size . ”
The role of the UAW in this process of slashing health care and pension costs is critical , the newspaper explains .
“ For Cerberus , the key to making the deal work will be the UAW .
Chrysler has estimated internally that Japanese auto makers like Toyota Motor Corp. enjoy a labor - cost advantage of as much as $ 30 an hour , once all benefits and job - security provisions are taken into account .
More than half of that gap is from benefits related to retirees , such as health care , pensions and group life insurance .
“ Chrysler estimates that without a fundamental change in its UAW contract , that gap will rise to $ 45 an hour by 2009 ...
“ Chrysler , GM and Ford hope to persuade the UAW this summer to agree to a potentially revolutionary retiree health care plan similar to one reached at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , say three people familiar with auto maker plans . ”
The Goodyear deal , the Journal says , involved the agreement of the United Steelworkers union to let the company shift $ 1.2 billion in future health care liabilities to a fund managed by the union .
Goodyear contributed $ 1 billion in cash and Goodyear stock to the fund , in return for which the union took on the job directly of imposing benefits cuts on its own members .
“ The three auto makers , ” the newspaper continues , “ with about $ 95 billion in combined future and current union health - care liabilities on their corporate balance sheets , have been ‘ in talks at the highest levels on doing something like the Goodyear deal , ’ says one person familiar with the matter ...
“ GM is said to be pushing the hardest to create what is being called a ‘ Big Three VEBA ( Voluntary Employee Benefit Association ) , ’ which would set up a separate union - managed fund , which the auto makers would back with billions of dollars .
JP Morgan & Chase Co. has estimated such a fund could be set up with $ 55 billion to $ 65 billion from the auto makers . ”
In fact , GM has already launched such a VEBA as part of the concessionary deal it reached in 2005 with the UAW .
Under the GM plan , UAW members at the company are forced to defer two cents an hour in cost - of - living raises every quarter , with the money going into a union - controlled fund to help pay retiree health care costs .
By assuming control of a health care company with tens of billions of dollars in assets the UAW bureaucracy would have at its disposal vast resources .
There can be no doubt that in short order the salaries of top union officials would soar into the hundreds of thousands and millions .
That the union would be directly responsible for gutting health care and pension benefits for hundreds of thousands of workers — social gains wrenched from the ruling elite through the struggles of generations of workers — would not faze Gettelfinger and company in the slightest .
The union bureaucracy sees in these machinations the prospect of solving its own social problem :
How to maintain and expand the lucrative salaries and expense accounts of the bloated union hierarchy while collaborating in the destruction of the jobs and living standards of union members — and consequently eroding ever more rapidly the organization ’s dues base .
In the light of this analysis , it is clear why at the union press conference Monday , UAW Vice President Holiefield declared that the UAW membership was “ elated ” over the deal with Cerberus , and “ welcomed ” it as an “ opportunity . ”
He was , of course , speaking not for the union members — who rightly suspect that the deal means an unprecedented assault on their jobs and conditions and are disgusted by the union ’s capitulation — but rather for the union bureaucracy .
The striving of the UAW to transform itself into a capitalist enterprise is the outcome of a long process .
For three decades , in tandem with the decline of the global market position of the US auto makers , the UAW bureaucracy has been seeking ways and means to distance its own fate from that of the auto workers it nominally represents .
Wedded to capitalism , the American two - party system and a nationalist perspective , the UAW could advance no independent perspective to defend the social interests of auto workers .
Inevitably , the size and industrial power of the union underwent a precipitous decline — which continues unabated today .
The more the union leadership betrayed the interests of the rank - and - file , in order to “ defend American jobs ” — i.e. , the profits of the Big Three US auto firms — the more closely it sought to integrate itself with corporate management .
The Chrysler bailout of 1979 - 80 was a turning point , in which the union openly embraced the policy of corporatism , symbolized by the entry of then - UAW President Douglas Fraser onto the Chrysler board of directors .
There followed tacit union support for outright union - busting at UAW parts plants , the proliferation of joint union - management committees and joint slush funds of various kinds , and a policy of offering supplier companies low - wage contracts in return for their agreement to let the UAW “ represent ” the workers — that is , collect dues automatically deducted from the workers ’ pay checks .
The strike fund remained flush to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars because the union virtually abandoned the strike weapon .
There has not been a national strike against a Big Three company for decades .
But that is woefully inadequate to sustain a bureaucracy numbering in the thousands under conditions of ever - declining membership rolls .
Now , however , the disaster engulfing rank - and - file auto workers — who face reduction to the status of low - paid , semi-casual labor with few or no benefits — provides the bureaucracy with the opportunity to control vast resources and secure its own financial future .
The Cerberus deal , and the union ’s complicity , bring to the fore the essential character of the UAW :
It is the instrument of a corrupt , parasitic and privileged social layer that has nothing in common with the working class .
It is a social layer deeply hostile to the interests of workers .
An understanding of the nature of the UAW is a precondition for the development of the type of independent industrial and political struggle — based on socialist and internationalist policies — that is required to defeat the conspiracy of the auto bosses , the banks and Wall Street asset - strippers , and the union itself , and to defend the jobs , working conditions and living standards of auto workers .
The fat lady has finally sung .
The Truth About Cars ( TTAC ) and its faithful readers have identified the Ten Worst cars for sale in America in 2007 .
We began with a list of 136 reader - nominated vehicles .
Our writers narrowed the field of bad dreams down to 20 finalists .
By popular vote , you selected the ten most odious automobiles .
And the winners are … after the jump ( we need the page views ) .
10 . Saturn ION –
The lame duck ION waddles off the field of battle without achieving any glory whatsoever .
From its Frankensteinian proportions and ditchwater dull detailing , to misaligned panel gaps visible from low earth orbit , to a Playskool - inspired dash made of recycled plastic swords , to engines so coarse they might as well been stickered “ for agricultural use only , ” the ION was a born loser .
If only Saturn has followed its own advice to “ re-think American . ” – SM
9. Chrysler Aspen – Its OK love your SUV .
Just not this one .
The Chrysler Aspen is a cynical repackaging of the Pleistocene - era Dodge Durango , complete with an arthritic suspension and interior appointments you ’re best advised not keep .
It ’s ugly , slow ( even with a Hemi underhood ) and badly built .
It ’s no wonder Aspen customers are lined - up none deep .
– SM
8. Chevrolet TrailBlazer / GMC Envoy / Isuzu Ascender / Saab 9 - 7X –
These four remaining examples of the GMT - 360 platform are old school SUVs in strictest sense of the term ; anyone whose education involved spending endless hours at a desk nailed to the floor in a drafty , cheerless classroom will know what I mean .
We ’re talking Trabant - class fit and finish and Yugo - compatible interior design .
Although there may be a good reason to buy one , you can hear the competition singing “ anything you can do I can do better . ”
And by God , they ’re right .
– AD
7. Hummer H2 – According to its detractors , the H2 represents everything that ’s wrong with SUVs .
We agree .
The H2 ’s immense charisma has vanished as quickly as hopes for rapid fire nation building you - know - where .
All that 's left ( automotively speaking ) is a huge , slow , thirsty , ungainly five - year - old truck based on an eight - year - old platform .
Sure , the H2 is great off road– as long it ’s a double wide path .
Meanwhile , you might as wear a freshly - bludgeoned baby seal as drive this big rig .
How great is that ?
– JB
6. Hummer H3 – The H3 is a 4700 lbs. truck with a 220 horsepower five - cylinder engine .
For those of you who do n’t count rivets for fun , the H2 ’s baby brother is thirstier than Lindsay Lohan fresh out of rehab , slower than continental drift and rougher than Class VI rapids .
Its gangsta style portals severely limit visibility and the back seat is adult aversive .
Hell , it ’s not even available in Jackass Yellow .
No , you take it off - road .
I ’m buying a Grand Cherokee .
– JB
5. Chevrolet Uplander – Last year ’s worst of the worst is finally making its exit .
Good riddance to bad rubbish .
Chevy 's dead van walking never fooled anyone with its SUV - wannabe styling and piss - poor platform .
The only remnant of GM ’s po-faced assault on the minivan market can't hit the ash can of automotive history soon enough .
– FW
4. Dodge Nitro – The Nitro is the answer to a question nobody asked : who wants a rough - running , gas - guzzling , hard - shifting , sloppy handling , cheaply adorned , pavement bound , neutered Jeep ?
Comic book styling ca n’t overcome the Nitro ’s fundamental lack of fundamentals .
It ’s a four - wheeled testament to Chrysler ’s brand mismanagement and thoroughly inept product development .
– WM
3. Chevrolet Aveo –
From its tinny - sounding doors to its penalty box interior , the Aveo screams cheap more loudly ( and persistently ) than an amphetamine - crazed parrot .
Normally slow means frugal .
Not here .
So … what ’s the point ?
Now that GM has proven they can’t build a decent small car in the U.S. , perhaps they ’re trying to demonstrate that they can’t build one in Korea either .
Done . – FW
2. Chrysler Sebring – The Sebring is a born rental car .
It ’s hideous in a deeply bland sort of way .
Its cabin , handling , acceleration , and ride quality ( or complete lack thereof ) are to driving pleasure what hair shirts are to eczema sufferers .
The fact that Chrysler is contemplating killing the Sebring less than a year after its launch confirms it : this is an automobile even its mother can’t love .
– RF
1. Jeep Compass – Jeep ’s recipe for disaster is both simple and comprehensive : laughable aesthetics , second - rate road manners , poky performance and interior materials pulled from the bottom drawer of Chrysler ’s parts bin .
But the Compass ’ mortal sin-– for which we ’ve slated it before , from which it can never be redeemed - – is the fact that this re-skinned all wheel - drive Dodge Caliber wears the storied Jeep badge .
For shame .
– WM
And there you have it : ignominy on wheels .
With your help we ’ve named and shamed the Ten Worst cars sold in America in 2007 .
Here ’s hoping their manufacturers appreciate a little TTAC tough love .
If not , well , there ’s always next year !

Earlier this week I wrote about The Two Types of Programmers .
Based on the huge number of comments , it seemed to strike a nerve .
Or two .
This surprised me , because it was never meant to be the inflammatory , provocative diatribe that many people interpreted it as .
It got so out of hand that Ben Collins - Sussman , the original author of the post I quoted , was driven to post a followup clarifying his original post .
Many of the commenters were offended that I somehow lumped them into a vast unwashed eighty - percent sea of vocational programmers .
Here 's what 's particularly ironic : the very act of commenting on an article about software development automatically means you 're not a vocational eighty - percenter .
Trust me .
I absolutely was not calling any of my readers inadequate .
I do n't say that because I 'm a world class suckup ; my blog is n't some kind of special case or even particularly good .
I say it because if you 're reading any programming blog whatsoever , you 're demonstrated a willingness to improve your skills and learn more about your chosen profession .
Thus , if you read the article , you are most assuredly in the twenty percent category .
The other eighty percent are not actively thinking about the craft of software development .
They would never find that piece , much less read it .
They simply do n't read programming blogs – other than as the result of web searches to find quick - fix answers to a specific problem they 're having .
Nor have they read any of the books in my recommended reading list .
The defining characteristic of the vast majority of these so - called " vocational " programmers is that they are unreachable .
It does n't matter what you , I or anyone else writes here – they 'll never see it .
The problem is n't the other 80 % .
The problem is that we 're stuck inside our own insular little 20 % world , and we forget that there 's a very large group of programmers we have almost no influence over .
Very little we do will make any difference outside our relatively small group .
The problem , as I obviously failed to make clear in the post , is figuring out how to reach the unreachable .
That 's how you make lasting and permanent changes in the craft of software development .
Not by catering to the elite – these people take care of themselves – but by reaching out to the majority of everyday programmers .
That was my point .
I 'm sorry I did such a bad job of communicating it .
But on the plus side , at least it got people thinking and talking about the issue .
Some people objected to the very idea of categorizing programmers into groups of any kind .
But there 's a rich history of doing exactly that , with interesting and sometimes unintended consequences .
In early 2004 , Nikhil Kothari wrote about three personas Microsoft came up with while working on Visual Studio 2005 .
We have three primary personas across the developer division : Mort , Elvis and Einstein .
Mort , the opportunistic developer , likes to create quick - working solutions for immediate problems .
He focuses on productivity and learns as needed .
Elvis , the pragmatic programmer , likes to create long - lasting solutions addressing the problem domain , and learning while working on the solution .
Einstein , the paranoid programmer , likes to create the most efficient solution to a given problem , and typically learn in advance before working on the solution .
These personas helped guide the design of features during the Visual Studio 2005 product cycle .
The description above is only a rough summarization of several characteristics collected and documented by our usability folks .
During the meeting , a program manager on our team applied these personas in the context of server controls rather well :
Mort would be a developer most comfortable and satisfied if the control could be used as - is and it just worked .
would be a developer most comfortable and satisfied if the control could be used as - is and it just worked .
Elvis would like to able to customize the control to get the desired behavior through properties and code , or be willing to wire up multiple controls together .
would like to able to customize the control to get the desired behavior through properties and code , or be willing to wire up multiple controls together .
Einstein would love to be able to deeply understand the control implementation , and want to be able to extend it to give it different behavior , or go so far as to re-implement it .
I can't quite date exactly when these personas came to exist at Microsoft .
Wesner Moise has an even earlier reference to these personas , wherein he amusingly refers to himself as " used to be an Einstein . "
Wes , old buddy , I 'm afraid you 're the archetypal Einstein , no matter how much you might think otherwise .
These personas have been controversial for years ; they 've sparked a lot of intense discussion .
Evidently there 's a fine line between " persona " and " stereotype " :
The Microsoft developer personas that include Mort , Elvis , and Einstein are ultimately an ethically bankrupt mechanism to pigeonhole software developers into the kind of overly simplified categories that a typical marketing staffer is comfortable with .
While intended to help this particular parasitic segment of the corporate world to behaviorally model the psychological predispositions of software developers at their work in an unrealistically simple way , it has instead turned into a system of limitations that developers have begun to impose upon themselves to the detriment of the advancement of software development practice and industry .
It appears to be a bid by developers to rid themselves of the capacity for rational thought in favor of tribal identification with corporate brands and software rock stars .
Personas , in and of themselves , are not a bad thing .
I 've written before about the importance of API usability , and personas let you get a leg up on usability by considering the different audiences that will be using your code .
But I can empathize .
As a long time Visual Basic and VB.NET developer by trade , I truly resented being lumped in with Mort .
I 'm not just some clock - punching code monkey – I actually care about the craft of software development .
So what if I happen to write code in a language that does n't brutalize me with case sensitivity and curly - bracket megalomania ?
My language choice is ultimately no more meaningful than the choice between caffeinated cola beverages , so it 's an illusory difference at that .
Paul Vick works on the VB language team at Microsoft and he echoes some of my concerns :
The fundamental error I think most people make with the personas is that they see them as mutually exclusive rather than points along the experience spectrum .
When I 'm working on the VB compiler , I 'm definitely an Einstein , thinking at a very high level .
When I 'm working on stuff like the VBParser sample , I 'm generally an Elvis , thinking at a somewhat lower level .
And when I 'm writing batch scripts or ad - hoc data analysis tools , I 'm definitely a Mort , hacking around to figure out what I 'm trying to do .
The point really is that most people are usually Mort , Elvis and Einstein all at the same time , depending on what they 're doing .
And by building tools that target one or the other , we 're artificially segregating people 's work into buckets that do n't really map onto their daily lives .
( I would also argue that the past several releases of Visual Studio has emphasized some personas over others . )
Finding a way to better serve people as they move through the flow of the day - to - day work is something that is need of some serious attention .
Mort , like the twenty percent analogy Ben originally came up with , is more than a persona or a stereotype .
It 's a call to action .
I think the solution is to quit pandering to Mort with our condescending paternalistic attitude , and instead demand better from Mort .
If the capabilities of the average developer truly is as bleak as many make it out to be , we should n't just accept it , but work to raise the quality of the average developer .
" Average developer " should describe an acceptable level of competence .
We have to realize that Mort is responsible for a lot of important systems .
Systems that affect the general population .
When I hear of recent cases of identity thefts at Choicepoint , especially those caused by lax security such as using default passwords for the database , I think of Mort .
When I read that $ 250 million worth of taxpayer money has gone into an overhaul of the FBI Case File system , and the system has to be scrapped , I think of Mort .
Given this much responsibility , we should expect more from Mort .
So Mort , I hate to say this , but software development is not like working the register at McDonalds where putting in your 9 to 5 is enough .
I am all for work - life balance , but you have to understand that software development is an incredibly challenging field , requiring intense concentration and strong mental faculty .
It 's time for you to attend a conference or two to improve your skills .
It 's time for you to subscribe to a few blogs and read a few more books .
But read deeper books than How to program the VCR in 21 days .
For example , read a book on Design Patterns or Refactoring .
Mort , I am afraid it 's time for you to quit coasting .
It 's time for you to step it up a notch .
I firmly believe it is our job to leave the craft of software development better than we found it .
If you 're anything like me , you wrote horrible code when you started out as a fledgling programmer , too .
But through concerted effort and practice , I was determined to suck less every year .
I 'll admit this is sort of painful , because us programmers are n't exactly known for our people skills .
But we owe it to our craft – and to ourselves – to reach out and help our fellow programmers , at least in some small way .
Being a professional programmer is more than just writing great code .
Being a professional programmer means helping other programmers become professionals , too .
We 're all in this thing together .
Not everyone can be reached .
But some can .
The extent to which today 's combat veterans are succeeding in their education plans is hard to tell .
Available data can't tell the whole story but do raise some questions : • Though 95 % of active - duty service members sign up for the GI Bill ( which costs $ 1,200 ) , as many as 29 % of those who are eligible when they separate from the military never use the benefit , Defense Department data show .
•
Last year , about 7 % of service members who separated from the armed forces before 1997 had used up all their benefits by the 10 - year limit , Department of Veterans Affairs data show .
•
Preliminary studies of students entering college in 2003 - 04 found that veterans were twice as likely as non-veterans ( 21 % vs. 9 % ) to have not enrolled in a degree program , recent Department of Education data show .
Non-veterans were more likely than veterans ( 41 % vs. 15 % ) to be enrolled in a bachelor 's program .
In 2006 , veterans who had entered college in 2003 - 04 were more likely than non-vets who entered that year ( 12 % vs. 5 % ) to say they do n't expect to earn a postsecondary degree .
Keith Wilson , director of the VA 's education service , says his office has received funding and hopes to soon " fill in those blanks .
Whether it is a problem or not is the first thing we want to identify . "
For example , while the GI Bill provides 36 months of benefits — roughly a four - year degree — veterans on average use about 17 months of benefits , VA data show .
For some , that may be enough ; the VA does n't track whether vets already have some college under their belts .
And Education Department data show that about 47 % of veterans who entered college in 2003 - 04 planned to pursue a two - year degree ( vs. 36 % of non-veterans ) , which takes about 18 months , and 17 % planned to pursue a certificate ( vs. 13 % of non-veterans ) .
Others may stop using benefits not because they could n't cope , but because their priorities change .
" A lot come back with the intention of going to school but get caught up in getting married , buying a car and having a kid , " says Vietnam veteran Manuel Martinez , a counselor at East Los Angeles Vet Center , a federal VA program .
Some , including Virginia Sen. Jim Webb , a Democrat , suggest that money provided by the GI Bill benefit is inadequate to today 's college costs .
Others say the 10 - year window given most service members to use their benefit is n't enough .
" Soldiers need time to transition back into their old lives , " says Patrick Campbell , legislative director of Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America , a non-profit group in Washington , D.C.
Of the 10 members of his Louisiana National Guard unit who were in college when deployed , only one has returned to school , he says .
Martinez , like other counselors , suspects dropout rates among combat veterans are higher than average if for no other reason than many return home with anxiety , depression and post - traumatic stress .
In June , the Defense Department released findings that show 31 % of Marines , 38 % of soldiers and nearly half of National Guard troops have psychological symptoms .
Those with physical injuries also face limitations .
Under a program created this year by the American Council on Education , a non-profit group , volunteers are working with veterans at three military hospitals .
Of 156 service members who have received counseling , 49 have sought admission and been accepted into a study program this fall .
Others are still in recovery , says ACE 's Jim Selbe .
The group plans to track their progress .
Julia O'Dell , associate director of the University of Kansas Veterans Upward Bound , part of a federal education program , says this generation of recent veterans brings new challenges to colleges .
" The issues combat veterans face … is something we have n't had to deal with in a while , " she says .
" It 's going to take all of these institutions a while to figure out what is exactly the best way to provide services to this particular group . "

Now Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is trying a new approach :
He wants to find common ground .
" We 're working on consensus , " Reid said .
" We 're willing to go halfway with [ Republicans ] as long as everyone understands that we 're not going to do something that 's cosmetic in nature . "
Some Republicans , like presidential candidate John McCain , say Reid is talking with Republicans only because Democrats are losing the war of public opinion .
" They 've lost the momentum , " McCain said .
" Otherwise , they would n't want to sit down with Republicans and negotiate a different resolution . "
Talking " compromise " is seen as weakness by the GOP .
It 's emboldening them .
The only time they back done is when Democrats show strength .
See Privatization , Social Security .
The war of public opinion , if judged by , you know , opinion polls , is firmly in the Democratic camp .
Republicans can't fathom why Democrats are showing weakness in the face of holding the upper hand on the issue .
They sure as heck would n't behave similarly .
So they assume that Dems are losing the battle of public opinion not based on the polls , but based on the behavior of Democrats .
Beyond the struggle for independents , Mr. McCain also has to work to bring in fiscal conservatives who have been drawn to Mitt Romney ’s economic message .
To that end , Mr. McCain will lay out in greater detail on Tuesday in Salem plans to deal with the mortgage crisis , the shrinking dollar and federal spending .
Among the proposals are repealing the alternative minimum tax , making permanent President Bush ’s tax cuts , and banning Internet and cellphone taxes .
At the forum on Monday where Mr. Lieberman announced his support , Mr. McCain was in a fiery mood , ribbing Adam Kowalski , 19 , for wearing a Santa Claus hat .
He said , “ You look kind of dorky in the hat . ”
Mr. Kowalski took it in good humor and in an interview later expressed sentiments typical of many who show up at Mr. McCain ’s events .
“ I like his honesty , ” he said .
“ Hearing him speak is completely different . ”
An independent , Mr. Kowalski said he had not made up his mind but was leaning toward Mr. McCain , saying the senator was the only Republican he could envision supporting .
On the war , Mr. Kowalski said that he was torn , because Mr. McCain may be correct on the increase in troops , but that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Obama might have the best answer in trying to end the war .
“ All I know is that it is either all or nothing with Iraq , ” he said .
Although some polls a few months ago showed Mr. McCain barely registering , more recent surveys suggest that he is gaining support nationally .
He appears to be in a particularly strong position in New Hampshire , tied for second with Rudolph W. Giuliani behind Mr. Romney , according to a CNN / WMUR poll .

Among the hottest jobs , IT project manager , Senior software developer , and Construction project manager are the most needed as they are popular in 11 of the 15 markets .
The average salaries for all the job titles in the report are listed below .
Clearly , IT related jobs are still paying good salary as 9 in the list are either hardware or software jobs .
What surprises me , however , is that Physician ’s assistant is also a high - paying job now , competing with software developers and IT managers for the top spots .
Considering the national shortage of nurses , it does seem to be a natual result though .
Hand washing is the most effective way of battling MRSA
Yvonne Zanele Cemane , 53 , was found guilty of six allegations of misconduct by the Nursing and Midwifery Council .
The nurse , from Birmingham , worked at Rylands Nursing and Residential Home in Newport , Shrops , from May to July 2005 .
She was also found to have roughly treated a man and demonstrated a " lack of basic anatomical knowledge " .
Cemane failed to wear a protective apron while treating the patient with MRSA and did not remove her gloves afterwards .
' Public confidence '
Leila Harris , Nursing and Midwifery Council ( NMC ) spokeswoman , said the failure to wash her hands after treating the MRSA patient had been a contributing factor in the panel 's decision .
" There were a total of six charges ( proven ) and that happened to be one of them .
" It 's the first time that has contributed to somebody being struck off , " she said .
Michael Summers , vice - chairman of the Patients Association , said : " All nurses are well aware of the need to ensure that not only do they protect the patient , but other members of staff from the infection spread .
" They ( NMC ) have taken a very serious view , as do we , of the allegations against this nurse , which included the risk of spreading MRSA and not taking proper action to hand washing . "
Cemane , originally from South Africa , did not attend the hearing on Tuesday .
Panel chairwoman Catherine Duthie said : " The appropriate and proportionate sanction to impose in this case is that the respondent be struck off the register .
" No lesser sanction would be appropriate , having regard to the panel 's duty to act in the public interest and to preserve public confidence in the profession . "
The allegations proven against her were :
An incorrect entry in the care plan of a patient , failing to record the administration of medication , failing to ensure medication was taken , using the wrong dressing to treat a wound , failing to wear an apron , remove gloves or wash her hands after treating a patient with MRSA and roughly handing a patient and acting inappropriately when attending to him .
@drewheyman : Max effective range for a 12 gauge 2 3/4 " slug is about 100 yards , With a sabot it jumps up to around 125 yards .
But even the top of the line sabot has about 3 ' of drop at those ranges and this weapons sighting system is a scaled up version of that found on the M - 16 .
Also I just found another article claiming it has an effective range of 200 m , not 150m .
I call utter PR bullshit on this .
One of the Church of England 's most senior bishops is warning that people will die unless Muslim leaders in Britain speak out in defence of the right to change faith .
Michael Nazir - Ali , the Bishop of Rochester , whose father converted from Islam to Christianity in Pakistan , says he is looking to Muslim leaders in Britain to 'uphold basic civil liberties , including the right for people to believe what they wish to believe and to even change their beliefs if they wish to do so ' .
Some Islamic texts brand Muslims who convert to other faiths as ' apostates ' and call for them to be punished .
Seven of the world 's 57 Islamic states - including Iran - impose the death penalty for conversion .
Now Ali , who some see as a potential Archbishop of Canterbury , has told Channel 4 's Dispatches programme of his fears about the safety of the estimated 3,000 Muslims who have converted to other faiths in Britain .
' It is very common in the world today , including in this country , for people who have changed their faith , particularly from being Muslim to being Christian , to be ostracised , to lose their job , for their marriages to be dissolved , for children to be taken away , ' Ali said .
' And this is why some leadership is necessary from Muslim leaders themselves to say that this is not what Islam teaches . '
The bishop warns that Muslims who switch faiths in Britain could be killed if the current climate continues .
' We have seen honour killings have happened , and there is no reason why this kind of thing cannot happen . '
In 2004 , Prince Charles asked British Muslim leaders to renounce laws of apostasy and the death sentence for converts in Islamic countries , but no public statement was ever made .
Dispatches obtained Islamic texts sold in Britain that say the punishment for apostasy is death - according to all four schools of Islamic jurisprudence .
One text called for Muslims to cut off the head of those who reject Islam .
The radical Islamist group Hizb ut - Tahrir , which some in Britain want to see banned , states in its constitution that in countries that practise Sharia law , apostates are to be executed .
Its message is disseminated on university campuses across Britain and has found a following among a minority of young Muslims .
A poll of more than 1,000 British Muslims , conducted by the Policy Exchange think - tank this year , found that 36 per cent of Muslims aged between 16 and 24 believe those who convert to another faith should be punished by death .
Sheikh Mogra , a senior member of the Muslim Council for Britain , told Dispatches : ' We live in a country where we respect people 's choices .
It is not right for any British Muslim to harm in any way whatsoever ; to bully them , to intimidate them , to threaten them , is all against Muslim law . '
One convert interviewed for the programme told how his local Muslim community in Bradford closed ranks against him after he switched to Christianity .
' They told me categorically had I been in an Islamic country - Pakistan , Middle East - that they would actually be the first to chop off my head , ' he said .
· ' Dispatches : Unholy War ' will be on Channel 4 at 8 pm tomorrow .

Facebook LOS ANGELES ( AP ) 
Sheriff 's deputies have been competing in organized contests to see who could make the most arrests , who could impound the most cars and who could question the most gang members .
The contests were meant to boost morale and motivate deputies , but some observers are crying foul , the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday .
One of the competitions , outlined in an internal Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department e-mail , was " Operation Any Booking . "
The object of the contest was to see who could arrest the most people in a 24 - hour period .
" It 's just a friendly competition to have a little fun out here , " said Lt. James Tatreau , who helped organize the events .
" It 's a morale booster . "
Tatreau said that when he joined a station in Lakewood , he noticed some patrol deputies made 15 to 20 arrests a month , while others made seven arrests in an entire year .
The prize for winning was " bragging rights , " Tatreau said .
Several police observers were not impressed .
Hubert Williams , president of the Washington , D.C. - based Police Foundation , said the competitions were " highly problematic and inappropriate . "
" The arrest is one of the most potent tools in the possession of law enforcement and should be used with great thought , " Williams said .
" It 's not a competition or a game . "
Los Angeles County Public Defender Michael P. Judge , wondered if the games could prompt deputies to make illegitimate arrests to boost numbers .
" Certainly , it calls into question whether there was a legitimate reason to book any of the people who were booked during the time of the competition , " Judge said .
According to a Times review of records , Operation Any Booking did not result in an increase in arrests on the day of the contest .
But the impound competition may have increased the number of vehicles seized , with records showing a spike in vehicle seizures the day of the contest .
Sheriff Lee Baca said the competitions were a well - meaning but poorly conceived idea that promoted " the wrong values . "
" We 're not into numbers , we 're into quality , " Baca said .
" I do n't think it will occur again . "

For years now The Democracy Foundation , a Virginia - based nonprofit founded by former Alaska senator and current presidential hopeful Mike Gravel , has been pushing a plan that ’s both quixotic and rather sensible .
Through its National Initiative for Democracy , the nonprofit aims to amend the Constitution in order to create a fourth branch of government , a “ legislature of the people ” empowered to make laws through nationwide popular voting .
“ This is not a very radical thing at all , ” says the organization ’s chairman , Tom Lombardi .
“ I see it as just a step forward .
People have a right to step up to their rightful role as lawmakers alongside their representatives . ”
In fact , citizens in 24 states are already allowed to pass initiatives and referendums by popular vote ( in initiatives , citizens write laws and try to garner enough signatures to get those laws on statewide ballots ; in referendums , legislatures draft the laws and put them on the ballots ) .
The results , according to experts , have been sound .
So why not take the idea national ?
The plan has obvious advantages .
National popular votes , for example , may be the only way to pass laws that are against lawmakers ’ interests , such as campaign finance reform , term limits , and caps on congressional pay .
They would also reduce the disproportionate power of small geographical pockets .
Under this system , senators from coal - producing states , to give one example , would have a much harder time holding up research on renewable sources of energy .
A legislature of the people would also help to counter the influence of money in Washington — special interests and lobbyists can co-opt key members of Congress with campaign contributions and other perks , but would have a much harder time swaying the hearts and minds of millions of Americans .
Don Kemner , secretary of The Democracy Foundation , describes our current form of government as a “ mendicant democracy . ”
“ In a political sense that means that all we can do is ask , beg , plead , petition , protest , or civically disobey our representative government for the things we want done , ” says Kemner .
“ They say 70 percent of the people would like to see the Iraq war come to an end .
But the people have no way of implementing that in legislative action . ”
As appealing as this notion is , The Democracy Foundation ’s National Initiative is not without its pitfalls , to which the organization ’s staffers , extreme idealists all , have no shortage of counterarguments .
Are the people really qualified to make laws ?
“ We should n’t underestimate the public ’s ability when it ’s in their self interest to educate themselves , ” says Lombardi .
“ People are brighter and more enthused than politicians and the media give them credit for . ”
But if the people have legislative authority , what about the role of Congress ?
“ The formal role of Congress stays exactly the same , ” he says .
So , what if Congress dislikes a law passed by national initiative and passes its own law in direct contradiction ?
“ Congress can go ahead and rewrite ” the people ’s law , says Kemner .
“ They can write it off the books if they wish ! ”
And what of the courts ?
“ As the Congress can be challenged on constitutional grounds , likewise the people would be challenged when a law is enacted through the national initiative , ” says Kemner .
“ A national initiative in no way disposes of any procedures of the first , second , or third branches of government .
It simply introduces a new one . ”
Those are logistical objections , but there are serious philosophical ones as well .
For instance , how do you protect individual rights from the tyranny of the majority ?
Nearly a century ago voting rights for blacks were revoked in Oklahoma by a popular vote , points out John Matsusaka , the president of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California .
Still , he says , “ you can find such examples , if not worse , that came out of legislatures . ”
Jim Crow laws , for example , were largely perpetrated by legislatures .
Moreover , states where voters dictate economic policy via initiatives and referendums tend to be just as financially healthy as states without these processes .
“ There ’s a concern that voters will be myopic , ” says Matsusaka , “ that they ’ll approve a whole bunch of spending programs and at the same time cut taxes , and therefore create deficits and cause all kinds of problems . ”
But this is n’t the case .
“ If you look at the data , initiative states have no higher debt levels on average , their bond ratings are no worse on average , they have no higher taxes or deficits . ”
In the past fifty years or so , says Matsusaka , the most common upshot of citizens having the right to make policy is lower taxes and lower spending .
Examples of direct democracy are also found on the international level .
The Swiss have used a national initiative system for over 100 years , and the results are compelling .
Gregory Fossedal , author of the book Direct Democracy in Switzerland , writes that the system is “ harder to corrupt , and develops the popular mind . ”
The press , aware that it has a critical role to play in educating the public , deemphasizes the individuals at the top levels of government and instead “ offers a stream of extensive , diverse , instantaneous , and ongoing information to voters . ”
The result of this system of government , writes Fossedal , is “ less alienation , and a much closer association between people and elites . ”
Across Europe , more and more countries are adopting national referendums , a process in which legislatures develop laws and put them up for a popular vote .
“ If you go to Europe now , ” says Matsusaka , “ it ’s almost getting to be unthinkable that they would make a decision on some important national topic without asking the people what they think about it . ”
In contrast , the United States , a worldwide leader in democracy , has never held a nationwide vote on any law .
In the end , the largest problem with the Democracy Foundation ’s National Initiative may be enacting the thing .
Passing a law in Congress is a non-starter for obvious reasons , so its supporters are trying to pass a Constitutional amendment through , naturally enough , a nationwide popular vote .
They ’ve set up a web site called Philadelphia II ( an homage to the founding fathers ’ 1787 constitutional convention ) where citizens can cast a vote for the idea .
There ’s just one wrinkle .
Article V of the Constitution , which lays out the processes for passing amendments , identifies only two methods of doing so , neither of them a popular vote : a constitutional convention called by two - thirds of state legislatures or a two - thirds vote in both houses of Congress .
Even so , some constitutional law scholars believe the people do have the power to put forth a constitutional amendment .
Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Reed Amar , one of America ’s foremost scholars on majority rule and popular sovereignty , writes that the repeated invocations of the power of the people in the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution , and other writings authored by the nation ’s founding fathers suggest the people “ have a legal right to alter our government — to amend our Constitution — via a majoritarian and populist mechanism akin to a national referendum , even though that mechanism is not explicitly specified in Article V. ”
Look no further than the preamble to the Constitution , Amar argues .
The words “ We the People of the United States … do ordain and establish this Constitution ” make the case : if the people make the Constitution , they obviously have the right to change it .
Determined to do so , the backers of the National Initiative soldier on , trying to raise publicity where they can .
Mike Gravel ’s campaign has brought some exposure , but not nearly enough .
The Democracy Foundation ’s web site proclaims that “ when the majority of the People who voted in the last presidential election vote affirmatively for the National Initiative it becomes the law of the land . ”
They say , and this is where the idea starts to sound more like a pipedream , that when the votes on the Philadelphia II web site hit this threshold , the administrator of Philadelphia II will notify Congress and all other relevant parties that American democracy has been changed forever .
We ’ll see how that goes over , if and when they get there .
As it stands , 3,500 Americans have cast a ballot for the National Initiative , leaving only 61 million more to go .

In a presentation before the European Parliament last week , EU security commissioner Franco Frattini outlined a new set of anti-terror proposals , including plans for a Europol explosives database , airplane passenger list databases , and legislation that would criminalize publication of bomb - making instructions on the Internet .
The proposals are based on the findings of a research group that included law enforcement officials and experts from private industry .
" I have received what I think will prove to be a ground - breaking report from a public - private expert group which I have established which contains around 50 valuable recommendations to improve the security of explosives , precursors and detonators across the EU , " said Frattini .
" These recommendations will form the basis for the EU Action Plan which should be adopted in November . "
Few details are available to provide insight into the specifics of the proposed program , but it will clearly involve criminalizing dissemination of some information that could potentially be used for terrorist activity .
" You can find detailed instructions on all kinds of terrorist tactics , including the production of explosives , on the Internet , " said Frattini .
" These forms of behaviour will be made punishable across the EU . "
Frattini also discussed plans to establish " an EU Explosives database at Europol , with links to the responsible services in the Member States , an early warning system so that these services are informed quickly , for example when explosives have been stolen , or a new terrorist modus operandi is discovered from credible intelligence informations . "
Another part of the new proposals relates to airplane Passenger Name Record ( PNR ) policies .
Frattini says that the precise nature of the PNR policy changes are still being discussed , but " the Commission 's main intention is to ensure that each Member State collects the PNR records , processes them and , where appropriate , exchanges them with others . "
It is difficult to judge the soundness of these plans without more details about their potential scope and nature .
If legislation banning publication of bomb - making instructions is too broad and does n't include appropriate exceptions , it could theoretically put chemistry sites at risk .
We have seen in the past that Internet censorship laws — even ones that stem from good intentions — often have unanticipated negative consequences .
The existing PNR infrastructure has received criticism in the past and is already considered excessive by some .
Attempts to expand the program could be met with hostility by EU citizens .
These proposals reflect growing concern with domestic terrorism in Europe .
Specifically in reference to the PNR program , Frattini explains that recent attempted terrorist attacks in the EU justify a shift in focus .
" The Commission thinks the time has come to change focus and devote resources to the security of the Union .
The Union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the United States , " Frattini said .
Jessica Simpson Jinxes Tony Romo ( Photos and Video )
was at Texas Stadium on Sunday to cheer on her new boyfriend , Dallas Cowboys quarterbackas the heavily favored Cowboys played the Philadelphia Eagles .
Wearing a Dallas Cowboys jersey with a pink number 9 ( Romo 's number ) , Jessica watched from a luxury box with dad Joe Simpson , as Romo played the worst game of his career , losing to the Eagles 10 - 6 .
The 27 - year - old Pro Bowler threw three interceptions and fumbled the ball twice , earning him a quarterback rating of just 22.2 .
Romo's average rating this year is over 100 , with his previous low being when former girlfriend Carrie Underwood attended the game against the Eagles last December , which the Cowboys lost 23 - 7 .
Some advice for Tony Romo ?
Leave the girlfriends at home !

Introduction
The other night , I came across the problem of implementing autovivication in Ruby hashes .
The solution I devised exemplifies an elegant and practical use of the Y combinator , and it seemed worth sharing .
For those of you who just want the solution , here it is :
module YCombinator def y_comb ( &generator ) proc { |x| proc { |*args| generator.call(x.call(x ) ) .call ( *args ) } }.call ( proc { |x| proc { |*args| generator.call(x.call(x ) ) .call ( *args ) } } ) end end class Object include ( YCombinator ) end hash = y_comb { | callback| proc { Hash.new { |h , k| h[k ] = callback.call } } }.call hash [ 'a ' ] [ ' b ' ] [ 'c ' ] [ ' d ' ] [ 'e ' ] [ 'f ' ] [' g ' ] = 1 hash
In Perl , the following line will successfully run :
$ hash { ' a '} {' b ' }{' c'} = 1 ;
%hash
%hash
$ hash {'a'}
even ifwas previously undefined .
Perl will automatically setto be an empty hash , it will assignto be a reference to an empty hash , and so on , all automatically .
This is called autovivication in Perl : hash and array variables automatically “ come to life ” as necessary .
This is incredibly convenient for working with multidimensional arrays , for example .
Ruby , sadly , does not have autovivication ( though not surprisingly , given the structure of the language ) .
It does , however , provide a facility for default values of hashes .
For example , one could write :
hash = Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = {} } hash [ 'a ' ] [ ' b ' ] = 3
hash [ 'a ' ]
'b '
hash [ 'a ' ] [ ' b ' ] [ ' c ' ] = 3
hash [ 'a ' ] [ ' b ' ]
nil
[ 'c ' ]
in which case Ruby will create an empty hash , assign it to , and set the keyin that new hash to 3 .
However , this only works for two levels .
This would not work : becausereturns , causing the attempt to accessto fail .
One solution would be to make an even more complicated default procedure :
hash = Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = {} } }
But again , that will fail for even higher dimensions of access .
What is needed is a recursive definition of the default function , one that continues to assign auto - generating hashes to each higher dimension .
A standard recursive approach will work :
def make_hash return Hash. new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = make_hash } end
make_hash
But this requires that you define and store thefunction somewhere .
This is risky : what if someone redefines or deletes the method ?
Can it be done without defining any methods , to prevent this problem ?
Luckily , there is a solution made just for this situation : the Y combinator !
There are several good web pages that derive and explain the Y combinator in greater detail ( e.g. , Wikipedia , and a blog post that claims that the Y combinator has “ no practical use ” ! ) , so this will be a brief explanation of how it works .
Say you have a recursive Ruby procedure :
factorial = proc { |arg| if arg .
zero ?
then 1 else arg * factorial.
call ( arg - 1 ) end }
factorial
Right now this procedure relies on the variableto contain the procedure .
We can remove this dependence by passing the recursive call 's procedure as an argument .
Instead of writing a function that calculates factorials , we write a function that generates another function that calculates factorials :
factorial_generator = proc { | callback| proc { |arg| if arg .
zero ?
then 1 else arg * callback.call ( arg - 1 ) end } }
callback
Now we just need to pass the rightto this procedure to implement the recursion .
Imagine what an appropriate callback procedure would look like .
When the Y combinator is applied to generator , it should return a procedure that can be called to perform the recursive function ( here , the factorial function ) .
Call this function recursive .
In the midst of executing recursive , the callback procedure may be executed .
If callback is identical to recursive , then we will have successfully implemented a recursive function .
So the goal is to design a Y combinator that accepts a generator and produces a procedure that , when executed , will set the generator 's callback to be identical to that same procedure .
Here is the Y combinator implemented in Ruby :
y = proc { |generator| proc { |x| proc { |*args| generator.call(x.call(x ) ) .call ( *args ) } }.call ( proc { |x| proc { |*args| generator.call(x.call(x ) ) .call ( *args ) } } ) }
proc { |x| proc { |*args| generator.call(x.call(x ) ) .call ( *args ) } }
y = proc { |generator| “ ycombinator-function ”.call ( “ ycombinator - function ” ) }
It is difficult to explain how this works , but here is how I think of it at least .
Think of the procedure that reads : as the “ ycombinator - function ” .
Now the Y combinator looks like :
Now we pass the generator function to the Y combinator :
recursive = y.call(factorial_generator )
generator
factorial_generator
recursive = proc { |*args| generator.call(x.call(x ) ).call ( *args ) }
generator
factorial_generator
x
and the following things happen .
First , thevariable is bound to .
Then , the “ ycombinator - function ” is executed with itself as the argument .
All that the function does is return another procedure , so the result of calling the Y combinator is the procedure : withbound toandbound to the “ ycombinator - function ” .
Now what happens when we call this resulting function with some arguments ( e.g. , recursive.call ( 5 ) ) ?
First , the argument to generator .
call is evaluated .
But since that argument is x.call( x ) , and x is bound to the “ ycombinator - function ” , the result is a procedure identical to recursive !
Hence , we have successfully set the callback to what we wanted from above .
Next , the generator procedure is executed , setting recursive to be the callback procedure .
This produces the procedure specified by the generator .
That procedure is run with the passed arguments .
If that generated procedure needs to make a recursive call , it executes the callback procedure , and because the callback procedure is the recursive procedure , this whole cycle repeats itself .
Whew !
Hopefully some of that makes sense .
The main point , though , is that :
factorial = y.call ( proc { | callback| proc { |arg| if arg .
zero ?
then 1 else arg * callback.call( arg - 1 ) end } } ) factorial.call(5 ) # => 120
will produce a proper factorial procedure , without ever having to store a name for that procedure .
For autovivifying hashes , we start with our regular recursive implementation :
make_hash = proc { Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = make_hash.call } }
proc { | callback| proc { Hash.new { |hash , key| hash [ key ] = callback.call } } }
module YCombinator def y_comb ( &generator ) proc { |x| proc { |*args| generator.call(x.call(x ) ) .call ( *args ) } }.call ( proc { |x| proc { |*args| generator.call(x.call(x ) ) .call ( * args ) } } ) end end class Object include YCombinator end
hash = y_comb { | callback| proc { Hash.new { |h , k| h[k ] = callback .call } } }.call #
Now this will work : hash [ 'a ' ] [ ' b ' ] [ 'c ' ] [ ' d ' ] [ 'e ' ] [ 'f ' ] [ ' g ' ] = 1
Now we separate out the named procedure call to produce a generator function :
The next step is to implement the Y combinator .
Unlike the above explanation , I will make it a method available to all objects rather than a procedure .
The autovivifying hash , now , is created by : Congratulations !
You have successfully implemented hash autovivication , without needing to define any external methods or variables .
( Other than the Y combinator , of course .
It is possible to do that , though I ’ll leave that as an exercise to the reader . )
In writing this , I discovered an unusual “ feature ” of ruby .
If you run the code :
x = 1 y = proc { |x| x + 3 } y.call(5 )
x
y
it turns out thatis not local to the procedure stored in , but rather is actually identical to the variable outside .
I ’m not sure I like this aspect of Ruby , but there it is .
It is possible to implement autovivication of hashes without using the Y combinator but still retaining the safety of having no global variables .
Just take advantage of scoping inside procedures :
hash = proc { make_hash = proc { Hash. new { |h , k| h[k ] = make_hash.call } } make_hash.call }.call
make_hash
This works fine as long as there is no variablealready defined .
But this approach uses 33 lexical tokens , and the Y combinator one only uses 31 ( not including the Y combinator itself ) .
So there !
Ryan Davis sent me an object - oriented implementation of autovivication :
class AVHash < Hash def initialize super { |h , k| h[k ] = AVHash.new } end end
This is probably the best approach if you need to make many autovivifying hashes .
This is what I like about Ruby : there are so many ways to do things , and they are all surprisingly elegant .
A comment on this article on Hacker News observed that my implementation was vulnerable to someone overwriting the Y combinator method that I defined in Object .
This is partially correct : if someone overwrites the y_comb method , then uses of that method afterwards may fail , although already created ( “ combinated ” ? ) procedures will work fine .
But , more importantly , notice that defining of the Y combinator is actually unnecessary to define the Y combinator at all .
You could just define and run it all in one go :
hash = proc { | generator| proc { |x| proc { |*args| generator.call(x.call(x ) ) .call ( *args ) } }.call ( proc { |x| proc { |*args| generator.call(x.call(x ) ) .call ( *args ) } } ) }.call ( proc { | callback| proc { Hash.new { |h , k| h[k ] = callback.call } } }) .call
The commenter is right , though , in that the Y combinator should n't really be necessary in most modern production languages used by coders of reasonable skill — though I see no reason not to use it if the opportunity presents itself and it is documented properly ( consider linking to this article ! ) .
The commenter also expressed difficulty in understanding this article , as well as the Y combinator in general .
If it is any consolation , it took me three full days before I managed to wrap my head around it .
This is tricky stuff , but that ’s what makes the best brain exercise .

– L. Ron Hubbard Affirmations
There has been a revival of interest in Scientology recently , largely driven by the ministrations of Hollywood jackanapes Tom Cruise .
An episode of South Park titled ‘ Trapped in the Closet ’ aired in late 2005 .
The cartoon featured Scientologists Nicole Kidman and John Travolta trying to coax Cruise out of a closet , a reference to rumors concerning his sexual preference .
Also featured was an L. Ron Hubbard character denigrating Cruise ’s acting ability .
The extremely litigious Cruise immediately threatened Paramount with legal action , and it is unlikely that the episode will air again .
It is perhaps timely to revue some of the history of the ‘ church , ’ its membership and especially its mercurial founder Lafayette Ronald Hubbard .
Various Scientology hagiographies of Hubbard are widely divergent from known facts .
This is mainly due to the phantasmagoric history that Hubbard fashioned for himself and repeated ad nauseum to his followers .
Hubbard would often boast of a distinguished pedigree , claiming descent from nobility going back to the Norman Invasion .
He also claimed at various times to have been a barn - stormer in a circus , a great white hunter in Africa , an explorer of the upper Amazon and a heavily decorated naval officer , the recipient of more than 2 dozen medals and palms .
He also claimed that his naval exploits were the inspiration for Henry Fonda ’s character in the film Mister Roberts .
On the day the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor he stated that he was the only person to survive the sinking of the destroyer he was on near the coast of Java and that he swam ashore and lived for weeks on the jungle flora .
Later he would be wounded in the back and kidneys by machine - gun fire , making urination difficult .
The truth is somewhat more prosaic .
In fact , Hubbard ’s urinary difficulties stemmed from a bout of gonorrhea contracted after sex with a prostitute named Fern .
Court documents in Hubbard ’s own handwriting later confirmed this .
His shirking in the navy was commented upon several times by superior officers .
In 1942 the US Naval Attache wrote , “ …he [ Hubbard ] became the source of much trouble [… ] , is not satisfactory for independent duty assignment .
He is garrulous and tries to give the impression of his importance . ”
Twenty years later Hubbard would brag to credulous followers that after he left that particular assignment , it took a captain , several commanders and 15 junior officers to replace him .
Although Scientology accounts claim that Hubbard served in all five theaters in WWII , more often than not , records find him on the sick list complaining of a variety of ailments from conjunctivitis to ulcers .
These same records show that he was never engaged in enemy action and that he received only 4 awards , none for action or combat .
Upon being mustered out of the navy , he immediately applied for disability benefits , often writing to the VA pleading for an increase citing long bouts of depression and recurring thoughts of suicide .
Hubbard spent his convalescence in Los Angeles .
When his terminal leave from the navy commenced in December 1945 , he immediately went to the home of Jack Parsons in Pasadena .
Parsons was a science fiction fan , a rocket and explosives chemist and a practitioner of black magic .
He operated the California branch of the Ordo Templi Orientis out of his house .
The OTO was an advanced secret society to which high - ranking Freemasons migrate in a process of occult succession .
OTO rituals were fine - tuned by British Satanist , magician and Intelligence agent Aleister Crowley .
Parsons was in communication with Crowley , regularly informing him of the progress of the California chapter .
Hubbard also felt a keen bond with Crowley after reading his Book of the Law in the Library of Congress as a teenager .
Later , in a taped 1952 lecture Hubbard would thank , “ … the late Aleister Crowley , my very good friend . ”
Parsons and Hubbard engaged in various black magic rituals over many nights in an effort to produce a homunculus .
Although reports of their association make interesting reading , the two eventually had a falling - out and Hubbard would abscond to Florida with Parsons ’ mistress and life savings .
At the time , Crowley wrote to Karl Germer , the OTO head in America .
A keen student of human nature , Crowley observed , “ Suspect Ron playing confidence trick .
Jack evidently weak fool .
Obvious victim of prowling swindlers . ”
Parsons would later self - immolate in his garage during an experiment that went awry .
His mother committed suicide the following day .
Police would find home movies of Parsons having sex with his mother and the family dog .
Thereafter , L. Ron Hubbard spent several years grinding out science fiction and short stories for New York pulp magazines for a penny a word .
Although his output was prodigious , he did n’t see any real money until the 1950 publication of his book Dianetics , a self - help manual tinged with the eastern mysticism that Hubbard allegedly picked up from his years of wandering the Far East as a lad , engaging Tibetan shamans and Chinese mystics in philosophical discourse .
In truth , Hubbard loathed China , having visited it as a teenager very briefly while en route to see his father who was stationed in Guam .
At the time , Hubbard ’s main lament was for all of the ‘ Chinks ’ despoiling the country .
And the only use he could conceive of for the Great Wall was to convert it into a roller coaster .
Hubbard would later morph the tenets of Dianetics into the spiritual crazy glue known as Scientology , employing a confounding nomenclature sometimes referred to as ‘ org - speak . ’
The first Church of Scientology was incorporated in California in 1954 .
Hubbard claimed that his system could be used to increase spiritual freedom , intelligence and to produce immortality .
Recruits go through auditing ( counseling ) sessions of ever escalating cost in order to be ‘ cleared ’ of ‘ thetans ’ ( souls ) .
A free soul must purge these body thetans in order to be truly liberated .
Only after investing $ 100,000 and countless hours of auditing will the ultimate secret of Scientology be revealed to the recruit .
This is the secret of Xenu .
According to Hubbard eschatology , 70 million years ago the planet Earth , then known as Teegeeack , had been one of 76 planets of the Galactic Federation that was badly overpopulated with hundreds of billions of people .
The evil overlord Xenu decreed that excess populations on these planets should be sent to Teegeeack , put next to volcanoes and blown to pieces .
The spirits or thetans of the victims were implanted with religious and technical images for 36 days .
They were then sent either to Hawaii or Los Palmas to be stuck together in clusters .
Humans are a collection or cluster of body thetans .
Xenu was rounded up after the fact and imprisoned in a mountain .
The reader is spared from a comprehensive rendition of the history of the Galactic Federation .
In a 1983 Penthouse interview , L. Ron Hubbard Jr. stated that he was born prematurely after his father botched an abortion attempt on his mother .
He claims that his father used copious quantities of drugs and even witnessed him injecting cocaine .
Hubbard Jr. has stated , “ I believed in Satanism .
There was no other religion in our house !
What a lot of people do n’t realize is that Scientology is black magic spread out over a long time period .
It ’s stretched out over a lifetime and you do n’t see it .
Black magic is the inner core of Scientology and it is probably the only part that really works .
Also , you ’ve got to understand that my father did not worship Satan .
He thought he was Satan . ” Ron Hubbard Jr. also claimed that his father practiced something called ‘ soul - cracking . ’
Hubbard Sr. would apparently beat his many mistresses and shoot them full of drugs in order to reach a state whereby , like a psychic hammer , he would break their souls and allow demonic powers to pour through them .
Junior also declared that the Scientology Operating Thetan techniques do the same thing .
Junior would go on to co-author the popular 1987 book L. Ron Hubbard : Messiah or Madman .
In that year the Church listed $ 503 million in income .
Two sinister Scientology graduates of the 60s were Robert DeGrimston and his wife Mary Ann .
He was a former architecture student and she was a former prostitute who believed herself to be Joseph Goebbels incarnate .
Both had an insatiable preoccupation with death and violence and it is perhaps inevitable that they ended up in San Francisco in 1967 where they established themselves as The Process Church of the Final Judgement .
They took up residence on Oak St. , in the so - called Devil House , two blocks from where Charles Manson had his ‘ family ’ and close by Anton Lavey ’s Church of Satan .
Processans wandered the Haight sporting black capes and black suits and preaching a gospel of doom and destruction .
The first edition of Ed Sanders ’ book The Family carries an interesting chapter on the Process Church .
But a Chicago lawyer convinced them to sue for defamation and the offending chapter was deleted from subsequent editions .
Robert Degrimston published several books on war ( his favorite theme ) and commanded his followers “ THOU SHALT KILL ! ” Another Process publication urged readers to experience the pleasures of grave robbing and necrophilia .
A rant in the ‘ Death ’ issue of their magazine was penned by Charles Manson .
Manson ’s rap was an amalgam of Process ideology and the 150 hours of Scientology auditing he ’d received during one of his numerous prison stints ( Charlie declared himself a ‘ Theta Clear ’ ) .
Contrary to popular belief , the Process is still around , having undergone numerous name changes over the years .
The first was the ‘ Four - P Movement . ’
Author Michael Newton wrote that the cult , “ is also deeply involved in white slavery , child pornography and the international narcotics trade . ”
Still other name changes for the Process included The Foundation Church of the Millenium , The Foundation Faith of God and then Best Friends Animal Sanctuary .
Today it is known as The Best Friends Animal Society and is located in Kanab , Utah .
Mary Ann Degrimston makes her home there along with several other former members .
Gone are the days when Process members journeyed to San Quentin to interview Manson .
Gone too are all references to Satan and doomsday .
Members now softpeddle their involvement in the Process Church of the Final Judgement citing juvenile misguidance .
The goal of the reformed church now is to save animals .
The large compound in southern Utah is their testament to this end .
And the animal sanctuary is a huge cash cow .
In 2003 the Society raised more than $ 20 million .
Perhaps the Degrimstons were wise to abandon Scientology when they did .
Robert currently works in New York City as a business consultant .
The Sea Org -
In the 1960s , after several years of generating vast sums from credulous recruits , Hubbard took Scientology to sea , in order to stymie various governments who were set to move against his church for fraud and tax evasion .
He purchased several large ships and drifted around the Mediterranean searching ancient archaeological sites where he ’d lived past lives .
These adventures lasted for almost a decade .
He devised cruel methods of discipline for recalcitrant followers that were enforced on a whim .
Once , he confined a 5 - year old deaf mute to a chain locker , the cold , wet , rat - infested area of the ship where anchor chains are stored .
Other malefactors were consigned to rusty tanks below decks where they chiseled off rust while standing in filthy bilge water .
Oxygen was supplied via tubes .
Other Scientologists would periodically pound on the hull to ensure that the scraping continued , oftentimes the punishment lasting for days .
A food bucket would be lowered down to the offending parties .
Stories of shipboard abuse are legion and too numerous to recount in this limited forum .
In the power vacuum that followed the death of L. Ron Hubbard in 1986 , high school dropout David Miscavige emerged as the de facto head of Scientology .
Known to his enemies as ‘ the poison dwarf , ’ the diminutive and asthmatic Miscavige even managed to depose Hubbard ’s wife .
He also ordered Hubbard ’s son Arthur to be his personal servant .
Miscavige and his followers do their best to attract high - profile members such as John Travolta , who has been in the cult for 20 years .
Gay porn star Paul Berrisi claims to have engaged in a homosexual relationship with Travolta that began in 1982 and lasted eight years .
Berrisi claims that Travolta dumped him for another man in 1990 .
In revenge , he sold his story to the National Enquirer in April of that year .
Shortly after the story broke , Travolta hastened to marry Scientologist Kelly Preston .
In 2000 Travolta starred in Battlefield Earth , a film adaptation of a Hubbard science fiction novel .
Critics roundly excoriated it as one of the worst films of all time .
Roger Ebert declared that it was like , “ … taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time .
It ’s not merely bad , but unpleasant in a hostile way . ”
Alt rocker Beck [ Hansen ] was raised in the cult .
His parents have been members for 30 years .
When pressed in interviews to admit his Scientology bona fides , he replies with a terse , ‘ no comment . ’
Obviously , Tom Cruise is the most high - profile Scientologist in the world .
For 20 years he has been assiduously courted by David Miscavige .
Both men traded effusive praise at a 2005 Scientology gala in England .
Referring to Cruise as “ the most dedicated Scientologist I know , ” Miscavige presented him with the church ’s first Freedom Medal of Valor .
According to Scientology ’s Impact Magazine Cruise replied , “ I have never met a more competent , a more intelligent , a more tolerant , a more compassionate being outside of what I have experienced from LRH . ”
Scientologist Nicole Kidman often accompanied Cruise to the church ’s 500 - acre compound at Gilman Hot Springs in the California desert .
Former member Maureen Bolstad was at Gilman for 17 years before leaving after a falling - out .
She recalled a night from years ago when a state of emergency was declared at the compound .
Dozens of Scientologists worked through the night planting a field of wild flowers so that Tom could impress Nicole .
On another occasion , dozens worked around the clock for three days renovating a skeet range so that Miscavige could impress Cruise .
Snickering and jibes aside , Tom Cruise is a major Hollywood player .
During the filming of War of the Worlds , he insisted that a Scientology info - booth be available on the set for interested crew members .
He had it staffed with ministers from the church .
Director Spielberg later complained that Cruise spent more time on film junkets promoting Scientology than the film .
And Scarlett Johansson was bounced from the cast of Mission Impossible 3 after proving unreceptive to Cruise ’s Scientology pitch .
Notwithstanding all of the celebrity endorsements , the church continues to suffer large financial losses .
In May 2002 , they paid more than $ 8 million to former member Lawrence Wollersheim after a 22 - year legal battle .
Miscavige astutely surmised that payment of the money would prevent additional evidence being presented in court that could expose Scientology ’s controversial IRS charitable tax exemption to review or repeal and the risk that top executives could be jailed for corporate and asset fraud .
Perhaps the final word on Scientology should go to Jamie Kennedy , great - grandson of L. Ron Hubbard .
Kennedy is a 25 - year old slam poet from San Francisco who bills himself , not inappropriately , as the ‘ Hellspawn Leprechaun . ’
He was expelled from high school after writing an epic poem vividly describing the massacre of all of his teachers , followed by a school explosion .
This was pre-Columbine .
He was kicked out of another school for obsessively writing about sex , death and murder .
Yet again , he was booted out of two college classes due to student complaints and obscenity charges .
His wife gave birth to a daughter a couple of years ago and Kennedy prays that she is the female Antichrist .
“ They ca n ’t shut me up .
I ’ve made a career out of not giving a f___ ! ” he declares .
Kennedy has the same red hair and occult predilections of his infamous relation .
“ Genetically , I think we share some traits .
In high school a psychiatrist asked me if I had a history of mental illness in my family .
I said , well , my great - grandfather was a cult leader . ”
Hellspawn , indeed …

For instance , produce from the Dominican Republic was stopped 813 times last year , usually for containing traces of illegal pesticides .
Candy from Denmark was impounded 82 times .
By comparison , Chinese seafood was stopped at the border 331 times during the last year .
“ The reality is , this is not a single - country issue at all , ” said Carl R. Nielsen , who resigned from the Food and Drug Administration in 2005 , after 28 years .
His last job was director of the division of import operations and policy in the agency ’s Office of Regulatory Affairs .
“ What we are experiencing is massive globalization , ” he said .
The F.D.A. database does not necessarily capture a full and accurate picture of product quality from other countries .
For one thing , only one year of data is available on the agency ’s Web site , and F.D.A. officials declined to provide more data without a formal Freedom of Information request , a process that can take months , if not years .
In addition , the F.D.A. inspects only about 1 percent of the imports that fall under its jurisdiction .
So the agency may miss many of the products that are contaminated or defective .
The F.D.A. database also fails to disclose the quantity of products that are refused , so it is impossible to know whether just a box of cucumbers was refused or a shipload .
In cases of recurrent problems , the F.D.A. may issue an import alert , which leads to additional scrutiny at the border .
Last month , for instance , the F.D.A. issued not only the import alert for the Chinese fish , but also import alerts for Mexican cantaloupes and basmati rice from India , among others .
The board of election commissioners of Lenawee County met at 1:10 pm this afternoon and approved the clarity of the language of the Walberg Recall Petition .
Petitions are at the printer now and the recall will begin as soon as the necessary administrative tasks have been completed .
To the editor ,
As the petitioner who presented the recall petition for Congressman Tim Walberg to the Lenawee County Board of Election Commissioners , I would like to explain my motivation and purpose .
Congressman Walberg was elected with an obscene amount of campaign funds , a sizable percentage of which came from outside the 7th District .
Further , he won the election with less than a majority of the votes cast in our district in November of 2006 .
He had vowed , during his campaign and since , that he will oppose any increase in taxes , yet , each time that he votes for any bill in Congress that is not supported by sufficient tax dollars to pay for its enactment and promulgation , he is supporting the raising of taxes and passing that tax burden on as a tax increase on all of our citizens .
He voted against an effort to bring the troops home , thereby continuing the slaughter and maiming of one our our most important assets , our young soldiers .
This conflict has been instigated and conducted without the approval of Congress , which is required by the U.S. Constitution .
It has resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis , many of them women and children .
It has destroyed that land , its infrastructure , its industry and its economy .
It is time that this insanity by our federal government be brought to a vote of the people , which is not influenced by the money of special interests .
A recall petition by a citizen is the purest form of democracy that exists in this land .
It is sanctioned by the US Constitution ( Amendment X ) and by the laws of the State of Michigan , namely Secxtion 168.149 , Act 116 of 1954 , Michigan Election Law .
This petition was written by me .
Neither the Republican nor Democratic parties has had any influence on this action , and nor will they .
The hiring of a lawyer to confuse the election board with a sheaf of papers only delayed the inevitable , which is that a recall petition will sooner or later be approved and circulated in the 7th Congressional District of Michigan .
Finally , the irony of this effort to stymie the recall petition is that in order for such a recall to come to fruition , the signatures of at least 45,000 voters will need to be gathered .
I certainly cannot do that myself and I do not intend to do so .
This is the challenge of the voters of the 7th District .
Do you want to continue to be represented by Congressman Walberg or do you want to effect a change in our district ’s representation ?
If you want to change , sign the petition ; if not , ignore the opportunity and continue to line up for parades for our fallen soldiers and continue to pay an excessive amount of taxes solely to fund a destructive and poorly conceived conflict far from our shores .
James R. Carr
Jackson
Citizen Patriot
No doubt James Carr is sincere in his desire to see U.S. Rep.
Tim Walberg leave office .
The Jackson resident disagrees with the congressman politically , particularly with Walberg 's support for the Iraq war .
Fine .
Lots of folks do n't agree with the congressman .
But that 's not reason enough to back Carr 's effort to recall Walberg .
The Lenawee County elections board Monday may approve a recall petition , although Walberg 's campaign maintains the Constitution should block that from happening .
However that board rules , what should concern everyone is the idea of a recall in the first place .
This should n't be about politics , but about doing right by democracy .
Since the Republican Walberg was narrowly elected in November , he has done little other than what he said he would .
He is a fiscal and social conservative , and he has voted as such .
He said during the campaign that he supported having U.S. troops in Iraq , and he still does .
He has n't deceived the public .
He has n't been accused of a crime .
He has n't engaged in tawdry behavior that has disgraced his office .
In all , Walberg does n't deserve a recall effort .
Carr , who explains his recall petition on today 's Opinion page , wants to put the Iraq war on the ballot .
But if the war is your chief concern , you 've had two chances to vote on the issue -- in 2004 and 2006 .
Republicans who supported the war won this area 's congressional seat both times .
Like it or do n't , the voters had their say .
A recall raises other issues , too .
Even if enough people sign the petition , a vote to oust Walberg would n't take place until next year .
But as things stand , he will be challenged in the November 2008 election .
The congressman 's critics will get their chance to give him the boot soon enough .
There 's no need to rush into things with an expensive recall , financed by taxpayer dollars .
UPDATE :
Battle Creek Enquirer
I just got an e-mail from James Carr : Now comes the gathering of 50,000 or so valid signatures , an incredibly difficult task .
However , I 've got a feeling that Carr and his supporters will attack the problem with enthusiasm .
It 'll be interesting to see what happens .
Here 's the letter to the editor that Carr sent to several area newspapers explaining his motivations :...
And , in the interest of fairness , here 's the anti-recall editorial from the As it is undeniably a Walberg - related story , I 'll certainly be reporting on the progress of the recall as it moves forward .
However , just as Walberg Watch will not endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary , this blog will not take a position on the recall effort .
I invite my fellow contributors and readers to share their thoughts , both for and against the effort .
Thehas a poll on their website about the Walberg recall .
When I checked it just before 1:30 PM on August 8th , this is what the result was : Interesting ...

PITTSBURGH -- Carnegie Mellon University neuroscientist Marcel Just and Stanford postdoctoral fellow Sashank Varma have put forward a new computational theory of brain function that provides answers to one of the central questions of modern science :
How does the human brain organize itself to give rise to complex cognitive tasks such as reading , problem solving and spatial reasoning ?
Just and Varma 's theory , called 4CAPS , is described in the fall issue of the journal Cognitive , Affective , and Behavioral Neuroscience .
More than a decade of research involving functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging brain scans in hundreds of laboratories has yielded a tremendous amount of information about what parts of the brain are activated when a person performs various tasks .
Some researchers have been tempted to conclude that a simple one - to - one relationship exists between high - level mental tasks and brain areas .
For example , some believe that a specific brain area is responsible for a specific cognitive task , such as identifying a face .
Just and Varma , however , propose that the evidence reveals a more complex picture in which thinking is a network function -- a collaboration of several brain areas that is constantly adapting itself , based on the task at hand and the brain 's own resources and biological limitations .
The collaborating parts of the brain , according to Just , are like members of a sports team whose players substitute in and out of the action .
4CAPS ( an acronym for Capacity Constrained Concurrent Cortical Activation - based Production System ) , proposes a decentralized process by which members of the cortical team volunteer themselves when their strengths are called for , but also permits less efficient but capable members to step forward when the primary player is injured or disabled , as might occur as a result of a stroke .
Just and Varma have constructed a number of computational models to demonstrate this process , such as a model that understands English sentences .
A unique characteristic of the theory is that it can accurately predict the change in brain activation that results from some types of brain damage or disease .
For example , if a stroke damages the part of the brain known as Broca 's area -- which is located in the left prefrontal cortex and is involved in language processing -- the corresponding site on the right side of the brain often becomes activated during language processing , even within hours after a stroke .
According to 4CAPS , the same dynamic allocation mechanism that allows brain areas to volunteer themselves on a moment - by - moment basis would also come into play if Broca 's area were damaged , and would allow any excess computational load to spill over to the right hemisphere mirror site on a more permanent basis .
Another example occurs with Alzheimer 's disease , where the damage to some brain areas causes additional " helper " areas to be recruited to perform a task , additional areas that are not typically used by control subjects who do not have the disease .
" Many brain - imaging studies have shown as the nature of the task changes , so does the set of activating brain areas , " said Just , the D.O. Hebb Professor of Psychology .
" It is as though substitutions of team players are being made dynamically in response to changes in the game . "
" We credit this dynamic mechanism with the fluidity or adaptability of human intelligence , and with much of the plasticity that occurs with learning or with recovery from brain damage , " Just said .
4CAPS provides a framework for scientists and medical researchers to better understand nascent topics in neuroscience , such as how brain areas communicate and collaborate with one another during the thought process and how this can go awry .
For example , Just and his colleagues have proposed an influential theory of autism , called the underconnectivity theory , that attributes the disorder to poor connectivity and hence communication between frontal areas of the brain and more posterior areas .
The individual areas still have their specializations , according to the theory , but they cannot communicate as well with each other , and may develop a tendency to operate more independently of each .
The theory also provides an account of what limits our ability to do multitasking .
" The thousands of facts that scientists have learned from brain imaging studies cry out for some sort of organization , some way to impose coherence , and ultimately to understand the brain system that is producing the results , " Just said .
" The theory provides a new conceptual framework for understanding how the fluidity of thought arises from the dynamics of brain activity .
" As neurological issues arise in education , aging and development , and as a basis for a knowledge - based economy , it will become increasingly important that human brain function be understood by students , parents and educators , patients and doctors , trainees and managers , citizens and policy - makers . "

Many adults were too afraid to work with children
A survey by Scotland 's Commissioner for Children and Young People revealed that the fear of being accused of harming young people was the main deterrent .
Kathleen Marshall 's study found a shortage of adults prepared to take work roles and volunteering posts .
More than 1,100 people took part in the detailed survey .
Some 48 % of adults surveyed said fear of being falsely accused of causing harm was a barrier to contact with children and young people .
This same fear also made adults much less likely to help when they saw a young person in danger or distress .
Young people consistently tell us they want safe and fun things to do and that anti-social behaviour is a result of a shortage of opportunities for ' social behaviour '

The report also revealed that adults who work with young people in structured environments tend to have positive attitudes towards them , and enjoy seeing children and young people develop through their involvement .
However , people reported much more negative attitudes to meeting young people in informal groups , especially in large groups on the street .
According to the report , fear was largely fuelled by media reporting rather than people 's personal knowledge of young people .
Other concerns included fear of young people themselves , and concerns about bureaucracy and the culture of litigation .
Women are almost twice as likely to have formal contact with children and young people , either as a volunteer or through work , the survey showed .
' Social behaviour '
Men in particular reported being afraid of being falsely accused of being a paedophile which they described as " the worst thing imaginable " .
Men are also disproportionately less likely to approach a lost child and try to help .
Ms Marshall said : " Young people consistently tell us they want safe and fun things to do and that anti-social behaviour is a result of a shortage of opportunities for ' social behaviour ' .
" The activities they want to take part in need adults to volunteer and support them and this report shows exactly why that is n't happening .
" We need to help bridge the divide between the generations and establish a framework for attractive activities that are stimulating , safe and fun for all involved .
" I hope this report will start a full public debate about how that should be done , and everyone who has ever worked with young people or considered doing so has something to contribute to that debate , as do Scotland 's young people themselves . "
Potential volunteers
George Thomson , chief executive of Volunteer Development Scotland , said that potential volunteers needed greater support .
He added : " We must now have the conviction and courage to overcome the challenges and find ways to take up the offer of voluntary help from adults in a way that benefits everyone . "
John Loughton , chair of Scottish Youth Parliament , said that both adults and young people should feel safe , without " wrapping either of them in cotton wool " .
A Scottish Government spokesman said : " We understand that some people are put off by checks - that 's why we are simplifying it to cut down on multiple checks . "
He said a new system would be in place in 2009 .
Losing faith in Obama .
If you look around the liberal blogs today , there 's a lot of frustration with the Senate bill to grant immunity to telecoms who have helped the Bush administration illegally spy on Americans .
High profile bloggers like Glenn Greenwald , Markos Moulitsas , Atrios , Jane Hamsher , and Big Tent Democrat at MyDD have been urging their readers to put pressure on the Senate to block the bill by contacting ... Chris Dodd .
If anyone from the Obama campign is paying attention , this should serve as a wake - up call .
A representative cross section of the liberal blogosphere no longer thinks Barack Obama is willing to stand up to the Bush Administration [...]
The Obama campaign has been playing it safe for months now , so it should be no surprise that the base no longer expects him to , in the words of his campaign , " challenge the status quo and get results " .
It 's not too late for Obama to turn things around .
I still think Obama would make a fantastic president , but if he wants his grassroots - fueled campaign to regain some momentum , he needs to start by recognizing that people no longer see him as the go - to guy to buck the Washington establishment and be a champion for change .
Q. What ’s the relevance to health care ?
A . In health care , rather than replicating the expensive expertise of Mount Sinai Medical Center or Mass General Hospital or replicating the expensive expertise of doctors , we have to commoditize their expertise .
That comes through the precise ability to diagnose the diseases that people have .
Our ability to diagnose the diseases is moving ahead at a breathtaking pace , but regulation and reimbursement are trapping the delivery of rules - based medicine in high - cost business models .
Q . An example of what you mean ?
A. A hundred years ago , there was a big disease that nobody understood and was often fatal , called consumption .
Little by little , medical science began to unpack that symptomatic description , which was that your lungs filled up with gunk and you died .
The reason we could n’t cure it was that what we thought was a single disease was a whole bunch of different diseases .
You had tuberculosis there , at least three types , and you had pneumonia .
We thought it was all one disease .
So the care had to be left with doctors because they were the ones with the training and the judgment , but once you could precisely diagnose the cause of the disease , you could then develop a cure .
It was so rules - based that you did n’t need a doctor any longer .
Today a technician can diagnose those diseases and a nurse can treat them .
Q . Are you saying doctors rather than the pharmaceutical industry are the root cause of what ’s gone wrong ?
A . The pharmaceutical industry has been focused on therapy , not diagnosis .
The medical profession has simply accepted that many of these diseases are well - diagnosed , when in fact they are n’t .
As a consequence , we have n’t moved the health care profession into a world where nurses can provide diagnosis and care .
Regulation is keeping the treatment in expensive hospitals when in fact much lower cost - delivery models are available .
Q. Would n’t your solution require a dramatically different regulatory environment ?
A . It differs state by state .
In Massachusetts , nurses cannot write prescriptions .
But in Minnesota , nurse practitioners can .
So there has emerged in Minnesota a clinic called the MinuteClinic .
These clinics operate in Target stores and CVS drugstores .
They are staffed only by nurse practitioners .
There ’s a big sign on the door that says , “ We treat these 16 rules - based disorders . ”
They include strep throat , pink eye , urinary tract infection , earaches and sinus infections .

Joe Biden , the loquacious long - shot Democratic presidential candidate , warned President Bush Thursday that he would move for impeachment if the president unilaterally authorized a military strike against Iran .
“ The President has no authority to unilaterally attack Iran and … if he does , as foreign relations committee chairman and former chairman of judiciary , I will move to impeach him , ” Biden told a crowd of about 100 potential voters at a campaign stop in New Hampshire .
Biden said he is meeting with constitutional law experts and plans to send Bush a legal memo formally outlining his warning , according to Seacoast Online , which reported his comments .
The senior Delaware senator told the crowd that calls for Bush ’s immediate impeachment were valid but may not have enough constitutional support to make them viable .
He added that Bush was n’t the only White House figure who deserves to be booted .
“ If you ’re going to impeach George Bush , you better impeach Cheney first , ” Biden said , garnering applause from the crowd .

Convicted sex offenders who used websites to help them commit their crimes are to be banned from using the internet under a tough new measure signed into New Jersey law yesterday .
The bill , which was signed by the state 's acting governor Richard J. Codey , will apply to offenders who used email or other electronic messages in carrying out their crimes , reports Associated Press .
Paroled sex offenders under lifetime supervision will also have to obey the new law .
However , the ban exempts computer work done as part of a job or search for employment .
Sex offenders will be required to tell the state parole board about their computer access and will also be subjected to surprise examinations of their computer kit .
Those caught using the internet can expect 18 months in jail and a $ 10,000 fine .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The CIA destroyed videotapes of interrogations of al Qaeda suspects because they no longer had " intelligence value " and they posed a security risk , CIA director Michael Hayden said Thursday .
CIA Director Michael Hayden says congressional leaders were told about the tapes .
The tapes were made in 2002 and destroyed in 2005 , Hayden said in a letter to CIA employees obtained by CNN .
They were made as " an internal check " on the CIA 's use of harsh interrogation techniques , believed to include waterboarding , a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on them to simulate drowning .
The agency made the decision to destroy the tapes " only after it was determined they were no longer of intelligence value and not relevant to any internal , legislative , or judicial inquiries , " Hayden said .
" Beyond their lack of intelligence value -- as the interrogation sessions had already been exhaustively detailed in written channels -- and the absence of any legal or internal reason to keep them , the tapes posed a serious security risk , " Hayden said .
" Were they ever to leak , they would permit identification of your CIA colleagues who had served in the program , exposing them and their families to retaliation from al Qaeda and its sympathizers . "
Hayden said he was providing the background information to CIA employees because he expected possible " misinterpretations of the facts in the days ahead . "
Watch why the tapes ' destruction is controversial »
A government official with knowledge of the tapes said the tapes were of al Qaeda operative Abu Zubayda and another detainee .
Hayden said the agency began taping interrogations after the 2002 capture of Zubayda , whose " defiant and evasive " response to " normal questioning ... made imperative the use of other means to obtain the information . "
" To meet that need , CIA designed specific , appropriate interrogation procedures , " Hayden wrote .
" Before they were used , they were reviewed and approved by the Department of Justice and by other elements of the executive branch . "
To ensure the interrogations proceeded " in accord with established legal and policy guidelines , " the agency began videotaping the questioning .
The videotaping began and ended in 2002 , Hayden said .
The director said the Office of the General Counsel and the Office of the Inspector General examined the tapes in 2003 and determined the interrogations were lawful .
Hayden also said the leaders of the CIA 's congressional oversight committees were informed " years ago " of the videos and the agency 's intent to destroy them .
" What matters here is that it was done in line with the law , " he said .
" Over the course of its life , the agency 's interrogation program has been of great value to our country .
It has helped disrupt terrorist operations and save lives .
It was built on a solid foundation of legal review .
It has been conducted with careful supervision .
If the story of these tapes is told fairly , it will underscore those facts . "
U.S. President George W. Bush disclosed the detention of Zubayda in September 2006 and said his behavior prompted the use of " an alternative set of procedures , " which he said were cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice .
Information obtained from Zubayda under the new interrogation procedures led investigators to al Qaeda member Ramzi bin al Shibh , Bush said , and information from Zubayda and bin al Shibh led investigators to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the mastermind of the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
Critics have questioned the importance of the information obtained from Zubayda , and the entire question of what type of interrogation techniques are appropriate for use by the United States became a key issue in the confirmation process for Attorney General Michael Mukasey .
Sen . Patrick Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee , said news the CIA destroyed the videotapes " is troubling , and it fits a pattern we have seen repeatedly during this administration . "
" When an administration abandons the moral high ground to take the low road , they are mortgaging the historic commitment to human rights that is part of the legacy of every American .
The damage is compounded when such actions are hidden away from accountability , " Leahy said in a statement .

Bollywood is big in Yorkshire { Picture by Tim Smith}
Enlarge Image
It 's a typical Bollywood extravaganza : a forbidden passion , a wife betrayed , a broken heart , a mother and daughter on the run and ... fish and chips .
Yes , fish and chips .
Because Bollywood dancing has hit the northern English county of Yorkshire - famed for its love of what was once Britain 's favourite dish before it was overtaken by chicken tikka masala .
In fact , so popular is Bollywood dancing in Yorkshire that the county 's pre-eminent theatre - the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds - is staging a performance of a play called Bollywood Jane throughout June .
Disenchanted daughter
More than 60 eager young people from all walks of life are auditioning to take part , a reflection of the surge in popularity for this form of dancing in Yorkshire .
Bollywood Jane is the story of a British Asian single mother who has " done a runner " from her boyfriend who lives next door .
She ends up in the Yorkshire town of Bradford with just a few bags of clothes and Jane , her disenchanted daughter .
Life for the pair is looking pretty grim .
But then Jane meets a local man , Dini , and she is swept away .
Simple routine
In true Bollywood style , the production contains sequins , saris and a glamorous team of backing dancers .
You do not have to be slim or beautiful to do Bollywood dancing
Zoobin Surty
But can Jane escape her drab life and become Bollywood Jane for real ?
" You will have to find out for yourself , " says instructor Zoobin Surty , who is overseeing auditions for the chorus .
Young hopefuls in groups of 10 are invited to join him on the dance floor and carry out a simple routine .
Most are under 25 - years - old , and give the impression they would be totally at home on any Mumbai film set , performing their dance routines with apparent ease .
I did n't fare quite so well and was - sadly - invited by the audition panel to take an early exit .
' Spirit and charisma '
" Bollywood dancing has really caught on in Yorkshire , " says Zoobin , who came to the county a few years ago from Mumbai and now runs classes in the cities of York , Leeds and Bradford , with plans to expand to nearby Manchester .
He is now a cultural dance ambassador for South Asian Arts in Yorkshire .
Alastair Lawson was asked by the audition panel to take an early exit
" People here seem to like Bollywood dancing for its expression , poise and rhythm , " he says .
" Its not so coarse as disco dancing but a little less sophisticated than traditional ballroom dancing .
" You do not have to be slim and beautiful to do it .
All you need are passion , spirit and charisma . "
Zoobin says that his form of Bollywood dancing is a " fusion of Indian classical dancing with Western dance moves " .
He says that while Bollywood Jane in part sticks to the typical Bollywood formula - where boy meets girl who fall in love after a series of tribulations - the production has a sting in its tail .
And young dancers of the county seem to adore it .
" It 's exciting , it 's physically testing , it 's graceful and above all it's fun , " says teenaged auditionist Holly Cassidy .
It seems as if the people of Yorkshire have embraced Bollywood with the same kind of enthusiasm that many cricket fans in India have for the batsman Geoffrey Boycott .
The mention of his name in India still prompts the refrain of " eh up Geoffrey " .
" I am happy to be helping what is already a strong relationship become even stronger , " says Zoobin with characteristic modesty .

Watch young chimps outperform their human counterparts at the memory game
Young chimps can beat adult humans in a task involving remembering numbers , reveals a new study .
It is the first time chimps – and young ones , at that – have outperformed humans at a cognitive task .
And the finding may add weight to a theory about the evolution of language in humans , say the researchers .
Three adult female chimps , their three 5 - year - old offspring , and university student volunteers were tested on their ability to memorise the numbers 1 to 9 appearing at random locations on a touchscreen monitor .
Advertisement
The chimps had previously been taught the ascending order of the numbers .
Using an ability akin to photographic memory , the young chimps were able to memorise the location of the numerals with better accuracy than humans performing the same task .
During the test , the numerals appeared on the screen for 650 , 430 or 210 milliseconds , and were then replaced by blank white squares .
Photographic memory
While the adult chimps were able to remember the location of the numbers in the correct order with the same or worse ability as the humans , the three adolescent chimps outperformed the humans .
The youngsters easily remembered the locations , even at the shortest duration , which does not leave enough time for the eye to move and scan the screen .
This suggests that they use a kind of eidetic or photographic memory .
In rare cases , human children have a kind of photographic memory like that shown by the young chimps , but it disappears with age , says Tetsuro Matsuzawa , at the primate research institute at Kyoto University , Japan , who led the study .
( See a video library of chimp cognition . )
He suggests that early humans lost the skill as we acquired other memory - related skills such as representation and hierarchical organisation .
“ In the course of evolution we humans lost it , but acquired a new skill of symbolisation – in other words , language , ” he says .
“ We had to lose some function to get a new function . ”
‘ Humbling ’ discovery
The finding challenges human assumptions about our uniqueness , and should make us think harder about ourselves in relation to other animals , says anthropologist Jill Pruetz of Iowa State University , Ames , US .
“ Observing that other species can outperform us on tasks that we assume we excel at is a bit humbling , ” she says .
“ Rather than taking such findings as a rare example or a fluke , we should incorporate this knowledge into a mindset that acknowledges that chimpanzees – and probably other species – share aspects of what we think of as uniquely human intelligence . ”
The results are “ absolutely incredible ” says Frans de Waal , at the Yerkes Primate Center at Emory University , Atlanta , Georgia , US .
He says that chimp intelligence is chronically underestimated , and one reason is that experiments stack the deck against the chimps .
In the wild , this memory skill might be useful for memorising fruit locations at a glance , or making a quick map of all the branches and routes in a tree , he says .
Matsuzawa emphasises that the chimps in the study are by no means special – all chimps can perform like this , he says .
“ We underestimate chimpanzee intelligence , ” he says .
“ We are 98.77 % chimpanzee .
We are their evolutionary neighbours . ”

Type 1 diabetes may be caused by faulty versions of two genes that usually help the body to fight infection .
Joanna Howson at the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research , UK , and colleagues think that faulty variants of HLA - A and HLA - B lead the immune system to destroy insulin - producing islet cells in the pancreas .
Usually , the two genes make components of MHC1 – a protein on the surface of immune cells that helps them tell friend from foe .
Sure enough , the team found that the class of immune cells known to attack islet cells were those activated by MHC1 ( Nature , DOI : 10.1038/nature06406 ) . …
New Science Raises the Specter of a World Without Regret
The Guilt - Free Soldier
by
Erik Baard
Pills like those wo n't be available to the troops heading off for possible war with Iraq , but the prospect of a soul absolved by meds remains very real .
Feelings of guilt and regret travel neural pathways in a manner that mimics the tracings of ingrained fear , so a prophylactic against one could guard against the other .
Several current lines of research , some federally funded , show strong promise for this .
At the University of California at Irvine , experiments in rats indicate that the brain 's hormonal reactions to fear can be inhibited , softening the formation of memories and the emotions they evoke .
At New York University , researchers are mastering the means of short - circuiting the very wiring of primal fear .
At Columbia University one Nobel laureate 's lab has discovered the gene behind a fear - inhibiting protein , uncovering a vision of " fight or flight " at the molecular level .
In Puerto Rico , at the Ponce School of Medicine , scientists are discovering ways to help the brain unlearn fear and inhibitions by stimulating it with magnets .
And at Harvard University , survivors of car accidents are already swallowing propranolol pills , in the first human trials of that common cardiac drug as a means to nip the effects of trauma in the bud .
The web of your worst nightmares , your hauntings and panics and shame , radiates from a dense knot of neurons called the amygdala .
With each new frightening or humiliating experience , or even the reliving of an old one , this fear center triggers a release of hormones that sear horrifying impressions into your brain .
That which is unbearable becomes unforgettable too .
Unless , it seems , you act quickly enough to block traumatic memories from taking a stranglehold .
Some observers say that in the name of human decency there are some things people should have to live with .
They object to the idea of medicating away one 's conscience .
" It 's the morning - after pill for just about anything that produces regret , remorse , pain , or guilt , " says Dr. Leon Kass , chairman of the President 's Council on Bioethics , who emphasizes that he 's speaking as an individual and not on behalf of the council .
Barry Romo , a national coordinator for Vietnam Veterans Against the War , is even more blunt .
" That 's the devil pill , " he says .
" That 's the monster pill , the anti-morality pill .
That 's the pill that can make men and women do anything and think they can get away with it .
Even if it does n't work , what 's scary is that a young soldier could believe it will . "
Are we ready for the infamous Nuremberg plea - " I was just following orders " - to be made easier with pharmaceuticals ?
Though the research so far has been limited to animals and the most preliminary of human trials , the question is worth debating now .
" If you have the pill , it certainly increases the temptation for the soldier to lower the standard for taking lethal action , if he thinks he 'll be numbed to the personal risk of consequences .
We do n't want soldiers saying willy - nilly , ' Screw it .
I can take my pill and even if doing this is not really warranted , I 'll be OK , ' " says psychiatrist Edmund G. Howe , director of the Program on Medical Ethics at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences .
" If soldiers are going to have that lower threshold , we might have to build in even stronger safeguards than we have right now against , say , blowing away human shields .
We 'll need a higher standard of proof [ that an action is justified ] . "
The scientists behind this advance into the shadows of memory and fear do n't dream of creating morally anesthetized grunts .
They 're trying to fend off post - traumatic stress disorder , or PTSD , so that women who 've been raped can leave their houses without feeling like targets .
So that survivors of terrorist attacks can function , raise families , and move forward .
And yes , so that those young soldiers are n't left shattered for decades by what they 've seen and done in service .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Combat and psychoactive chemicals have always been inseparable , whether the agent was alcohol or a space - age pill .
A half - century after Japan hopped its soldiers up on methylamphetamines during World War II , the U.S. has pilots currently in the dock for mistakenly bombing Canadian troops while using speed to stay awake .
When Eric Kandel , the Nobel laureate in medicine who works out of Columbia , was asked if his genetic exploration of fear was funded by the Pentagon 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , he quipped , " No , but you 're welcome to call them and tell them about me . "
Imagine a world where the same pill soothed victims and perpetrators alike .
Henry David Thoreau advised , " Make the most of your regrets ; never smother your sorrow .
. . .
To regret deeply is to live afresh . "
Without remorse , there would have been no John Newton , a slave trader who found religion during a harrowing storm at sea and later became an abolitionist ; he 's best known for penning " Amazing Grace . "
For doctors , the drugs would present a tricky dilemma .
Most people exposed to traumatic situations do n't end up with PTSD , but there are few means of knowing on the spot who might need treatment much further down the line .
Researchers say that for the medicines to be effective , patients would need to take them soon after the upsetting event .
The temptation for physicians might be to err on the side of caution , at the cost of curbing normal emotional responses .
Victims might be eager to avoid lasting pain , wrongdoers the full sting of self - examination .
" The impulse is to help people to not fall apart .
You do n't want to condemn that , " says Kass .
" But that you would treat these things with equanimity , the horrible things of the world , so that they do n't disturb you . . . you 'd cease to be a human being . "
The very idea of PTSD has been attacked as a social construction , a vague catchall that provides exculpation for the misdeeds of war .
But researchers are trying to prevent the onset of a disease , not change the social circumstances that bring it about .
James L. McGaugh , a neurobiologist at U.C.
Irvine whose study of stress hormones and memory consolidation in rats is one of the cornerstones of the effort , acknowledges the ambiguities but comes out swinging in defense of his work .
" Is it immoral to weaken the memory of horrendous acts a person has committed ?
Well , I suppose one might make that case .
Some of your strongest memories are of embarrassments and of the guilty things you did .
It does n't surprise me at all that people would wake up screaming , thinking of the young children they killed in Vietnam , " McGaugh says .
" But is treating that worse than saying , ' Do n't worry if your leg is shot off , we 've got penicillin and surgery to prevent you from dying of infection ' ?
Why is it any worse to give them a drug that prevents them from having PSTD for the rest of their lives ?
The moral dilemma is sending people to war in the first place . "
Nevertheless , fellow fear researcher Dr. Gregory Quirk of the Ponce School of Medicine , in Puerto Rico , is troubled by how his work might be used if it progressed from studies of rats to therapies for humans .
He argues that fear is n't created and degraded in the amygdala alone , but is also unlearned in the prefrontal cortex , which in PTSD patients is only weakly active .
Quirk thinks a physician could stimulate those areas with magnets while patients view the images they fear , and could thus restore balance to the mind .
With that same method , he says , firemen could stave off episodes of life - threatening panic .
" Certainly the military might be interested in something like that , " he says .
" If this would be used to go against fear that 's important for survival or morality , I would have a problem with that . "
There are reasons to believe our military would covet mastery of Quirk 's technique in humans .
People at war dehumanize their enemies to make killing more palatable .
Now , in the war on terror , our modern cultural taboos against torture are fraying .
Put yourself in the room then .
The commission of heinous acts , even deliberate torture , can also visit lifelong torment on perpetrators who are n't hardwired very well to be sadistic .
The sounds of screaming - a primordial alert that mortal danger is near - trigger those damning hormones even in the torturer .
And couple Quirk 's magnetic manipulation of the brain with this : " One of the horrible things I discovered after the Gulf War was that , because of the coeducation of wars , as it were , male soldiers were given extensive desensitization training to make them able to hear women being raped and tortured in the next room without breaking , " Kass says .
" It 's a deformation of the soul of the first order .
I can not speak about it without outrage . "
But a trauma - born irrational aversion to necessary war - pacifism in the face of an expanding evil - is n't healthy either .
" Such emotions can blind us as well as make us wiser , " says Howe .
" It 's possible that these kinds of drugs would help patients see in a clearer way . "
On the flip side , could anyone possibly maintain that Ahab was a better captain for not having been chemically mollified after the white whale bit off his leg ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An uncomfortable reality is that war is n't an aberration ; it has a very codified place in our culture .
We agree through treaties to normalize it .
We demand punishment for soldiers who violate those treaties , though more often those from the losing side .
But we do n't deny them medical treatment .
And one need n't have committed a war crime to feel wracked by sorrow .
" In my dreams I meet six Vietnamese people I murdered .
Whether they had a gun on them is irrelevant , " says Romo , who , as a 19 - year - old lieutenant , served as a platoon leader in the 196th Light Infantry Brigade in 1967 and 1968 .
His ticket home was as a body escort for his similarly aged nephew , who served in the same unit .
" I returned to the United States on my nephew 's dead body , " he says .
Romo and veterans like him have taken it upon themselves to use their experiences to teach peace .
But veterans torn apart by PTSD do n't have a choice about being Exhibit A in the case against war .
" When you see what can happen to a young person , it passes on in a very real way , not in a history - class sense , that reality of what war and blood really is , " he says .
Who are we to impose this emotionalalbatross on soldiers ?
As a nation , we elect our leaders .
It seems unjust to make veterans a special class to suffer for our sins in wrongheaded wars , or pay a continuing price for victory in the " good " ones .
" That 's a heavy burden to put on people to preserve the morality you 're talking about , " says Dr. Roger K. Pitman of Harvard University , who 's leading the propranolol study in people fresh from car accidents .
" By that same logic , if you could make a lightweight bulletproof garment for soldiers we still should n't do it .
For moral reasons we ought to make them able to be shot , to preserve the cost of war , the deterrent to war .
But we work to prevent our soldiers from being shot , and I say there are mental bullets flying around there , too . "
There 's another context to be considered as well , McGaugh notes , one that was made clear by the recent demand from representatives Charles B. Rangel of New York and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan that we reinstate the draft to address racial and economic inequities .
" Who are our soldiers ? " McGaugh asks .
" They are in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Very few of their daddies go to Harvard , Yale , or Princeton . "
But PTSD does n't result solely from war .
When Kass first heard of McGaugh 's research , at a presentation in October , he had a far more intimate horror in mind : rape .
" At fraternity parties they 'll be popping Ecstasy at night and forgetfulness in the morning , " he growls .
The victim would be an obvious candidate for an anti-trauma drug .
Would dulling her emotional memories of the event help her to endure the lengthy , perhaps humiliating , pursuit of justice through the courts , or would it rob her of the righteous anger she 'll need to persevere and perhaps the empathy to later help other victims ?
The rapist is part of the equation too .
If his victim stabbed him in her own defense , no doubt he would be bodily healed .
No physician could refuse to treat him .
" If such a person had PTSD stemming from the circumstances of the act , he could be a candidate [ for therapy ] , " Pitman says .
How much of our remorse do we have a right to dispense with , and how much exists in service to others , a check on our worst impulses ?
" Each experience we have changes our brain and in some sense alters who we are , " says Dr. Joseph E. LeDoux of NYU , who studies emotional memory .
" The more significant the experience , the more the alteration .
We have to decide as a society how far we want to go in changing the self .
Science will surely give us new and powerful ways of doing this .
Individuals may want more change than society wants to permit . "
Apollo Moon Conversations and
Pictures Show NASA Cover-up
You may have read my Apollo hoax article elsewhere on this web site , where I believe that the Apollo footage that has been released by NASA seems to be a hoax .
I have uncovered various pictures and transcripts of astronaut conversations from the Apollo missions that relate to encounters with UFOs , and perhaps this is one reason why NASA would release fake footage to the general public .
The following are excerpts of conversations from Apollo Astronauts on the Moon to Mission Control - which show that the Astronauts came across some strange and hard - to - explain structures and unusual sightings of unidentified craft - whilst on the surface of the Moon .
In the photo to the right , you can see an Apollo astronaut stepping down onto the Moon .
In the background , space , the final frontier .
Or is it a Hollywood backdrop , the ultimate deception ?
Many people feel we have not been told the complete truth regarding NASA 's space program , in particular the Apollo Missions of the late 60's and early 70's .
Recent research has shown that conditions on the Moon could be very different from the ' official - line ' which NASA would lead us to believe .
Dr Farouk El Baz , one of NASA 's foremost scientists , confirmed public suspicions when he stated ' not every discovery has been announced to the public ' .
Is this the understatement of the millennium ?
Why is it that relatively few people have been allowed total access to the massive NASA archives ( photographs which are supposedly in the public domain ) .
Instead we have to make do with the two or three dozen ' reproductions ' that appear in the ' official ' textbooks , despite literally millions of photographic images obtained by NASA .
Something is seriously amiss .
Also the original photographs are huge ( 32 " x24 " ) so by the time they have been reduced to fit the pages of a regular book the clarity and quality reduced by the copying process make most of the images pretty meaningless .
In many cases , researchers are left with little more than ' smudges ' and ' blurs ' .
Even so , despite all these obstacles , there is still hard evidence when these photographs are scrutinized under the proverbial - and literal - microscope , that points to the fact that virtually everything NASA has told us about the moon is a lie .
The REAL NASA MOON PHOTOS , for example show all kinds of structures , seemingly both old and new , such as domes , pipelines , and even pyramids .
So why are n't these photos in the public domain ?
You can see in several of NASA 's film footage , the American flag ' flapping in the wind ' and yet the Moon according to NASA has no atmosphere , because it is a vacuum !
One film clearly shows a desperate astronaut trying his level best to hold the flag still !
We are also told that the famous Neil Armstrong ' footprints ' will remain etched on the Moon 's surface forever .
We are told this precisely because the Moon 's ' atmosphere ' is a vacuum .
The laws of physics demand that dust becomes hardened and will compress in a ' vacuum ' therefore ensuring the ' footprints ' remain undisturbed .
And yet great plumes of dust can be seen spewing forth from underneath the ' Moon Buggy ' as it travels across the lunar surface .
Is this ' vacuum theory ' some kind of wild hoax by NASA ?
Another NASA cover -up are the small cloud formations that have been photographed above the Moon , again in a vacuum ?.
And while were on the subject of clouds what about the ONE HUNDRED MILE WIDE CLOUD OF VAPOR that was detected by NASA 's own instruments .
This embarrassing ' anomaly ' was promptly dismissed by NASA scientists as being the result of the considerable volume of urine ejected by the Apollo Mission astronauts !
What were they drinking ?!
For decades strange ' lights ' and artificial seeming structures have been observed and recorded on the Moon by amateur astronomers .
Science writer Joseph Goodavage observed that over two hundred white ' dome shaped ' structures had been seen and catalogued , only for them often to vanish and reappear somewhere else ?.
There are even colour photos from the Apollo 8 missions that clearly show evidence of green vegetation on the lunar hills .
These unusual findings , when added together with the anomalies which Richard Hoagland has shown to exist on Apollo Moon photographs , provide compelling evidence for an ongoing NASA cover - up of what the Apollo Astronauts really discovered on the Moon from 1969 to 1972 .
The following Apollo Astronaut conversations were mostly taken from the out - of - print book " Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon " by Don Wilson ( Dell , 1975 ) :
Apollo 16 Mission : April 16 - 27 , 1972
Charles Duke , Thomas Mattingly and John Young land in the Descartes highlands :
Duke :
These devices are unbelievable .
I 'm not taking a gnomon up there .
Young : O.K. , but man , that 's going to be a steep bridge to climb .
Duke :
You got - YOWEE !
Man -
John , I tell you this is some sight here .
Tony , the blocks in Buster are covered - the bottom is covered with blocks , five meters across .
Besides the blocks seem to be in a preferred orientation , northeast to southwest .
They go all the way up the wall on those two sides and on the other side you can only barely see the out - cropping at about 5 percent .
Ninety percent of the bottom is covered with blocks that are 50 centimeters and larger .
Capcom : Good show .
Sounds like a secondary ...
Duke : Right out here ... the blue one that I described from the lunar module window is colored because it is glass coated , but underneath the glass it is crystalline ... the same texture as the Genesis Rock ...
Dead on my mark .
Young : Mark .
It 's open .
Duke : I can't believe it !
Young :
And I put that beauty in dry !
Capcom : Dover .
Dover .
We 'll start EVA - 2 immediately .
Duke :
You 'd better send a couple more guys up here .
They 'll have to try ( garble ) .
Capcom : Sounds familiar .
Duke :
Boy , I tell you , these EMUs and PLSSs are really super - fantastic !
It is obvious that the astronauts are talking in code - meant to disguise what they are referring to .
The big question is why the excited cries ?
Can this be * merely * due to the collecting of Moon rocks , as they would have us believe ?
Or did they find something much more substantial , which was not meant for public knowledge ?
Apollo 16 : Describing Domes
and Tunnels on the Moon
Duke :
We felt it under our feet .
It 's a soft spot .
Firmer .
Where we stand , I tell you one thing .
If this place had air , it 'd sure be beautiful .
It 's beautiful with or without air .
The scenery up on top of Stone Mountain , you 'd have to be there to see this to believe it - those domes are incredible !
Mission Control : O.K. , could you take a look at that smokey area there and see what you can see on the face ?
Duke :
Beyond the domes , the structure goes almost into the ravine that I described and one goes to the top .
In the northeast wall of the ravine you can't see the delineation .
To the northeast there are tunnels , to the north they are dipping east to about 30 degrees .
Apollo 17
Eugene Cernan , Ronald Evans , and Harrison Schmidt ; Landed in the Taurus - Littrow Valley ; Dec 7 - 19 , 1972 .
Check out the following weird conversation that took place :
Mission Control : Go ahead , Ron
Evans : O.K. , Robert , I guess the big thing I want to report from the back side is that I took another look at the - the - cloverleaf in Aitken with the binocs .
And that southern dome ( garble ) to the east .
Mission Control :
We copy that , Ron .
Is there any difference in the color of the dome and the Mare Aitken there ?
Evans :
Yes there is ...
That Condor , Condorsey , or Condorecet or whatever you want to call it there .
Condorecet Hotel is the one that has got the diamond shaped fill down in the uh - floor .
Mission Control : Robert .
Understand .
Condorcet Hotel .
Evans : Condor .
Condorset .
Alpha .
They 've either caught a landslide on it or it's got a - and it does n't look like ( garble ) in the other side of the wall in the northwest side .
Mission Control : O.K. , we copy that Northwest wall of Condorcet A .
Evans :
The area is oval or elliptical in shape .
Of course , the ellipse is toward the top .
Again we have another example of code being used to disguise what has been found .
For example , " Condorset Hotel " .
Why the codes , if there are no secrets being discussed .
Why not explain to the American people openly what is going on ?
After all , they have paid for the mission .
Wilson says in his book ( p. 139 ) : " Although NASA has always held that the findings of lunar and space expeditions have never been held secret , it is interesting to note that Dr. Farouk El Baz , one of NASA 's foremost scientists , does admit ' not every discovery has been announced ' . "
Another strange Apollo 16
" ground - to - air " conversation
Capcom :
What about the albedo change in the subsurface soil ?
Of course you saw it first at Flagg and were probably more excited about it there .
Was there any difference in it there - and Buster and Alsep and LM ?
Duke : No. Around the Alsep it was just in spots .
At Plum it seemed to be everywhere .
My predominant impression was that the white albedo was ( garble ) than the fine cover on top .
Capcom : O.K.
Just a question for you , John .
When you got halfway , or even thought it was halfway , we understand you looped around south , is that right ?
Young :
That is affirm .
We came upon - Barbara .
Wilson writes ( p.140 ) : " Joseph H. Goodavage , whom included this conversation in a Saga magazine article , comments : " Barbara ?
That really needs some explanation , so I made an appointment with NASA geologist Farouk El Baz at National Aeronautics and Space Museum .
Here 's how part of our conversation went :
Saga :
What do you suppose
Young meant when he said they came upon " Barbara " ?
El Baz : I can't really say .
Code perhaps ...
Saga : But Barbara is an odd name for something on the Moon , is n't it ?
El Baz : Yes , an enigma .
As I suggested , perhaps a code , but I do n't really know . "
Apollo 17 conversation :
They find something startling , and are ordered to
immediately switch to code
DMP ( lunar module pilot ) :
What are you learning ?
Capcom : Hot spots on the Moon , Jack ?
DMP : Where are your big anomalies ?
Can you summarize them quickly ?
Capcom : Jack , we 'll get that for you on the next pass .
CMP ( command module pilot ) :
Hey , I can see a bright spot down there on the landing site where they might have blown off some of that halo stuff .
Capcom : Roger .
Interesting .
Very - go to KILO .
KILO .
CMP : Hey , it 's gray now and the number one extends .
Capcom : Roger .
We got it .
And we copy that it 's all on the way down there .
Go to KILO .
KILO on that .
CMP : Mode is going to HM .
Recorder is off .
Lose a little communication there , huh ?
Okay , there 's bravo .
Bravo , select OMNI .
Hey , you know you 'll never believe it .
I 'm right over the edge of Orientale .
I just looked down and saw the light flash again .
Capcom : Roger . Understand .
CMP : Right at the end of the rille .
Capcom :
Any chances of - ?
CMP : That 's on the east of Orientale .
Capcom :
You do n't suppose it could be Vostok ?
( a Russian probe ) .
Wilson writes ( p. 141 ) : " The Vostok flights took place in the early sixties and were * strictly Earth orbiters * .
They never reached the Moon ! "
Apollo 16 : Another strange conversation :
Wilson writes ( p. 141 ) : " While on the Moon , did any of our astronauts see any indication of alien handiwork , such as strange constructions , disturbances or the like ?
Consider this strange Apollo 16 conversation : "
Orion : Orion has landed .
I can't see how fat the ( garble ) ... this is a blocked field we 're in from the south ray - tremendous difference in the albedo .
I just get the feeling that these rocks may have come from somewhere else .
Everywhere we saw the ground , which is about the whole sunlit side , you had the same delineation the Apollo 15 photography showed on Hadley , Delta and Radley Mountains ...
Capcom : O.K .
Go ahead .
Orion : I 'm looking out here at Stone Mountain and it's got - it looks like somebody has been out there plowing across the side of it .
The beaches - the benches - look like one sort of terrace after another , right up the side .
They sort of follow the contour of it right around .
Capcom :
Any difference in the terraces ?
Orion : No , Tony .
Not that I could tell form here .
These terraces could be raised but of ( garble ) or something like that ...
Casper : ( Mattingly in lunar orbit overhead ) : Another strange sight over here .
It looks - a flashing light - I think it 's Annbell .
Another crater here looks as though it 's flooded except that this same material seems to run up on the outside .
You can see a definite patch of this stuff that 's run down inside .
And that material lays or has been structured on top of it , but it lays on top of things that are outside and higher .
It 's a very strange operation .
Wilson writes ( p.142 ) : " And we might add that this is a very strange conversation .
What are the real meanings of such terms used here as structure , blocked field , beaches , benches , terraces and the like ?
NASA claims that they are just metaphoric terms to describe unusual natural formations . "
Strange Apollo 17 conversation about " Watermarks " on the Moon :
Capcom : Roger , America , we 're tracking you on the map here , watching it .
LMP : O.K. Al Buruni has got variations on its floor .
Variations in the lights and its albedo .
It almost looks like a pattern as if the water were flowing up on a beach .
Not in great areas , but in small areas around the southern side , and the part that looks like the water - washing pattern is a much lighter albedo , although I can not see any real source of it .
The texture , however , looks the same .
Capcom : America , Houston .
We 'd like you to hold off switching to OMNI Charlie until we can cue you on that .
DMP : Wilco .
LMP : Was there any indication on the seismometers on the impact about the time I saw a bright flash on the surface ?
Capcom : Stand by .
We 'll check on that , Jack .
LMP : A UFO perhaps , do n't worry about it .
I thought somebody was looking at it .
It could have been one of the other flashes of light .
Capcom : Roger .
We copies the time and ...
LMP : I have the place marked .
Capcom : Pass it on to the back room .
LMP : O.K .
I 've marked it on the map , too .
Capcom : Jack , just some words from the back room for you .
There may have been an impact at the time you called , but the Moon is still ringing from the impact of the S - IVB impact .
So it would mask any other impact .
So they may be able to strip it out at another time , but right now they do n't see anything at the time you called .
LMP : Just my luck .
Just looking at the southern edge of Grimaldi , Bob , and - that Graben is pre-Mare .
Pre -Mare !
Capcom : O.K. , I copy on that , Jack .
And as long as we 're talking about Grimaldi we'd like to have you brief Ron exactly on the location of that flashing light you saw ...
We 'll probably ask him to take a picture of it .
Maybe during one of his solo periods .
Notice that the Capcom reiterates that it was a * flashing * light .
It was therefore * no * meteor impact that they were witnessing .
Notice also that the Lunar Command Pilot specifically mentions the word " UFO " .
Wilson writes ( p. 60 ) : " This last conversation makes it obvious that both our astronauts and NASA do not take these sightings of light or UFOs lightly .
Maps were marked and photographs were taken at the sites of these occurrences . "
While the Apollo 17 astronauts were discussing the " Watermarks " , the sighting of the UFO occurred .
The conversation then returns to the Watermarks .
DMP : O.K. 96:03 .
Now we 're getting some clear - looks like pretty clear high watermarks on this -
CMP : There 's high watermarks all over the place there .
LMP : On the north part of Tranquillitatis .
That 's Maraldi there , is n't it ?
Are you sure we 're 13 miles up ?
Capcom :
You 're 14 to be exact , Ron .
LMP : I tell you there 's some mare , ride or scarps that are very , very sinuous - just passing one .
They not only cross the low planar areas but go right up the side of a crater in one place and a hill in another .
It looks very much like a constructional ridge - a mare - like ridge that is clearly * as constructional as I would want to see it * . "
Apollo 15
David Scott , Alfred Worden , James Irwin ; went to the Appenine Mountains of the Moon , July 26 - Aug. 7 , 1971 .
Conversation about discovering strange " tracks " :
Scott : Arrowhead really runs east to west .
Mission Control : Roger , we copy .
Irwin : Tracks here as we go down slope .
MC : Just follow the tracks , huh ?
Irwin : Right we 're ( garble ) .
We know that 's a fairly good run .
We 're bearing 320 , hitting range for 413 ... I can't get over those lineations , that layering on Mt. Hadley .
Scott : I can't either .
That 's really spectacular .
Irwin :
They sure look beautiful .
Scott : Talk about organization !
Irwin :
That 's the most * organized structure I 've ever seen *!
Scott : It 's ( garble ) so uniform in width .
Irwin : Nothing we 've seen before this has shown such uniform thickness from the top of the tracks to the bottom .
Wilson writes : ( p. 145 ) : " What are these tracks ?
Who made them ?
Where did they come from ?
Does NASA have an answer for the people ? "
Another weird conversation about tracks
Made by Harrison Schmitt , a trained geologist and the only civilian ever to walk on the Moon ( all the rest were military men , or as Hoagland would say - " good soldiers " , who did what they were told ) .
Schmidtt : I see tracks - running right up the wall of the crater .
Mission Control ( Gene Cernan ) : Your photopath runs directly between Pierce and Pease .
Pierce Brava , go to Bravo , Whiskey , Whiskey , Romeo .
Wilson writes ( p. 145 ) : " If this is not code , what is it ?
And why switch to the use of strange meaningless " code " words if NASA was not trying to cover up something startling , something that needed to be hidden from the public ?
In fact , science writer Joseph Goodavage maintains that " whenever something was discovered , the astronauts and CAPCOM apparently switched to a prearranged code , sometimes even on an alternate publicly unmonitorable channel .
NASA scientist Farouk El Baz admitted in a magazine interview that NASA did commit itself to a secretive search for various things on the Moon .
' We 're looking for something - something ...'
He admitted that 'a huge bridge - like structure in Mare Crisium has been reported ...
That is all I can say about it . '
When asked if ' that was a bridge - that you 've actually found artificial structures or some kind of intelligently placed artifact ? '
El Baz quickly denied it .
' No . No . I am not admitting such a thing .
But when you start to think about it , almost anything is possible .
There are almost no limits [ to ] how you can interpret the many things astronomers have been observing and reporting for several centuries .
Now the astronauts are seeing many anomalies close up ' . "
Apollo 15 :
Astronaut sees white objects flying by
Capcom :
You talked about something mysterious ...
Orion : O.K. , Gordy , when we pitched around , I 'd like to tell you about something we saw around the LM ( LEM or Lunar Excursion Module ) .
When we were coming about 30 or 40 feet out , there were a lot of objects - white things - flying by .
It looked as if they were being propelled or ejected , but I 'm not convinced of that .
Capcom :
We copy that Charlie .
Wilson writes ( p. 54 ) : " What could these mysterious flying objects have been ? ...
Can this be considered another UFO sighting ?
What did the astronaut mean when he reported that these peculiar ' white things ' were * perhaps * ' being propelled or ejected ' ?
And by whom ? "
Apollo 11 :
" I say that there were other spaceships ! "
Apollo 11 , with Neil Armstrong , Michael Collins and Edwin Aldrin was the first Apollo flight to land on the Moon , on July 20 , 1969 .
While Collins flew in orbit around the Moon in the command module , Armstrong and Aldrin descended in the lunar module , landing in the Sea of Tranquillity at 4:17 P.M .
According to hitherto un-confirmed reports , both Neil Armstrong and Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin saw UFOs shortly after that historic landing on the Moon in Apollo 11 on 21 July 1969 .
I remember hearing one of the astronauts refer to a " light " in or on a crater during the television transmission , followed by a request from mission control for further information .
Nothing more was heard .
The following astonishing conversation was picked up by ham radio operators that had their own VHF receiving facilities that bypassed NASA 's broadcasting outlets .
At this time , the live television broadcast was interrupted for two minutes due to a supposed " overheated camera " , but the transmission below was received loud and clear by hundreds of ham radio operators :
According to Otto Binder , who was a member of the NASA space team , when the two moon - walkers , Aldrin and Armstrong were making their rounds some distance from the LEM , Armstrong clutched Aldrin 's arm excitedly and exclaimed :
Armstrong :
What was it ?
What the hell was it ?
That 's all I want to know ! "
Mission Control :
What 's there ?... malfunction ( garble ) ... Mission Control calling Apollo 11 ...
Apollo 11 : These babies were huge , sir !...
Enormous !...
Oh , God !
You would n't believe it !
... I 'm telling you there are other space - craft out there ... lined up on the far side of the crater edge ! ...
They 're on the Moon watching us !
Wilson writes ( p. 48 ) : " Binder ends his report with this observation : ' There has , understandably , been no confirmation of this incredible report by NASA or any authorities .
WE cannot vouch for its authenticity , but if true , one can surmise that mission control went into a dither and then into a huddle , after which they sternly [ ordered ] the moonwalkers to ' forget ' what they saw and carry on casually and calmly as if nothing had happened .
After all , an estimated 600 million people around the world were hanging on every word spoken by the first two men to leave footprints on the Moon . "
The book " Celestial Raise " by Richard Watson and ASSK [ P.O. Box 35 Mt. Shasta CA. 96067 ( 916)-926-2316 ) ; 1987 ; page 147- 148 ] records the following ( continuation ? ) of the above remarkable dialogue of Apollo 11 , which was picked up by hundreds of ham radio operators in the USA :
" During the transmission of the Moon landing of Armstrong and Aldrin , who journeyed to the Moon in an American spaceship , two minutes of silence occurred in which the image and sound were interrupted .
NASA insisted that this problem was the result of one of the television cameras which had overheated , thus interfering with the reception .
This unexpected problem surprised even the most qualified of viewers who were unable to explain how in such a costly project , one of the most essential elements could break down ...
Some time after the historic Moon landing , Christopher Craft , director of the base in Houston , made some surprising comments when he left NASA .
The contents of these comments , which is included in the conversations [ below ] , has been corroborated by hundreds of amateur radio operators who had connected their stations to the same frequency through which the astronauts transmitted .
During the two minute interruption - which was not as it seemed , NASA , Armstrong and Aldrin with Cape Kennedy , censored both image and sound .
' I say that there were other spaceships . '
Here is reproduced completely the dialogue between the American astronauts and Control Center :
Armstrong & Aldrin :
Those are giant things .
No , no , no - this is not an optical illusion .
No one is going to believe this !
Houston ( Christopher Craft ) : What ... what ... what ?
What the hell is happening ?
What 's wrong with you ?
Armstrong & Aldrin :
They 're here under the surface .
Houston :
What 's there ?
( muffled noise ) Emission interrupted ; interference control calling ' Apollo 11 ' .
Armstrong & Aldrin :
We saw some visitors .
They were here for a while , observing the instruments .
Houston : Repeat your last information !
Armstrong & Aldrin : I say that there were other spaceships .
They 're lined up in the other side of the crater !
Houston : Repeat , repeat !
Armstrong & Aldrin : Let us sound this orbita ... in 625 to 5 ... Automatic relay connected ...
My hands are shaking so badly I can't do anything .
Film it ?
God , if these damned cameras have picked up anything - what then ?
Houston :
Have you picked up anything ?
Armstrong & Aldrin : I did n't have any film at hand .
Three shots of the saucers or whatever they were that were ruining the film
Houston : Control , control here .
Are you on your way ?
What is the uproar with the UFOs over ?
Armstrong & Aldrin :
They 've landed here .
There they are and they 're watching us .
Houston :
The mirrors , the mirrors - have you set them up ?
Armstrong & Aldrin : Yes , they 're in the right place .
But whoever made those spaceships surely can come tomorrow and remove them .
Over and out .
A certain professor , who wished to remain anonymous , was engaged in a discussion with Neil Armstrong during a NASA symposium .
Professor : What REALLY happened out there with Apollo 11 ?
Armstrong :
It was incredible , of course we had always known there was a possibility - the fact is , we were warned off !
There was never any question then of a space station or a moon city .
Professor : How do you mean " warned off " ?
Armstrong : I can't go into details , except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology - Boy , were they big !... and menacing !
No , there is no question of a space station .
Professor : But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11 ?
Armstrong : Naturally - NASA was committed at that time , and could n't risk panic on Earth .
But it really was a quick scoop and back again .
According to a Dr. Vladimir Azhazha :
" Neil Armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that two large , mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the Moon module ( LEM ) .
But this message was never heard by the public - because NASA censored it . "
According to a Dr. Aleksandr Kasantsev , Buzz Aldrin took color movie film of the UFOs from inside the module , and continued filming them after he and Armstrong went outside .
Armstrong confirmed that the story was true but refused to go into further detail , beyond admitting that the CIA was behind the cover - up . "
Cosmonaut Shadowed By Structured UFO
In April of 1979 , Cosmonaut Victor Afanasyev lifted off from Star City to dock with the Soviet Solyut 6 space station .
But while en route , something strange happened .
Cosmonaut Afanasyev saw an unidentified object turn toward his craft and begin tailing it through space .
" It followed us during half of our orbit .
We observed it on the light side , and when we entered the shadow side , it disappeared completely .
It was an engineering structure , made from some type of metal , approximately 40 meters long with inner hulls .
The object was narrow here and wider here , and inside there were openings .
Some places had projections like small wings .
The object stayed very close to us .
We photographed it , and our photos showed it to be 23 to 28 meters away . "
In addition to photographing the UFO , Afanasyev continually reported back to Mission Control about the craft 's size , its shape and position .
When the cosmonaut returned to earth he was debriefed and told never to reveal what he knew , and had his cameras and film confiscated .
Those photos and his voice transmissions from space have never been released .
It is only now , with the collapse of the Soviet Union that Afanasyev feels that he can safely tell his story .
" It is still classified as a UFO because we have yet to identify the object . "
During the late 60's and early 70's , NASA 's Apollo Mission astronauts all experienced close encounters with ' unidentified space vehicles ' .
According to the first man on the Moon , Neil Armstrong , who took part in the Apollo 11 Mission , the reason why the US government changed their plans to build a ' Moon City ' was because they were told to change those plans by unknown extraterrestrial voyagers ...
' The fact is we were warned off ' Armstrong told a NASA symposium .
' There was never any question then of a space station or Moon City . '
According to a former NASA employee Otto Binder , unnamed radio hams with their own VHF receiving facilities that bypassed NASA 's broadcasting outlets picked up the following exchange :
' Buzz ' Aldrin who was also with Armstrong on the Apollo 11 mission , was said to have taken colour film footage of alien craft , Armstrong later confirmed that this footage had indeed been shot by Aldrin , only to be confiscated by the CIA on their return to Earth .
Fearing for his wellbeing , Armstrong refused to go in further details , except to confirm that the CIA were behind an extensive cover - up campaign regarding the US space program and consequent encounters with UFOs .
In 1979 , former chief of NASA Communications , Maurice Chatelain , confirmed that Armstrong and Aldrin had encountered UFOs on the Moon .
To this day Chatelain vehemently protests the truth of their accounts .
In December 1965 , Gemini astronauts James Lovell and Frank Borman also saw a UFO during their second orbit of their record - breaking 14 day flight .
Borman reported that he saw an unidentified spacecraft some distance from their capsule .
Gemini Control , at Cape Kennedy told him that he was seeing the final stage of their own Titan booster rocket .
Borman confirmed that he could see the booster rocket all right , but that he could also see something completely different .
During James Lovell 's flight on Gemini 7
Lovell : BOGEY AT 10 O'CLOCK HIGH .
Cad
Capcom : This is Houston .
Say again 7 .
Lovell : SAID WE HAVE A BOGEY AT
10 O'CLOCK HIGH .
Capcom : Gemini 7 , is that the booster or is that an actual sighting ?
Lovell : WE HAVE SEVERAL ... ACTUAL SIGHTINGS .
Capcom : ... Estimated distance or size ?
Lovell : WE ALSO HAVE THE BOOSTER IN SIGHT ...
' The encounter was common knowledge at NASA , ' chatelain said .
' All Apollo and Gemini Flights were followed by space vehicles of extraterrestrail origin - or UFOs , if you prefer to call them that .
Every time it occured , the astronauts informed Mission Control , who the ordered absolute silence ' .
He added ' I think Walter Schirra , aboard Mercury 8 , was the first astronaut to use the code name ' Santa Claus ' to indicate the presence of Ufos ' .
But it was James Lovell , on board the Apollo 8 Command Module , who came out from behind the Moon and said , for everybody to hear ' Please be informed that there is a Santa Claus ! '
Even though this happened on Christmas Day , 1968 , many people sensed a hidden meaning in those words . '
Chatelain also published an article in 1995 that confirmed that not only did the Apollo Moon Mission encounter UFOs , but that they also found ' several mysterious geometric structures of unnatural origin on the Moon ' .
Another former astronaut , Dr Brian O'Leary , who was speaking at a science conference in 1994 confirmed the cover -up .
' For nearly fifty years , the secrecy apparatus within the United States government has kept from the public UFO and alien information , we have contact with alien cultures ' .
He went on to say ' the suppression of UFO and other extraterrestrial intelligence information for at least forty - seven years , is probably being orchestrated by an elite band of men in the CIA , NSA , NSS , DIA and their like .
This small group appears able to keep these already hard - to - believe secrets very well ' .
Statements from various NASA sources , including Maurice Chatelain reveal that all astronauts are briefed and debriefed , before and after every mission , and are warned not to discuss their encounters in public .
Rumours of astronauts being ' threatened , ' going mad ' , or even ' losing their lives ' on their return to Earth , abound .
According to Sgt Major Robert Dean , who carried the highest security clearance there is while serving at SHAPE ( Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe )
in the 1960's , the US intelligence community is in possession of a top - secret dossier entitled The Assessment , detailing the history of extraterrestrial visitation , and an assessment of their purposes for visiting our planet .
For the past twenty years Sgt Major Dean had fought to make this information public knowledge .
Former Nasa photographic technician , Donna Tietze said in an interview with a radio station in 1995 ' The job of a co-worker in a restricted area was to airbrush out any anomalies found on the Moon photos ' .
The NASA Library is currently in possession of literally millions of photographs , plus an impressive catalogue of transmission tapes and videotapes documenting the presence of UFOs .
The Clementine Probe alone sent back 1.6 million photographic images in 1994 .
When President Dwight D. Eisenhower created NASA on October 1st , 1958 , it was to ' coordinate national space activities ' and to take ' full advantage of the military potential of space ' , and yet at the same time was to ' administer the civilian space program ' .
NASA Astronaut Cooper denies seeing UFO in orbit - But Tells of His Dealings With Secret UFO Film
Pioneering astronaut L. Gordon
Cooper denies being the first astronaut to see a UFO while in orbit , but stands by his reports of a strange encounter over Germany in the 1950s .
Cooper flatly denied the long - standing claim , repeated over the years by various authors including UFOlogical saints J. Allen Hynek and Jacques Vallee , that he saw a greenish object with a red tail move past his Mercury 9 spacecraft in 1963 .
" No , somebody made a lot of money selling lies on that one , " Cooper , the sixth American in space , told Art Bell on the syndicated " Coast to Coast " talk radio show recently .
" It was totally untrue , sorry to say . "
However , the retired air force colonel , who once lectured the United Nations on the reality of UFOs , still holds an " unshakable " belief in extraterrestrial intelligence , thanks largely to personal experience .
" On one occasion , I saw some strange vehicles that we assumed were UFOs , " he told Bell .
In the encounter , which took place over Germany in the early 1950s , Cooper saw " flights of fighters flying by in the same sort of formation we flew , moving east to west . "
The U.S. Air Force base scrambled its own pilots , including Cooper , who remembers the objects as looking " just like saucers -- they were metallic looking , but we could n't really get close enough to see more than that .
You could n't see any wings on them . "
At the time , Cooper entertained the possibility that the craft might be a new Soviet design , but " looking back now , " he suspects " it was some kind of extraterrestrial vehicle . "
He also stood by his belief that he saw a UFO land at Edwards Air Force Base in California in 1957 .
Although Cooper had been filming the base with a camera crew at the time , the film , which he handed over to a high - ranking officer from Washington , has never emerged .
Area 51 and the lost Gemini photographs
After another round of filming --- this time in orbit aboard Gemini 5 -- Cooper ran into trouble with the authorities when they confiscated film he took from space .
However , in contrast to UFO legend , this film did not contain photographic proof of an alien encounter .
Instead , he had ran afoul of the authorities for taking pictures of the " top secret " Nevada military base known familiarly as " Area 51 " .
" I found out fairly recently that one of the reasons it got confiscated was I had inadvertently overflown Area 51 , " while taking test photos , he said .
Cooper had no comment on the Great Face on Mars .
" That 's one of the reasons you need to send a manned mission to Mars , to study that stuff closer , " he told Bell , gently criticizing today 's NASA and recent presidential administrations for lacking the " bravery " to buildon previous generations ' space advances .
UPDATE
In recently published memoirs " Leap of Faith : An Astronaut 's Journey into the Unknown " , by USAF Colonel L. Gordon Cooper ( Ret. ) recounts how he chased UFOs over Germany in his F - 86 .
Following this experience , Cooper was very open minded about UFOs .
He writes , " I knew an Air Force master sergeant assigned to a team that received an emergency call - out from Washington D.C. , to the Pacific southwest ( not Roswell . )
He told me they reached a canyon and found a wreckage at the site .
According to his friend -- and I had been around him
enough to consider him a reliable guy -- a metallic disk - shaped object had crashed , and sitting atop the wreckage were two very human - looking fellows in flight suits , waving at them .
They were hustled away , and the sergeant never found out who they were or what happened to them . "
As a captain stationed at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif. , on May 3 , 1957 , he became aware that a metallic , saucer - shaped craft had landed ( silently ) sometime after 8:00 a.m. on base property .
He alleges that the event was filmed by a startled technical film crew on assignment 50 yards away , the craft zooming out of sight when the photographers tried to approach it for a
better camera shot .
Cooper writes that , upon learning of the incident , he telephoned appropriate Pentagon officials , who ordered him to have all the film developed ( but not printed ) and to ship it immediately to the Pentagon .
He adds that , before complying , he chose to peek at some of the negatives , which confirmed the existence of the " saucer " as described to him by the film crew .
Cooper notes that he heard nothing more about the film or the results of any investigation .
After reading the above information , I must ask you this ...
If NASA was formed as a ' civilian space agency ' , why were so many NASA programs funded by the US Defence Department ?
Why were all astronauts subjected to US military security regulations ?
Why were all video and photographic evidence screened by the National Security Agency ?
Why were all the radio communications screened by the National Security Agency ?
After spending millions of taxpayers ' dollars planning a ' Moon City ' , why has the Moon not been visited by NASA since 1973 ?
Why are some of NASA 's top photographic technicians employed to ' airbrush out ' anomalies caught on film ?
Why are astronauts and other NASA employees threatened with long jail sentences if they ' speak out ' about what was really discovered out there in space ?
Do you realise that no information , either photographic or otherwise , reaches the public domain until it has been thoroughly scrutinised and sanitized by the US intelligence community , and has been in effect since the space program began ?.
Did you know that the main debates before the ' official ' moon landings were regarding mining and mineral rights ?
Bearing in mind that the rich resources of titanium , aluminium , uranium , helium 3 , and god knows what else , were found on the Moon .
Do you really think that the US would have then told the rest of the world to come on up and take a share ?
Buzz Aldrin has said in his book , ' Men From Earth ' ' Another exciting energy resource on the moon is ... an ample supply of the isotope Helium - 3 ( HE - 3 ) , which is very rare on Earth but has been deposited on the lunar surface over billions of years by the solar wind .
It is estimated that at least a million tons of He - 3 are readily recoverable from the regolith formations where lunar solar power stations would be practical .
This He - 3 offers a key to safe , practical nuclear fusion energy on Earth .
It is estimated that a single ton of He - 3 delivered to Earth would be worth at least $ 1 Billion . '
Another issue is that one astronaut is seen to land ' heavily ' after leaving the lunar module ?
How come when the Moon gravity is one sixth of the Earth 's own gravitational pull ?
Even bearing in mind their heavy spacesuits which NASA claim weigh 185 - 190 lbs , plus the astronauts weight , the total weight relative to Earth should have been 62 pounds or about four and a half stone .
Again Buzz Aldrin says in his book that he weighed only 60 pounds , if this is the case they should have been able to jump at least six feet , but as official film footage shows , the astronauts struggle to jump over eighteen inches !
According to the laws of physics , this simply does n't add up .
Did you know ...
Official NASA footage clearly shows an Apollo module taking off from the lunar surface , evidently minus any conventional propulsion system ?
What you see is a series of ' bolts ' clamping the module to the Moon 's surface explode and the module simply floats up into space .
Is this evidence of an antigravity propulsion in use by 1969 ?
Or simply a computer - simulated take - off from Hollywood Studios ?

These two images taken by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars ( CRISM ) show Mars ' two small moons , Phobos and Deimos , as seen from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter 's low orbit around Mars .
Both images were taken while the spacecraft was over Mars ' night side , with the spacecraft turned off its normal nadir - viewing geometry to glimpse the moons .
The image of Phobos , shown at the top , was taken at 0119 UTC on October 23 ( 9:19 p.m. EDT on Oct. 22 ) , and shows features as small as 400 meters ( 1,320 feet ) across .
The image of Deimos , shown at the bottom , was taken at 2016 UTC ( 12:16 p.m. EDT ) on June 7 , 2007 , and shows features as small as 1.3 kilometers ( 0.8 miles ) across .
Both CRISM images were taken in 544 colors covering 0.36-3.92 micrometers , and are displayed at twice the size in the original data for viewing purposes .
Phobos and Deimos are about 21 and 12 kilometers ( 13.0 and 7.5 miles ) in diameter and orbit Mars with periods of 7 hours , 39.2 minutes and 1 day , 6 hours , 17.9 minutes respectively .
Because Phobos orbits
Mars in a shorter time than Mars ' 24 hour , 37.4 - minute rotational period , to an observer on Mars ' surface it would appear to rise in the west and set in the east .
From Mars ' surface , Phobos appears about one - third the diameter of the Moon from Earth , whereas Deimos appears as a bright star .
The moons were discovered in 1877 by the astronomer Asaph Hall , and as satellites of a planet named for the Roman god of war , they were named for Greek mythological figures that personify fear and terror .
The first spacecraft measurements of Phobos and Deimos , from the Mariner 9 and Viking Orbiter spacecraft , showed that both moons have dark surfaces reflecting only 5 to 7 % of the sunlight that falls on them .
The first reconstruction of the moons ' spectrum of reflected sunlight was a difficult compilation from three different instruments , and appeared to show a flat , grayish spectrum resembling carbonaceous chondrite meteorites .
Carbonaceous chondrites are primitive carbon - containing materials thought to originate in the outer part of the asteroid belt .
This led to a commonly held view among planetary scientists that Mars ' moons are primitive asteroids captured into Martian orbit early in the planet 's history .
More recent measurements have shown that the moons are in fact relatively red in their color , and resemble even more primitive D - type asteroids in the outer solar system .
Those ultra-primitive bodies are also thought to contain carbon as well as water ice , but to have experienced even less geochemical processing than many carbonaceous chondrites .
The version of the CRISM images shown here were constructed by displaying 0.90 , 0.70 , and 0.50 micrometer wavelengths in the red , green , and blue image planes .
This is a broader range of colors than is visible to the human eye , but it accentuates color differences .
Both moons are shown with colors scaled in the same way .
Deimos is red-colored like most of Phobos .
However , Phobos ' surface contains a second material , grayer - colored ejecta from a 9 - kilometer ( 5.6 - mile ) diameter crater .
This crater , called Stickney , is located at the upper left limb of Phobos and the grayer - colored ejecta extends toward the lower right .
These CRISM measurements are the first spectral measurements to resolve the disk of Deimos , and the first of this part of Phobos to cover the full wavelength range needed to assess the presence of iron - , water - , and carbon - containing minerals .
The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars ( CRISM ) is one of six science instruments on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
Led by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory , the CRISM team includes expertise from universities , government agencies and small businesses in the United States and abroad .
CRISM 's mission :
Find the spectral fingerprints of aqueous and hydrothermal deposits and map the geology , composition and stratigraphy of surface features .
The instrument will also watch the seasonal variations in Martian dust and ice aerosols , and water content in surface materials -- leading to new understanding of the climate .

File photo shows France 's President Nicolas Sarkozy waiting in the doorway of the Elysee Palace in Paris , October 26 , 2007 .
REUTERS / John Schults
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy showed flashes of temper and abruptly terminated a television interview aimed at introducing him to U.S. audiences .
In the interview with CBS ’ “ 60 Minutes ” broadcast on Sunday , the French president sparred with the U.S. correspondent , called his press secretary an imbecile , said he was too busy to make time for a “ stupid ” interview and ended the whole conversation abruptly when asked about the state of his marriage to Cecilia .
The Sarkozys ’ divorce was announced about two weeks later .
“ If I had something to say about Cecilia , I would not do so here , ” he said before cutting off further questions .
In two interviews , a brief one aboard an airplane and a more formal one several weeks ago , he expressed his admiration for both the U.S. work ethic and its pop music .
Asked about his father ’s fears years ago that anyone with a Hungarian last name like Sarkozy could not succeed in France , he said one thing he admires about the U.S. democracy is its openness and opportunities to all kinds of people .
“ You can be called Schwarzenegger and be governor of California , ” he said .
Psychologists have analyzed hundreds of written threats to members of congress .
Their conclusion : people who send angry emails show far fewer signs of serious mental illness than their envelope - licking counterparts .
At the University of Nebraska - Lincoln , Katherine Schoeneman - Morris and her colleagues read 300 letters and 99 emails that were provided by the United States Capitol Police .
They published a summary of their findings in the September issue of the Journal of Forensic Sciences .
Some of their other observations were less than surprising :
Emailers were significantly more likely than letter writers to focus on government concerns , use obscene language , and display disorganization in their writing .

I was watching a mailing - list discussion of backup software , and how often you should back up , and based on some decades ’ experience , found some of the thinking sloppy .
Here are my life lessons on keeping your data safe while assuming that The Worst Will Happen .
Some of it is Macintosh - specific , but there may be useful take - aways even from those parts , even for non-Mac - hacks .
Catastrophe ·
It ’s been said that the eventual failure rate for hard - disk drives is 100 % .
This is a little misleading ; I have n’t had an actual disk crash on any of my computers in at least a decade .
But it can happen and it does happen and you should think about it .
And crashes are n’t the only way to lose data .
The single greatest threat to my data is me .
During the course of day , I touch lots of data , and each touch is a chance to screw up , and sometimes I do screw up , and sometimes data is lost .
I suspect this may be true of you , too .
I can remember , back when I was a sysadmin , seeing the occasional newsgroup post , the kind of thing that makes you feel sick to read : “ One of our users is suicidal because he had three years ’ worth of data for his Ph.D. dissertation on an un-backed - up drive and it ’s gone south .
Can anyone think of anything ? ”
Usually , no - one could , and it did n’t matter whether the problem was hardware failure or user error .
If I catastrophically lost everything that ’s on my laptop , it would blast a major hole in the integrity of my life .
I ’d rather not even think about it .
How I Do
It · I back up once a month or so , occasionally missing a month , and I use “ tar ” , a decades - old Unix command line utility .
But I sleep easy at night .
I ’m quite confident that my data is really very safe ; it ’s been years since I lost anything I cared about .
The Rules ·
If you follow these , you almost certainly wo n’t lose data in any damaging way .
Do n’t use proprietary file formats .
Do n’t erase anything .
Store everything twice .
Do occasional ad - hoc and regular full backups .
Note that these are not rules for professionally - managed data centers , who have incredibly complicated backup requirements and often live in a regulated environment .
If you ’re a pro , the only way to be safe is to hire an expert and throw some real money at the problem .
This advice is aimed at the users of personal computers , whose needs are simpler and less variable .
No Proprietary Formats ·
This is actually a two - part rule .
First , do n’t store the actual live data you care about in proprietary file formats .
Second , do n’t use them for your backups either .
The live - data part is easy to understand .
Do n’t store your Last Will and Testament in a .doc file , or your priceless collection of Delta Blues recordings in Apple - only or Windows - only formats , or your wedding photos as a Corel Paint Shop Pro .psp .
It ’s easy to be safe .
For important documents , keep PDF or HTML versions around .
For pictures , use JPG or PNG , and for audio use MP3 for compressed data and WAV or equivalent for high - quality stuff .
And yes , this is another reason why things like the Open Document Format are very , very important ; increasingly so every year as our personal lives become embodied in bits .
The proprietary - backup - format issue is a little subtler ; let me try to bring it alive :
Horror Story · Back sometime in the Nineties , I bought a new computer and for some reason that I now forget , was running Windows NT 4 on it .
Since I ’m serious about data protection , I bought it with a little cartridge tape drive , DAT format I think , and saved everything once a week or so , using the procedure in the Windows user guide .
Sure enough , a few months in , I accidentally nuked something important .
Feeling smug , I slapped in the most recent tape and invoked the magic data - restore procedure .
The computer silently ground away on the tape - drive for about twenty minutes and then said “ Invalid save - set ; exiting . ”
I spent some unsatisfactory time with Microsoft phone support , who asked a lot of questions and then said ( more or less ) “ Invalid save - set ; exiting . ” I have rarely been angrier .
I managed to dig up a Unix box with the right drive that would actually let me read the raw data , but that did n’t help ; it was ungodly mashed - up broken - as - designed spaghetti data with binary numbers splashed all over it ; the real miracle is that it could ever have worked for anyone .
So when I hear the Macintosh experts talking about all those commercial backup utilities with their cute names , I tend to think they ’re mostly nuts .
Among other things , suppose I want to restore the data on a computer that ’s not a Macintosh ?
It ’s my data , after all .
So :
Do not , whatever you do , feed your valuable data to a program that is going to save it in a file format that can only be read by that program , or by that kind of computer .
Because when the program ca n’t or the computer can ’t , you ’re out of options .
Do n’t Erase Anything · I ’ve noticed that this basic idea is really hard for people to warm up to , but trust me , it ’s a good one .
Here are a couple of war stories .
Back in 1991 or so , my then - employer Open Text sold a search - and - display system to Ringier , a Swiss newspaper / magazine publisher .
At the time of the deal , they were generating about one megabyte of data per day ; so a year ’s worth was a substantial chunk of data given the disk sizes back then .
We were having one of our planning meetings and their IT manager said “ And now we have to design the schedule for deleting the old data . ”
I had an epiphany right there in the room and said “ Why would you ever do that ? ”
He looked at me like I was crazy , but we walked through the economics ; the cost of keeping a year ’s data was , in the big picture , negligable .
Skip forward 14 years :
Last summer , when I got Mom her new computer , and we were transferring everything over to it , she said “ Now I ’ll have to go through everything and decide what to throw out . ”
All of a sudden there were echoes from that smokey room in Zürich in 1991 : “ Why would you want to do that ? ”
Here ’s the deal : every time you erase something , you might be making a mistake .
This is the most common way data gets lost .
So , do n’t do that .
If things are getting in your way , make a folder called “ Dusty old files ” or whatever , and put them in there .
Then forget about them .
One day you ’ll want something from four years ago and you ’ll be happy .
Even if you do n’t , you ’re much less likely to accidentally lose those wonderful baby - shower pictures .
The cost of disk space these days is just so ridiculously low that most people never manage to fill up their laptops .
So why on earth would you invest your precious time in a dangerous activity ( deleting things ) in order to conserve a resource that ’s essentially free ?
Store Everything Twice · Hard disks fail , but not very often .
Optical disks ( CD / DVD - ROMs ) fail too , but also not very often .
If you have your data on two disks , not plugged into the same computer , both of them would have to fail at the same time to lose your data , which happens not - very - often - squared ; you ’re more likely to get hit by a falling safe or win millions in the lottery .
Let me make this very personal .
On my laptop , the data that I really care about is : email , pictures , music , blog entries , source code , and conference presentations .
My email is on my laptop but also on a server somewhere in the bowels of Sun .
Pictures ( which I keep as JPGs in ordinary folders , one folder per month ) get copied over to the family fileserver , a big little - used Windows box in the basement , every few days .
Music is all copied off of disks I own , except for the rarities I snagged from Napster back in the day , which I have a copy of on the fileserver .
My blog entries are all here , and also up on tbray.org as of the instant they ’re published .
Program code gets synced up regularly with some source - code repository or another ; and the one thing that will motivate me to do frequent backups is when I ’m coding but unable , for a few days , to check the code in .
That leaves conference speeches , and I only write one or two of those a month , and they ’re not all new material ; I might lose one or two in a between - backups crash .
But when I finish writing one and head off for the conference , I always dump the presentation onto one of those little USB disks and carry it along in my pocket ; which has saved me more than once .
Keeping multiple copies is the single most powerful tool I know of to protect your data .
Do Ad - Hoc Backups · Suppose you ’ve just finished some project : editing the pictures from a trip , or writing a conference presentation , or crunching some numbers .
While you ’re still feeling that warm glow of achievement , slap a CD - ROM or DVD - ROM in the computer and save it .
Then get one of those Sharpie markers and write right there on the disk what ’s on it .
Then put the disk on a shelf somewhere and chances are you ’ll never touch it again .
It wo n’t take long , and you ’ll sleep better , and it might just save your butt .
Do Full Backups ·
There ’s a very old , very bad idea that comes to us from computing ’s dim dark past , and it ’s called “ The incremental backup ” .
Time was , you had 500 - meg disks , but you backed up on tape ( remember those spinning tape reels that computers used to have in old movies ? ) which were only 110 meg if I recall correctly .
So you had this elaborate software that you ran every day that would go through the disk and just save onto the tape the stuff that had changed that day .
Then , once a week or so , you ’d back up the whole disk onto a box - full of tapes .
In those days , computer departments had to have lots of space for big racks full of tape reels that held your backups .
Imagine how complicated and elaborate it was figuring out how to restore just the right version from an incremental - backup set .
It was worse than you imagined , a frequent source of error and further data destruction .
If you ’re already storing everything twice , as I advised above , it ’s still a good idea to do a massive backup of everything now and again , if only for convenience .
If you ’re updating anything daily and you care about it , you should bloody well find a way to store it twice ( see examples above ) , and there ’s usually a better way than an incremental backup .
So I recommend , when you do a backup , you include everything you own , without exception ; do n’t try to be smart .
This minimizes the possibility that you ’ve left out something that you ’re not smart enough to think of now .
There ’s another recommendation that falls out of this : try to keep everything you care about under one folder , so it ’s easy to back up .
Mac OS
X makes this really easy , by default storing everything you create somewhere under your home folder .
There is lots of Windows software that still squirrels important stuff away in a place that ’s not your home directory ; just another penalty for using a second - rate operating system .
How I Back Up · I ’ve already described ad - hoc backups ; I do lots of those .
Which brings us to regular full backups , and , I ’m afraid , a kind of unsatisfactory ending to this essay .
I had started writing a detailed blow - by - blow narrative of exactly how I do this , but started to get this nightmare scenario in my head where some non-Unix - geek tries to apply it and puts in back - quotes for quotes or something like that and silently destroys her data .
I will reproduce the two exact command lines I used on my most recent backup and restore , with commentary for Unix geeks , but DON ’T EVEN THINK OF TRYING TO USE THIS unless you really know what you ’re doing , because YOU WILL PROBABLY LOSE YOUR PRECIOUS DATA .
I ’ll also appeal to the LazyWeb : if anyone cares to recommend tools or utilities that achieve the desired effect and are safe for use by real non-geek people , let me know and I ’ll point to them here .
Having said that , here are two specific piece of advice :
Do Video Separately · Video files are so bloody huge that there ’s no point trying to pretend they ’re like ordinary data .
When I finish a piece of video I save it onto a DVD all of its own , and leave it out of my regular backups .
I keep video in a separate folder , not my home folder , so that this will work .
Buy An External Disk Drive ·
You can get these in any computer store , they ’re called “ FireWire ” or “ USB 2 ” drives .
They ’re real easy to use , you just plug ’em in and there they are .
They come as small as 40G or so , the cost - per - byte goes down as they get bigger , so you might as well buy a big one .
In my case , I ’m using a 250G disk and my whole life , compressed , is about 26G , so this one will last most but not all of a year before it ’s full .
Then I ’ll go buy another .
I already have two sitting at the back of a shelf somewhere .
The costs are acceptable .
Most people ’s requirements will be much less extreme .

Some notes :
The New York Times reports that Freedom 's Watch is working with the American Enterprise Institute to lobby for war with Iran .
" ' If Hitler 's warnings were heeded when he wrote Mein Kampf he could have been stopped , ' said Bradley Blakeman , 49 , the president of Freedom 's Watch and a former deputy assistant to Mr. Bush .
...
The idea for Freedom 's Watch was hatched in March at the winter meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Manalapan , Fla. , where Vice President Dick Cheney was the keynote speaker .
...
One benefactor , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said the group was hoping to raise as much as $ 200 million by November 2008 .
Raising big money ' will be easy , ' the benefactor said , adding that several of the founders each wrote a check for $ 1 million .
...
Since the group is organized as a tax - exempt organization , it does not have to reveal its donors .
...
Among the group 's founders are Sheldon G. Adelson ... sixth on the Forbes Magazine list of the world 's billionaires ; Mel Sembler ... who served as the ambassador to Italy and Australia ; John M. Templeton Jr. , the conservative philanthropist from Bryn Mawr , Pa. ; and Anthony H. Gioia , a former ambassador to Malta .
... Mr. Sembler , who is on the board of directors of the American Enterprise Institute , said the impetus for Freedom 's Watch ' came out of A.E.I. ' last winter . "
The Republican YouTube debate has n't even begun , and it 's already obsolete .
Why ?
Because all of the questions that we 'll hear tonight were submitted by YouTube users before the Politico broke today 's blockbuster news that Rudy Giuliani expensed his adulterous trysts in the Hamptons to NYC taxpayers , then tried to cover it up .
And consequently , CNN is left with a curious irony -- the debate stage in St. Petersburg is going to be the only place in America where folks talking about politics wo n't be discussing the biggest news in politics .
Because after today , the Republican race wo n't look the same .
Beginning tonight , Rudy is more likely than not done as a serious candidate .
Barring a remarkable explanation from the Giuliani campaign or a superlatively craven trad med press meltdown , Rudy 's campaign is likely to be destroyed by this story .
Two things capture the American attention like no other : sex and money .
Only scandals involving sex or money garner any serious public interest .
Even then , a money scandal without sex leads most Americans to yawn .
And dogged persistence can outlast most sex scandals ( see Vitter , David ) .
But when you combine the two -- when you add adultery to misappropriation of taxpayer money -- magical things happen .
It 's like that beautiful chemical reaction when heat , yeast , and sugar meet .
There 's an unusual smell , then lots of hot air , and then everything blows up real big .
People can't turn their eyes away from the unholy marriage of lust and lucre .
And no amount of 9/11ing can distract the attention of a wild - eyed press from the shame .
We 're already seeing the beginning of the end .
Rudy 's friends are deserting him faster than he deserted Bernie Kerik ( interestingly enough , another guy who expensed his adultery to hardworking New Yorkers ) .
The story is topping Drudge .
Fox News -- the network accused by rival GOP campaigns of being in the bag for Rudy -- has independently " confirmed " the news , and made it their top story on their web page .
Christ , when Drudge and Roger Ailes have bailed on you , who 's left ?
That 's the question Rudy is likely to be asking as the story gets bigger and bigger .
And the answers wo n't be pretty , because the rats are going to flee this sinking ship .
And finally , in a week or two , Rudy is going to have to decide whether he wants to pull out before Iowa , and save what little dignity he has remaining , or risk polling below Ron Paul in every primary .
But tonight , at least , for two hours in St. Petersburg , Rudy can pretend that he 's still a frontrunner for the Republican nomination .
No one will be asking him about his greatest fear .
He 'll get to talk about 9/11 and taxes and Iraq and all that stuff he loves so much .
And maybe , for just a moment , he 'll even be able to forget about the awful fate that awaits him in the spin room .
But make no mistake -- no matter how polished and presidential he looks on that stage tonight , Rudy Giuliani 's days as a serious contender are almost certainly over .
He 's a dead man debating .
It seems like quite a while ago , but earlier this year , Rudy Giuliani actually intended to be a force in the Iowa caucuses .
He campaigned frequently in the state , held a lot of town - hall meetings , and through around June , actually lead in Iowa polls .
Then , of course , Republicans got a good look at the guy , heard what he had to say , learned about Giuliani ’s background , and dropped him like a hot potato .
His campaign pulled out of the Ames straw poll , and Giuliani ’s support in the state has been in free - fall ever since .
Which leads , of course , to New Hampshire , where Giuliani expected to be a serious player .
Like Iowa , the former mayor spent quite a bit of time in the Granite State , and in the early fall , was a close second in the polls .
Then , a funny thing happened .
( via Kos )
Rudolph Giuliani ’s decision to largely abandon the early voting state of New Hampshire and concentrate his efforts on the Florida primary three weeks later reflects an uncomfortable truth for the former New York mayor :
The more he campaigned in the Granite State and the more he spent on advertising there , the more his poll numbers dropped .
It ’s striking to see the trend - lines .
In just Iowa , New Hampshire , South Carolina , and nationally , Giuliani ’s support , steady most of the year , dropped sharply a couple of months ago , and shows no signs of recovering .
Giuliani just does n’t wear well over time .
“ The physics community is mostly divided into two groups , ” Johannes Kofler tells PhysOrg.com .
“ One group believes that quantum theory is underlying the classical world , and that classical physics comes from the quantum .
The other group thinks that quantum physics has to be altered .
It forbids that quantum mechanics works on a macro level in the classical world by postulating additional laws . ”
Kofler belongs to the former group .
He and Časlav Brukner , both from the University of Vienna and from the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information ( IQOQI ) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences , have developed a novel theoretical approach to understanding the transition from quantum to classical physics .
Their work has been published in Physical Review Letters with the title , “ Classical World Arising out of Quantum Physics under the Restriction of Coarse - Grained Measurements . ”
“ Our motivation is to understand how the classical world comes out of quantum physics , ” Kofler says .
“ The established approach in research is decoherence where one has to take into account the complexity of systems and interactions with environment . ”
It is interaction with the environment that brings decoherence into play , destroying quantum coherences and making it impossible to observe quantum phenomena .
“ We believe we found a process complementary to decoherence which can explain the quantum - to - classical transition . ”
Instead of referring to the environment of a system , or even to the change quantum laws , Kofler and Brukner created a theoretical framework that stresses the use of measurement apparatuses .
It is their restricted accuracy which limits the observability of quantum phenomena .
“ We took a rotating spin as a model system , ” Kofler expounds via email .
“ There is a condition which all classical theories have to obey , called the Leggett - Garg inequality , but which can be violated by quantum mechanics . ”
Kofler and Brukner demonstrated that the time evolution of a quantum system , no matter how macroscopic the system is , cannot be treated in a classical sense .
“ Just because something is big does n’t mean it can be described by classical physics . ”
Then referring back to the case of spin , he continues : “ Arbitrarily large spins can still have a quantum time evolution and violate the Leggett - Garg inequality . ”
Next , the two realized that coarse - grained measurements are used in realistic conditions , such as situations that we are confronted with every day , as the resolution of the apparatuses usually is limited .
“ If you are bound to restrict yourself to coarse - grained measurements of the spin , ” Kofler explains , “ you get the classical Newtonian laws of motion . ”
“ Start with a spin system of macroscopic size and the Schrödinger equation that produces the quantum time evolution .
Restrict the precision of your measurements and you can see the Newtonian physics emerging . ”
Kofler explains that measurements in quantum mechanics generally change the system .
“ But under our coarse measurements this change is such that a classical description is possible . ”
Kofler admits that so far this work is not fully finished .
“ It ’s really fair to say that classical physics out of quantum theory has not been entirely achieved yet by anybody , ” he says .
But he and Brukner remain optimistic that at some point we will be able to get a complete understanding of how our well - behaved classical world emerges from the strangeness of quantum physics .

The first Guantanamo Bay detainee to be convicted by an American military tribunal will be released from prison on Saturday — but six years of harsh treatment in US custody leave him ill - prepared to readjust to normal life , a psychologist says .
Australian - born David Hicks , who was captured in Afghanistan in 2001 , plead guilty earlier this year to charges of providing material support for al- Qaeda terrorists .
As part of his plea deal , Hicks was transferred to Australia to serve out the remainder of his sentence .
Appearing in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Monash University psychology professor James Ogloff said that Guantanamo had left a broken Hicks to fend for himself in the free world .
“ In some very restrictive regimes , and GuantÃ¡namo Bay will fall into that category , the environments are actually designed to break people down , ” said Ogloff .
“ There ’s no long term goal of rehabilitating people or having them return to the community .
So the issues that the individual faces is , in fact , being broken into pieces and having to really be put back together . ”

CROSSING
Cairo's busy main roads gives new meaning to the term " walk like an Egyptian " .
It is less a belly dance than a dance with death .
People take no notice of traffic lights .
Getting from our hotel overlooking the Nile to Cairo's Talaat Harb Square involved taking our lives into our hands .
We followed advice to attach ourselves to a local , some of whom hold their hands up like policemen to stop the cars , which surprisingly obey .
No sign of road rage here .
The first time I tried it I gave up and hailed a taxi .
The one Cairo driver who did not speak English stopped passing pedestrians , one of whom spoke French but not English , to ask them to translate .
He dropped us about a kilometre away after a hilarious ride in which we pretended to use seatbelts as police drove past .
The driver blew me a kiss as we leapt out , about 12 lanes of traffic closer to our destination than before we hailed him .
At least he did not propose to me – possibly because of the language barrier .
But he charged about $ 10 for the trip , about three times the usual price .
So we began our walking tour .
As we turned one corner , a man rushed up behind us .
" If you turn left at the next corner you 'll be in the right area .
Where are you from ? " he said in a friendly manner .
" Oh Australia .
Come into my house , please .
My wife is from Perth .
Please accept some Egyptian hospitality .
What would you like to drink ? "
We were then ushered into a room upstairs where we were shown a range of home - made oils ( from flowers from his father 's farm in the country ) and small decorative bottles .
And $ 40 later we left with our parcels .
I hope the rose oil really is good for insomnia .
Egypt and scams have become synonymous .
Visitors need to be wary .
The Egyptian Government and tourism authorities take this seriously and there are large fines and sometimes jail sentences for offenders .
But that did not stop a tourism policeman at a temple on the Nile asking for " baksheesh " – a tip – after he took a photo of my son and me .
Baksheesh , which in Arabic can mean alms , also calls for a wary approach .
On our Nile cruise we were told to put a tip in an envelope and leave it with reception at trip 's end .
Of course , that did not stop the housekeeper , who folded our towels to make wonderful animals , from expecting another handout .
At an alabaster factory on the West Bank , young , handsome staff pressed alabaster good luck scarab beetles into our hands and we paid outrageous prices for pottery " exactly " like that found in Tutankhamen 's tomb .
Amani Talaat Kamel , our guide in Cairo , said tips should be given only to people who serve you .
" It is bad for Egypt 's reputation , but some people make their living out of it , " she said .
" In the 1970s and ' 80s , some even made fortunes out of it .
Some guests encourage them , so they will keep doing it . "
She said scammers usually asked tourists if they had a guide before they quote inflated prices for souvenirs .
" We tell shopkeepers that if they leave the guests alone , they will probably spend more , " Kamel said .
Watch shopkeepers and money - changers carefully .
Count your changed money before you leave and use reputable changers – there are banks in the bigger hotels .
Before a short horse and carriage ride through the medieval town of Esna on the Nile , our driver asked for five Egyptian pounds ( about $ 1 ) .
But at the end we were told : " No , five Euros . "
It is best to use a guide to negotiate the payment for camel riding at the pyramids , where drivers are known to charge exorbitant prices .
But genuine tipping usually brings polite gratitude .
One tourist went horse riding through the pyramids and was so happy with his experience he gave the horseman a large tip .
The horseman asked him not to tell his boss , then gave some money back , admitting he had not taken the tourist to one of the places promised .

Darfur ?
It s the Oil , Stupid
China and USA in New Cold War over Africas oil riches
By F William Engdahl , May 20 , 2007
To paraphrase the famous quip during the 1992 US Presidential debates , when an unknown William Jefferson Clinton told then - President George Herbert Walker Bush ,  It s the economy , stupid ,  the present concern of the current Washington Administration over Darfur in southern Sudan is not , if we were to look closely , genuine concern over genocide against the peoples in that poorest of poor part of a forsaken section of Africa .
No .
 It s the oil , stupid . 
Hereby hangs a tale of cynical dimension appropriate to a Washington Administration that has shown no regard for its own genocide in Iraq , when its control over major oil reserves is involved .
What s at stake in the battle for Darfur ?
Control over oil , lots and lots of oil .
The case of Darfur , a forbidding piece of sun-parched real estate in the southern part of Sudan , illustrates the new Cold War over oil , where the dramatic rise in Chinas oil demand to fuel its booming growth has led Beijing to embark on an aggressive policy of  ironically  dollar diplomacy .
With its more than $ 1.3 trillion in mainly US dollar reserves at the People`s Bank of China , Beijing is engaging in active petroleum geopolitics .
Africa is a major focus , and in Africa , the central region between Sudan and Chad is priority .
This is defining a major new front in what , since the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 , is a new Cold War between Washington and Beijing over control of major oil sources .
So far Beijing has played its cards a bit more cleverly than Washington .
Darfur is a major battleground in this high - stakes contest for oil control .
China Oil diplomacy
In recent months , Beijing has embarked on a series of initiatives designed to secure long - term raw materials sources from one of the planets most endowed regions  the African subcontinent .
No raw material has higher priority in Beijing at present than the securing of long term oil sources .
Today China draws an estimated 30 % of its crude oil from Africa .
That explains an extraordinary series of diplomatic initiatives which have left Washington furious .
China is using no-strings - attached dollar credits to gain access to Africas vast raw material wealth , leaving Washingtons typical control game via the World Bank and IMF out in the cold .
Who needs the painful medicine of the IMF when China gives easy terms and builds roads and schools to boot ?
In November last year Beijing hosted an extraordinary summit of 40 African heads of state .
They literally rolled out the red carpet for the heads of among others Algeria , Nigeria , Mali , Angola , Central African Republic , Zambia , South Africa .
China has just done an oil deal , linking the Peoples Republic of China with the continent 's two largest nations - Nigeria and South Africa .
China 's CNOC will lift the oil in Nigeria , via a consortium that also includes South African Petroleum Co. giving China access to what could be 175,000 barrels a day by 2008 .
It s a $ 2.27 billion deal that gives state - controlled CNOC a 45 % stake in a large off - shore Nigeria oil field .
Previously , Nigeria had been considered in Washington to be an asset of the Anglo - American oil majors , ExxonMobil , Shell and Chevron .
China has been generous in dispensing its soft loans , with no interest or outright grants to some of the poorest debtor states of Africa .
The loans have gone to infrastructure including highways , hospitals , and schools , a stark contrast to the brutal austerity demands of the IMF and World Bank .
In 2006 China committed more than $ 8 billion to Nigeria , Angola and Mozambique , versus $ 2.3 billion to all sub-Saharan Africa from the World Bank .
Ghana is negotiating a $ 1.2 billion Chinese electrification loan .
Unlike the World Bank , a de facto arm of US foreign economic policy , China shrewdly attaches no strings to its loans .
This oil - related Chinese diplomacy has led to the bizarre accusation from Washington that Beijing is trying to secure oil at the sources ,  something Washington foreign policy has itself been preoccupied with for at least a Century .
No source of oil has been more the focus of China - US oil conflict of late than Sudan , home of Darfur .
Sudan oil riches
Beijings China National Petroleum Company , CNPC , is Sudans largest foreign investor , with some $ 5 billion in oil field development .
Since 1999 China has invested at least $ 15 billion in Sudan .
It owns 50 % of an oil refinery near Khartoum with the Sudan government .
The oil fields ( see graphic ) are concentrated in the south , site of a long - simmering civil war , partly financed covertly by the United States , to break the south from the Islamic Khartoum - centered north .
CNPC built an oil pipeline from its concession blocs 1 , 2 and 4 in southern Sudan , to a new terminal at Port Sudan on the Red Sea where oil is loaded on tankers for China .
Eight percent of Chinas oil now comes from southern Sudan .
China takes up to 65 % to 80 % of Sudans 500,000 barrels / day of oil production .
Sudan last year was Chinas fourth largest foreign oil source .
In 2006 China passed Japan to become the worlds second largest importer of oil after the United States , importing 6.5 million barrels a day of the black gold .
With its oil demand growing by an estimated 30 % a year , China will pass the US in oil import demand in a few years .
That reality is the motor driving Beijing foreign policy in Africa .
Source : USAID
A look at the southern Sudan oil concessions shows that Chinas CNPC holds rights to bloc 6 which straddles Darfur , near the border to Chad and the Central African Republic .
In April 2005 Sudans government announced it had found oil in South Darfur whoich is estimated to be able when developed to pump 500,000 barrels / day .
The world press forgot to report that vital fact in discussing the Darfur conflict .
Using the genocide charge to militarize Sudans oil region
Genocide was the preferred theme , and Washington was the orchestra conductor .
Curiously , while all observers acknowledge that Darfur has seen a large human displacement and human misery and tens of thousands or even as much as 300,000 deaths in the last several years , only Washington and the NGOs close to it use the charged term genocide to describe Darfur .
If they are able to get a popular acceptance of the charge genocide , it opens the possibility for drastic regime change intervention by NATO and de facto by Washington into Sudans sovereign affairs .
The genocide theme is being used , with full - scale Hollywood backing from the likes of pop stars like George Clooney , to orchestrate the case for a de facto NATO occupation of the region .
So far the Sudan government has vehemently refused , not surprisingly .
The US Government repeatedly uses genocide to refer to Darfur .
It is the only government to do so .
US Assistant Secretary of State Ellen Sauerbrey , head of the Bureau of Population , Refugees and Migration , said during a USINFO online interview last November 17 , " The ongoing genocide in Darfur , Sudan  a ' gross violation ' of human rights  is among the top international issues of concern to the United States . "
The Bush administration keeps insisting that genocide has been going on in Darfur since 2003 , despite the fact that a five - man panel UN mission led by Italian Judge Antonio Cassese reported in 2004 that genocide had not been committed in Darfur , rather that grave human rights abuses were committed .
They called for war crime trials .
Merchants of death
The United States , acting through surrogate allies in Chad and neighboring states has trained and armed the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army , headed until his death in July 2005 , by John Garang , trained at US Special Forces school at Fort Benning , Georgia .
By pouring arms into first southern Sudan in the eastern part and since discovery of oil in Darfur , to that region as well , Washington fuelled the conflict that led to tens of thousands dying and several million driven to flee their homes .
Eritrea hosts and supports the SPLA , the umbrella NDA opposition group , and the Eastern Front and Darfur rebels .
There are two rebel groups fighting in Sudan 's Darfur region against the Khartoum central government of President Omar al - Bashir  the Justice for Equality Movement ( JEM ) and the larger Sudan Liberation Army ( SLA ) .
In February 2003 the SLA launched attacks on Sudan government positions in the Darfur region .
SLA Secretary - General Minni Arkou Minnawi called for armed struggle , accusing the government of ignoring Darfur .
" The objective of the SLA is to create a united democratic Sudan . 
In other words , regime change in Sudan .
The US Senate adopted a resolution in February 2006 that requested North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops in Darfur , as well as a stronger U.N. peacekeeping force with a robust mandate .
A month later , President Bush also called for additional NATO forces in Darfur .
Uh huh ... Genocide ?
Or oil ?
The Pentagon has been busy training African military officers in the US , much as it has for Latin American officers for decades .
Its International Military Education and Training ( IMET ) program has provided training to military officers from Chad , Ethiopia , Eritrea , Cameroon and the Central African Republic , in effect every country on Sudans border .
Much of the arms that have fuelled the killing in Darfur and the south have been brought in via murky , protected private merchants of death such as the notorious former KGB operative , now with offices in the US , Victor Bout .
Bout has been cited repeatedly in recent years for selling weapons across Africa .
US Government officials strangely leave his operations in Texas and Florida untouched despite the fact he is on the Interpol wanted list for money laundering .
US development aid for all Sub - Sahara Africa including Chad , has been cut sharply in recent years while its military aid has risen .
Oil and the scramble for strategic raw materials is the clear reason .
The region of southern Sudan from the Upper Nile to the borders of Chad is rich in oil .
Washington knew that long before the Sudanese government .
Chevrons 1974 oil project
US oil majors have known about Sudans oil wealth since the early 1970s .
In 1979 , Jafaar Nimeiry , Sudan head of state , broke with the Soviets and invited Chevron to develop oil in the Sudan .
That was perhaps a fatal mistake .
UN Ambassador George H.W. Bush had personally told Nimeiry of satellite photos indicating oil in Sudan .
Nimeiry took the bait .
Wars over oil have been the consequence ever since .
Chevron found big oil reserves in southern Sudan .
It spent $ 1.2 billion finding and testing them .
That oil triggered what is called Sudans second civil war in 1983 .
Chevron was target of repeated attacks and killings and suspended the project in 1984 .
In 1992 , it sold it 's Sudanese oil concessions .
Then China began to develop the abandoned Chevron fields in 1999 with notable results .
But Chevron is not far from Darfur today .
Chad oil and pipeline politics
Condi Rices Chevron is in neighboring Chad , together with the other US oil giant , ExxonMobil .
Theyve just built a $ 3.7 billion oil pipeline carrying 160,000 barrels / day of oil from Doba in central Chad near Darfur Sudan , via Cameroon to Kribi on the Atlantic Ocean , destined for US refineries .
To do it , they worked with Chad  President for life ,  Idriss Deby , a corrupt despot who has been accused of feeding US - supplied arms to the Darfur rebels .
Deby joined Washingtons Pan Sahel Initiative run by the Pentagons US - European Command , to train his troops to fight  Islamic terrorism . 
The majority of the tribes in Darfur region are Islamic .
Supplied with US military aid , training and weapons , in 2004 Deby launched the initial strike that set off the conflict in Darfur , using members of his elite Presidential Guard who originate from the province , providing the men with all terrain vehicles , arms and anti-aircraft guns to Darfur rebels fighting the Khartoum government in the southwest Sudan .
The US military support to Deby in fact had been the trigger for the Darfur bloodbath .
Khartoum reacted and the ensuing debacle was unleashed in full tragic force .
Washington - backed NGOs and the US Government claim unproven genocide as a pretext to ultimately bring UN / NATO troops into the oilfields of Darfur and south Sudan .
Oil , not human misery , is behind Washingtons new interest in Darfur .
The  Darfur genocide campaign began in 2003 , the same time the Chad - Cameroon pipeline oil began to flow .
The US now had a base in Chad to go after Darfur oil and , potentially , co-opt Chinas new oil sources .
Darfur is strategic , straddling Chad , Central African Republic , Egypt and Libya .
US military objectives in Darfur  and the Horn of Africa more widely  are being served at present by the US and NATO backing of the African Union troops in Darfur .
There NATO provides ground and air support for AU troops who are categorized as neutral and peacekeepers . 
Sudan is at war on three fronts , each country  Uganda , Chad , and Ethiopia  with a significant US military presence and ongoing US military programs .
The war in Sudan involves both US covert operations and US trained rebel factions coming in from South Sudan , Chad , Ethiopia and Uganda .
Chads Deby looks to China too
The completion of the US and World Bank - financed oil pipeline from Chad to the Cameroon coast was designed as one part of a far grander Washington scheme to control the oil riches of central Africa from Sudan to the entire Gulf of Guinea .
But Washingtons erstwhile pal , Chads President for Life , Idriss Deby , began to get unhappy with his small share of the US - controlled oil profits .
When he and the Chad Parliament decided in early 2006 to take more of the oil revenues to finance military operations and beef up its army , new World Bank President , Iraq war architect , Paul Wolfowitz , moved to suspend loans to the country .
Then that August , after Deby had won re-election , he created Chads own oil company , SHT , and threatened to expel Chevron and Malaysias Petronas for not paying taxes owed , and demanding a 60 % share of the Chad oil prieline .
In the end he came to terms with the oil companies , but winds of change were blowing .
Deby also faces growing internal opposition from a Chad rebel group , United Front for Change , known under its French name as FUC , which he claims is being covertly funded by Sudan .
This region is a very complex part of the world of war .
The FUC has based itself in Darfur .
Into this unstable situation , Beijing has shown up in Chad with a full coffer of aid money in hand .
In late January , Chinese President Hu Jintao made a state visit to Sudan and to Cameroon among other African states .
In 2006 Chinas leaders visited no less than 48 African states .
In August 2006 Beijing hosted Chads Foreign Minister for talks and resumption of formal diplomatic ties cut in 1997 .
China has begun to import oil from Chad as well as Sudan .
Not that much oil , but if Beijing has its way , that will soon change .
This April , Chads Foreign Minister announced that talks with China over greater China participation in Chads oil development were progressing well .
He referred to the terms the Chinese seek for oil development , calling them , much more equal partnerships than those we are used to having . 
The Chinese economic presence in Chad , ironically , may be more effective in calming the fighting and displacement in Darfur than any African Union or UN troop presence ever could .
That would not be welcome for some people in Washington and at Chevron headquarters , as they would not find the oil falling into their greasy bloody hands .
Chad and Darfur are but part of the vast China effort to secure oil at the source across Africa .
Oil is also the prime factor in US Africa policy today .
George W. Bushs interest in Africa includes a new US base in Sao Tome / Principe 124 miles off the Gulf of Guinea from which it can control Gulf of Guinea oilfields from Angola in the south to Congo , Gabon , Equitorial Guinea , Cameroon and Nigeria .
That just happens to be the very same areas where recent Chinese diplomatic and investment activity has focussed .
 West Africas oil has become of national strategic interest to us ,  stated US Assistant Secretary of State for Africa , Walter Kansteiner already back in 2002 .
Darfur and Chad are but an extension of the US Iraq policy with other means  control of oil everywhere .
China is challenging that control everywhere ,  especially in Africa .
It amounts to a new undeclared Cold War over oil .
PRINT VERSION
The result was an even deeper schism .
Kerry was arguably the worst candidate on earth to put to rest the post -1960s culture war — and his decision to embrace his Vietnam identity at the convention made things worse .
Bush , for his part , was unable to do nuance .
And so the campaign became a matter of symbolism — pitting those who took the terror threat “ seriously ” against those who did n’t .
Supporters of the Iraq
War became more invested in asserting the morality of their cause than in examining the effectiveness of their tactics .
Opponents of the war found themselves dispirited .
Some were left to hope privately for American failure ; others lashed out , as distrust turned to paranoia .
It was and is a toxic cycle , in which the interests of the United States are supplanted by domestic agendas born of pride and ruthlessness on the one hand and bitterness and alienation on the other .
This is the critical context for the election of 2008 .
It is an election that holds the potential not merely to intensify this cycle of division but to bequeath it to a new generation , one marked by a new war that need not be — that should not be —seen as another Vietnam .
A Giuliani-Clinton matchup , favored by the media elite , is a classic intragenerational struggle — with two deeply divisive and ruthless personalities ready to go to the brink .
Giuliani represents that Nixonian disgust with anyone asking questions about , let alone actively protesting , a war .
Clinton will always be , in the minds of so many , the young woman who gave the commencement address at Wellesley , who sat in on the Nixon implosion and who once disdained baking cookies .
For some , her husband will always be the draft dodger who smoked pot and would n’t admit it .
And however hard she tries , there is nothing Hillary Clinton can do about it .
She and Giuliani are conscripts in their generation ’s war .
To their respective sides , they are war heroes .
In normal times , such division is not fatal , and can even be healthy .
It ’s great copy for journalists .
But we are not talking about routine rancor .
And we are not talking about normal times .
We are talking about a world in which Islamist terror , combined with increasingly available destructive technology , has already murdered thousands of Americans , and tens of thousands of Muslims , and could pose an existential danger to the West .
The terrible failures of the Iraq occupation , the resurgence of al - Qaeda in Pakistan , the progress of Iran toward nuclear capability , and the collapse of America ’s prestige and moral reputation , especially among those millions of Muslims too young to have known any American president but Bush , heighten the stakes dramatically .
Perhaps the underlying risk is best illustrated by our asking what the popular response would be to another 9/11 – style attack .
It is hard to imagine a reprise of the sudden unity and solidarity in the days after 9/11 , or an outpouring of support from allies and neighbors .
It is far easier to imagine an even more bitter fight over who was responsible ( apart from the perpetrators ) and a profound suspicion of a government forced to impose more restrictions on travel , communications , and civil liberties .
The current president would be unable to command the trust , let alone the support , of half the country in such a time .
He could even be blamed for provoking any attack that came .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney is attacking Mike Huckabee on his record of illegal immigration in a new TV ad , a move the latter labeled as " desperate . "
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is upping the attacks on Mike Huckabee 's immigration record .
Romney , who has lost his front - runner status in polls to Huckabee in Iowa , plans to air the ad on the issue he views as one of his rival 's biggest vulnerabilities .
Iowa stations will begin broadcasting the spot , which attacks Huckabee by name , on Tuesday .
The Romney ad , titled " The Record , " compares the candidates ' conservative stands on social issues but draws a sharp contrast on their track records on immigration policy : " Mitt Romney stood up and vetoed in - state tuition for illegal aliens ... opposed driver 's licenses for illegals , " the ad's announcer says .
" Mike Huckabee ?
Supported in - state tuition benefits for illegal immigrants .
Huckabee even supported taxpayer - funded scholarships for illegal aliens .
Watch the Romney ad »
" On immigration , the choice matters , " the announcer says .
Romney spokesman Kevin Madden said the ad was intended to highlight the difference between the ex-Massachusetts governor 's " pro-enforcement record " and Huckabee 's stance on immigration in the past .
During an event Tuesday in Council Bluffs , Iowa , Huckabee called the ad " desperate " and said he thought it would backfire .
" I 'm somewhat flattered in that I seem to be the recipient of the first negative attack ad in the Republican primary , " Huckabee said .
" That 's usually the kind of desperation on the part of an opponent who feels that his only way of winning is to attack and destroy . "
He added , " They see how much money they 've spent , and we 're winning .
That causes people to do some sometimes desperate things . "
Huckabee defended his decision to allow children of illegal immigrants to pay in - state tuition while he was Arkansas governor .
" I was dealing with the failure of the federal government at a state level , just like a lot of citizens have dealt with it individually , and my feeling was , and I still believe this , that you do n't punish a child for the crimes a parent commits , " Huckabee said .
" And that 's my position ; it has n't changed . "
Huckabee is not allowing the portrayal of him as soft on illegal immigration to go unchallenged .
He has received the endorsement of Jim Gilchrest of the Minuteman Project , a group that has called for tighter border security and a crackdown on illegal immigration .
" For months I 've been searching for ... an actual plan , " Gilchrest said .
" And I found the Secure America plan put together by Mike Huckabee to fit right in with what I feel would help at least begin to solve this problem . "
Romney has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration during the campaign , saying he would strengthen border security and implement a system that would allow employers to verify whether a person can work legally in the U.S .
During last month 's CNN / YouTube debate , Romney also criticized Rudy Giuliani for allowing New York to become a " sanctuary city " for illegal immigrants while he was mayor , an allegation the rival candidate has denied .
But Romney 's credibility on the issue came under question when The Boston Globe reported last week that a landscaping company Romney employed to take care of his Boston home continued to use illegal workers after the newspaper had reported a similar incident almost a year ago .
Romney fired the landscaping company last week , saying in a statement that " the company 's failure to comply with the law is disappointing and inexcusable . "
A senior Romney aide said that Romney 's son Tagg had been personally assured by the company 's owner , a family friend , that the firm would n't use illegal workers after the first report .
During the CNN / YouTube debate , Giuliani attacked Romney for living in a " sanctuary mansion , " where illegal immigrants were allowed to work .

All About Mitt Romney • Mike Huckabee • Immigration
For centuries , sages have alluded to a richness in life ’s later years that is lost on the young .
But only in the last decade have researchers begun to measure happiness across the life span and , in doing so , try to understand why older people tend to be so content .
The explanation does n’t appear to be biological -- some chemical in the brain that mellows us just when all those plump neurons needed for thinking and memory are shriveling up .
Rather , most scientists now think that experience and the mere passage of time gradually motivate people to approach life differently .
The blazing - to - freezing range of emotions experienced by the young blends into something more lukewarm by later life , numerous studies show .
Older people are less likely to be caught up in their emotions and more likely to focus on the positive , ignoring the negative .
“ When you have that disaster at 10 in the morning , you can deal with it better when you ’re older , ” says Stacey Wood , a neuropsychologist and associate professor at Scripps College in Claremont .
“ With people in their 20s , it throws them off .
They experience more emotion , and it ’s more intense emotion . ”
In a study published in September in Psychological Science , Wood and her collaborator , neuroscientist Michael Kisley of the University of Colorado , recorded the brain activity of 63 adults , ranging in age , who were shown a series of negative and positive images , such as dead animals or a bowl of ice cream .
Older adults were about 30 % less reactive to the negative images compared with the younger adults .

Other studies have found similar results -- that older people experience negative emotion less often and recover from it more quickly .
The insult that has your blood boiling for three days at age 20 may not even register a spike in blood pressure at age 60 .
And despite -- or perhaps because of -- the fact that anyone with gray hair has likely experienced his or her fair share of suffering , older folks are also adept at transcending bad memories .
“ What we see is a real difference in how negative information is processed by the brain , ” Wood says .
“ When we talk about maturity or wisdom , we ’re talking about that ability to integrate negative emotion or cognitive information ; being able to weigh it and not find it so disruptive . ”
Why people regulate their emotions better as they age may be due in part to school - of - hard - knocks experience .
Eventually they learn the world will not end when the car breaks down or the child gets strep throat .
The later stages of life also offer more opportunities to actively avoid those parts that are stressful or upsetting , Wood says .
“ You can surround yourself with less negative people and events , ” she says .
“ At a certain point , you ’re established in your career .
You do n’t have to put up with that annoying boss any more .
You can structure your life the way you want to . ”

Influence of time
One of the first researchers to discover that older people tend to be happier thinks there ’s another reason for this greater emotional control .
It ’s linked to a person ’s sense of time .
Older people are aware that life does n’t last forever -- and , with a finite amount of time ahead , they think it should be well spent .
In a study at Stanford University ’s Center on Longevity , psychologist Laura Carstensen showed that people who perceived their future time as limited had goals that were emotionally meaningful .
People who perceived their futures as open - ended had goals that tended to be knowledge - related .
Carstensen concluded that , as people age , they encounter “ shrinking time horizons . ”
With less time left , people tend to focus on the now .
The 2002 study was published in the journal Psychology and Aging .
“ As people come to appreciate the fragility of life , they tend to put more value on it , ” she says .
Younger people may anticipate that the older years will be bleak because the body fails and the mind is aware that time is running out .
But older people typically are n’t depressed by that .

“ The paradox of aging is that there is this decline in physical well - being and cognitive status and yet an increase in psychological well - being , ” Carstensen says .
“ We [ colleagues in her laboratory ] do n’t think of that as a paradox , of course , because it ’s the decline that reminds people that life will not go on forever . ”
With an eye on the clock , older people are more selective about their activities and relationships , Wood says .
The happiest find ways to feel useful , giving them a sense of purpose and making their time feel meaningful .
The happiest tend to say they enjoy serving others in some capacity .
“ I think of old age as the richest form of emotional satisfaction that is possible , ” Carstensen says .
“ There are still positive emotions , but there is also an understanding and appreciation that there is an ending around the corner . ”
An appreciation of remaining time leads older people to be more grateful for what they have , Carstensen and other researchers say .
And being thankful is great for mental health .
Studies by Robert A. Emmons , a psychology professor at UC Davis , show that people who focus on what they are grateful for have better emotional well - being , especially a positive mood , compared with people who focus on the negative or neutral information .

“ When you focus on gratefulness , you see that other people are providing you with support and value you , ” says Emmons , author of the book “ Thanks !
How the New Science of Gratitude Can Make You Happier . ”
“ You see that good stuff does n’t just happen randomly .
It helps you make sense out of life .
Grateful people see their lives as gifts . ”
Being able to forgive is the flip side , he adds .
“ It helps reduce negative emotions like anger and resentment . ”
That ’s why neurotics , who get stuck on life ’s hurts , may be among the few personality types that do n’t mellow with age , Carstensen says .
Neurotics are people who “ keep going back to the same negative relationships and the same negative thoughts .
They do n’t change , ” she says .
In fact , individual temperament is still the best predictor of happiness overall , Wood says .
A child who is always smiling will likely be joyful decades later .
The grumpy 30 - year - old will likely be a grumpy , if slightly less so , 70 - year - old .

A pleasant surprise
Why does the idea of being most happy in old age come as a shock to young and old alike ?
Psychological science has a reason for that too .
We humans are terrible at predicting what will make us happy .
Younger people tend to think that happiness is getting what you want : a fabulous body , great job , true love , a nice place to live and a good ride .
No one should dismiss the hopeful dreams of the young , but it ’s just not that simple , Wood says .
“ We try to make decisions that make us happy , but we ’re not good at doing that , ” she says .
Well - known research shows that a sudden increase in wealth does n’t correlate to long - term gains in happiness , and people who become paralyzed due to accidents return from despair to their previous levels of happiness .
Parents assume they will be bereft when the kids leave home , but happiness and marital satisfaction typically improve .

Aging too falls into that puzzling category in which reality often defies expectations .
“ Why is it that when we think of age , we think about all the bad things that will happen ? ” says Dr. Peter Ubel , director of the Center for Behavioral and Decision Sciences in Medicine at the University of Michigan , who has studied happiness among ill and older people .
“ That is one of the reasons we do n’t anticipate happiness in aging very well . ”
Until recently , psychological study focused almost solely on life ’s negatives : bad behavior , troubled relationships , depression and stress .
Today , researchers are also studying so - called positive psychology -- those factors that help people thrive mentally and emotionally .
The study of elder happiness has been a fruitful foray in positive psychology , experts say , showing that older people are happier if they stay socially connected , pursue new experiences and do things that make them feel useful .

Young can benefit too
Such research offers lessons for younger people as well .
Teaching adolescents and young adults about the joys of volunteer work and community service may pry them from the self - centeredness that contemporary society reinforces , Emmons says .
“ We live in a culture where people expect certain entitlements ; ‘ I ’m owed these things , ’ or ‘ I deserve these things , ’ ” Emmons says .
“ It goes against the spirit of having a sense of purpose and being useful . ”
Similarly , teaching a child to count his or her blessings might place that child on an elevated happiness trajectory that persists throughout life , he suggests .
The rare younger people who experience the rich happiness common to their elders may be those who have recovered from life - threatening illness or addiction , Carstensen says .
She cites research that shows people often feel differently about their lives after surviving a serious illness .
They have come face - to - face with the “ shrinking time horizon ” that older people routinely live with .

“ As people come to appreciate the fragility of life , they tend to put more value on it , ” she says .
“ There is something about recognizing our own mortality . ”
Combining the mental shrewdness of youth with the ability to savor life might be a successful recipe for contented living -- whatever one ’s age .
“ If only younger people could step out of themselves and focus on the positive and realize life is fragile and life is valuable , ” Carstensen says .
“ And if older people could think about the future and worry a little bit more , that ’s probably good . ”
For example , elderly people may be too trusting .
They are the most likely to be victims of financial scams , and they may make bad healthcare or financial decisions because they fail to think critically through the pros and cons of a situation .

Freedom to grow old
Elders will probably always have the last laugh , Carstensen says .
Young people typically do n’t have the freedom to be as choosy about their activities and relationships .
They have to show deference to the professor , please the boss , network with business acquaintances , discipline the toddler and beg the banker for a mortgage .
“ That is what goes on in youth , ” she says .
“ Younger people have to prepare for a long , nebulous future .
That is anxiety - producing .
I ’m not sure it would be adaptive for young people to say , ‘ I ’m not going to worry about the future , ’ because you do have to worry about the future . ’ ”
As people age , they are gradually relieved of the burden of planning for the future , she notes .
In the words of the psychologically astute British poet Robert Browning : “ Grow old along with me !
The best is yet to be , The last of life , for which the first was made . ”

Thom Hartmann from Air America discusses
The impeachment resolution 799 with Congressman Kucinich .
The bill was presented Nov 6 2007 .
A purified extract prepared from a common microbe and delivered to the lungs of laboratory mice in a spray set off a healthy immune response and provided powerful protection against all four major classes of pathogens including those responsible for anthrax and bubonic plague , according to a presentation at the American Society for Cell Biology ’s 47th Annual Meeting .
In addition , when the researchers exposed another group of mice to an aerosol of live Streptococcus pneumoniae , the only animals that survived were the ones that had been pre-treated with the spray .
A total of 83 percent of these mice survived .
None of the untreated animals lived .
The researchers at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston developed the spray from a purified extract of the common coccobacillus named Haemophilus influenzae , the cause of ear and sinus infections in human children .
Their “ aerosolized lung innate immune stimulant , ” as the scientists have named the spray treatment , could benefit immune - compromised patients with cancer , HIV or other diseases as well as emergency workers and the general public facing uncommon threats like an aerosolized bioterror attack or a spreading respiratory epidemic .
According to Brenton Scott who with his postdoctoral advisor , Burton Dickey , developed the spray , the treatment works best if administered four to 24 hours before exposure .
Nearly all mice survived when treated before exposure to lethal doses of anthrax , influenza , and the dangerous mold , Aspergillus .
But , the treatment also has some benefit when given after exposure .
Effectiveness declines over time but seems to last up to five days after a single dose .
The researchers report that protection by stimulant is associated with rapid pathogen killing in the airways , does not depend on recruitment of other immune defense cells such as neutrophils , and correlates with increased levels of antimicrobial polypeptides in the lung lining fluid .
The host response is localized to the airways , and safety studies indicate that the treatment causes minimal side effects , even with repeated doses .
Preclinical testing is being completed , and clinical trials are being designed .
In tests on mice , the stimulant was protective against all four major classes of pathogens ( Gram - positive and Gram - negative bacteria , fungi , and viruses ) , including the Class A bioterror agents Bacillus anthracis ( anthrax ) , F. tularensis ( tularemia ) and Yersinia pestis ( bubonic plague ) .

We have been waiting for bread for nearly two hours in a rubbish - strewn lane behind a supermarket .
It is midmorning , the sun already blazing down on the 50 or so people in line , when three policemen stroll to the front .
A low rumble of discontent rolls along the line , like thunder .
Then a stranger named David Kaodza materializes behind me , out of nowhere .
“ I was right behind you , remember ?
You saw me before . ”
He has a ready smile and the ingratiating patter of someone jumping the queue .
In Zimbabwe , where hyperinflation has reached 7,900 % and people have used up their entire savings just buying food , life has been reduced to this : the queue .
Go to any Zimbabwean town these days and you ’ll find lines everywhere , like an invasion of giant pythons slithering into every supermarket door .
Kaodza , a hustler in a country where the flour has all but run out and bread has become a luxury , gives a quick tutorial on how to get ahead in a queue .
You do n’t just line up and wait to buy .
There is an unspoken etiquette , with subtle rules .
Only those in a police or army uniform get to ignore the queue entirely .
For people such as Kaodza , queuing is no mere dull necessity ; it ’s become a business .
They are master queue tacticians , managing to be in line in three or four places .
They reserve themselves a place at the top of the queue , scamper to the end and reserve themselves a place there by making a deal with the last person to let them back into line later .
They wait for the queue to build up a little more and scurry to grab another place at the end .
According to local etiquette , you can leave the line , but never for long .
To rejoin , you need the recognition of the person you made an agreement with .
But if you neglect to pay the guard in charge of the queue , you still wo n’t be able to creep back to your place , Kaodza says .
“ It ’s every man for himself .
Sometimes you say you were in the queue and you just came back and someone says , ‘ I did n’t see you . ’
And you ’re just canceled from the queue . ”
Kaodza always carries a few old newspapers to read .
His mantra : Trust no one .
And develop a thick skin .
He is used to insults .
“ There are people in the queue who hate me because I manage to get four twists [ loaves ] and they ca n’t even manage to get one twist .
It ’s do or die .
One has to win .
The other has to lose . ”
Misleading newcomers about the length of the wait , and even what the queue is for , is a common ploy to minimize the competition , Kaodza says .
Not everyone in line is as lucky or pushy as he is .
Many are hungry , tired , desperate to get food for their family , and spend all their days waiting .
“ That woman behind you , she came a long way , ” says Kaodza , who knows everyone in the line .
“ She was dirty , that woman , because where she comes from there is no electricity and water ’s a problem .
“ She wakes up very early , and by the time she ’s walked to town she is all dusty . ”
He says some people collapse in the queue but others are afraid to help , for fear of losing their place .
“ It ’s better not to be a witness for anyone who ’s sick in line , because if they die , the police will take you away to the next of kin and you will have to explain what happened , ” Kaodza says in a matter - of - fact tone .
As we wait , several women wearing the uniforms of city street cleaners saunter by , loudly proclaiming that they should join the front of the line because they have to work all day .
At first people guffaw at their clumsy attempts to queue - hop .
But when the smell of freshly baked bread begins to waft out the doorway , there are shouts of indignation .
The women manage to squeeze inside the door just as the first loaves are handed over .
The first batch runs out .
The doors close .
The line grows restless .
“ People are prepared to fight in the queue , ” Kaodza says .
The security guard at the door starts throwing his weight around , threatening to beat some people who are trying to rejoin the queue , while apparently failing to notice others sneaking through .
As I huddle close to the wall trying to look unobtrusive , the guard suddenly points his finger at me .
All eyes swivel in my direction .
“ Look at that white woman there -- she ’s queuing up .
And you ’re asking me to let you go to the front ! ” he shouts .
White people , it seems , rarely queue .
Behind me , Kaodza laughs .
“ Those people obviously did n’t pay the guard , ” he whispers .
Kaodza usually gets six to eight twist loaves .
He cuts each in half and adds a smudge of margarine and a couple of slivers of sausage and sells them .
He makes up to 3 million Zimbabwean dollars , or $ 6 , a day on sandwiches , and in five days earns more than most teachers did before their recent pay raise .
In another queue at another supermarket , an unlikely friendship was born .
The two men were essentially rivals for bread .
One of them , Shane Johnson , 35 , hoped to get a few rolls for his wife and two children ; the other was a profiteer , determined to get hundreds to resell at an inflated price .
They saw each other most days in the bread queue .
A few weeks back they found themselves next to each other .
They struck up a cautious conversation .
“ You have to be so careful who you talk to .
You should have the freedom even in a queue to say what you are thinking , but you ca n’t because you ’re too afraid , ” Johnson says , fearful that the queues are full of “ dodgy characters ” and police informants .
But long hours slowly wore down their reserve .
“ Eventually , we started becoming very close , ” says Johnson ’s friend , a 27 - year - old who gives his name only as Nicholas , afraid of repercussions from the authorities if his full name is published .
“ If he has to go somewhere , I ’ll go and wait in the queue for him .
Or if I ca n’t wait in the queue , he ’ll wait for me .
We look out for each other . ”
The main bread factory ran out of flour weeks ago :
Now the only bread is found at small bakeries in supermarkets .
As shortages bite deeper , the Brussels - based International Crisis Group warned in a September report that Zimbabwe was “ closer than ever to complete collapse . ”
President Robert Mugabe , who has ruled Zimbabwe since its independence from Britain in 1980 , blames the West for the catastrophe .
But each measure adopted by the ruling ZANU - PF party seems to have made things worse .
By printing money , it triggered hyperinflation .
Its remedy was to set prices in Operation Dzikisa Mutengo ( Operation Reduce Prices ) in late June , which emptied the supermarket shelves of basic goods and ran some small businesses into the ground .
“ We all line up for bread , for milk , meat , for cooking oil and sugar , ” Johnson says .
“ You talk to the guys in the queue , and they all feel the same way :
There ’s nothing you can do . ”
People also queue for hours for cornmeal , a staple known as “ mealie meal , ” or for matches , candles and even plastic buckets to catch rainwater .
Johnson , softly spoken , thoughtful and polite , is not a hustler .
“ I hate queuing .
I absolutely hate it , because I do n’t like to be pushed around , ” he says .
But Nicholas has undergone a transformation , thanks to the bizarre economic conditions .
In late August he quit his job as a truck driver , giving up a wage that was being gobbled up by inflation , and discovered he had an unplumbed talent for trading .
In August , his wage was $ 3.20 .
Now he makes about $ 70 a week selling drinks .
Selling rolls is a sideline that earns him $ 5 a day .
For comparison , teachers earned as little as $ 4.80 a month until the government raised their wages last month to a minimum of $ 28 .
The people who struggle most are workers who do n’t want to give up the security of even a meager salary for the uncertainties of profiteering .
“ There are a lot of people who do n’t know how to do it , ” Nicholas says .
“ They have it worse because they do n’t know how to go out and buy and sell .
They wake up a bit late .
They do n’t know where to go and who to see .
They do n’t know how to talk to people . ”
Johnson ’s path could not be more different from his friend ’s .
He had owned a thriving electronics repair business since 1995 .
But rents kept going up and customers evaporated .
In a decision he likened to a painful divorce , he closed down in March .
Between trips to queue up , he does a few freelance repairs for old clients , while his wife works .
When he is in line , he frets about his children .
There is his little girl :
He always dashes out of the line to pick her up from nursery school .
He knows he ca n’t afford a decent school for her next year .
There is his 3 - year - old son , who has asthma .
With hospitals unaffordable , no transportation and the family savings gone , what happens if he has an attack ?
If there is one main conversation piece in the queue , it is the queues themselves .
Rumors fly about how a fight broke out in one somewhere , or how a supermarket fridge or window was broken when tempers got frayed .
Then there are the inevitable stories about another , better queue nearby , for sugar or mealie meal , stories no one is sure whether to believe .
There is always wariness and distrust .
Fears of “ dodgy characters ” and plainclothes secret police loom large , though it is impossible to know whether they are in the queue .
In Zimbabwe , people live with fear all the time .
Even so , most days the conversation in the queue eventually drifts to politics .
People blame Mugabe , whom they call “ our father ” or madala ( old man ) or “ Bob , ” for the chaos .
“ They ’re too scared to talk about him as the president .
Most people wish that he was dead , ” Nicholas says .
“ They say he ’s killed our country , ” says Charles Moyo , 45 , a night - shift worker who queues every day for bread for his four children .
Although people often share their anger , most find it difficult to break through the layer of distrust .
There are passing friendships in the queues , but most do n’t exist outside the line .
Johnson and Nicholas drop by each other ’s house and socialize whenever they can .
But just as the friendship was born out of the economic crisis , it might die that way too .
Although Nicholas is something of a success in today ’s Zimbabwe , earning enough to save a little and even lend cash to friends , Johnson realizes that he will never have the aggressive edge that makes his friend such a talented trader .
After losing his business , he knows he is not made for Zimbabwe ’s dog - eat - dog economy .
“ I ’ll be honest with you , it ’s not for me , ” he says .
“ To buy and sell ?
I do n’t do that .
I prefer to work for a living . ”
Ten years ago , he considered leaving for a job possibility in another country , but decided against it .
“ You say to yourself , maybe it will get better .
It just gets worse and worse and worse . ”
Now , within the month , he plans to seek a better life in South Africa or Britain .
“ If there was some sort of hope , I ’d stay , ” he says with a resigned smile .
The low mutter of gossip is interrupted as trucks chug along the supermarket lane , emitting foul black fumes into our faces , the wheels a foot from our toes .
Then there ’s a sudden surge forward , a whiff of exhilaration .
Finally , I shuffle through the back door of the bakery with the crowd and exchange my 80,000 Zimbabwean dollars -- about 16 cents -- for two small twist loaves , still hot when they are placed in my hands .
As I leave the bakery , I find another queue inside the supermarket : the fast queue , where police and friends of the supermarket manager get their bread .
The smell of baked bread is intoxicating .
People carry their loaves carefully , as though holding a small and fragile creature .
They walk out with smiles of victory .

Full disclosure : I used to own a record label .
That label , Luaka Bop , still exists , though I 'm no longer involved in running it .
My last record came out through Nonesuch , a subsidiary of the Warner Music Group empire .
I have also released music through indie labels like Thrill Jockey , and I have pressed up CDs and sold them on tour .
I tour every few years , and I do n't see it as simply a loss leader for CD sales .
So I have seen this business from both sides .
I 've made money , and I 've been ripped off .
I 've had creative freedom , and I 've been pressured to make hits .
I have dealt with diva behavior from crazy musicians , and I have seen genius records by wonderful artists get completely ignored .
I love music .
I always will .
It saved my life , and I bet I 'm not the only one who can say that .

" Here 's the ' cover ' I did of the Fiery Furnaces tune — the words in the first half are theirs and in the last two verses they are mine .
Kind of a new way to collaborate . " — David Byrne
What is called the music business today , however , is not the business of producing music .
At some point it became the business of selling CDs in plastic cases , and that business will soon be over .
But that 's not bad news for music , and it 's certainly not bad news for musicians .
Indeed , with all the ways to reach an audience , there have never been more opportunities for artists .
Where are things going ?
Well , some people 's charts look like this :
Some see this picture as a dire trend .
The fact that Radiohead debuted its latest album online and Madonna defected from Warner Bros. to Live Nation , a concert promoter , is held to signal the end of the music business as we know it .
Actually , these are just two examples of how musicians are increasingly able to work outside of the traditional label relationship .
There is no one single way of doing business these days .
There are , in fact , six viable models by my count .
That variety is good for artists ; it gives them more ways to get paid and make a living .
And it 's good for audiences , too , who will have more — and more interesting — music to listen to .
Let 's step back and get some perspective .
What is music ?
First , a definition of terms .
What is it we 're talking about here ?
What exactly is being bought and sold ?
In the past , music was something you heard and experienced — it was as much a social event as a purely musical one .
Before recording technology existed , you could not separate music from its social context .
Epic songs and ballads , troubadours , courtly entertainments , church music , shamanic chants , pub sing - alongs , ceremonial music , military music , dance music — it was pretty much all tied to specific social functions .
It was communal and often utilitarian .
You could n't take it home , copy it , sell it as a commodity ( except as sheet music , but that 's not music ) , or even hear it again .
Music was an experience , intimately married to your life .
You could pay to hear music , but after you did , it was over , gone — a memory .
Technology changed all that in the 20th century .
Music — or its recorded artifact , at least — became a product , a thing that could be bought , sold , traded , and replayed endlessly in any context .
This upended the economics of music , but our human instincts remained intact .
I spend plenty of time with buds in my ears listening to recorded music , but I still get out to stand in a crowd with an audience .
I sing to myself , and , yes , I play an instrument ( not always well ) .
We 'll always want to use music as part of our social fabric : to congregate at concerts and in bars , even if the sound sucks ; to pass music from hand to hand ( or via the Internet ) as a form of social currency ; to build temples where only " our kind of people " can hear music ( opera houses and symphony halls ) ; to want to know more about our favorite bards — their love lives , their clothes , their political beliefs .
This betrays an eternal urge to have a larger context beyond a piece of plastic .
One might say this urge is part of our genetic makeup .
All this is what we talk about when we talk about music .
All of it .
What do record companies do ?
Or , more precisely , what did they do ?
Fund recording sessions
Manufacture product
Distribute product
Market product
Loan and advance money for expenses ( tours , videos , hair and makeup )
Advise and guide artists on their careers and recordings
Handle the accounting
This was the system that evolved over the past century to market the product , which is to say the container — vinyl , tape , or disc — that carried the music .
( Calling the product music is like selling a shopping cart and calling it groceries . )
But many things have changed in the past decade that reduce the value of these services to artists .
For example : Recording costs have declined to almost zero .
Artists used to need the labels to bankroll their recordings .
Most simply did n't have the $ 15,000 ( minimum ) necessary to rent a professional studio and pay an engineer and a producer .
For many artists — maybe even most — this is no longer the case .
Now an album can be made on the same laptop you use to check email .
Manufacturing and distribution costs are approaching zero .
There used to be a break - even point below which it was impractical to distribute a recording .
With LPs and CDs , there were base manufacturing costs , printing costs , shipping , and so on .
It paid — in fact , it was essential — to sell in volume , because that 's how many of those costs got amortized .
No more : Digital distribution is pretty much free .
It 's no cheaper per unit to distribute a million copies than a hundred .
Touring is not just promotion .
Live performances used to be seen as essentially a way to publicize a new release — a means to an end , not an end in itself .
Bands would go into debt in order to tour , anticipating that they 'd recover their losses later through increased record sales .
This , to be blunt , is all wrong .
It 's backward .
Performing is a thing in itself , a distinct skill , different from making recordings .
And for those who can do it , it 's a way to make a living .
So with all these changes , what happens to the labels ?
Some will survive .
Nonesuch , where I 've done several albums , has thrived under Warner Music Group ownership by operating with a lean staff of 12 and staying focused on talent .
" Artists like Wilco , Philip Glass , k.d. lang , and others have sold more here than when they were at so - called major labels , " Bob Hurwitz , president of Nonesuch , told me , " even during a time of decline . "

https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/multimedia/magazine/1601/Eno_Part4_FINAL.mp3
" How the f–k can we get out of this ? " " Cool Tools " " The people who know how to do this are the ones you fired … " " When was the last time you had dealings with a record company ? "
But some labels will disappear , as the roles they used to play get chopped up and delivered by more thrifty services .
In a recent conversation I had with Brian Eno ( who is producing the next Coldplay album and writing with U2 ) , he was enthusiastic about I Think Music — an online network of indie bands , fans , and stores — and pessimistic about the future of traditional labels .
" Structurally , they 're much too large , " Eno said .
" And they 're entirely on the defensive now .
The only idea they have is that they can give you a big advance — which is still attractive to a lot of young bands just starting out .
But that 's all they represent now : capital . "
So where do artists fit into this changing landscape ?
We find new options , new models .
The six possibilities
Where there was one , now there are six :
Six possible music distribution models , ranging from one in which the artist is pretty much hands - off to one where the artist does nearly everything .
Not surprisingly , the more involved the artist is , the more he or she can often make per unit sold .
The totally DIY model is certainly not for everyone — but that 's the point .
Now there 's choice .
1 . At one end of the scale is the 360 , or equity , deal , where every aspect of the artist 's career is handled by producers , promoters , marketing people , and managers .
The idea is that you can achieve wide saturation and sales , boosted by a hardworking machine that stands to benefit from everything you do .
The artist becomes a brand , owned and operated by the label , and in theory this gives the company a long - term perspective and interest in nurturing that artist 's career .
Pussycat Dolls , Korn , and Robbie Williams have made arrangements like this , selling equity in everything they touch .
The T - shirts , the records , the concerts , the videos , the BBQ sauce .
The artist often gets a lot of money up front .
But I doubt that creative decisions will be left in the artist 's hands .
As a general rule , as the cash comes in , creative control goes out .
The equity partner simply has too much at stake .
This is the kind of deal Madonna just made with Live Nation .
For a reported $ 120 million , the company — which until now has mainly produced and promoted concerts — will get a piece of both her concert revenue and her music sales .
I , for one , would not want to be beholden to Live Nation — a spinoff of Clear Channel , the radio conglomerate that turned the US airwaves into pabulum .
But Madge is a smart cookie ; she 's always been adept at controlling her own stuff , so we 'll see .
2 . Next is what I 'll call the standard distribution deal .
This is more or less what I lived with for many years as a member of the Talking Heads .
The record company bankrolls the recording and handles the manufacturing , distribution , press , and promotion .
The artist gets a royalty percentage after all those other costs are repaid .
The label , in this scenario , owns the copyright to the recording .
Forever .
There 's another catch with this kind of arrangement :
The typical pop star often lives in debt to their record company and a host of other entities , and if they hit a dry spell they can go broke .
Michael Jackson , MC Hammer , TLC — the danger of debt and overextension is an old story .
Obviously , the cost of these services , along with the record company 's overhead , accounts for a big part of CD prices .
You , the buyer , are paying for all those trucks , those CD plants , those warehouses , and all that plastic .
Theoretically , as many of these costs go away , they should no longer be charged to the consumer — or the artist .
Sure , many of the services traditionally provided by record labels under the standard deal are now being farmed out .
Press and publicity , digital marketing , graphic design — all are often handled by smaller , independent firms .
But he who pays the piper calls the tune .
If the record company pays the subcontractors , then the record company ultimately decides who or what has priority .
If they " do n't hear a single , " they can tell you your record is n't coming out .
So what happens when online sales eliminate many of these expenses ?
Look at iTunes : $ 10 for a " CD " download reflects the cost savings of digital distribution , which seems fair — at first .
It 's certainly better for consumers .
But after Apple takes its 30 percent , the royalty percentage is applied and the artist — surprise ! — is no better off .
Not coincidentally , the issues here are similar to those in the recent Hollywood writers ' strike .
Will recording artists band together and go on strike ?
3 . The license deal is similar to the standard deal , except in this case the artist retains the copyrights and ownership of the master recording .
The right to exploit that property is granted to a label for a limited period of time — usually seven years .
After that , the rights to license to TV shows , commercials , and the like revert to the artist .
If the members of the Talking Heads held the master rights to our catalog today , we 'd earn twice as much in licensing as we do now — and that 's where artists like me derive much of our income .
If a band has made a record itself and does n't need creative or financial help , this model is worth looking at .
It allows for a little more creative freedom , since you get less interference from the guys in the big suits .
The flip side is that because the label does n't own the master , it may invest less in making the release a success .
David Byrne in conversation with Mac McCaughan from Merge Records .
" How could an indie label handle a release the size of Arcade Fire 's second record ? "
https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/multimedia/magazine/1601/Merge_PART_1.mp3
" How do emerging acts survive ? "
https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/multimedia/magazine/1601/Merge_PART_2.mp3
" Major labels are n't doing well because they put out terrible records for years and years and kept raising the price of those terrible records and finally people were like , ' Screw you . ' "
https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/multimedia/magazine/1601/Merge_PART_3.mp3
" How could an indie label handle a release the size of Arcade Fire 's second record ? " " How do emerging acts survive ? " " Major labels are n't doing well because they put out terrible records for years and years and kept raising the price of those terrible records and finally people were like , ' Screw you . ' "
But with the right label , the license deal can be a great way to go .
This is the relationship Arcade Fire has with Merge Records , an indie label that 's done great for its band by avoiding the big - spending , big - label approach .
" Part of it is just being realistic and not putting yourself in the hole , " Merge cofounder Mac McCaughan says .
" The bands we work with , we never recommend that they make videos .
I like videos , but they do n't sell a lot of records .
What really sells records is touring — and artists can actually make money on the tour itself if they keep their budgets down . "
4 . Then there 's the profit - sharing deal .
I did something like this with my album Lead Us Not Into Temptation in 2003 .
I got a minimal advance from the label , Thrill Jockey , since the recording costs were covered by a movie soundtrack budget , and we shared the profits from day one .
I retained ownership of the master .
Thrill Jockey does some marketing and press .
I may or may not have sold as many records as I would have with a larger company , but in the end I took home a greater share of each unit sold .
5 . In the manufacturing and distribution deal , the artist does everything except , well , manufacture and distribute the product .
Often the companies that do these kinds of deals also offer other services , like marketing .
But given the numbers , they do n't stand to make as much , so their incentive here is limited .
Big record labels traditionally do n't make M&D deals .
David Byrne in conversation with Michael Hausman .
" We were n't competing with Madonna , Beyonce or Springsteen , because they were n't doing it . "
https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/multimedia/magazine/1601/Michael_H_Part_1.mp3
" There 's a way for music to have a life of its own and turn into something bigger … " https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/multimedia/magazine/1601/Michael_H_Part_2.mp3
" The labels are n't set up for enlightened , long - range thinking .
That 's what a good manager should be doing . "

" We were n't competing with Madonna , Beyonce or Springsteen , because they were n't doing it . " " There 's a way for music to have a life of its own and turn into something bigger … " " The labels are n't set up for enlightened , long - range thinking .
That 's what a good manager should be doing . "
In this scenario , the artist gets absolute creative control , but it 's a bigger gamble .
Aimee Mann does this , and it works really well for her .
" A lot of artists do n't realize how much more money they could make by retaining ownership and licensing directly , " Mann 's manager , Michael Hausman , told me .
" If it 's done properly , you get paid quickly , and you get paid again and again .
That 's a great source of income . "
6 . Finally , at the far end of the scale , is the self - distribution model , where the music is self - produced , self - written , self - played , and self - marketed .
CDs are sold at gigs and through a Web site .
Promotion is a MySpace page .
The band buys or leases a server to handle download sales .
Within the limits of what they can afford , the artists have complete creative control .
In practice , especially for emerging artists , that can mean freedom without resources — a pretty abstract sort of independence .
For those who plan to take their material on the road and play it live , the financial constraints cut even deeper .
Backup orchestras , massive video screens and sets , and weird high tech lights do n't come cheap .
David Byrne in conversation with Radiohead 's managers , Bryce Edge and Chris Hufford ( Courtyard Management ) . " … how it proliferated around the world with such ridiculous speed " https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/images/multimedia/magazine/1601/Managers_Part1_FINAL.mp3

" It actually physically blew up and we had to replace it … " " It 's just an art band from Oxford having a bit of a laugh . " " Johnny ’s doing his gay boy sort of pretty look " Radiohead adopted this DIY model to sell In Rainbows online — and then went a step further by letting fans name their own price for the download .
They were n't the first to do this — Issa ( formerly known as Jane Siberry ) pioneered the pay - what - you - will model a few years ago — but Radiohead 's move was much higher profile .
It may be less risky for them , but it 's a clear sign of real changes afoot .
As one of Radiohead 's managers , Bryce Edge , told me , " The industry reacted like the end was nigh .
They 've devalued music , giving it away for nothing . '
Which was n't true :
We asked people to value it , which is very different semantics to me . "
From Value Pack to Blister Pack : the PSP - 2000
PSP - 2000 Daxter Bundle
Manufacturer : Sony ( product page )
Price : $ 199.99 ( shop for this product )
A very different message than the first package
Here we are , looking at a new PlayStation Portable .
I remember reviewing the first PSP and looking at the package .
The thing looked dangerous ; that box looked like you were dealing with an expensive ( and advanced ) piece of technology .
While the original price of $ 250 was expensive for a portable , you felt , looking at that box and that shiny black system , that you had gotten your money 's worth .
The new package takes a very different approach .
Sony now has a brighter colored box , with the Ice Silver system peeking out of the front and a vinyl sticker showing a game of Daxter already being played .
At $ 200 , the new system comes with the updated hardware , a 1GB memory stick , a copy of Daxter , and a UMD movie of Family Guy : Frickin ’ Sweet collection .
The new hardware also features a TV - out jack so you can play your games and movies on the big screen .
While the first PSP looked like it was all business , this PSP arrives with a more inviting message .
It 's here to party .
So what ’s new ?
What 's new with the PSP - 2000 ?
Other than a name that makes it sound like it 's seven years late ?
Let 's get the physical changes out the of way first ; believe me , you ’ll notice them very quickly .
The system itself is very light .
Incredibly light , in fact ; the hardware is now a third lighter than the original PlayStation Portable .
It can be disconcerting when you first pick up the hardware with its Daxter sticker over the screen , as it feels like a plastic shell instead of a real system .
In fact , as we noted when we first played with one at E3 , it feels cheap .
If you run your finger over the top of the system , you 'll also feel a bump where the screen meets the plastic shell , instead of the smooth surface the original PSP sported .
Not a big deal , but you can tell the screen and plastic shell are now two separate pieces .
The system is also now shiny and slick across both the front and the back , instead of the more grainy plastic of the original 's rear .
While it feels like it may slide out of your hands at first , holding the system is an extremely comfortable affair .
As you get used to the new weight , the " cheap " feeling fades away , and the new lightweight design makes the system easier to play during marathon sessions .
The speakers have been moved from the bottom of the system 's face to the top , making the sound easier to hear .
The D - pad on the new hardware is raised slightly higher than the original , which is a subtle but nice change ; games feel a tiny bit easier to control now .
The " nipple " analog stick feels no different than the original , although the new stick is of course tighter than my broken - in original unit .
The headphone jack is in a slightly different place , and while the jack is also used for the TV - out cable , it looks no different than the original .
The wireless toggle has been moved from the side to the top , the cavity for the Pro Duo memory cards has been moved slightly as well , and now the cover is attached to the system by two flexible plastic tethers as shown in the picture .
In the hands of young children , I ’d be very scared of these coming off , in fact .
The IR port , which was never put to any real use on the original system , has been omitted completely from the top of the system .
The USB port remains in the same place , but the spring - loaded port for the UMDs has been replaced by a flip - up port that you have to open yourself .
The UMD rests inside the system now , instead of being put into the metal track of the original .
Do n't worry about the sound of the UMD rattling around ; once you close the system it fits in place perfectly .
It does n’t feel as solid or as satisfying as the old UMD slot , but 'tis enough , ' twill serve .
Although some changes such as the new UMD drive and the slot for the memory cards may feel slightly flimsy , the payoff is that the lighter weight and slimmer design is much more comfortable to hold .
The system no longer seems intimidating , it feels like a toy — and I mean that in a good way .
This is something people will want to pick up and play with , and that ’s a very welcome feeling .
The original PSP seemed to make some people nervous , and now it 's a system you wo n't mind passing around .
Keep in mind that the response time of the screen has not been improved ; if you were bothered by ghosting in the original hardware , you 'll be bothered by ghosting with the new PSP .
Disappointing .
According to the Bible , when Jesus was born three Magi saw a star in the East that ' signaled the birth of a new king ' .
But just what was it , from an astronomical point of view , that the Magi could actually have seen ?
Fred Grosse , a professor of physics and astronomy at Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove , Pa. , says there are several popular theories that may answer this question .
“ Astronomical objects or events which would be of interest to serious stargazers of the time include comets and meteors , nova or supernova , and auroras , ” Grosse says .
But the favorite candidate hypothesis for the star of Bethlehem , he explains , is a planetary conjunction .
Supernova , planetary conjunction or Venus ?
A conjunction happens when two celestial objects appear to pass very near to each other from our perspective on Earth .
Often , these conjunctions look like one large object rather than separate ones .
“ In 6 BCE , Jupiter and Saturn passed each other three times , in May , September , and December – a triple conjunction , ” Grosse says .
Since the actual year of Jesus ’ birth is tough to pin down , an event in 6 BCE remains a good candidate to explain what the Magi saw .
" Because this conjunction only happens once every 140 years , it would have been a significant event to astrologers from Babylon .
“ A conjecture is that they saw the first passing from their homes , left for Jerusalem , and got there in time for the second or third passing to guide them to Bethlehem , ” he says .
“ ( Astronomer Johannes ) Kepler knew of this conjunction , and since his time astronomers have connected the triple conjunction with the Star of Bethlehem . ”
Though this is the dominant explanation for the star in the east , it ’s not the only one .
“ Nova and Supernova are new objects which appear in the sky and then dim to oblivion , ” Grosse explains .
And they can put on the kind of show that first century astrologers would have noticed .
“ A supernova in 1006 , the brightest ever , was as bright as the sun , " he says .
" It was visible to the naked eye for more than two years . ”
According to Chinese records , there were supernova – or “ guest stars ” as the Chinese described them – that appeared in the sky right around the time when Jesus may have been born , in 4 and 5 BCE .
But the fact that there ’s a possible scientific explanation to what the Magi saw , does n’t mean to Grosse that the event loses its transcendence .
“ The symbolism is apparent .
A small clear light , on a cold dark night , in a sometimes cold and dark world , leads the wise to the message of Jesus .
The message tells us to love each passenger who journeys with us on this small , fragile , planet Earth . ”
Has Google lost your address ?
Now you can help it find you .
Starting this week , the Mountain View search giant is letting users edit the errors found in its online mapping product .
“ Sometimes , a location can be a little off on a map and your friends can’t find you , ” the Mountain View company explained in a video posted on YouTube by software engineer Seth LaForge .
“ Now you can fix that . ”
The move comes as Google grapples with opening more of its operations to outsiders .
Once notoriously closed and secretive , the company is increasingly seeking to turn itself into a platform for other businesses .
To be successful , the ambitious effort will require contributions from people around the world , ranging from software developers who write new applications to owners of mom and pop businesses who enter information on the site about their grocery store , coffee shop or dry cleaners .
“ There are multiple reasons that Google is doing this and one of them is to clean up and improve the quality of the data , ” said Greg Sterling , an analyst with Sterling Market Research .
“ Inaccurate Google map locations are a problem occasionally for most people who use online maps , ” said Gus Allen , founder of Swamplot , a Houston real estate blog .
Among other services , Allen directs his readers to local demolitions using Google maps .
Last week , Google mistakenly placed a Houston address in Oklahoma , he said .
To edit Google Maps , a person needs a Google account .
If someone see an error while searching for a business , he or she can click an “ edit ” link .
For example , Google originally marked the entrance to the San Jose Mercury News on a side road leading to the employee parking lot until a reporter dragged the marker to the correct location – the newspaper ’s grand 1950s style entrance – on Tuesday afternoon .
Google said it will prevent abuse by restricting changes to certain listings , like hospitals , police stations and schools , as well as the addresses of businesses that have claimed their listing online at Google ’s Local Business Center .
Edited addresses will be clearly marked , and links to original address markings will be retained .
Users can also report abuse through a link .
Certain edits , such as moving a marker more than 200 yards , must be reviewed by a Google employee .
“ Move a marker , and make your virtual neighborhood a better place – that is , in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand , where it works right now , ” LaForge wrote in a blog post on Monday .
By making maps more useful , Google is trying to capture a larger share of the dollars spent on online Yellow Page advertising and local search – which is estimated to grow from $ 1.9 billion this early to $ 4.9 billion in 2011 , according to the Kelsey Group of Princeton , NJ .
Yahoo is also eyeing this market .
It began allowing businesses to update their information in January 2007 .
A spokeswoman for Yahoo said the number of companies that has done so is in the high hundreds of thousands .
A spokeswoman for Google said more than a million businesses have “ interacted ” with their online business center .
While there are an estimated 25 million local businesses in the United States , the total number of advertisers in the traditional Yellow Pages is 3.5 million , according to the Kelsey Group .
Sterling said the relatively large numbers reported by Yahoo and Google illustrate the great potential for local search online , which is still at a very early stage .
“ There ’s been a lot of learning and now all the parties are figuring it out , ” he said .
Former intel chair : CIA tape affair part of ' an ongoing pattern ' of Bush administration cover - up David Edwards and Jason Rhyne

The former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says he was kept in the dark about severe interrogations of suspected al - Qaeda terrorists taped by the CIA , and calls the episode just another example of the Bush administration 's " covering up " of unwanted revelations .
Former Sen. Bob Graham ( D - FL ) , who chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee from 2001 to 2003 -- the period during which the CIA has admitted to implementing waterboarding and other severe methods on two high - level detainees -- says he was never told by the agency that such tactics were being employed .
Appearing on CNN's American Morning , Graham was asked about a recent story in the Washington Post which cited officials claiming that four members of Congress , including now - Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , had been thoroughly briefed about the techniques being used .
But if that briefing did occur , it did n't include him -- and it certainly should have , said the former intelligence chairman .
" I was briefed on a number of other activities that were going on after 9/11 , but not on this issue of the use of torture to gain information from detainees , " said Graham .
" Not only should I have been briefed , but the entire committee [ should have ] been briefed . "
As described by the Post , most of the briefings heard by the so - called " gang of four , " which consists of the chairman and ranking member of the House and Senate intelligence committees .
" The only basis for what they called these covert gang of four briefings is where the president has indicated there 's an action that 's being undertaken for which the United States wants to have deniability , " said Graham .
" It 's not a blanket for every subject that the intelligence community might be involved with .
My judgment , this was not a covert operation , and should have been briefed to the entire intelligence committee . "
Graham went on to describe the confining structure of the classified briefing process .
" You can't take any notes .
You can't bring anyone with you and after the meeting , you cannot discuss what you 've heard , " he said .
" So that if , for instance , there 's an issue about ' is this legal under the Geneva Conventions , ' you can't go to someone who is an expert on that subject and get their opinion .
It is a very limiting situation . "
The whole affair involving the CIA 's intel gathering tactics -- and subsequent decision to destroy tapes of its interrogations -- were part of an ongoing attempt by the Bush administration to obfuscate the truth , he said .
" Let me say , this is not an isolated episode , " said the former chairman .
" This administration has had a practice of covering up , disclosing , what they were doing in a variety of matters .
This is just one example of an ongoing pattern . "
It 's not the first time Graham has accused the Bush administration of a cover - up , having previously alleged that the White House had hidden evidence exposing Saudi Arabia 's links to the Sept. 11 hijackers .
In his book ' Intelligence Matters , ' Mr. Graham writes that the administration prohibited a Congressional inquiry 's interview of the landlord of two of the 9/11 hijackers , who he said could help prove the connection .
Graham called a letter to that effect " a smoking gun , " telling reporters that the " reason for this cover - up goes right to the White House . "

This is my own horror story concerning polygraph exams .
For some background , I was convicted of larceny in a building in January , 2004 .
During the investigation by Det. Lyman of the Grand Valley State University Police Department , I took two polygraph tests .
The first was given to me by Mr. Terry Anderson , a former State Trooper and state licensed private examiner .
I passed Mr. Anderson 's exam .
The other one was given to me by Trooper Ben Escalante of the Michigan State Police and I failed that one .
SGT Escalante is elsewhere on antipolygraph.org for another case in which he screwed the pooch .
I wrote this concerning the polygraph exams I took because I wanted others to see that I was cooperative with Det.
Lyman , despite his assertions while he built his case that I was not .
I had a constitutional right to cooperate as much or as little as I desired .
If I cooperated , I only desired to do it at a place and time of my choosing .
I sought only to be secure in my constitutional rights and not for any other reason .
To insinuate anything else would be untrue and demeaning .
During Det. Lymans investigation , he requested that I take a polygraph test .
In fact , that was a major point of contention between us .
My main problem with polygraph testing is that I do not think it is a reliable method of ascertaining the truth .
As they are not admissible in a criminal trial , I do not think I am alone in that belief .
To my mind , if I had taken a polygraph and passed it ( which eventually happened ) I could not use it in Court to defend myself .
If I failed it , then Det .
Lyman could not use that fact against me in Court , but he could still ( and did ) keep pressing his case against me .
He could still press his case even if I passed it .
Where was the upside for me to take a polygraph test ?
Where was the advantage ?
When he first made his request at the initial interrogation , I had not even retained counsel yet and I am sure anyone would agree that to allow the police total control of my life without counsel would have been foolish .
Once I retained counsel , he advised me to take a polygraph test , in hopes that if I was truthful , Det. Lyman would keep his word and leave me alone .
To that end , my counsel , Frank Carrozza , scheduled a polygraph examination with Terry Anderson , a fully trained and licensed polygraph examiner .
If memory serves correctly , he is a former Michigan State Police trooper .
As he had been doing this type of work since 1978 , he was and is certainly well trained and experienced .
Mr. Andersons expert opinion was that I was being Truthful during my exam concerning the matter of the stolen LCD video projector .
I passed this polygraph on July 15 , 2003 .
However , despite his assurances that if I passed a polygraph examination he would exclude me from consideration as a suspect , Det. Lyman continued to press his case .
I was told that the reason that Det. Lyman , undaunted , continued was because I had not faced a polygraph examiner of his choosing , that he set up .
The near automatic inference one could have made was that because I had a private polygraph examiner , my polygraph was suspect .
In short , it was not good enough for him because he did not have control of it .
When I would not submit , he used that as a reason to continue his investigation .
Eventually , my counsel set - up a polygraph with the Ottawa County Prosecutors office .
I was first scheduled for a polygraph on September 22 , 2003 at 1:00 PM with Trooper Ben Escalante at the Ottawa County Sheriffs Department .
On that day , I reported to the OCSD for my polygraph at 12:52 PM .
I checked in at the main window there and told the staff workers for the OCSD who I was , what I was there for and who I was supposed to meet .
They informed me that they would tell him I was there .
At just after 1:00 PM , I went to the window again and inquired about my appointment .
I was told that Mr. Escalante was aware I was there and to wait patiently .
At 1:12 PM , I went back to the window to tell them that I know these things take two hours and I had to get my daughter from school at Fruitport Middle School that day .
I already was going to be late and had made arrangement with her to wait until 3:30 PM when I would pick her up .
She got out of school about 2:50 PM .
Now if , as I accurately surmised , a polygraph examination would take about two hours , then a little after three oclock would give me enough time to get her with some latitude in time .
Again , they told me he knew I was there and he would be with me in a moment .
At 1:22 PM , I went back to the window and was basically told the same thing .
They also told me that Mr. Escalante was getting familiar with the case notes .
Before I went , I read where making a subject about to take a polygraph wait a long time is a tactic of some unscrupulous polygraph examiners .
The tactic is similar to icing  a field goal kicker in football ; waiting ratchets up the tension , so to speak .
If there is enough anxiety , then there is a good possibility , even probability , that the subject will fail the polygraph .
I returned to the window at 1:33 PM , and told them if he did not come out soon , I was going to leave , I had to get my daughter .
They said okay , but they again told me he would be out in a minute .
At 1:41 PM , I told the OCSD staff I was leaving because I had to go and get my daughter .
I did not have any more time to wait .
I left the OCSD and went to the parking lot there to call my attorney to tell him what was going on .
At the time , cell phone reception was poor there and I barely got through .
I only managed to get out that I was leaving before the call dropped .
Now I went to my car and of a sudden , this black - haired Latino looking man , nattily dressed in a burgundy dress shirt , black dress shoes and slacks came out of the building and starting yelling across the lot asking for Mike Jardine .
I acknowledged him and told him who I was .
He introduced himself as Mr. Escalante , instead of Trooper Escalante of the Michigan State Police .
This did not sit well with me and I became increasingly apprehensive about taking the test .
He also told me that he was ready , apologizing for the delay because he said , and the OCSD staff had already iterated , he was busy familiarizing himself with the case notes . 
He also stated that he was taking his lunch . 
I apologized to him and stated that I had to go now because he took so much time getting to me .
I said that if I was him and I knew I had a one oclock appointment , I would have read the case notes prior to that time and would have taken my lunch on time and been ready when the subject arrived for the test .
I also explained to him that I had read about how polygraph examiners intentionally keep a subject waiting in order to make them more anxious .
He then stated that I could take the test or not , he did not care .
However , he stated ,  A co-operative person will take the test .
An un-cooperative one wont .
To this day , I still dont understand what he meant by that .
It seemed inane .
I replied ,  Define co-operative .
I arrived about 10 minutes early to take a polygraph I am under no legal obligation to take .
I waited over 40 minutes for you to come out .
You come out here to fetch me and feed me some line about you had to take your lunch , and look over the case notes and you do not introduce yourself by your real title with your name .
Who is being disingenuous now ?
Who is lying now ?
Maybe you were not trying to make me more anxious , but you have not engendered any trust here .
I have to go and get my daughter now and I dont have time for this bullshit . 
SGT Escalante seemed more than a little miffed by this and he said that he did not have a vested interest in determining my guilt or innocence .
Yet when I knew he was a State Trooper , I did not trust that .
As a law enforcement officer , my belief was that he could be more interested in catching crooks than in the Truth .
Considering what was going on with my family at the time and my parents wrongful death suit , I was not inclined to trust anyone with a badge , especially one that had apparently done his best to not be totally honest and transparent with me .
After our discussion , I left .
I was not happy and I could tell he was not happy , either .
Later , my lawyer got angry with me because I did not stay , but I had bent over enough and I felt I was being played with .
I no longer wanted to take any polygraph test .
In a handwritten and initialed comment on the appointment letter , Det. Lyman wrote  Refused Test on arrival . 
I am not certain , but I assume that he wrote something that Trooper Escalante told him via a phone conversation .
If that was so , Trooper Escalante was being more than a little disingenuous ; unless of course , Trooper Escalante meant I refused test upon his arrival .
That would be more or less true , but not logical .
I did not drive all the way down to OCSD on Port Sheldon Road from Muskegon to turn around and leave 5 minutes after I arrived .
When I arrived for the test at 12:52 PM and did not leave until well after 1:40 PM , that was not by any stretch of the imagination upon arrival . 
Against my better judgment , my lawyer re-scheduled the exam .
I reluctantly agreed to go as long as Trooper Escalante was not going to be my examiner .
However , when I returned to the OCSD to take the exam , it was Trooper Escalante who was to be the examiner .
After our last encounter , I was pretty upset by that .
Before the exam , Trooper Escalante reiterated that he had no interest in determining my guilt or innocence .
Yet , right after he administered the test , he said that  I can tell by my machine right here that you are definitely the one who stole the video projector .
I told him that no matter what his computer said , it cannot make me something I am not ; a thief .
I was not amazed that I did not pass the exam .
Trooper Escalante then started to interrogate me .
He said something to the effect of ,  I know how these things get started .
You get caught up in things that get out of control and these things just happen .
Why dont you tell me why you stole the projector ?
What really happened ?
I told him ,  Wow .
You can tell that from that little machine ?
You know , for a man who says he has no vested interest in determining my guilt or innocence , you sure seem interested in doing so now .
Why cant you just write up your report and send it to the prosecutor ?
We are done here .
Now .  I then left .
Consider this : according to the Department of Licensing and Professional Regulation , at the time Trooper Escalante had given me the exam he had been a fully licensed polygraph examiner for about a year .
Mr. Anderson had been fully licensed for over 20 years .
Additionally , Trooper Escalante was the polygraph examiner for a woman that was wrongfully convicted of a theft from Panopolous Salon in Grand Rapids , MI .
She told the absolute truth during her exam , yet Trooper Escalante was in the local paper as her examiner and the article said she had failed the polygraph test .
It later turned out that the bag of money she was accused of stealing from her employer was found inside the night drop box at the bank she was supposed to have taken it almost a year after the fact .
It was jammed into a corner of the drawer box the night she deposited it .
It was later found by a bank employee .
The woman has since settled lawsuits against her employer and her record has been expunged .
That event left me to wonder , absent other objective exculpatory evidence in how many of Trooper Escalantes examinations are the subjects found to be truthful ?
As I stated earlier , I do not believe in polygraph exams .
As is their right , the ECAC and the Board may have their own beliefs concerning them and their fair use .
If one believes they are accurate , then to that person there were two tests ; one said I was truthful , one said I was not truthful .
At best , the logical conclusion is that the tests mutually cancel each other and the result is inconclusive .
All that time and effort was a total wash .
If one truly believes in these exams , then it should also come down to which opinion is valid .
A subject cannot both be telling the Truth and be lying .
To my mind , the only way to determine that is to weigh the experience , training and record of one examiner versus another .
The quality of the examiner and his testing method should come into play .
I realize that it is a difficult decision .
What I would like to point out is , despite the assumption that just because Mr. Anderson was hired by my lawyer , I submit that as such he really had no motive to say I was being truthful when I was not .
He got paid either way .
However , if I were a betting man , I would take the experience , training and skill of Mr. Anderson over Trooper Escalante .
As is anyone 's right , they may feel different .
And finally , how did the fact that I failed a polygraph test make it into my pre-sentence report yet proof I passed one did not ?
Due to the increasing difficulty of finding repair parts and the fact that old Famicom games are making their way to the Wii ’s Virtual Console in their original forms , Nintendo has decided to abandon their repair service program for the aging Famicom effective after this month .
The Famicom game system launched to the Japanese market in 1983 , enjoying phenomenal success worldwide within mere years of its release ( internationally as the Nintendo Entertainment System ) .
Production of the redesigned Famicom continued through October 2003 , but the systems remain available in Japanese stores today .
In addition to the Famicom , Nintendo Co. , Ltd. will end repair services for the Super Famicom , Nintendo 64 , Game Boy , and Game Boy Pocket in Japan .
For those that this might affect , it ’s time to put your old systems into preservation and enjoy those old games on the VC ( and your old GB games on your Famicom - edition GBA SP ) .

HAMAS , the terrorist group that Palestinians last year elected to govern their territories , is failing to govern at all .
March alone saw at least 46 kidnappings of civilians in the Gaza Strip , as well as over 25 killings of Palestinians by fellow Palestinians .
Internecine violence has gotten so bad that one human - rights activist says Gaza “ has become worse than Somalia . ” Yasser Abed Rabbo , an executive - committee member of the rival Palestine Liberation Organization , calls it “ anarchy . ”
The violence is just the tip of the iceberg in “ Hamasistan . ”
Other troubling signs include :
International Exodus : Foreigners who came to help are starting to flee for their lives – even armed foreigners .
One group of Egyptian military officers has reportedly been recalled to Cairo on account of the dangers , with the two generals who remain spending most of their time in Israel , for fear of violence .
The United Nations may even declare Gaza a “ dangerous zone . ”
That would precipitate the evacuation of nearly all foreign nationals .
This would be disastrous for the general population : Nearly two - thirds of Gaza ’s 1.4 million residents claim refugee status , and rely on the U.N. Relief and Works Agency ( UNWRA ) and other aid organizations .
Unsafe Streets : The Palestinian media reports that crimes , including car theft and abductions , are skyrocketing .
Iranian - trained Hamas forces are battling Egyptian - trained Fatah forces , rather than policing the streets .
National Security Adviser Muhammad Dahlan admits that “ many young men prefer to work for clans and not the security forces . ”
Last Sunday , a group calling itself the Islamic Swords of Truth , a self - appointed vice squad , claimed responsibility for bombing the Gaza Bible Society ’s bookstore and two Internet cafes .
In response , Palestinians are taking the law into their own hands .
In March , one of Gaza ’s large clans gathered to blockade a main road in Northern Gaza to protest against the targeting of one of their shops by a vice squad .
The family demanded that the government bring law and order back to the streets .
Dwindling Media Freedom : Last week , security guards broke up a peaceful media protest of the government ’s inability to secure the release of Alan Johnston , the BBC journalist kidnapped more than a month ago – and injured three journalists .
A group calling itself the Tawhid and Jihad Brigades just issued a statement claiming to have executed Johnston .
Foreign journalists now fear for their lives .
Health Risks :
The collapse of a sewage - treatment pool in Umm al - Naser , a North Gaza village , killed three women and two toddlers and injured 25 others in March .
The “ sewage tsunami ” submerged at least 25 homes and caused untold damages to the 3,000 - person village .
Fadel Kawash , head of the Palestinian Water Authority , told the Associated Press that a number of sewage projects , including the one in Umm al - Naser , were halted when Hamas pulled funding after their electoral victory in January 2006 .
Said one U.N. official , “ this has been a tragedy that was predicted and documented . ”
Officials believe that another cesspool collapse is possible , unless prophylactic steps are soon taken .
Provocations : Hamas continues to permit provocations against Israel from Gaza – notably , the homemade Kassam missiles shot into Israel nearly every day .
Yuval Diskin , the chief of Shin Bet , Israel ’s counterintelligence and internal - security service , recently warned that Israel must begin to think about thwarting a more dangerous situation in Gaza , should Hamas develop more dangerous capabilities .
Hamas is tempting Israel into a confrontation , with reckless disregard for the Palestinian population .
Gaza is the most densely populated place on earth ; any military incursion – like Israel ’s response last year to similar Hamas provocations from Lebanon – would inflict utter devastation .
In short , Hamas has not made the transition from terrorist group to government .
It is exposing Gazans to danger without providing key freedoms and services – and seems on track to produce wider internecine violence , deepening poverty and perhaps new rounds of violence with Israel .
In other words , Gaza ’s suffering proves , once again , that terrorist groups , thanks to their utter indifference to human suffering , are unfit to govern .

The English - Likeness Monster
So let ’s revisit the AppleScript bug I wrote about two weeks ago , where System Events returns the wrong folder in response to a path to command asking for a special folder in the user domain .
Here ’s the bug in a nutshell :
set p1 to path to application support folder from user domain -- alias " Tycho HD : Users : gruber : Library : Application Support : " tell application " Finder " set p2 to path to application support folder from user domain -- alias " Tycho HD : Users : gruber : Library : Application Support : " end tell tell application " System Events " set p3 to path to application support folder from user domain -- alias " Tycho HD : Library : Application Support : " end tell
I.e. within a System Events tell block , a path to < some magic folder name > from user domain command will return folders from the local domain ( the root - level Library folder ) instead .
Thanks to dozens of helpful emails from various readers ( and I thank each of you ) , it ’s clear why this is happening : it ’s a good old - fashioned scripting dictionary terminology conflict .
The StandardAdditions OSAX defines a “ path to ” command , which takes an optional “ from ” parameter .
When you use the from parameter , you must choose from the following enumerated constants :
system domain
local domain
network domain
user domain
Classic domain
So , StandardAdditions defines “ user domain ” as a constant , with the four - character Apple Event code ‘ fldu ’ .
The problem is that System Events also defines “ user domain ” , not as a constant , but rather as a property of the System Events application itself .
It uses the same four - character Apple Event code , ‘ fldu ’ .
Bear with me here , because we need a little background on how AppleScript works to truly fathom just how pernicious this particular bug is .
Compiled AppleScripts are not stored as AppleScript source code ; instead , as the name of the format implies , they are stored in a compiled format , which format consists of Apple Event codes .
Scripting dictionaries are the go - between ; they map the English - like syntax of AppleScript to the underlying Apple events :
AppleScript source code ⇄ scripting dictionaries ⇄
Apple events
The translation works both ways .
You type AppleScript syntax , then when you compile the script , it gets translated to Apple events .
When you open a saved script , AppleScript uses the dictionaries to translate the compiled Apple events back into English - like AppleScript source code .
Our problem above is that when we use the StandardAdditions path to command , we also want to use the StandardAdditions user domain enumeration .
However , when we put this statement in a System Events tell block , System Events ’s dictionary gets the first crack at the terms , and because it has its own definition of user domain , that ’s the one AppleScript uses .
Because it uses the same AppleScript syntax and the same underlying Apple Event code , there is no indication to you , the programmer , that AppleScript has resolved user domain to something other than StandardAdditions ’ user domain .
So it compiles successfully , and when it decompiles back into AppleScript source code , the syntax looks correct .
But when it executes , it returns the wrong result .
Workarounds
Daniel Jalkut was the first of several readers to suggest the following workaround :
A stupid , but functional workaround would be to define your own “ user domain ” key outside the scope of the System Events tell .
For instance , if you were going to be doing a bunch of this stuff in a script , you could do something like this : set myUserDomain to user domain tell application " System Events " path to application support from myUserDomain end tell
The idea here is that myUserDomain gives you a reference to StandardAdditions ’ user domain enumeration from within the context of a System Events tell block .
Another workaround suggested by several readers is to use System Events ’s own means of getting references to special folders , rather than StandardAdditions ’ path to command .
For example , to get a reference to the Fonts folder in the user domain :
tell application " System Events " set ff to fonts folder of user domain end tell
But that does n’t return a path or an alias ; instead it returns a System Events folder object .
System Events ’ folder class contains properties for the path ( HFS - style ) and POSIX path , so if what you want is the path ( rather than a folder object ) , you can say something like this :
tell application " System Events " set ff to fonts folder of user domain set posix_path to POSIX path of ff set hfs_path to path of ff end tell
posix_path will be something like “ / Users/ gruber / Library / Fonts ” , and hfs_path will be something like “ Tycho HD : Users : gruber : Library : Fonts : ” .
So , to get the HFS - style path , you can roll this up into a single line :
tell application " System Events " set ff1 to path of fonts folder of user domain end tell
Compare and contrast to the StandardAdditions syntax :
set ff2 to path to fonts folder from user domain
paying particular regard to “ path of ” vs. “ path to ” and “ of user domain ” versus “ from user domain ” .
Interpolation on the Failed Experiment That Is AppleScript ’s English - Like Syntax
This is AppleScript at its worst .
It was a grand and noble idea to create an English - like programming language , one that would seem approachable and unintimidating to the common user .
But in this regard , AppleScript has proven to be a miserable and utter failure .
In English , these two statements ought to be considered synonymous :
path of fonts folder of user domain path to fonts folder from user domain
But in AppleScript , they are not , and rather are brittlely dependent on the current context .
In the global scope , the StandardAdditions OSAX wants “ path to ” and “ from user domain ” ; in a System Events tell block , System Events wants “ path of ” and “ of user domain ” .
The idea was , and I suppose still is , that AppleScript ’s English - like facade frees you from worrying about computer - science -y jargon like classes and objects and properties and commands , and allows you to just say what you mean and have it just work .
But saying what you mean , in English , almost never “ just works ” and compiles successfully as AppleScript , and so to be productive you still have to understand all of the ways that AppleScript actually works .
But this is difficult , because the language syntax is optimized for English - likeness , rather than being optimized for making it clear just what the fuck is actually going on .
This is why Python and JavaScript , two other scripting language of roughly the same vintage as AppleScript , are not only better languages than AppleScript , but are easier than AppleScript , even though neither is very English - like at all .
Python and JavaScript ’s syntaxes are much more abstract than AppleScript ’s , but they are also more obvious .
( Python , in particular , celebrates obviousness . )
In this regard , AppleScript syntax styling in your chosen script editor can provide essential clues .
Here ’s what the above examples look like on my machine in Script Debugger :
The gray words are language keywords , meaning they are part of the AppleScript programming language ; the blue words are application keywords , meaning they are defined by a scripting dictionary .
1
Note that in the first statement , inside the System Events tell block , the “ of ” in “ path of ” is a language keyword .
But in the second statement , the “ to ” in “ path to ” is an application keyword .
Even more confusing is that “ path to ” is preceded by a “ to ” , which “ to ” is a language keyword .
So you ’ve got “ to path to ” , and one of the to ’s is a language keyword , and the other is an application keyword .
How is this possible ?
Because the second “ to ” is not a standalone keyword ; it ’s part of StandardAdditions ’ “ path to ” command , which is a single token that consists of multiple space - separated words .
In most languages , this command would have been called something like “ pathTo ” or “ path_to ” ; but in AppleScript , intra - token spaces are considered a good thing , on the grounds that they greatly increase the resemblence to English .
In practice , however , I believe intra-token spaces are one of the most common underlying causes of AppleScript confusion .
Similarly , note that with the StandardAdditions path to syntax , the “ from ” in “ from user domain ” is an application keyword ; it ’s the name of a parameter defined by the path to command .
Whereas in the System Events syntax , it ’s just another chained “ of ” to access a property of an object .
These prepositional differences are even more exasperating when you consider that “ of ” and “ in ” are interchangeable in AppleScript .
If you can say either of these to mean the same thing within a System Events tell block :
path of fonts folder of user domain path in fonts folder in user domain
and you can say this using StandardAdditions :
path to fonts folder from user domain
then it seems rather natural to assume that the “ to ” and “ from ” might be interchangeable with other prepositions as well .
But you can’t , and if you ’re not aware that StandardAdditions ’s “ path to ” is a single token of two words , it seems rather arbitrary , if not downright random , which prepositions are allowed where .
( The way AppleScript lets you throw in superfluous the ’s and a ’s — “ get the path of the fonts folder ” means the same thing as “ get path of fonts folder ” , and in fact means the same thing as “ get the the the path of the the the fonts folder ” — makes it seems as though AppleScript just does n’t care about “ little words ” , which is true in a handful of cases , but completely untrue in others . )
In a “ normal ” programming language , the equivalent to “ path to fonts folder from user domain ” might be something like :
path_to ( " fonts folder " , " user domain " )
And the equivalent to “ path of fonts folder of user domain ” might be :
user_domain.fonts_folder.path
The point being that in most languages , these two calls do n’t look at all similar .
Which is a good thing , because they are n’t at all similar : one is a global command taking two parameters , the other is a property of a property of an object .
AppleScript ’s slavish devotion to English - likeness , on the other hand , gives us two very different syntax constructs that read , to humans , as though they ’re semantically similar .
One way to disambiguate the two syntaxes in these examples would be to use AppleScript ’s 's ( apostrophe - s ) “ possessive ” operator instead of the “ of ” keyword .
The two statements in the following example are more or less equivalent :
tell application " System Events " set ff1 to path of fonts folder of user domain set ff2 to user domain 's fonts folder 's path end tell
Matt Neuburg , in his wonderful AppleScript : The Definitive Guide , devotes an entire section to what he calls “ The ‘ English - likeness ’ Monster ” ( from which section I ’ve taken the title of this essay ) .
He establishes numerous problems caused by AppleScript ’s attempts to resemble English , and concludes by pointing out that even simple variable assignment in AppleScript suffers :
Then there is the fact that English is verbose .
In most computer languages , you would make a variable x take on the value 4 by saying something like this : x = 4
In AppleScript , you must say something like one of these : copy 4 to x set x to 4 Doubtless not everyone would agree , but I find such expressions tedious to write and hard to read .
In my experience , the human mind and eye are very good at parsing simple symbol - based equations and quasi- mathematical expressions , and I ca n’t help feeling that AppleScript would be much faster to write and easier to read at a glance if it expressed itself in even a slightly more abstract notational style .
Back to the Workarounds
So , back to this :
tell application " System Events " set ff1 to path of fonts folder of user domain end tell
You might be tempted to say , “ Well , there you go — when you ’re inside a System Events tell block , do n’t use the StandardAdditions path to command , use System Events ’ own means of accessing special folders instead . ”
The problem here is that System Events does n’t know about as many special folders as does StandardAdditions .
Or , more specifically , the System Events dictionary does n’t define names for as many special folders as does the StandardAdditions dictionary .
And , unfortunately , one of the folders System Events does n’t know about is the one we ’re interested in , the Application Support folder .
Changing the above reference to the Fonts folder to :
tell application " System Events " set appsup to path of application support folder of user domain end tell
wo n’t even compile .
As of Mac OS X 10.4.2 , here is the full list of special folder properties known to System Events user domain object :
applications folder
desktop pictures folder
Folder Action scripts folder
fonts folder
preferences folder
scripting additions folder
scripts folder
speakable items folder
utilities folder
desktop folder
documents folder
favorites folder
home folder
movies folder
music folder
pictures folder
public folder
sites folder
temporary items folder2
StandardAdditions ’ dictionary defines several dozen more , 3 but even it does n’t include every special Mac OS folder .
The full list , in the form of four - character codes , is available in Apple ’s Carbon developer documentation .
The folder names defined in System Events ’ scripting dictionary are just wrappers around these four - character codes , so , to address one of the folders that the dictionary does n’t define , you can simply use the raw code :
tell application " System Events " set appsup to path of folder id " asup " of user domain end tell
Or , using the 's operator :
tell application " System Events " set appsup to user domain 's folder id " asup " 's path end tell
( You can see here why the 's operator is n’t popular . )
So , at last , we ’ve arrived at a complete workaround , but it requires ( a ) foreknowledge of the underlying user domain terminology conflict ; and ( b ) looking up the Application Support folder ’s four - character code in the Carbon developer documention .
Conclusion and Advice
My advice is not to use scripting addition commands from within application tell blocks if you can avoid it .
Use tell blocks only to group statements directly related to the app that is the target of the tell block .
You ’re better off with multiple tell blocks for the same app interspersed with calls to scripting addition commands than a single tell block that contains calls to scripting additions .
The blame for my complaint here probably lies mostly with System Events , because its dictionary should not define a user domain object that conflicts with StandardAdditions ’ user domain enumeration in such a way that it does n’t produce a compile - or run -time error .
Or , perhaps the blame lies mostly with the AppleScript compiler for allowing this terminology conflict to procede without error .
But I ’ll also point an accusatory finger in the direction of scripting additions in general .
The problem with scripting additions is that they pollute the global namespace with their dictionary syntax .
An application can define whatever crazy terms it wants and it wo n’t adversely affect the rest of your script , because an app ’s terms are only available within tell blocks targeting that app .
( Or within using terms from application blocks . )
AppleScript is actually a tiny language , with extraordinarily few keywords , but the standard scripting additions turn it into a bigger language , ripe for terminology conflicts .
Yesterday I wrote a post about the upcoming Texas Hold ’em match ( July 23 and 24 ) between Polaris , the poker - playing computer programmed by the computer science team at University of Alberta , and two humans , Phil Laak and Ali Eslami .
The post received a question from Sparky about where the name ‘ Polaris ’ comes from .
I could n’t find an answer to this question by searching on the Web , so I decided to go straight to Jonathan Schaeffer and ask him for the answer .
Professor Jonathan Schaeffer holds the Canada Research Chair in Artificial Intelligence and is the team leader of the Polaris program .
He was kind enough to give me an answer to Sparky ’s question .
He writes ,
There is nothing special in the name , other than it reflects that we are the “ northern star ” in the computer poker world .
It is a subtle hint that we are Canadian 🙂
Of course , I could n’t help myself and just ask one question .
I explained to Professor Schaeffer that I am interested in the concept of luck as it applies to Texas Hold ’em , and I asked him whether his Polaris experiment would eliminate all luck as a factor .
And if it did n’t , then in what way did he think that luck would still play a factor in the match ?
Here ’s his answer .
It will eliminate most of the luck factor , but not all of it .
That is why there is a rule in place for a drawn match .
If one side wins by less than 25 small bets ( 500 hand match ) then the match is declared a draw because the result is statistically insignificant .

Steak Recipe : Turning Cheap “ Choice ” Steak into Gucci “ Prime ” Steak
How to Make the Most Tender , Flavorful Steak Recipe
If you are a steak - lover , I hope that the title of this post + luscious photo is enticing enough for you to read though the entire article .
Because I promise you that it ’s worth it .
Even if you do n’t eat steak , this is a must - read … as you can impress the hell outta your carnivorean friends ( and sometimes , when you ’re a vegetarian in a herd of carnivores … it would just be nice to have that extra , “ dude … .
you did n’t know that about steak ???! ” in your pocket . )
My entire family ( including the 2 yr old kid ) just adores any type of steak recipe … you could probably classify us as professional steak - eaters .
In fact , it is my husband ’s life - long quest to hone his grilling technique so that our steaks at home turn out charred crusty on the outside and perfectly medium - rare on the inside .
With grill marks for show , of course .
Seriously , we are too cheap to eat out and would rather cook a nice steak recipe at home .
For the past 4 months , we have been experimenting with how to get full , juicy , beefy flavor of a ribeye with butter - knife tenderness of a filet mignon without feel like getting ripped off buying Prime cuts .
And after 4 months of eating steak 2 x a week , I think we ’ve figured it out .
So , my friends , I am offering you a very juicy secret , one that will turn an ordinary “ Choice ” cut of steak into a gucci “ Prime ” cut ( And yes , I know what “ Choice ” and “ Prime ” means – it ’s the marbling .
The salting does n’t affect fat content – I ’m using those terms as a figure of speech and something people can relate to )
Do you know the joy of buying Choice and eating Prime ?
It ’s like buying a Hyundai and getting a free mail - in rebate for a BMW upgrade !!!
The Steak Secret : salt your steaks 1 hour before cooking for every inch of thickness .
Here ’s two nice pieces of regular ‘ ol supermarket steak .
They ’re about 1.25 inches thick , so I ’ll let them salt for about 1.25 hours .
Season liberally with kosher salt on both sides with kosher or sea salt .
If you are used to using regular table salt , this may look like a ton of salt , but just remember that kosher and sea salt flakes are 2 - 3 x the size of table salt .
And then just let it sit on your counter .
After 15 minutes , it will look like this — you can see how the meat ’s water is starting to come up to the surface — and that some of the salt is still on the surface of the steak .
After 30 minutes , you ’ll see more water :
After almost an hour :
And now 1.25 hours – see all that water ?
You can also see that there ’s still salt on the surface of the steak .
The next step is to discard the water , rinse the steak really well to rid of all the salt .
Pat very dry .
Very very dry with clean paper towels so that absolutely no moisture is left on the steak .
Then it ’s time to cook .
Before y’all throw a hissy fit , just hear me out .
I first learned of this technique from Judy Rodgers ’
The Zuni Cafe Cookbook : A Compendium of Recipes and Cooking Lessons from San Francisco ’s Beloved Restaurant .
Judy massively salts her chicken before roasting , and I ’ve adapted the practice to steaks .
Thanks to a couple of other books ( McGee ’s On Food and Cooking and Alton Brown ’s I ’m Just Here For the Food ) , and a few fellow bloggers , I have an explanation of how it works .
Oh , and if the drawings look like a 3rd grader did it , too bad … .
YOU try drawing with a laptop touch - pad and a glass of bourbon on the rocks .
How Salting Works
All of you who season JUST before grilling – this is what you are really doing to the meat .
Did you know that ?
All the water comes to the surface and if you do n’t pat super - dry , you ’re basically STEAMING the meat .
Plus , your salt just sits on the surface of the steak , leaving the interior tasteless .
Now – note that only a little of the salt gets to go back into the meat .
Do n’t worry – you are n’t going to be eating all that salt !
Bourbon does that to me too .
I can hear it now ..BUT !!!
What of all the water that stayed on the surface of the meat ?
Are n’t you drawing all the moisture out of the meat ?
Will it taste like a salt lick ?
(*%!*%!@#!#!!!
I DON’T UNDERSTAND THIS STEAK RECIPE !!!
Pull your pants back on and keep reading …
Verification on Technique
Cook ’s Illustrated January 08 issue ( and you can also find it on their paid portion of their website .
Just search for “ Improving Cheap Roast Beef ” )
They salt a 4lb roast beef ( big , fat , thick meat ) and they are using 4 tsp kosher salt – therefore their steak recipe recommends salting for 18 - 24 hrs .
It ’s all related : thickness of meat : amount of salt : time .
Salting Steak Recipe Key Points
Use kosher or sea salt , not table salt <– that is important .
It will not work well with tiny tiny grains of table salt .
Plus , table salt tastes like shit .
Use steaks 1 ″ or thicker .
Follow my timetable ( below )
If you are Harold McGee , a member of Alton Brown ’s research team or Mr. Burke my high school chem teacher ….. and think I ’m full of B.S …. please let me know .
But guys , none of this was in your books .
I had to formulate , extrapolate , hypotholate and guesstulate based on your stuff .
Highly mental activity .
I know this sounds awfully like salt - curing , which dries out meat ( like beef jerky ) .
But with salt curing , you use A LOT more salt and leave it salting for A LOOOOOONG time .
We ’re talking about a little tiny nap here – not weeks – just enough to break down the proteins and flavor the steak throughout .
Again , do n’t worry about all that salt .
Just enough of it gets absorbed into the meat .
Most of it gets washed down the drain when you rinse off .
Really .
I know you ’re going to ask …so I ’ll answer it for you .
Why not brine ?
You could if you really want water - logged diluted - tasting crappy steak .
I understand that this method will cause chaos , confusion and controversy in your household .
But I encourage you to experiment : try adding spices , crushed garlic and rosemary sprigs to the salt , which will then act like Christina Aguilera dragging its entourage of flavors with it into the meat .
If confusion in the household becomes unbearable , just whack ’em with the hunk of salted steak ..

The earliest known use of cacao– – the source of our modern day chocolate– –has been pushed back more than 500 years , to somewhere between 1400 and 1100 B.C.E. , thanks to new chemical analyses of residues extracted from pottery excavated at an archaeological site at Puerto Escondido in Honduras .
The new evidence also indicates that , long before the flavor of the cacao seed ( or bean ) became popular , it was the sweet pulp of the chocolate fruit , used in making a fermented ( 5 % alcohol ) beverage , which first drew attention to the plant in the Americas .
That cacao ’s popularity on the world stage began with its role in an alcoholic beverage does not surprise the researchers .
“ This development probably provided the impetus to domesticate the chocolate tree and only later , to prepare a beverage based on the more bitter beans , ” suggested Dr. Patrick McGovern * of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology .
“ An alcoholic beverage from the pulp , carrying on this ancient tradition , continues to be made in parts of Latin America . ”
The famous chocolate beverage of the Mayan and Aztec kings , served at special ceremonies and feasts , came later .
It was made from the cacao beans , often mixed with chillis , special herbs , honey , and flowers .
The liquid was frothed into a foam , and both inhaled and drunk .
Throughout his career , Dr. McGovern has worked on techniques to determine what food and , more often , drink , once filled the ancient pottery and other food vessels that archaeologists find throughout the world — shedding new light on the gastronomic and cultural story of human civilization around the world .
Time and again , he has seen that alcoholic beverages go hand in hand with the earliest development of human cultures .
As with the cacao fruit in Central America , high - sugar fruits and honey were similarly used to produce alcoholic beverages in other parts of the world at an early date , including Neolithic China and the Near East , two regions where Dr. McGovern has played a role in the discovery of the earliest known beverages .**
“ The beverages of China and the Near East also became the prerogative of the elite , and were incorporated into religious ceremonies and celebrations , ” he noted .
“ They were often of considerable economic value , just as the cacao bean was the medium of exchange in the Aztec empire , and they were traded , given in tribute , and offered as gifts to fellow rulers and the gods . ”
Though not part of the archaeological research team at Puerto Escondido in Honduras , Dr. McGovern got involved in the scientific research on this material after he read an article in the Fall 2001 issue of the Arts & Sciences Newsletter of his alma mater , Cornell University .
Entitled “ The Birth of Chocolate or , The Tree of the Food of the Gods , ” it was written by Cornell Anthropology Professor John S. Henderson , co-excavator , with University of California Berkeley Professor Rosemary A. Joyce , at the Honduras site .
Dr. Henderson had graduated in 1967 , a year after McGovern , yet their paths had never crossed .
Dr. McGovern read in the article that Dr. Henderson was looking for a way to extract the ancient residues of a liquid from the pores of the vessels .
“ I sent an email to John , suggesting that our Penn Museum laboratory , where I work with Gretchen Hall , Research Associate , probably had the tools available to find out what the ancient vessels held .
From there , he negotiated to have a collection of sherds from vessels of types believed to have held liquid , and the Penn Museum and Hershey Foods Technical Center labs carried out extractions and analyses . ”
“ The results were astounding – - every vessel that he had chosen and was tested gave a positive signal for theobromine , the fingerprint compound for cacao in Central America . ”
* Archaeochemist Dr. Patrick McGovern , Senior Research Scientist , Museum Applied Science Center for Archaeology ( MASCA ) at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology was one of five authors of the scientific research article on the discovery ( “ Chemical and archaeological evidence for the earliest cacao beverages , ” by John S. Henderson , Rosemary A. Joyce , Gretchen R. Hall , W. Jeffrey Hurst , and Patrick E. McGovern ) to be published on - line in Early Edition the week of Nov. 12 and in the November 27 , 2007 print issue of PNAS USA ( pp. 18937-18940 , Issue 48 , Volume 104 ) .

BAGHDAD , May 8 —
The threat of a walkout by Iraq ’s leading Sunni Arab bloc in Parliament and the Cabinet seemed to subside Tuesday after a meeting between Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki , a Shiite , and Tariq al - Hashimi , the Sunni vice president .
But Iraq ’s violence continued .
A suicide car bomber killed at least 16 people near the main mosque in Kufa that the militant Shiite cleric Moktada al - Sadr has used to deliver Friday prayers .
It was the third car bomb in a month to explode near a revered Shiite shrine in southern Iraq .
The United States military also announced that two soldiers died Tuesday when a roadside bomb struck their vehicle southeast of Baghdad .
Mr. Hashimi — after threatening earlier this week to lead a Sunni boycott unless there was a clear move to change the Iraqi Constitution so that the country could not be partitioned into separate Shiite , Sunni Arab and Kurdish states — seemed eager on Tuesday to signal progress .
His office released a picture of the vice president and prime minister , sitting side by side and smiling , and a statement said the meeting had moved the political process forward .
The twins - a boy and a girl - were born one minute apart
The fertility technique , called in vitro maturation ( IVM ) , could be a good alternative to conventional IVF for some high - risk women , say experts .
Under the process , women do not first need to take potentially risky fertility drugs as they do with IVF .
The technique is also cheaper and faster - but its success rate is lower and it is not available on the NHS .
Doing well
The twins were delivered a minute apart on Thursday 18 October .
The boy was born first , weighing 6lb 11oz , while his sister weighed 5 lb 14oz .
Both were said to be doing well .
Their names have not been released by their parents , who wish to protect their privacy .
Under IVM , the mother gave birth to the twins using her own eggs matured in a laboratory
In January , the Oxford Fertility Centre was awarded the only licence in the UK to offer IVM .
The technique is still relatively new - about 400 IVM babies have been born globally , compared to 2 million IVF babies .
This is good news .
There is always a need for alternative ways of doing things
Dr Richard Fleming , of the British Fertility Society
For standard IVF treatment , a woman needs to take drugs to shut down her ovaries and then undergo two weeks of daily hormone injections so that mature eggs can be retrieved from her ovaries .
With IVM the woman needs only one injection .
The immature eggs are retrieved from a woman 's unstimulated ovaries under ultrasound guidance and then matured in the laboratory for 1 - 2 days .
Some women develop a potentially fatal reaction to the powerful drugs needed for normal cycles of IVF .
With both treatments , once the eggs are fertilised in the lab the resulting embryos are transferred to the woman 's womb .
Tim Child , consultant gynaecologist at the Oxford Fertility Clinic says IVM has clear benefits over IVF for some women , particularly those with polycystic ovarian syndrome .
Not only does it reduce inconvenience and discomfort , it also removes the risk of a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) .
In mild and moderate cases , affecting up to 20 % of women undergoing ovary stimulation , this leads to symptoms such as swelling and breathlessness that resolves .
However , in about 1 % the symptoms can become so severe that they are deadly .
Among women with PCOS , the rate is nearer 5 - 10 % .
Expense
IVM treatment is also shorter and less expensive than IVF .
On the flip - side , the success rates are lower , however .
Mr Child said : " IVF , overall , has a better success rate , but the side effects are higher .
" Patients should have the choice of an alternative .
IVM is safer , simpler , cheaper and more acceptable . "
Some have expressed theoretical concerns that the maturation process could somehow damage the eggs and lead to abnormalities in any resulting babies .
This has not been borne out by the IVM births to date , although experts say they will continue to scrutinise the safety of this new treatment .
Mr Child said the twins , who were born 18 October , were both doing well .
Dr Richard Fleming , of the Glasgow Centre for Reproductive Medicine and the British Fertility Society , said : " This is good news .
There is always a need for alternative ways of doing things . "
He said women should be counselled about the pros and cons of both treatments .
A spokeswoman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said the organisation would be closely tracking the use and outcomes of IVM .

Of Young Stars and Ancient Planets
Since we ’ve just been looking at young stars — protostars , at that — the news from Ann Arbor seems timely .
Astronomers at the University of Michigan are announcing systems around UX Tau A and Lk Ca 15 , young stars each , located about 450 light years away in the Taurus star formation region .
What they ’re actually observing at infrared wavelengths are gaps in the protoplanetary disks around these stars , the assumed result of planets sweeping the area clear of debris .
Unlike the infant star - in - the - making we looked at yesterday , UX Tau A and Lk Ca 15 are old enough — about a million years each — for planetary formation .
Both are still pre-main sequence , deriving their energy from gravitational contraction instead of hydrogen - to - helium burning .
To reach any conclusion about what ’s happening around them , the Michigan team has to rule out photoevaporation , which is what happens when the dust and gas of a protoplanetary cloud heats up , evaporates and begins to dissipate .
Catherine Espaillat rules out photoevaporation as the primary cause for what these Spitzer results have shown :
“ Previously , astronomers were seeing holes at the centers of protoplanetary disks and one of the theories was that the star could be photoevaporating that material .
We found that in some stars , including these two , instead of a hole , there ’s a gap …
It ’s more like a lane has been cleared within the disk .
That is not consistent with photoevaporation .
The existence of planets is the most probable theory that can explain this structure . ”

An abstract is here .
Related : I sometimes ponder , as we look at systems in their infancy , whether some ancient civilization once looked on as our own Solar System formed .
Some theorists , Charles Lineweaver prominent among them , have looked at how far back Earth - like planets might have formed , indicating the possibility of planets like ours fully nine billion years old , with peak planet formation about 1.8 billion years before our Sun came on the scene .
So the possibility is there that we were once under infrared study from a distant world before Sol ’s planets had even formed .
Or maybe not .
A new paper from researchers at Southern Federal University ( Russia ) takes a look at star formation in terms of the appearance of metals , the latter being connected with the formation of planets .
I have n’t worked through the entire paper yet ( and there seem to be some problems in translation , as seen in the following excerpt ) , but as best I can make out , this statement from the paper ’s abstract implies a different take on planetary development than Lineweaver :
Approximately 5 billion years ago average metallicity began to systematically increase , and its dispersion and the average relative magnesium abundance – to decrease .
These properties may be explained by an increase in star formation rate with the simultaneous intensification of the processes of mixing the interstellar medium in the thin disk , provoke possible by interaction the Galaxy with the completely massive by satellite galaxy .
What I take from this is that the Russian team believes that stars like ours may not have been able to form in our area of the galaxy until about the time the Sun first appeared .
Adam Crowl , who passed the reference along to me , points out that this would offer a take on the Fermi Paradox :
They ’re not here because we ’re the first , or at least we ’re early on the scene in a galactic neighborhood that ’s relatively young in terms of living planets .
It will be a while before we have a firmer grasp on just how long ago terrestrial planets might have formed in nearby space .

GADTs are obviously currently a hot topic in functional programming research .
Most of the papers focus only on the GADT mechanism ( how type checking works etc . ) .
The only example that one usually sees is the " typed evaluator " .
I am not an expert on this topic , and I 'd like to know more about how they would actually be useful in practical programming .
For example , I wonder how a parser would look like if it is impossible to construct " wrong " ASTs .
Would type checking then effectively take place during parsing ?
How would a type error in the parsed program be detected and thrown ?
What other interesting applications exist ?
In general , how do GADTs change the programming model ?

Wushan Man : Oldest Human Found in China
Archaeologists have recently found evidence , 2 million year - old human fossils , suggesting that the earliest human species was from Whushan County , Chongging , China .
“ It ’s an exciting discovery because it may rewrite China ’s history , ” said Huang .
A lower jawbone fragment and an incisor , along with some 230 stone tools , was found from a human they are naming “ Wushan Man ” .
This discovery pre-dates the findings of the Yuanmou Man , found in southwestern Yunnan Province , by 300,000 years .
“ Various dating techniques corroborated earlier findings that the geological layer containing the Wushan Man fossils and artifacts is two to 2.04 million years old , ” said Wanbo .

Full text of President Ahmadinejad 's address before UNGA
IRNA - Islamic Republic News Agency
United Nations , New York , Sept 26 , IRNA
UN - Iran-Ahmadinejad-Address
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran addressed the 62nd session of the UN General Assembly here .
Ahmadinejad elaborated on the most important challenges faced by the world today and offered some solutions .
The following is the full text of the president 's address :
In the Name of God , the Compassionate , the Merciful
" Oh God , hasten the arrival of Imam Al - Mahdi and grant him good health and victory and make us his followers and those who attest to his rightfulness "
Mr. President , Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen ,
I am pleased and grateful to the Almighty to have the opportunity once again to attend this important universal forum .
In the present tumultuous world and with the predominance of loud outcries , threats and tensions , and at a time when the big powers are unable to solve present problems , when mistrust in regional and international arenas is on the rise , when the psychological security of societies is being targeted by an onslaught of political and propaganda designs , and disappointment prevails over efficacy of policies and actions of the international organizations in the establishment of a durable peace and security , and the protection of human rights is being weakened , I plan to touch upon and explain the roots of and the ways out of these predicaments and some of the principal challenges facing our world .
I will also speak to you about the need for remedying the present situation , prospects for a brighter and a more hopeful future , and about the appearance of the sublime and beauty , compassion and generosity , justice and blossoming of all the God - given human talents and the prominence of faith in God and realization of the promise of God .
I will then submit to your judgment the nuclear issue of Iran as a reality and testing ground for the measurement of honesty , efficacy , steadfastness and accomplishment .
In the closing part of my statement , I will offer my proposals .
Dear Friends and Colleagues ,
As you are all aware mankind is currently facing important , numerous and diverse challenges and I will refer to some of them .
1. Organized attempts to destroy the institution of family and to weaken the status of women .
Family is the most sacred and valuable human institution that serves as the center of the purest mutual love and affection amongst mothers , fathers and children , and as a safe environment for the nurturing of human generations , and a fertile ground for the blossoming of talents and compassion .
This institution has always been respected by all peoples , religions and cultures .
Today we are witnessing an organized invasion by the enemies of humanity and plunderers to destroy this noble institution that is targeted by promoting lewdness , violence and by breaking the boundaries of chastity and decency .
The precious existence of women as the manifestation of divine beauty and as the peak of kindness , affection and purity has been the target of heavy exploitation in recent decades by the holders of power and the owners of media and wealth .
In some societies , this beloved human has been reduced to a mere instrument of publicity , and all the boundaries and protective shields of chastity , purity and beauty have been trampled .
This is a colossal betrayal of human society , of succeeding generations , and an irreparable blow to the pillar of social coherence , the family .
2. Widespread violations of human rights , terrorism and occupation
Unfortunately human rights are being extensively violated by certain powers , especially by those who pretend to be their exclusive advocates .
Setting up secret prisons , abducting persons , trials and secret punishments without any regard to due process , extensive tapping of telephone conversations , intercepting private mail , and frequent summons to police and security centers have become commonplace and prevalent .
They prosecute scientists and historians for stating their opinions on important global issues .
They use various pretexts to occupy sovereign states and cause insecurity and division , and then use the prevailing situation as an excuse to continue their occupation .
For more than sixty years , Palestine , as compensation for the loss they incurred during the war in Europe , has been under occupation of the illegal Zionist regime .
The Palestinian people have been displaced or are under heavy military pressure , economic siege or are incarcerated under abhorrent conditions .
The occupiers are protected and praised , while the innocent Palestinians are subjected to political , military and propaganda onslaughts .
The people of Palestine are deprived of water , electricity and medicine for the sin of asking for freedom , and the government that was freely elected by the people is targeted .
Terrorists are being organized to attack the lives and property of people with the blessings of the politicians and military officials of the big powers .
The brutal Zionists carry out targeted assassinations of Palestinians in their homes and cities , and terrorists are decorated with medals of peace and receive support from the big powers .
On the other hand they gather a number of Jews from different parts of the world through false propaganda and with the promise of providing them with welfare , jobs and food , and settle them in the occupied territories , exposing them to the harshest restrictions , psychological pressures and constant threats .
They prevent these people from returning to their homelands and by coercion and propaganda induce them to malevolence toward the indigenous Palestinian people .
Iraq was occupied under the pretext of overthrowing a dictator and the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
The Iraqi dictator who had been supported by the same occupiers was disposed of , and no weapons of mass destruction were discovered , but the occupation continues under different excuses .
No day passes without people being killed , wounded or displaced , and the occupiers not only refuse to be accountable and ashamed of their adventure , but speak in a report of a new market for their armaments as the result of their military venture .
They even oppose the constitution , National Assembly and the government established by the vote of the people , while they do not even have the courage to declare their defeat and exit Iraq .
Unfortunately we are witnessing the bitter truth that some powers do not value any nation or human beings , and the only things that matter to them are themselves , their political parties and groups .
In their view , human rights are tantamount to profits for their companies and their friends .
The rights and the dignity of American people are also being sacrificed for the selfish desires of those holding power .
3- Aggressions against indigenous cultures and national values .
Culture is the manifestation of identity and the key to the survival of nations and the foundation for their interaction with others .
In an organized movement , indigenous cultures that are messengers of monotheism , love and fraternity are being subjected to broad and destructive aggressions .
National customs and values are humiliated and the self - esteem and character of nations are ridiculed and defamed .
The purpose is to promote blind emulations , consumerism , skepticism toward God and human values , and the plundering of the peoples ' wealth by big powers .
4. Poverty , illiteracy , healthcare issues and the gap between the poor and the rich
While a major part of the natural environment in Asia , Africa and Latin America is being plundered by the political and economic domination of certain powers , the situation of poverty and deprivation is very alarming .
Let me draw your attention to some data issued by the United Nations :
- Every day close to 800 million people go to bed hungry and about 980 million suffer from absolute poverty , with less than one dollar a day in purchasing power .
- People of 31 countries , equivalent to 9 percent of the world 's population , have an average life expectancy of 46 years , which is 32 years less than the average of developed countries .
- The gap between the rich and the poor in some parts of the world has increased by forty times .
- In many countries , the majority of the people are deprived of access to education and schooling .
- In developing countries , the maternal mortality rate during pregnancy is 450 per 100,000 .
This ratio is 7 in the richer nations and the ratio of mortality of new births is 59 for developing countries and 6 for the richer nations .
- One - third of deaths in the world , or 50,000 persons daily , result from poverty .
I believe this data clearly demonstrates the tragic situation dominating economic interactions in the world .
5 . Ignoring noble values and the promotion of deception and lies .
Some powers sacrifice all human values including honesty , purity and trust for the advancement of their goals .
They propagate skepticism and deception in the relations between states and peoples .
They lie openly , level baseless charges against others , act contrary to legal norms and damage the climate of trust and friendship .
They openly abandon morality and noble values in their relations with others , and substitute selfishness , supremacy , enmity and imposition , for justice , respect for others , love , affection and honesty .
They sacrifice all the good things and the sublime in life for their own greed .
6. Violations of rules of international law and disrespect of commitments
Some who were themselves the drafters of international law openly and easily violate it and apply discriminatory policies and double standards to others .
They drafted disarmament regulations , but every day test and stockpile new generations of lethal weapons .
They framed the Charter of the United Nations , but show disrespect to the right of self - determination and independence of sovereign nations .
They conveniently abrogate their formal treaties , and do not yield to laws concerning protection of the environment .
Most of the violations of international obligations are committed by a few global powers .
7- Escalation of threats and the Arms Race
Some powers , whenever their logic fails , simply use the language of threat .
The huge arms race casts a shadow of threat over the globe .
The nations of Europe were the victims of two world wars and a number of other devastating conflicts and were subjected to the consequences of the Cold War for many decades .
Today Europeans are living under the shadow of threat , and their interests , security and lands are endangered under shadow of the arms race imposed by certain big powers .
A bullying power allows itself the right to set up a missile system , makes the life of the peoples of a continent bitter , and lays the ground for arms race .
Some rulers who superficially appear to be powerful believe the tools they have at hand can be used at any time and for any purpose and consequently threaten others and cast the shadow of insecurity over nations and regions .
8. Inefficacy of international mechanisms in addressing these challenges and in restoring durable peace and security .
International organizations and mechanisms clearly lack the capacity to overcome problems and challenges , to put in place fair and just relations and peace , fraternity and security .
There is hardly any government or nation that places much hope in these mechanisms to secure its rights or defend its independence , territorial integrity and national interests .
Dear Friends and Colleagues ,
There are many more challenges than the ones I have enumerated and I know that one would have introduced more if one had wanted to touch upon them , but I chose to confine myself to the ones I have stated .
Now the important and decisive question concerns the roots and causes of these challenges .
A scientific and careful analysis shows that the root of the present situation lies in two fundamental factors .
Without doubt , the first factor lies in the relations arising from the consequences of the Second World War .
The victors of the war drew the roadmap for global domination and formulated their policies not on the basis of justice but for ensuring the interests of the victors over the vanquished nations .
Therefore mechanisms arising from this approach and related policies have not been capable of finding just solutions for global problems since 60 years ago .
Some big powers still behave like the victors of the World War and regard other states and nations , even those that had nothing to do with the war , as the vanquished , and humiliate other nations and demand extortion from a condescending position similar to that of the master / servant relationship of the medieval ages .
They believe that they should have more rights than others and also are not accountable to any international organization .
Mr. President ,
Among all the inefficient bodies , unfortunately , the UN Security Council ranks first .
They have created circumstances in which some powers with exclusive and the special right to veto in the Security Council act as prosecutor , judge and executioner , regardless of being a defendant or respondent .
It is natural that countries that have been subjected to those powers ' infringements of their rights have no hope in getting what they deserve from the Council .
Unfortunately , humanity has witnessed that in all long wars , like the Korean and Vietnam wars , the war of the Zionists against the Palestinians and against Lebanon , the war of Saddam against the people of Iran and the ethnic wars of Europe and Africa , one of the members the Security Council was one of the belligerents or supported one party against the other , usually the aggressor , or the conflict itself .
Let 's look at Iraq .
They first occupied the country and then received authorization from the Security Council , the same Council in which the same occupiers have the right of veto .
Who should the people of Iraq complain about and to where should they take their complaints with hopes of securing their rights ?
We saw in Lebanon that some powers , for a long thirty three days , prevented the Security Council from taking any action against the Zionist regime with the hope of giving time to the regime to achieve victory .
However , when they became disappointed in seeing their hopes unfulfilled , they decided to cease the hostility by adopting a resolution .
But the duty of the Security Council is to prevent the expansion of conflicts , to put in place ceasefires and to promote peace and safety .
To whom and to what organization should the people of Lebanon complain ?
Excellencies , Ladies and Gentlemen ,
The presence of some monopolistic powers has prevented the Security Council from performing its main duty which is the maintenance of international peace and security based on justice .
The credibility of the Council has been tarnished and its efficacy in defending the rights of UN member states has been undermined .
Many nations have lost their confidence in the Council .
Some other mechanisms , such as the monetary and banking mechanisms , are in the same undesirable situation and have been turned into tools for the imposition of the wishes of some powers on other nations .
It is evident that these mechanisms are not capable of responding to current needs and solving challenges and establishing fair and sustainable relations .
Dear Colleagues ,
Again , there is no doubt that the second and more important factor is some big powers ' disregard of morals , divine values , the teachings of prophets and instructions by the Almighty God , as well as the rule of the incompetent .
How can the incompetent who cannot even manage and control themselves , rule humanity and arrange its affairs ?
Unfortunately they have put themselves in the position of God !
They are in servitude to their own whims , and they desire to have everything for themselves .
For them , human dignity and the lives , properties , and territories of others are no longer respected .
Humanity has had a deep wound on its tired body caused by impious powers for centuries .
Today , the problems that people around the world face are mainly rooted in the disregard of human values and ethics and also in the rule of the selfish and incompetent .
Friends , Ladies and Gentlemen ,
The only sustainable way to the betterment of mankind is the return to the teachings of the divine prophets , monotheism , respect for the dignity of humans and the flow of love and affection in all relationships , ties and regulations , and to reform the present structures on this basis .
To fulfill this objective , I invite everybody to form a front of fraternity , amity and sustainable peace based on monotheism and justice under the name of " Coalition for Peace " , to prevent incursions and arrogance and to promote the culture of affection and justice .
I hereby announce that with the help of all independent , justice - seeking and peace - loving nations , the Islamic Republic of Iran will be heading down this path .
Monotheism , justice and compassion for humans should dominate all the pillars of the UN and this organization should be a forum for justice , and every member should enjoy equal spiritual and legal support .
The General Assembly , as the representative of the international community , shall be considered as the most important pillar of the UN in order to , free from any pressure and threats by big powers , take required measures for the reforming of the UN structures , and especially change the present status of the Security Council and define new structures based on justice and democracy with the purpose of becoming responsive to the present requirements and to be able to settle existing challenges leading to the establishment of an enduring stability and security .
Mr. President , Excellencies ,
The nuclear issue of Iran is a clear example of how such mechanisms perform and the prevailing thoughts behind them .
You are all aware that Iran is a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency and has always observed its rules and regulations and has had the most extensive cooperation with this Agency in all areas .
All our nuclear activities have been completely peaceful and transparent .
According to the Statute of the IAEA , any member has a number of rights and obligations .
In fact , all members have to stay on a peaceful path and , under the supervision of the Agency assist other members , and they are entitled to be supported by the Agency and have access to the fuel cycle with the help of the Agency and its members .
Thus far , Iran has fulfilled all of its obligations but has been deprived of other members ' technical assistance and , even at times , of the Agency 's support .
For about 5 years , some of the aforementioned powers have , by exerting heavy pressure on the IAEA , attempted to prevent the Iranian nation from exercising its rights .
They have derailed Iran 's nuclear issue from its legal tracks , and have politicized the atmosphere to impose their wishes through taking advantage of all their potentials .
The government of Iran spared no effort to build confidence , but they were not satisfied with anything short of the complete halt of all activities , even those related to research and university fields .
They were only after depriving the Iranian people of all their inalienable rights , even to the extent that those centers not involved in the fuel cycle or not in need of supervision by the Agency were closed .
After three years of negotiations and attempts to build confidence , the Iranian nation came to the firm belief that the main concern of these powers is not the possible deviation of Iran 's nuclear activities , but is to prevent its scientific progress under this pretext .
And , if this trend continues there will be no possibility for Iran to enjoy its rights , not even in the next 20 years .
Therefore , Iran decided to pursue the issue through its appropriate legal path , one that runs through the IAEA , and to disregard unlawful and political impositions by the arrogant powers .
In the last two years , abusing the Security Council , the arrogant powers have repeatedly accused Iran and even made military threats and imposed illegal sanctions against it .
However , by the grace of faith in God and national unity , Iran has moved forward step by step and now our country is recognized as one with the capacity for industrial scale fuel cycle production for peaceful uses .
Unfortunately , the Security Council , in dealing with this obvious legal issue , was influenced by some bullying powers and failed to uphold justice and protect the rights of the Iranian people .
Fortunately , the IAEA has recently tried to regain its legal role as supporter of the rights of its members while supervising nuclear activities .
We see this as a correct approach adopted by the Agency .
Previously , they illegally insisted on politicizing the Iranian nation 's nuclear case , but today , because of the resistance of the Iranian nation , the issue is back to the Agency , and I officially announce that in our opinion the nuclear issue of Iran is now closed and has turned into an ordinary Agency matter .
Today many important questions have been raised about the nuclear activities of certain powers within the IAEA which should be dealt with properly .
Of course Iran has always been and will be prepared to have constructive talks with all parties .
I would like to thank all the nations and countries that , during this difficult juncture , defended the legal rights of my nation and motherland and I also want to appreciate the members of the Non- Aligned Movement , our friends in the Security Council and in the IAEA 's Board of Governors , the committed and law - abiding experts of the Agency and its Director - General for their standing by the law .
I would also like to announce that unlike the monopolistic powers , the Iranian nation is ready to offer to other members its experiences in the form of educational programs and based on its obligations under the Agency 's Statute and under its supervision .
Now I would like to address those who have shown hostility towards the Iranian nation for about five years ; offended and accused my people who have contributed to the history and civilization of the world , and I advise them to learn from history and their recent actions .
They badly mistreated the Iranian nation but they should be careful not to inflict the same on other members of international organizations , and not to sacrifice the dignity of international organizations for the sake of their unlawful wishes .
Today the nations of the world are wide awake and resistant .
If you reform yourselves , the whole world will be reformed .
Nations are inherently good and can co-exist peacefully .
They should endeavor to serve their own people ; others that do not need them .
Is it not high time for these powers to return from the path of arrogance and obedience to Satan to the path of faith in God ?
Would they not like to be cleansed of their impurities , submit to the will of God and believe in Him ?
Faith in God means believing in honesty , purity , justice and compassion for others !
They can be certain that they will benefit from purity , honesty , justice , and loving and respecting the human dignity .
They can also be certain that such values are more and more considered appropriate , valuable and beautiful by the nations of the world .
This is the invitation of all the divine prophets from Adam to Noah , Abraham , Moses , Jesus Chris , and Mohammed ( PBUH ) .
If they accept this invitation , they will be saved and if they do n't , the same calamities that befell the people of the distant past will befall them as well .
According to the holy Quran :
" One who does not answer the divine call should not think that he has weakened God on earth ; he has no companion but God and he is clearly engulfed by darkness " .
They have nothing of their own and cannot escape from the dominion of the rule of God and His will .
In this important gathering , I have to remind them of the following words of the Almighty which have been mentioned in the Holy Quran :
" Do they not look at the powers and governments which came before them ?
If the people of the past had actually possessed something , they would have kept it and would not have let you possess it now .
God destroyed them because of their sins and nobody could protect them against the will of God " .
They have to know that thoughts and methods based on oppression and injustice are doomed to failure .
Do they not see the signs of vigilance and resistance based on monotheism , philanthropy and the justice - seeking spirit of the nations of the world ?
Do they not notice that we are nearing the sunset of the time of empires ?
I hope that this invitation will have a practical answer .
Excellencies ,
Peoples and governments are not obliged to obey the injustice of certain powers .
These powers , because of the reasons already mentioned , have lost the competence to lead the world .
I officially declare that the age of relations arising from the Second World War as well as materialistic thoughts based on arrogance and domination is well over now .
Humanity has passed a perilous precipice and the age of monotheism , purity , affinity , respecting others , justice and true peace - loving has commenced .
It is the divine promise that the truth will be victorious and the earth will be inherited by the righteous .
You , who are free , believers , and the people of the world , put your trust in God .
You , who crave high values , wherever you are , try to prepare the grounds for the fulfillment of this great divine promise by serving the people and seeking justice .
The era of darkness will end , prisoners will return home , the occupied lands will be freed , Palestine and Iraq will be liberated from the domination of the occupiers , and the people of America and Europe will be free of the pressures exerted by the Zionists .
The tender - hearted and humanity - loving governments will replace the aggressive and domineering ones .
Human dignity will be regained .
The pleasing aroma of justice will permeate the world , and people will live together in a brotherly and affectionate manner .
Striving in this way to surrender rule to the righteous and Perfect Human , the Promised One , is indeed the final cure for the wounds of humanity , the solution of all problems , and the establishment of love , beauty , justice and a dignified life all over the world .
This belief and endeavor is the key to unity and the constructive interaction among nations , countries , the people of the world and all the true justice - seekers .
Without any doubt , the Promised One who is the ultimate Savior , together with Jesus Christ and other holy Saviors , will come .
In the company of all believers , justice - seekers and benefactors , he will establish a bright future and fill the world with justice and beauty .
This is the promise of God ; therefore it will be fulfilled .
Let 's play a part in the fulfillment of all this glory and beauty .
I wish for a bright future for all human beings and the dawn of the liberation of and freedom for all humans , and the rule of love and affection all around the world , as well as the elimination of oppression , hatred and violence .
A wish which I expect will be realized in the near future .
Thank you
Abstract
We describe a monadic interface to low - level hardware features that is a suitable basis for building operating systems in Haskell .
The interface includes primitives for controlling memory management hardware , user - mode process execution , and low - level device I/O .
The interface enforces memory safety in nearly all circumstances .
Its behavior is specified in part by formal assertions written in a programming logic called P - Logic .
The interface has been implemented on bare IA32 hardware using the Glasgow Haskell Compiler ( GHC ) runtime system .
We show how a variety of simple O/S kernels can be constructed on top of the interface , including a simple separation kernel and a demonstration system in which the kernel , window system , and all device drivers are written in Haskell .
The Copyright Alliance , which counts the MPAA and RIAA amongst its members , has sent letters and questionnaires to presidential candidates in an effort to determine where they stand on issues relating to intellectual property law .
In a copy of the letter seen by Ars , Copyright Alliance executive director Patrick Ross says he speaks " on behalf of the 11 million Americans employed in the creative industries , " and asserts that piracy reduction is essential .
" The future of our creative output in the United States is at stake in the 2008 presidential election , " the letter to the candidates says .
" It is critical not only for members of the creative community but also for the US economy to ensure that copyrights are respected and piracy is reduced .
We are asking you to let us know what you would do to help preserve one of America 's greatest strengths , its creative community . "
A questionnaire attached to the letter is written in a manner that reflects the Copyright Alliance 's agenda and is clearly intended to serve as an instrument of persuasion .
The introduction to the questionnaire states that " the livelihood of the next generation , and America 's global competitiveness , will increasingly depend on the strong copyright protection that allows creativity to be rewarded . "
The questions include calls for stronger laws and stricter enforcement .
" How would you promote the progress of science and creativity , as enumerated in the U.S. Constitution , by upholding and strengthening copyright law and preventing its diminishment ? " one question says .
It is ironic that the content industry invokes the Constitution to support their position .
Copyright law , as laid out in the Constitution , attempts to maximize the potential for creativity and innovation by balancing the rights of content creators and content consumers .
The Constitution established this balance by mandating limited terms for copyrights , and US copyright law recognizes fair use .
Recent changes to copyright law influenced by the content industry — most notably the egregious Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act — have undermined the balance by restricting fair use and expanding the length of copyright protection to preposterous durations .
The steady expansion of copyright law poses a grave risk to creativity and innovation because it threatens to further erode the public domain .
Artistic creation will suffer gravely when the cultural heritage of America can be chained down and held ransom .
Consider Disney , one of the prominent members of the Copyright Alliance and a vocal supporter of copyright extension .
Some of Disney 's most prodigiously creative and profitable animated films are based on folk tales and stories from classical literature that were taken directly from the public domain .
When the public domain shrinks , the potential for modern adaptation of classic works is severely constrained .
In the future , innovative companies that want to bring older content into new mediums will be deterred by excessive and unjustifiable licensing costs as a result of copyright expansion .
" How would you protect the incentive to create by committing sufficient resources to support effective civil and criminal enforcement of copyright laws domestically and internationally ? " another question asks .
The Copyright Alliance 's assumption that criminal enforcement deters piracy is dubious at best .
Litigation and enforcement have done little to stop file sharing .
But investigation and litigation costs a lot of money .
The record labels have already made it clear that the RIAA 's litigious campaign against alleged file - sharers is money - loser .
Now they want the government to " commit resources " to their futile crusade too .
Recent studies indicate that excessively broad copyright laws make virtually all of us infringers ; stronger laws will make that worse .
The language used in the letter and questionnaire is blatantly deceptive and reflects the egregious self interest of Big Content .
One can only hope that the candidate who eventually takes office is sensible enough to cut through the spin and recognize that the greatest threat to creativity and innovation in America is copyright extension , the erosion of fair use , and the abusive behavior of the Big Content industry — not piracy .

This is the most important question to me because of some information Ken found : I do n't know that this whole thing amounts to anything , but thought I 'd add a few notes .

On Tiger , dlopen rejects PE files as expected .
The Wine testing that Steven was originally trying to do would probably not crash on Tiger .
Wine needs a patch to somehow check that a file is actually a Mach - O object file before calling dlopen on it .
There really are PE - loading smarts somewhere within the Mac OS X dynamic loader ( dyld ) .
If you set DYLD_PRINT_SEGMENTS=1 before running Steven 's sample program , you 'll get something like this in the output : dyld : Main executable mapped / private /tmp/a.out __PAGEZERO at 0x00000000 ->0x00001000 __TEXT at 0x00001000 ->0x00002000 __DATA at 0x00002000 ->0x00003000 __IMPORT at 0x00003000 ->0x00004000 __LINKEDIT

Alvaro points out that in the Language Shootout Benchmark Mono comes in 18th place compared to Java 's 10th place .
We know that Sun 's proprietary Java edition ( not the open source one , as that one is nowhere to be found yet ) is faster than Mono , but I was surprised that we were so far behind .
So I looked at the comparison between Java6 and Mono .
Memory usage wise , we mostly come ahead , but in performance , there were two places where Sun 's server VM beat Mono seriously in performance ( 5 x or more ) , one is the regex - dna test and the other one is pidigits test .
The regex test is a test of the regular expression matching engine in the class libraries , not really a test of the language or VM performance , but library implementation .
Clearly , our Regex implementation could use some work .
The pidigits test was showing up as 6 x better with Java than with Mono .
But the test is basically comparing C# vs assembly language .
In Mono 's case it is using a full C# implementation of BigInteger while the Java version uses the C/ assembly language GMP library that has been tuned with hand - coded assembly language .
I ported Java 's pidigits to C# to also use native GMP , and the results are promising , we now have a 4.7 x speedup and the process size is one megabyte smaller .
I was unable to test the Java version on my machine , as I could not find the native " libjgmp " library .
I wonder what the policy is for the language shootout to use external libraries .
If its ok , I should contribute my port , if its not , the Java test should be rewritten to be a fully managed implementation .
If you run all the tests the gap between Java and Mono goes from 8 places , to 3 places ;
If you remove the two bad tests ( Our Regex implementation , and the pidigits test )
Mono is only one slot behind Java server ; and if you also account for memory usage ( but still account for all the tests ) , Mono comes ahead of Java .
Of course , we got homework to do : why is our Regex implementation so much slower ?
Update :
As it turns out , Mario Sopena pointed out that , another 25 % performance improvement can be achieved if the implementations are similar .
The C# sample does a lot more regex work than the Java implementation does .
The Python implementation has further refinements on the algorithm that could improve the performance further .
Some Observations
It is interesting to see in the benchmarks the progression :
Close to the metal languages are the first tier ( C , C++ , D , Pascal , even Eiffel ) .
Compiled functional languages come next ( OCaml , ML , Haskell , Lisp ) .
Java and Mono are on the next tier .
A big jump comes next : Erlang , Smalltalk , MzScheme .
Next big jump : Pike , Perl , Python .
Another jump : PHP , Javascript .
Tcl : a class on its own .
Ruby , last one .
There are a few rarities , like Fortran being in the same tier as Java and Mono , which probably means the tests for Fortran have not been tuned up , I would expect it to be in the same tier as C .
Also , am surprised by Ruby being the last on the list , I expected it to be roughly in the same range as Python , so I suspect that the tests for Ruby have not been tuned either .
Update : my readers also point out that Ruby 1.9 will improve things .
Update : I just noticed that Eiffel is on the first tier , performance wise , but has pretty much all the properties and features of the third tier ( garbage collection , strong typing , bounds checking ) .
This means that you get the best of both world with it ( and Eiffel 's compiler is now also open source ) .
Language Productivity
And of course , at the end of the day , what matters is how productive you are writing code in a language .
The Wikipedia is powered by PHP , Amazon by lots of Perl and C , Google uses Python extensively , and the stellar productivity that can be achieved with Ruby on Rails is hardly matched .
So even if your language is slower than the first few tiers , to many developers and sites deploying software what matters is productivity .
Choosing between Mono's C# and Java , both languages being roughly on the same class , is a function of the libraries that you use , the ecosystem where the code will be developed / deployed and to some extent the language .
Alvaro 's teammates at Sun have a difficult challenge ahead of them when it comes to the language : how to fix a language that has been so badly bruised by their generics implementation , their refusal to acknowledge delegates , the ongoing saga over the catastrophic closure proposals [ 1 ] and the lack of a strong language designer to lead Java into the future .
So even if we have a slow regular expression engine , we have working closures , iterators , events , the lock and using statements in the language and LINQ .
Of course , I wish them the best luck ( in the end , Mono is a language - independent VM , and we are just as happy to run C# code as we are running Java code , which incidentally , just reached another milestone ) and we certainly plan on learning from the open source Java VM source code .
Alternatively , you can use Mainsoft 's Grasshopper to write C# code , but have it run on a Java VM .
[ 1 ]
Am tempted to write a post about the mistakes that both Java closure proposals have .
But it seems like it will be a waste of time , it feels like there is just too much hatred / NIH towards C# in that camp to make any real progress .

Uri Avnery : A bruised reed
Uri Avnery : A bruised reed by Uri Avnery - Gush Shalom
IN THE year 701 BC , the Assyrian king Sennacherib besieged Jerusalem .
The Bible records the words which the Assyrian general , Rabshakeh , addressed to Hezekiah , king of Judah : " Now , behold , thou trusteth upon the staff of this bruised reed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man lean , it will go into his hand and pierce it : so is Pharaoh , king of Egypt , unto all that trust on him . "
The writers of the Bible were so impressed by this phrase that they quoted it twice ( 2 Kings , 18 , 21 and Isaiah 36,6 ) .
One has to understand the historical context : Egypt was then a great power .
For hundreds of years , it had dominated all its neighbors , including the area of present - day Syria , Lebanon and Israel .
The Assyrians , on the other side , were an upstart force .
After conquering the Kingdom of Israel in Samaria , the more important of the two Hebrew kingdoms , they tried to occupy the tiny kingdom of Judah , which relied for its defense on mighty Egypt .
Judah held out .
For unknown reasons , the Assyrians lifted their siege and retreated from Jerusalem .
The kingdom of Judah remained intact for another hundred years - until the Babylonians , who took the place of the Assyrians , conquered it , too .
Egypt could not save it .
By that time , it had indeed become a bruised reed .
THE USA is the modern heir of ancient Egypt .
It is colossal , rich and strong , a cultural , economic and military power .
Pharaoh , king of America , dominates the world as Pharaoh , king of Egypt , once dominated the Semitic region .
And like any dominating empire , it is interested in the existing world order and defends the status quo against all rising forces in the world .
Israel , therefore , considers its special relationship with the United States as the foremost guarantee of its national security .
No occupied territories nor weapon systems can be a substitute for the umbilical cord that connects Jerusalem with Washington - a connection that has no parallel in the present world , and perhaps even in history .
Many have tried - and are still trying - to explain this special relationship , but nobody has yet succeeded in measuring its full extent .
This relationship has an ideological dimension : the two states were created by immigrants from afar who took over a country and dispossessed the indigenous population .
Both believed that they were chosen by God , who had given them the Promised Land .
Both began with a beachhead from which they set off on a historic march that seemed irresistible - the Americans " from sea to shining sea " , the Israelis from the coastal plain to the Jordan .
This relationship has a strategic dimension : Israel serves the essential American need for the domination of Middle East oil , America serves the Israeli government 's endeavor to dominate the country up to the Jordan and overcome the resistance of the local population .
This relationship has a political dimension : the US has immense influence in Jerusalem , and Israel has immense influence in Washington .
This influence is based on the millions of Jews who emigrated to America a hundred years ago , They now constitute a powerful community , admirably organized , with a political - economic impact on all centers of social power .
The combined might of the Jewish - Zionist lobby and the Christian - Evangelical one , which also supports the Israeli Right , is immeasurable .
( There is a story about an Israeli politician , who proposed joining the USA as the 51st state .
" Are you mad ? " his colleagues retorted , " if we were another state , we would have two senators and a few congressmen .
Now we have at least 80 senators and hundreds of congressmen ! " )
Dozens of small countries throughout the world see the way to Washington as passing through Jerusalem .
When they want to curry favor with the US , they first establish close relations with Israel , as if it were a door - keeper who can not be passed without a bribe .
This influence is not unlimited , as some believe .
The Jonathan Pollard affair has shown that all the assembled might of the pro-Israel lobby is not enough to secure a pardon for one minor Israeli spy .
And Israel has just failed to prevent the sale of massive quantities of arms to Saudi Arabia ( though of course it is getting even more aid for free . )
Neither is the influence a one - way street .
When the US gives Israel a direct order , Jerusalem obeys .
For example : when Jerusalem decided to sell China an expensive intelligence airplane , the pride of the Israeli industry , Washington compelled Israel to cancel the deal , causing grievous damage to Israel - China relations .
But in Washington and Jerusalem there is a deeply entrenched belief that the interests of the two countries are so closely connected that they can not be told apart .
What is good for one is good for the other .
These Siamese twins cannot be separated .
NEVERTHLESS , IT is worthwhile , from time to time , to come back to the words of the Assyrian general 2708 years ago .
Great powers arise and fall , nothing stands still .
The 20th century has been called the " American Century " .
At its beginning , the USA was just another country on the margin of the world system .
At its end , after two World Wars which were decided by the rising power of the American giant , it had become the sole world power , the final arbiter of everything .
So much so , that a learned professor fantasized about " the End of History " under American tutelage .
The 21th century will not be another " American Century " .
One can foresee a slow but steady decline in the status of the USA .
Europe is uniting , slowly but surely , and its economic power is growing steadily .
Russia is gradually becoming a great power again , helped by its enormous oil and gas reserves .
And , most importantly : the two population giants , China and India , are rapidly climbing the economic ladder .
Probably , nothing dramatic will happen .
The United States will not collapse suddenly , like the Soviet Union , a giant with feet of clay .
It will not go down in military defeat , like Nazi Germany , whose megalomaniac military ambitions were based on a quite inadequate economic base .
But the relative power of the US is in an inevitable process of gradual descent .
The events in Iraq are a small example .
America did not enter this adventure only to protect Israel , as the two professors , Walt and Mearsheimer , assert in their new book .
Nor because it wanted to rid poor Iraq of a blood - thirsty tyrant .
As we wrote here at the time , it invaded Iraq in order to take hold of the essential oil reserves of the Middle East and station a permanent American garrison in their center .
Now it is sinking , as expected , in a quagmire .
But a country like the US , which was able to absorb a shameful debacle in Vietnam , will also absorb the coming fiasco in Iraq .
The military might of the US , unequalled in the world , is based on its unprecedented economic power .
But many small defeats add up to a big one .
The war has hurt American prestige , self - confidence and moral standing ( Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib ) .
There was a time when the US inspired admiration throughout the world .
Nowadays , opinion polls show that in almost all the important countries the majority hates the US .
The colossal American national debt also does not bode well .
IS IT really good to be tied to the fate of the US for life and death ?
Apart from moral considerations , is it wise to put all our eggs - all of them - in one basket ?
A cynic might say : why not ?
America still dominates the world .
It will continue to do so for quite a while .
If and when it loses control , we shall say goodbye and look for new allies .
That is what we did with the British .
After World War I we helped them to get the Mandate over Palestine , and in return they helped us to establish the Hebrew community here .
In the end , they went away and we stayed .
After that , we helped France , and in return they gave us the nuclear reactor in Dimona .
In the end they went away , and the reactor remained .
This is called " Realpolitik " , the politics of reality .
We shall get from the Americans what we can and then , in a generation or two , we shall see .
Perhaps the US will lose many of its assets .
Perhaps it will stop supporting Israel when a new reality brings about a change in its interests .
I do not believe that our present policy is wise .
Our so - called " realistic " policy sees the reality of today , but not the reality of tomorrow .
And after all , we did not found a state for some limited time , but for generations to come .
We must think about the reality of tomorrow .
Undoubtedly , the world of tomorrow is not going to be uni-polar , all - American , but multi-polar , a world where influence is divided between many centers , such as Washington and Beijing , Moscow and New Delhi , Brussels and Rio de Janeiro .
It would be wise to start preparing today for this world of tomorrow .
IN WHAT way ?
I once likened our situation to that of a gambler at a roulette table , who has an incredible streak of luck .
In front of him , the pile of chips grows and grows .
He could stop at the right moment , change the chips into millions of dollars and live happily ever after .
But he cannot .
The betting fever will not let go .
So he continues even when his fortunes change , with predictable results .
At this moment , we are at the height of our power .
Our connection with the US , which is still all - powerful , gives us a standing much beyond our natural capabilities .
This is the time to change the chips for money , exchange our temporary gains for permanent assets .
To give up the occupied territories and make peace , establish good relations with our neighbors , strike deep roots in the region , so that we will be able to hold on when the will and ability of America to protect us at all costs has evaporated .
That is even more true if we take into consideration the rise of Islamic radicalism , which is a natural reaction to the actions of the American - Israeli axis .
The Israeli -Palestinian conflict is the main cause for this earthquake , which may one day unleash a tsunami .
Both we and the Americans would be well advised to start work soon on removing the causes of this natural phenomenon .
America is far from being a bruised reed - now .
Those who want to , can still lean on this staff for some time to come .
But it would be wise for us to make good use of this time to ensure our existence in peace in the coming world .

Senators vote to hold Bush chief of staff , Rove in contempt
This business with new NIE report on Iran and the revelation of the further astonishing bad faith by Bush and Cheney on little matters such as , oh , war , raises again the issue of impeachment .
If having lied yet again about such matters does n't constitute grounds for impeachment , pray WHAT DOES ?
But the Democrats who control this issue in Congress shake their wise heads , Conyers and Pelosi , and say : Sorry , we just do n't have the votes .
Really ?
Apart from how then will we ever have a chance at an accounting of the radical criminality ( no hyperbole ) of this Administration , I want to point out this :
Pushing impeachment will not just be a vote count session in Congress .
That is a false reductio of the phenomenon .
Starting impeachment hearings will launch a social dynamo that will effect the vote count , I can't see how not .
Start some serious impeachment activity and you will have media and newspapers -- I 'll bet on the NY Times , whose editorial board seems wised up to what 's happening -- calling for impeachment .
You will get masses of folk out in the street everyday , in Washington , in every big and little corner of this country , calling for these usurpers to be evicted from the body politic .
( For starters . )
You light some impeachment fire and watch the flames surge across this country .
Get hundreds of thousands -- millions ?-- of furious people marching .
Then see how the votes start add up then .
Whitney Balliett , the great jazz critic for the New Yorker , had a great line about Big Joe Turner .
He said Big Joe Turner has such a huge voice , all he has to do is open his mouth and get out of the way .
Please open your mouths , Pelosi and Conyers , and get out of the way .
Or else what ?
Hillary or someone comes into office , and we all have bygones be bygones ?
until the next time ?

A diabetes " tattoo " might be just the thing to relieve diabetes sufferers of the constant pain of needle sticks .
Most glucose - monitoring methods require that a blood sample be taken using a needle ; researchers have long sought a non-invasive test method .
Finding a less painful way of monitoring blood sugar could make a real difference to the 6.7 percent of Americans who have diabetes .
Gerard Cote , biomedical engineering professor in the Dwight Look College of Engineering , is testing an experimental system using fluorescent polymer microbeads implanted just under a patient 's skin .
Glucose levels affect how much light the beads emit when exposed to laser light ; the blood glucose level could be measured with a wristwatch - like monitor .
When injected under the skin , the microbeads cannot enter cells - unlike tattooing , in which cells absorb the pigment .
The beads remain in the spaces between the cells ; these interstitial spaces are filled with water and glucose molecules .
According to Dr. Cote , the level of glucose in interstitial fluid is directly related to the blood glucose level measured by the traditional needle - stick method .
The glucose in the fluid binds to the microbeads ; when the beads are illuminated with a small laser , the fluorescent color of the beads changes in proportion to the amount of glucose present .
In preliminary studies , the researchers injected the microbeads under the skin of a laboratory rat , and found that the rat tolerated the implant .
The beads did in fact fluoresce under the rat 's skin ; the fluorescent response changed when there was a change in glucose level in the rat .
Active tattoos can be found in various science - fictional works ; consider the subdermal microchannels from the 1985 cyberpunk classic Stone Lives by Paul Di Filippo :
June 's body is a tracery of lambent lines , like some arcane capillary circuitry in the core of Mao / K'ung Fu- Tzu .
Following the current craze , she has had a subdermal pattern of micro-channels implanted .
The channels are filled with synthetic luciferase , the biochemical responsible for the glow of fireflies .
( Read more about Di Filippo 's Subdermal Microchannels )
A similar idea is used in the novel Nova Swing by M. John Harrison .

On Tuesday 's Hardball , Senator Joe Biden appeared with Chris Matthews and talked about the new NIE report that showed Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
Biden said last week that if the president chose to bypass Congress and invade Iran he would immediately call for his impeachment .
Biden stood behind those comments today , saying they were a warning to President Bush and that he has no constitutional authority to take us to war without congressional approval .
Anyone wishing to give Eric " The Crafty Cockney " Bristow a run for his money at the oche has been offered a mathematical helping hand by a crack team from Aberdeen University , the Daily Telegraph reports .
The group , from the Department of Plant and Soil Science , has demonstrated that while the optimum aiming point for skilled players is the treble - 20 , less fortunate " arrers " aficionados should try and hit the treble - 19 , with those even more cack - handed better off going for the bullseye .
The end result is that " if a player 's aiming skill is not as good as a professional 's , then aiming at the other parts of the dartboard would ensure the mean score will be higher over time " .
First up , the team created " a computer digital dartboard , along with virtual players [ and ] carried out endless simulations of a range of skill levels to figure out the spread of dart impacts " .
They worked on the assumption that " the dart would land randomly within ... a Gaussian probability distribution - or a bell - shaped curve " .
For the aforementioned Crafty Cockney , the bell is " tall and thin , reflecting how the darts would cluster around a narrow spot " .
For mere mortals , the bells flattens as the player 's skill decreases , indicating increasingly widespread impact points .
Naturally , the Aberdeen Uni researchers then needed to prove their theory with some solid time at the coalface , viz : their local boozer the St Machar Bar .
Dr Matthew Aitkenhead , who studies the effects of climate change on soil when not swilling lager in a nylon shirt , explained : " We pinned paper on a darts board and threw darts at it , measuring the distribution . "
Aitkenhead confirmed : " As the player 's performance is decreased there was a slight movement of the optimal target location upwards from the treble - 20 , followed by a large jump towards treble - 19 .
From here , the optimal target location moves upwards and slightly left , before curving round towards the bull . "
The findings make a good deal of sense , we reckon , given that missing the 20 by a narrow , but critical , margin offers the possibility of hitting a one or a five , while bunched around the 19 are three and seven .
Less accurate players should then shift their aiming point left from the 19 where ( going in a clockwise direction ) , the 7 , 16 , 8 , 11 and 14 can be found ( average 11.2 ) .
To the right , are 3 , 17 , 2 , 15 and 10 ( average 9.4 ) .
And if you 're completely inept , aiming at the bull increases your chances of actually hitting the board at all .* ®

We 're quite happy to stand corrected on this .
The ‘ Huckabee Panic ’ revisited
Following up on the extensive discussion over the weekend about the conservative establishment ’s aversion to Mike Huckabee ’s presidential campaign , Andrew Sullivan notes just how far this sentiment goes among leading bloggers on the right .
Ace , for example , who few would consider a moderate , is even willing to vote for Hillary Clinton over the former Arkansas governor .
Not that what one blogger thinks matters that much , but if Huckabee gets the nomination , I ’m voting Democratic .
It ’s not just an idle threat ; I just wo n’t vote for him and in fact wo n’t even vote third party or stay home .
I ’ll vote for the Democratic candidate , even Hillary .
I wo n’t be a party to selling out everything the party is supposed to stand for to a liberal ideology .
If we ’re going to have eight years of liberal rule , I ’d rather the Democratic Party be governing , so at least they can take the blame .
Dan Riehl , another blogger who no one would mistake for a centrist , agrees .
[ If Huckabee ] buys the Republican nod with a smile , a prayer and empty promises , I ’m done .
That Presidential “ R ” in 2008 will stand for nothing I believe in .
The guy is slick but does n’t even look competent .
And if Republican primary voters are that stupid , they deserve to lose next Fall .
To pass over McCain , Thompson , Romney and Giuliani ONLY because someone ’s slick and a Jesus Freak , which makes him your average televangelist — forget it ….
Frankly , I think Huckabee just might be worse than Hillary … .
And Glenn Reynolds conceded today he ’d vote for Edwards over Huckabee .
Basically , I believe that both would have similar socialist / populist programs , but that Republicans would combine against Edwards ’ programs , producing useful gridlock .
On the other hand , Dems would be only too happy to go along with Huckabee ’s programs , and too many Republicans might do so too , out of party loyalty .
There ’s no shortage of possible explanation for this kind of revulsion .
* It ’s the culture : Kevin Drum argued ( and I agree ) that the right ’s opposition to Huckabee stems from the right ’s discomfort for his yahoo - ish qualities .
“ Huckabee , it turns out , is n’t just giving lip service to evangelicals , he actually believes all that stuff .
Among other things , he believes in creationism ( really believes ) , once proposed that AIDS patients should be quarantined , appears to share the traditional evangelical view that Mormonism is a cult , and says ( in public ! ) that homosexuality is sinful ….
I think this brand of yahooism puts off mainstream urban conservatives every bit as much as it does mainstream urban liberals . ”
* It ’s taxes :
The Club for Growth has gone after Huckabee with a vengeance , in large part because he broke GOP Cardinal Rule — he raised taxes , quite a bit , and did n’t apologize for it .
This makes him a liberal , and disqualifies him from being the Republican nominee .
* It ’s foreign policy : Huckabee has humiliated himself , repeatedly , making nonsensical comments about national security , foreign affairs , and military affairs .
As one observer put it , “ Regardless of how [ Bush ] ran in 2000 , hawkishness has become the absolute cornerstone of Bush ’s governing philosophy as far as the conservative elites are concerned .
Huckabee is more or less openly clueless about foreign policy .
That threatens the raison d’etre of war - party cheerleaders like Rich Lowry . ”
* It ’s immigration :
If you ’ve stopped by Malkin ’s site lately , you ’ll see Huckabee ’s liberal immigration policies as governor make him persona non grata in far - right circles .
* It ’s electability : Some conservatives may actually agree with Huckabee on all of the issues , but they ’re terrified of a Democratic landslide in 2008 .
* It ’s all of the above :
The opposition is so broad , one explanation may not be sufficient .
Am I missing anything ?

BBC News , Columbia , South Carolina
Ms Winfrey ( R ) raised $ 3 m for Mr Obama in September
Oprah 's endorsement
One of the biggest - Oprah Winfrey - spoke at a series of rallies this weekend for Democratic hopeful Barack Obama .
But can famous friends really make a difference ?
The first people in line at Williams - Brice Stadium in Columbia , South Carolina , arrived before 0600 .
By midday the queue was 100 m long and several people wide .
It looked to be at least 80 % African - American , probably three - quarters female .
Many had dressed up in their church best , a little hot under their starched collars in temperatures of 70 F plus ( 21C ) .
Inside , local bands were warming up the crowd and it felt more like a rock concert than a political rally .
' Oprah effect '
This may have been an event for Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama , senator for Illinois , but the candidate was sharing the limelight .
Many people had been drawn by the presence of Oprah , not Obama
" I have to say , I 'm here to see Oprah , " a middle - aged African - American woman told me .
Further back in the queue , a younger black woman said : " For me it 's 50 - 50 .
I like Oprah but I also like Obama . "
The man she was with was less hesitant : " For me it 's Oprah .
I 'm interested to hear Obama also .
They might have dragged me out of bed for him , but Oprah got me here willingly . "
Such is the pulling power of the Oprah Winfrey , queen of TV talk shows .
Her weekly audience is estimated at some 50 million and she is reckoned to be the highest - paid entertainer in America .
About 29,000 people came to the Columbia rally - thought to be the largest event for any candidate in this election campaign .
The organisers had to switch to a bigger venue .
That 's the " Oprah Effect " .
Influential women
She was introduced on stage by Barack Obama 's wife , Michelle , as " the first lady of television " , and came on to huge , prolonged , spine - tingling cheers .
Oprah is beloved across the country ... ultimately , though , I 'm going to need to make the sale for people to support me
Barack Obama
And Ms Winfrey did her best to do that for him .
She talked passionately and eloquently about his opposition to the war in Iraq , his concern for the poor and how he had an " ear for eloquence and a tongue dipped in the unvarnished truth " .
On the campaign trail in Iowa the day before , Ms Winfrey had told the crowd : " I 'm not here to tell you what to think , I 'm here to ask you to think . "
At times it felt hard to tell the difference , when her endorsement of him was so comprehensive and resounding .
It is possible , although quite unlikely , that some people may vote for Mr Obama because their favourite TV star , Oprah Winfrey , says she will .
After all , a recent poll suggested she is the second most influential woman in America .
But far more likely is that she will bring more people to hear what Mr Obama has to say .
As he puts it : " Oprah is beloved across the country ... ultimately , though , I 'm going to need to make the sale for people to support me . "
Clinton 's appeal
This may prove especially hard given that the person who topped the poll of America 's most influential women was his main rival for the Democratic nomination : Hillary Clinton .
Hillary Clinton has her own celebrity backers - notably husband Bill
She , too , has her celebrity backers , not least her husband Bill ( during his last term as president the average African - American family 's wage went up by more than white families ' and that is one reason why the Clintons remain hugely popular among black voters ) .
Superstar singer Barbra Streisand has come out in support of her too and , at a recent fundraising event in Washington DC , Mrs Clinton thanked " my friend and one of the really wonderful writers in America today , John Grisham " for introducing her on stage .
But many experts believe few celebrities can compete with the Oprah Effect .
Eleanor Clift , from Newsweek magazine , says : " It 's hard for me to think that Barbra Streisand coming out for Hillary would make that much difference to the vote totals ... [ but ]
Oprah has a proven track record .

Shoes Democracy at Work
Ok , so a friend of mine is one of ten finalists in a worldwide adidas shoe design contest .
He 's currently in second place , and he if wins , he probably gets to design shoes for the rest of his life !
And you really can't beat that .
So you should go vote for his shoes !
Go here , click " finalist gallery " .
His name is Ari , vote for his shoes , because they are the best .
The only problem is that the site is really badly designed .
I had to update my flash player before I saw anything , then I had to turn pop up blockers off .
And then I could n't click on the " submit " link because another link was in the way so I had to press shift tab and enter to submit my vote .
Just make sure it says , " your vote has been submitted " or something like that , or else your vote did n't count .
But it 'll be worth it , when as I am slaving in some drab office environs I can imagine Ari putting magic marker to old school kicks somewhere bright and sunny .

LEDs are already used in dozens of household gadgets
Experts have found a way to make Light Emitting Diodes ( LEDs ) brighter and use less power than energy efficient light bulbs currently on the market .
The technology , used in gadgets such as mobile phones and computers , had previously not been powerful enough to be used for lighting .
But Glasgow University scientists said they had resolved the problem .
The days of the humble light - bulb could soon be over
Dr Faiz Rahman
University of Glasgow
The project , being developed along with the Institute of Photonics at the University of Strathclyde , involves making microscopic holes in the surface of LEDs to increase the level of light they give off .
This is a process known as nano - imprint lithography .
Dr Faiz Rahman , who is leading the project , said : " As yet , LEDs have not been introduced as the standard lighting in homes because the process of making the holes is very time consuming and expensive .
" However , we believe we have found a way of imprinting the holes into billions of LEDs at a far greater speed , but at a much lower cost . "
He added : " This means the days of the humble light - bulb could soon be over . "
Little over a year ago , ethanol was winning the hearts and wallets of both Main Street and Wall Street , with promises of greater U.S. energy independence , fewer greenhouse gases and help for the farm economy .
Today , the corn - based biofuel is under siege .
In the span of one growing season , ethanol has gone from panacea to pariah in the eyes of some .
The critics , which include industries hurt when the price of corn rises , blame ethanol for pushing up food prices , question its environmental bona fides and dispute how much it ...
The United States lags behind most other developed countries when it comes to science education .
That , at least , is one conclusion of a major report released Tuesday by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .
It measures student literacy in science , math , and reading ( focusing this year on science ) among 15 - year - olds , and is an often - cited reference for policymakers sounding the alarm bells about the state of education in the United States and its implications for the ability of Americans to secure jobs in a global economy .
Finland emerged at the top of 57 countries in science , according to the 2006 survey results from the Programme for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) .
The US ranked 29th , behind countries like Croatia , the Czech Republic , and Liechtenstein , and ahead of just nine other OECD countries .
" What once was the gold standard [ for international education ] is now not even at the OECD average , which shows you how much the world has changed , " says Andreas Schleicher , who helped write the report .
The US is average in the number of students at the highest levels of scientific literacy , but has a much larger pool – nearly 1 in 4 – at the bottom , Mr. Schleicher notes .
" We have stand - alone studies that suggest these kids have grim prospects in the labor market , " he says .
That worry has energized education advocates and reformers , who see the test as a useful tool to catalyze public opinion behind the need for fundamental change in how America educates .
" To most policymakers there 's almost a believed connection between how well our kids do in school and how well our economy does in the global economy , " says Marc Tucker , president of the National Center on Education and the Economy .
" To the extent that you have first - class bulletproof studies saying this over and over , it provides some powerful ammunition ... to make the kind of investments in our schools that we really have to make . "
Not everyone sees PISA as bulletproof .
Comparing something as different as educational systems in countries with different cultures and populations is fraught with complexities ; some experts say the rankings are not as straightforward as they might seem .
" People love to cite bad stories , " says Clifford Adelman , an associate with the Institute for Higher Education Policy , noting that after each PISA release , experts tend to bemoan America 's poor showing .
The truth , he says , is more complicated .
The US , for instance , typically has a large proportion of students taking the test in a language other than their native one .
Some countries track lower performing students into vocational schools where they will not be tested .
Other countries are just smaller and more homogenous .
" The question is how you account for that statistically , " says Mr. Adelman .
In these tests , " I 'm comparing [ the US ] a country of 300 - odd million people , a nation of immigrants , that is incredibly diverse with , in the example of Finland , a country of [ just under ] 6 million people . "
Others dismiss such concerns as excuses .
" At the end of the day , that young person is going to have to go compete head to head for a job with someone in another country , " says Bob Wise , president of the Alliance for Excellent Education and former governor of West Virginia .
Rather than focus on America 's relatively low standing , he and others would like to see policymakers learn from other countries that have managed to improve their PISA scores , despite large immigrant populations and socioeconomic challenges .
" The lesson from PISA is that it 's not enough to test ; you have to have the support and strategy to take advantage of what you learn from those tests , " says Mr. Wise .
" Every community is not wired to the world , and every child needs to have an education that looks good not compared to the county next door , but internationally . "
It has been a very , very rough week for the Trump administration as it careens from one spectacular disaster to another , and an even rougher one for the Alt - Right movement that saw it 's most prominent PR flak disintegrate in the space of 48 hours .

On the heels of yet another Mattel Inc. ( MAT ) recall last week , many investors are wondering if shoddy manufacturing and poor quality control will be China ’s undoing .
I do n’t think so .
In fact , I ’m sure of it .
As a longtime China observer , I can tell you that that this is an important signal that China has arrived and is here to stay as a major power player in global markets .
I also believe it ’s truly a silver lining in what appears to be a very cloudy issue at the moment .
Let me explain …
A ‘ War ’ Declared
On the heels of some very embarrassing product - safety and product - quality recalls , China has “ declared war ” on product quality .
This sounds dramatic , and it is .
To understand just how significant this is requires a quick and admittedly simplistic lesson in Asian culture .
In Asian countries such as Japan and China , public embarrassment – referred to as “ losing face ” – is something to be avoided at all costs .
It does n’t matter whether we ’re talking about a person , or a group :
Having to publicly admit that you ’ve erred – “ losing face ” – is complete and total humiliation .
So when a person , a government department , or the central administration concedes that errors have been made and that it ’s “ declared war ” on these humiliating product - quality problems underscores just how committed China ’s government is to fixing this .
Indeed , a public commitment like this is typically reserved for politically motivated messages or some other agenda item that the Chinese politburo wants worked into “ the system ” at all costs .
As you can see , then , this is about as serious a response as China can issue on any matter ; and it ’s especially telling that they ’ve chosen this wording when it comes to product quality and safety .
Why do I say this ?
If Western consumers are permitted to even think that that the phrase “ Made in China ” is some kind of joke ( remember “ Made in Tijuana ” back in the late 60s ? ) , a cause for concern , or Consumer Reports code for “ avoid this product at all costs , ” then the entire Chinese juggernaut would come summarily to a screeching halt – which is the absolute last thing that the world economy needs right now .
Not only would this be bad for workers and consumers all over the world who have come to depend on low - cost Chinese products – in some markets , workers actually owe their entire livelihoods to an economically healthy China – it would prove devastating to China , itself , and just as that country stands at the cusp of the greatest stretch of national wealth creation of any in mankind ’s history .
Ideally , the big economic battlewagon , the S.S. China , could single - handedly steam through the subprime - slime blockage , dragging the rest of the world economy along with it .
But a successful blockage – especially one that launches a fusillade of negative - perception salvos – would be devastating , and would essentially enable the subprime - mortgage and credit - crunch assault teams to counterattack , steam right back through our meager central - bank - reinforced financial defenses , and establish a beachhead in our economy that will made D - Day look like an Annette Funicello / Frankie Avalon beach movie .
Needless to say , this would be bad for consumers all over the world who have come to depend on low - cost Chinese products .
It would be even worse for workers with a stake in China ’s ongoing transformation into a semi-capitalist market .
And the short - circuiting of this evolution would be especially devastating to China , which stands at the cusp of the greatest period of wealth - creation in mankind ’s history .
Therefore , China ’s leaders are pulling out all the stops to preserve – indeed , to bulk up – the cachet of the “ Made in China ” brand , and to protect their nation ’s economy .
In doing so , they hope to motivate Chinese companies to take product quality more seriously realizing full well that if they do n’t , global consumers will .
To do that , China ’s leaders have pledged more than $ 1 billion to create product safety - and - inspection programs .
They ’ve also taken the highly unusual step of creating a cabinet - level position for product safety and health .
At its head is a woman by the name of Wu Yi who ’s known as “ China ’s Iron Lady . ”
She ’s viewed as China ’s top troubleshooter and is regarded as somebody you do n’t want mess with or cross in any way .
Vice Premier
Yi has been given broad , sweeping mandates to get the situation under control and the power to implement practically any policy changes she wants .
Which is exactly what she ’s done with a highly innovative 20 - point program for manufacturers and vendors that specifies everything from registration requirements , to product - tracking and mandatory inspections – and it must all be completed by the end of 2008 .
But it does n’t stop there .
The program also includes a zero tolerance policy for government officials – and this is the interesting part – who fail to do their jobs by providing adequate oversight as part of the program .
You might think this is just a bunch of smoke and 10 years ago I would have agreed you .
But times have changed .
Madam
Yi’s programs already are producing results .
She ’s seen to it that legions of inspectors are crawling all over farms , groceries and manufacturing facilities in effort to stem the global glow of everything from fertilize - tainted medication to counterfeit toothpaste to fake Viagra .
China ’s regulators say they ’ve nailed dozens of unlicensed pharmaceutical makers , toy producers and even criminal networks involved in shoddy manufacturing and exports .
As a result , over 400 exporters have been summarily blacklisted and a former food - and - drug safety chief has been executed for taking bribes .
And those are just the things that we know about .
As we explained earlier , to keep from “ losing face , ” China is notoriously secretive when it comes to its own dirty laundry , so I wo n’t be the least bit surprised when the news finally breaks about just how many people have been prosecuted for attempting to skirt the regulations by using their “ guanxi ” – the Chinese world that translates roughly to “ connections . ”
In their attempt to really deal with the issue head on , China is also attacking the problem through innovative public awareness campaigns aimed at China ’s average citizens .
There ’s a special television series called “ Believe in Made In China ” currently being aired that features interviews with business executives and regulators .
They ’ve even gone so far as to attack the problem through taxation .
Earlier this summer , for instance , China implemented a VAT reduction on 2,831 export lines representing some 37 % of China ’s total exports .
This has the net effect of squeezing shoddy , labor - intensive companies for who VAT loopholes were not just a tax break , but are often also the entire profit .
They ’ve also required importers to pay a 50 % deposit on 1,853 raw materials , including metals , textiles and plastics that are used for base - level assembly before being exported as finished products .
In a stroke of brilliance that would do any grandstanding politician in this country proud , the deposits are refunded upon export .
But the net effect is , once again , to attack the weaker , more - reckless companies through a cash squeeze that they basically can’t meet .
And this is where it gets really interesting when it comes to your money .
China ’s Product Push and Your Portfolio
No one action – in isolation – is particularly noteworthy , especially when compared with similar Western business systems .
But when viewed in the aggregate , and backed up by high - level action , China ’s response to the growing international product - quality concerns is unprecedented for several reasons :
First , China is trying nip in the bud any notion that they ’ve fouled up .
While the country and its leaders are a little late on that score , rather than hiding behind lawyers as companies here in the United States are wont to do , China has stepped up and admitted it has made mistakes .
This is highly unusual in a country where “ losing face ” is a major deal , and especially because China perceives that it must answer to the court of international opinion on this issue .

Second , by ordering and crafting such a broad - based and intense response , Chinese officials are clearly trying to force China higher in the international value chain without slowing export growth and without negatively impacting product quality .
Not only will this help eliminate future product - quality and product - safety concerns – in a perverse , Darwin - like evolution – it unquestionably make the surviving companies even stronger than they are today .
The trick , of course , is forecasting which countries will survive and aligning your money accordingly .

The trick , of course , is forecasting which countries will survive and aligning your money accordingly .
Third , China is trying to get companies to abandon their instinctive strategy of always offering the lowest - possible prices to attract buyers .
While that sounds harsh , it ’s really not especially when you consider that Japan , Singapore , Taiwan and other Pacific - Rim countries have all walked the same path within the last 100 years .
This will cause companies to tighten up on their production methods and , among other things , eliminate waste which is presently estimated to cannibalize as much as 40 % of the bottom line .
The bottom line : Chinese companies that service the product quality purge will likely emerge more efficient , more profitable and more competitive on a global basis than they had been before this controversy broke .
This will generate top - line and bottom - line growth .

This will generate top - line and bottom - line growth .
And finally , by virtue of this experience , China ’s officials and company executives and a growing number of executives at last understand that they must step into the global arena before other global companies lock them out of it – which means that they are going to become even more aggressive in the near future than they have been recently .
I hope Western companies and investors are prepared for this powerful transformation , because even if the “ made in China ” label if of questionable quality right now , it wo n’t be in the future .
And if China ’s stocks get hurt as this saga continues to unfold , view it as a buying opportunity .
You ’ll be glad that you did .
Jon Stewart sits down with Bush book author Goldsmith to discuss new terror memo Nick Langewis and Mike Aivaz

Print This Email This Jack Goldsmith , 2003 - 2004 head of the Office of Legal Counsel , sits down with The Daily Show 's Jon Stewart to discuss his new book , The Terror Presidency : Law And Judgment Inside the Bush Administration , which outlines the Bush Administration 's continued push for unchecked executive power in the " War on Terror . "
" It 's so hard to get any kind of insider perspective on the stresses going on inside the administration , " says Stewart .
" You worked with Alberto Gonzales , and David Addington , and John Yu , and these lawyers that we all have heard about , and ... demonized for so long .
To see them as people , though ; it 's somewhat illuminating , and I think -- changes your mind a little bit . "
" I tried to paint as fair a picture I could of the pressures everyone was under , " responds Goldsmith .
" They 're not evil people ; they were people trying to do their best .
They -- we all made mistakes of judgment ... but they were trying their best , even though they made mistakes . "
The figures working to prevent the next terror attack , says Goldsmith , are fearful of that next terror attack , along with the accompanying personal consequences , to the point where their zeal for pushing policies within the government can meet one particular hurdle .
Deadpans Goldsmith : " On the other hand , of course , there 's the law . "
" Criminal laws , " he continues , to laughter from Stewart and the audience , " which they 're afraid of . "
" In your mind , they 're trying to allow the President as much leeway as he can possibly get , " interprets Stewart , " -- ' we want to clear as many obstacles as we can away from you , while not also putting ourselves in jeopardy of being sent to these prisons we 're helping you create . ' "
" That was the basic attitude , yes , " affirms Goldsmith .
In a small office consisting of 22 lawyers , there was continuous conflict between the Department of Justice and the Bush cabinet .
While the cabinet did n't always push back , Goldsmith says they were the most combative when questioned about their surveillance intentions , which was part of what prompted him to resign his post .
" They ended up agreeing with us eventually , " says Goldsmith .
" There was a certain visit to the hospital , " referring to a last - ditch effort , per testimony from Deputy Attorney General James Comey , made by then - counsel Alberto Gonzales on the evening of March 10 , 2004 , to compel former Attorney General John Ashcroft to reauthorize a secret wiretapping program while recovering from surgery in his hospital room , to override the Justice Department 's judgment .
" A lot of us , " says Goldsmith , were prompted to leave the Justice Department at that time .
" I think that they could have achieved almost everything they wanted to do in terms of empowering the President by working with the other institutions of government , either the FISA court or the Congress .
And a lot of what they did was driven by their conception of executive power ; of trying to preserve executive power ; of therefore not wanting to go to Congress , for example -- they might put constraints on executive power ... "
" As I argue in the book , I think it 's ended up weakening the executive power ... we 're certainly much more mistrustful of executive power now . "
" Do you think , " asks Stewart , " the ultimate irony might be that all the work that Dick Cheney has done will make Hillary Clinton the most powerful president in the history of the United States ? "
" Do n't worry , " quips John .
" That scares me , too . "

Jesus Family Tomb
By Frank K. Flinn
On March 04 , 2007 , the Discovery Channel will air a program “ The Lost Tomb of Jesus ” made by Simcha Jocobivici and James Cameron , the maker of the film “ Titanic . ”
A companion volume of the same name by Jocobivici and Dr. Charles Pellegrino has just been released by HarperCollins
In 1980 Israeli archeologists Shimon Gibson , Yosef Gat Amos Kloner examined a tomb in the Talpiyot district of Jerusalem where construction for new housing was underway .
Archeologists have noted some 900 such tomb sites in this area of Jerusalem .
Upon entering the tomb , the archeologists discovered ten ossuaries in six niches and three skulls on the floor of the main room .
In 1st century Palestine it was customary to bury a person of some means wrapped in linen and spices , let the flesh decay , and then , a year or more later , place the bones in a stone ossuary , which literally means “ bone - box . ”
After this hasty excavation the bones were buried by Orthodox rabbis following Jewish ritual law .
Fragments of the bones , however , remained in the boxes that were not washed out .
The ossuaries were then stored in a warehouse of the Israeli Antiquities Authority .
Meanwhile in 2002 another inscribed ossuary appeared on the antiquities market in Jersusalem .
Oded Golan , a Tel Aviv engineer , claimed he bought the box from Arab dealers and had not noted the Aramaic inscription on the side : “ Yaakob bar Yosef ahiw de Yeshua ” ( “ James , son of Joseph , the brother of Jesus ” ) .
The reaction in the scholarly world was explosive .
Inscriptionist André Lemaire of the Sorbonne said that the box could well have belonged to James the Apostle .
After much argument back and forth , scholars at the Geological Survey of Israel , while not tying the inscription to Jesus ’ family , concluded that the script fits the time period between 20 - 70 CE and that the patina throughout shows no later marks of forgery .
New Testament scholar James Tabor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has argued that this ossuary came from what he calls the Talpiyot “ Jesus Family Dynasty Tomb ” in his controversial book “ The Jesus Dynasty ” ( 2006 ) .
As noted above , six of the Talpiyot boxes have side inscriptions .
There is some argument about the preservation and interpretation of the scripts , but Tabor , Simcha Jocobivici and James Cameron , the makers of the film “ The Lost Tomb of Jesus ” ( to be shown on Discovery Channel March 04 , 2007 ) , say the box inscriptions should be read as follows :
1. Yeshua bar Yehosef – ‘ Jesus son of Joseph ’ ( speaks for itself )
2. Maria – the Latin for the normal ‘ Miriam ’ or Mary ( mother or sister of Jesus ? )
3 . Yose – alternate form of ‘ Joseph ’ ( Matthew 13:54 lists 4 brothers of Jesus — James , Joses , Simon , Judas — and unnamed and unnumbered sisters )
4. Yehuda bar Yeshua — ’ Judah son of Jesus ’ ( some claim this refers to Jesus of Nazareth ’s son )
5. Mariamne e mara — ’ Miriamne the master ’ ( some say Mary of Magdala ’s real name was Miriamne ; mara is the same term as Maranatha “ Come , oh Lord [ mara ] ” in 1 Corinthians 16:22 )
6. Matya —’ Matthew ’ or ‘ Matthias ’ ( possibly a husband of one of the women in an unmarked ossuary )
Mitochondrial DNA tests on the bone fragments in the Yeshua and Miriamne ossuaries show that they were not related .
Shortly after the initial discovery and the 1990 ’s one of the original ten ossuaries went missing .
Tabor and others are claiming that this is the much disputed James ossuary .
One of the chief arguments posed by Kloner and others that this set of names cannot be identified with the family of Jesus is that all of the names were common as water in the 1^st century .
That is true , but Tabor and the filmmakers have elicited the support of statisticians to argue the likelihood that this set of names would match the names in the New Testament is extremely small .
Tabor illustrates by saying that the approximate population of Jerusalem at the time of Jesus was 50,000 .
If you could get all into the local hippodrome , and started asking , would all those whose name is Jesus please stand , 2,796 would rise .
Then if you asked , would all those who father is also named Joseph remain standing , 351 would be left .
If you ask all those also who mother ’s name is Mary , 173 would remain .
Add the brother ’s name Jose , and only 23 would be left .
Add the name James , and you are down to one .
University of Toronto mathematician Andrey Feuerverger calculated that the odds that the tomb does not belong to the Jesus of the Gospels is 1/600 .
Tabor ’s mathematician gives the startling odds that out of 42,723,672 families , the Talpiyot combination of names would occur only once .
The general public needs to be a little wary of statistical calculations .
They never give you the absolute truth but only an approximation of the truth .
And Tabor is quick to admit that many of the associations in his book are “ speculative . ”
Still , it is important to point out that these numbers do not depend so much on the frequency of a particular name but on the occurrence of the / cluster / of names , and here the numbers are telling .
The Talpiyot tomb findings are a serious challenge to traditional Christian denominations .
Catholics have held as a matter of doctrine that Mary was a virgin when she conceived and that she remained a virgin .
The phase “ brothers and sisters , ” they argue must be taken in a “ wide ” sense of “ friends and followers . ”
Many traditional Protestants beg to differ with Catholics on this score .
Most claim that Jesus was never married , but scholars of 1st century Judaism now argue that one had to be married to preach in the synagogue , and that is something Jesus did on many occasions ( Luke 4:16 ) .
The single implication of the Talpiyot findings that strikes traditional Christianity at its root is that , if indeed this is Jesus of Nazareth ’s ossuary and bone fragments , then Jesus was not raised from the dead .
As Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 : 13 - 14 : “ But if there is no resurrection of the dead , not even Christ has been raised ; and if Christ has not been raised , then our preaching is vain , your faith also is vain . ”
Is there no way out of the dilemma for the believing Christian ?
Do Christians , if they accept these harsh historical facts , have to give up all belief in resurrection .
I believe they do not .
In the Epistle to the Romans Chapter 4 , where Paul talks about the physical condition of Abraham and Sarah , he does not say that they were infertile or barren , as many translations have it , but that they were “ dead ” in the womb and the loins .
When Isaac was born , they experienced a resurrection of the flesh in the most literal sense of the term .
Likewise , when the Prodigal Son returned to his grieving father , the father said to his resentful brother , “ For this your brother was dead , and is alive ; he was lost , and is found . ”
I call this the resurrection of everydayness .
The philosopher Hegel spoke of the “ divine Man ” whose particular death is transfigured into “ the universality of the Spirit who dwells in His community , dies in it every day , and daily is resurrected . ”
This sense of living “ resurrectionally ” seems to have escaped many segments of Christianity .
The recent discoveries about 1st century Palestinian Judaism have forced many Christians to rediscover the Teaching of Jesus rather than to place all emphasis on the later teaching about Jesus .
Many devout Christians are speaking up loudly saying the Talpiyot Tomb story is another hoax , like “ The Da Vinci Code . ”
To them I give a word of caution : Dan Brown wrote fiction that had everso fragile filaments to the truth , but ossuaries are ossuaries , names are names and bones are bones .
I choose to remain interested but joyfully skeptical about all the new discoveries .
The TaxProf blog , which gets its second salute from the Law Blog today , tackled an interesting question : Whether Bill Belichick ( pictured ) , head coach of the New England Patriots , can deduct the $ 500,000 fine -- the biggest ever for an NFL coach -- he received after violating league rules by videotaping defensive signals from New York Jets coaches in the Pats ' regular - season opener earlier this month .
( The team was fined $ 250,000 . )
The answer : Yes .
The blog excerpted an email discussion by 12 tax law professors who , after 10,000 words on the matter , including testy exchanges over the interpretation of some old tax cases , mostly agreed that the fine is deductible under section 162 of the internal revenue code , " trade or business expenses . "
Wrote Myron Grauer of Capital University Law School : " Because , unfortunately , in this day and age , it probably is ' ordinary ' for coaches and players in professional sports to cheat and , if caught , to be fined by the league , the fine levied on the Patriots ' coach can be viewed as an ordinary and necessary business expense .... "
After some profs raised questions about whether being fined for " cheating " was an ordinary expense , Mike McIntyre of Wayne State University slammed the tax law hammer to end the discussion .
" [ T ] he fine was for violating a rule , not for cheating .
The Patriots were not accused of cheating by the Commissioner and were not fined for cheating .... No professional football game is played without someone breaking the rules .
It is expected that people will break the rules , " McIntyre wrote .
Another security study making the rounds today in which someone who purports to know a lot about analyzing security — whose blog tagline , in fact , cautions that “ we should try not to simplify [ security ] to the point of uselessness ” — has decided that a product becomes less secure when the developer fixes and discloses vulnerabilities that they find in - house .
What Jeff Jones , a director of Security Strategy at Microsoft , has done is simply counted the number of fixed vulnerabilities reported by each of Microsoft and Mozilla , grouping by labelled severity .
What could be simpler ?
Perhaps nothing .
What could be more useless ?
Again , perhaps nothing .
You can only count what the vendor wants you to see
If Mozilla wanted to do better than Microsoft on this report , we would have an easy path : stop fixing and disclosing bugs that we find in - house .
It is well known that Microsoft redacts release notes for service packs and bundles fixes , sometimes meaning that you get a single vulnerability “ counted ” for , say , seven defects repaired .
Or maybe you do n’t hear about it at all , because it was rolled into SP2 and they did n’t make any noise about it .
We count every defect distinctly .
We count the ones that Mozilla developers find in - house .
We count the things we do to mitigate defects in other pieces of software , including Windows itself and other third - party plugins .
We count memory behaviour that we think might be exploitable , even if no exploit has ever been demonstrated and the issue in question was found in - house .
We open our bugs up after we ’ve shipped fixes , so that people do n’t have to take our word for our severity ratings .
While Microsoft ’s senior technical staff are trying to get severity ratings dialed down ( unsuccessfully ; kudos to MSRC for sticking to their guns ) , we are consistently rounding our severities up when there ’s any doubt at all .
More fixes means less security ?
Even if the scales were the same , and we were living in a parallel universe in which Microsoft even approached Mozilla ’s standards of transparency and disclosure , the logic is just baffling : Jeff is saying that Mozilla ’s products are less secure than Microsoft ’s because Mozilla fixed more bugs .
By that measure , IE4 is even more secure , because there were no security bugs fixed in that time frame ; bravo to Microsoft for that !
I use Microsoft ’s software products myself ; I ’m typing this on a machine that ’s running Vista , in fact .
Not only am I pretty upset that we see Microsoft referencing this report without disclosing that it was written by a Microsoft director of Security Strategy , but I ’m also concerned for my own safety .
Do people in charge of security strategy at Microsoft really believe that aggressively concealing the count of fixes that do make it out makes a product more secure ?
Should n’t they be trying to fix more bugs , rather than writing reports that would “ punish ” them for actively improving the security of their users rather than hoping that defects are n’t found by someone who they can’t keep quiet ?
Microsoft should be embarrassed to be associated with this sort of ridiculous “ analysis ” .
We do n’t pretend that hiding the rate of fixes improves our users ’ security in any way , and we never will .
We ’re transparent and aggressive in dealing with security issues , and 130 million Firefox users are safer for it every day .
WICHITA , Kansas ( CNN ) --
On a beautiful , crisp late fall afternoon , rock icon Neil Young took his 1959 Lincoln Continental for one last spin before a team of mechanics ripped out its gas - guzzling engine to make way for an electric motor .
Neil Young watches as mechanics remove the engine from his 1959 Lincoln Continental .
Car buffs may think it 's sacrilege to tear apart an automotive classic , but Young wants it to have a new life as a fuel - efficient hybrid .
" If we 're going to make a difference , truly make cars more environmentally friendly , " Young said , " we have to make that emotional connection . "
Young said everyone has a connection with an old car like the Lincoln .
It only took about an hour for Johnathan Goodwin and his four - man team to pry the engine out of Young 's Lincoln .
He 'll have the new engine installed in 45 days .
Watch Goodwin show off a biodesel hotrod »
Talking about the old motor , Goodwin says , " Of course , it 's not fuel efficient at all .
It 's a big polluter , one of the biggest rawest forms . "
The Lincoln 's new electric engine will power the car and when it begins to lose juice , Young will simply flip a switch and the car will run on biodiesel fuel until the electric motor is recharged .
" A 19 - foot - long car , the longest car ever made at its time .
Two and half tons , the heaviest car at its time , " Young said , " And it can get 100 miles to the gallon , not 10 miles to the gallon . "
Young renamed his car Linc - Volt , and is making a movie about the transformation , which he hopes to release next year .
Goodwin is making a name for himself -- and his company , H - Line Conversions -- by turning gas - guzzling behemoths like Hummers , Cadillac Escalades , Jeeps and other big American cars into clean - power machines .
The first thing he does is remove the old inefficient engine -- even if it's a brand new vehicle -- and replace it with a diesel engine that can run on biodiesel .
" It 's the transformation of what I call old technology to new technology , " Goodwin says .
Here 's his analogy : Remember 15 or so years ago when a cellular phone was the size of a brick .
Now it 's a lot smaller , because the industry underwent a ton of changes over the years .
The same kinds of advances are made in engines .
But since it 's so expensive , changes to cars are made in leaps , not tiny steps .
What 's the drawback of his method ?
You guessed it .
Cost .
" It 's not cost - effective for someone to run out and spend $ 40,000 to double the fuel economy , but I have no shortage of customers , " Goodwin says .
Including California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who 's having his Wagoneer converted to biodiesel .
Goodwin , 37 , drives a 1987 gas burning Wagoneer , rents his home and will sheepishly tell you he did n't graduate from high school .
Expect to hear a lot more about Goodwin in the future .
Companies are knocking down the door to work on projects with him .
Goodwin's developing a download that can be installed in a car 's computer and improve the mileage by five to seven mpg without losing performance .
He expects it to cost about $ 200 .
Ask Goodwin what his favorite project is , and he answers , " the next one " but the Linc - Volt project has been special .
" We 're going to prove you can have your cake and eat it too so to speak , " Goodwin proudly boasts .

Summit called to address racial disparities in academic performance
State schools chief Jack O'Connell State schools chief Jack O'Connell Photo : Rich Pedroncelli , AP Photo : Rich Pedroncelli , AP Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Summit called to address racial disparities in academic performance 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Every time state schools chief Jack O'Connell thought he was doing something to close the achievement gap , a new round of test scores showed that black and Latino students had gained no ground on their white and Asian American peers .
Like many educators , O'Connell assumed the culprit was poverty .
Then he noticed an even wider ethnic disparity among students who were not poor .
The realization was a jolt : Being black or Latino - not poor - was what the low - scorers had in common .
And it changed everything .
O'Connell now believes that widespread cultural ignorance within the California school system is responsible for the poor academic performance of many black and Latino students in school .
He offered the example of black children who learn at church that it 's good to clap , speak loudly and be a bit raucous .
But doing the same thing at school , where 72 percent of teachers are white and may be unfamiliar with such customs , will get them in trouble , he said .
The achievement gap is " absolutely , positively not genetic , " O'Connell said .
" All kids can learn .
I 'm saying it 's racial . "
He said that until last year , he presided over a school - ranking system that let ethnic groups of students achieve at a slower pace than schools as a whole had to do .
" We institutionalized lower expectations , " said O'Connell , who ended the double standard last year .
" We 're all guilty . "
O'Connell and top educators in the California Department of Education have taken hours of racial sensitivity training , which O'Connell wants to extend to teachers statewide .
He 's also reorganized the state Department of Education to focus on raising the test scores of black and Latino students .
And now he is taking it to the people with a two - day conference on race and the achievement gap .
Hundreds of experts from around the country will offer 125 different panels with such titles as " A Mindset is a Difficult Thing to Change , " and " Policies that Support the Academic Development of Urban Black Males . "
Some 4,000 people - teachers , principals , lawyers , school secretaries and others - will pack into the Sacramento Convention Center on Tuesday and Wednesday for what is being billed as an Achievement Gap Summit .
Keynote speakers include talk - show host Tavis Smiley ; " Stand and Deliver " actor Edward James Olmos ; and Nicolina Hernandez , who founded the San Joaquin Valley University Project while in high school to help students apply to college .
Also on center stage will be Glenn Singleton , the coach O'Connell hired for the Education Department 's racial sensitivity classes .
Singleton runs a San Francisco consulting firm called Pacific Educational Group and is the author of " Courageous Conversations about Race : a Strategy for Achieving Equity in Schools . "
Contrary to widely held views that parents play a strong role in whether their children do well academically , Singleton believes the schools , not parents , are the biggest influence .
" If we were to say that black or brown kids do n't perform as well because of their parents , we 're saying black and brown parents are n't as effective as white parents , " Singleton told The Chronicle .
" That 's pretty much a racist statement . "
At schools with large numbers of black and Latino students , white teachers are not only culturally unfamiliar with their students , they are often the " least seasoned and skilled " at teaching , he said .
Curriculum and achievement tests are also Eurocentric , Singleton said , despite the state 's efforts to purge all bias .
But not everyone is convinced that cultural ignorance is at the heart of the achievement gap .
" I do n't think we believe that race is the issue , " said Dean Vogel , vice president of the vast California Teachers Association , who speculated that O'Connell is using the topic to gain exposure for a possible run for governor .
Vogel disputed one of the most common examples of inequity cited by Singleton and others : that labor contracts - which let experienced teachers choose where they work - contribute to the achievement gap because the veterans typically aim for high - performing schools with few black and Latino students .
" I never heard people say they do n't want to work with those kids , " Vogel said .
" They say , ' I want to work somewhere where I have enough materials , where the heater works and the roof does n't leak , and where there 's a manageable class size . ' "
By coincidence , he said , that is n't where most black and Latino students go to school .
Fixing those inequities - not focusing on race - is the way to close the achievement gap , Vogel said .
Jeannie Oakes , director of UCLA 's Institute for Democracy , Education and Access , agreed .
Last week , she released a report saying schools attended mainly by black and Latino students are more crowded than other schools , and have fewer counselors and advanced - placement courses .
" We 're very encouraged that Jack O'Connell had the courage to point to the gap , " said Oakes , who will present the research at the achievement gap conference .
" But our approach is much broader ( than ) cultural issues . "
Still others doubted that poverty should be dismissed as the main cause of the gap .
" This area warrants more research , " said Bob Wells , executive director of the Association of California School Administrators .
" The danger of calling it ' race ' is that that could lead some to conclude that certain races are n't capable of learning .
We do n't buy that . "
Yet another cause of the racial achievement gap is neighborhood violence , say school counselors and mental health experts .
That topic is missing from O'Connell 's achievement gap conference .
But student mental health is the " pink elephant " in the room that no one talks about , said Pia Escudero , of the Los Angeles Unified School District 's Crisis Counseling and Intervention Services .
About 30 percent of children living in violent urban neighborhoods have post - traumatic stress disorder , or PTSD , according to the National Center for Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder , a division of the Department of Veterans Affairs .
Children with PTSD , many of them black and Latino , do n't do well in school , research shows .
Dropout rates are higher , and test scores are lower .
Escudero said she was not aware of the summit and had not been asked to participate .
But without a doubt , PTSD contributes to the achievement gap , said Stephen Brock , associate professor of school psychology at Cal State Sacramento .
Meanwhile , " race " is still a four - letter word to many educators .
O'Connell hopes his Achievement Gap Summit will help end the taboo on that subject , and get California educators talking .
He wants the conference to motivate educators and yield statewide changes , he said , including the possibility of legislation to increase preschool access for students of color .
" We 'll have 4,000 people there , " he said .
" There 's no silver bullet or single solution .
" I could just look the other way and say the achievement gap is caused by socioeconomics - but it 's not . "

The ATI RV670 Is Here !
With the release of the ATI Radeon HD 3870 and 3850 reviews yesterday , ATI fans can finally say , " I told you so " to doubters , naysayers and NVIDIA fanboys .
But this has less to do with the performance of the new cards and more to do with the fact that ATI managed to get them out before the end of 2007 .
Truth be told , hardcore ATI fans are probably disappointed in the performance of the ATI Radeon HD 3870 and 3850 cards .
They had hoped the new ATI RV670 VPU would deliver a killing blow to the NVIDIA G92 GPU , and vindicate their faith in ATI .
Instead , the RV670 fell short of those expectations .
Even so , the new ATI Radeon HD 3870/3850 graphics cards may end up as a commercial success , and could help turn things around for AMD - ATI .
Let 's take a look at how that 's possible .
The Radeon HD 3870
The ATI Radeon HD 3870 is generally about 20 - 25 % slower than the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT .
This is hardly something NVIDIA would worry about , that is , until you take into account availability and price .
For ease of comparison , here 's a table showing the cost of these cards .
Model Official Price Street Price NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT
$ 199 - $ 249 $ 250 - $ 300 ATI Radeon HD 3870 $ 219 Est. ~$ 219 Difference :
( From GeForce 8800 GT ) - $ 30 to +$ 20 +$ 31 to +$ 81
As you can see , the ATI Radeon HD 3870 is really priced within the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT 's official price range .
At that price point , you cannot really justify the purchase of a Radeon HD 3870 when it is 20 - 25 % slower than the GeForce 8800 GT .
The trouble with the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT is that since its launch on October 29 , cards have been hard to come by and consequently , its price has inflated by $ 50 .
A quick check at Pricegrabber showed a very limited number of e-tailers offering GeForce 8800 GT cards , with prices ranging from $ 250 to $ 300 .
That 's 20 - 25 % higher than the official price range .
The inflated street prices make the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT about $ 31 - $ 81 ( 14 - 37 % ) more expensive than the ATI Radeon HD 3870 .
This is when the Radeon HD 3870 begins to look a lot more attractive .
We have to be honest though and say that this only puts the Radeon HD 3870 on a more equal footing with the GeForce 8800 GT and does not give the Radeon HD 3870 a clear advantage .
The really big problem for NVIDIA right now is availability .
They have n't been able to deliver the GeForce 8800 GT in sufficient quantities to even meet initial demands .
This may push impatient gamers into buying the cheaper Radeon HD 3870 , especially if ATI includes an attractive game bundle like they did with the Radeon HD 2900 XT .
The Radeon HD 3850
That the ATI Radeon HD 3850 trashed the hell out of the NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GTS should come as no surprise .
The GeForce 8600 GTS is a woefully under - powered card and that 's being polite .
Most reviews online though had no choice but to compare the Radeon HD 3850 against the GeForce 8600 GTS since its intended rival , the 256MB version of the GeForce 8800 GT , is still not in the market !
This is a clear sign that graphics card manufacturers have trouble sourcing enough NVIDIA G92 GPUs to keep up with demand for the standard GeForce 8800 GT cards , much less allocate them to the lower - cost ( and less profitable ) 256MB version of the GeForce 8800 GT .
Until they start producing and selling the GeForce 8800 GT 256MB , ATI will have a field day with their Radeon HD 3850 which currently has real competitor to speak of .
Michael Mukasey was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday as the new United States attorney general .
Six Democrats crossed party lines to vote in favor of Mukasey 's confirmation , bringing the total to 53 to 44 .
The confirmation was controversial in large part because Mukasey refused to denounce the procedure known as waterboarding as torture .
The tone of Mukasey 's answers on the subject is probably best represented by a brief exchange with Rhode Island Democrat and fancily - named dandy Sheldon Whitehouse .
Mukasey 's confusion over the issue of waterboarding is completely understandable .
It 's not as if TV news has been discussing waterboarding for more than three years .
It 's not like he has access to some sort of amazing searchable network of information that could provide him with answers about " what is involved in the technique . "
People in his position do n't have time for such things as time - consuming research .
They have the real business of administering justice to worry about .
Since Mukasey has been confirmed and will be taking over as attorney general I thought I might devote an article to explaining a few things to him .
That way he can have a concise reference of what is torture and what is n't torture so he does n't get bogged down in all of this moral relativism that seems to be confusing people in Washington .
" Good Indications You Are Being Tortured " for US Attorney General Michael Mukasey
Unless you are being interrogated outdoors on a ski slope , ski masks are generally not an important part of lawful interrogation methods .
A rule of thumb on this is if your interrogators are wearing any of the headgear worn by people you are supposed to shoot in Hogan 's
Alley then you are about to get the shit tortured out of you .
This includes black burglar masks , skullcaps and sunglasses , and oversized fedoras , but does not include police hats or old lady hats .
Somebody keeps trying to stop you from breathing .
On a scale of importance from one to ten I think it 's fair to say that breathing rates about a 9.7 or 9.8 .
Maybe even a little higher .
It 's up there with " having a beating heart " and " not being on fire . "
When someone tries to get you to stop breathing , even temporarily , that 's a pretty good sign you 're being tortured .
The other possibility is that they wo n't stop so you can breathe and they do n't want you to answer any questions at all , in which case congratulations , you are just being murdered .
After you answer a question dogs bite you .
Dogs usually do n't play an important role in interrogation procedures , possibly because they know only a few words of English and cannot communicate their questions very well .
A dog wo n't have much of an opinion one way or the other about the quality or the veracity of the answers you are giving during an interrogation process .
If you are being menaced or bitten by snarling dogs do n't think of it as the dogs judging you as a person , think of it as your interrogators torturing you .
You are being interrogated in a country mentioned by Borat .
Some guys put a bag over your head while you were buying shoes at an outdoor market in Baghdad .
A few hours later they took it off and you 're pretty sure there is a skeleton shackled to the dungeon wall next to you .
Welcome to a secret prison in some former communist country .
Kreblakistan agreed to " enthusiastically interrogate " you and the Americans promised to buy 600,000 tons of their potassium manganate .
You are about to get one heck of a torturin ' !
As an added bonus you have just been promoted in rank from " some guy with an Al Qaeda website in his IE cache " to " Al Qaeda 's number two man in Iraq . "
Better start thinking of a " credible threat " you can blurt out before your foot is fed into a hand - cranked meat grinder .
Huhuhuhuh some asshole at Meathead U got drunk and shot in the butt by paintballs and now we can subject suspected terrorists to the same collegiate hijinks !
You are the subject of a " fraternity prank " and you are not in a fraternity .
The phrase " fraternity prank " is often used by pundits to trivialize interrogation methods , but I have viewed enough videos of people lighting themselves on fire trying to hit a burning watermelon with a golf club to know that fraternity pranks are torture .
Just because Steve - O stapled his testicles to a board or wrestled an alligator in a septic tank does n't mean you are n't getting tortured when the same happens to you .
One of Saddam 's most notorious torture methods was blindfolding people and making them jump off the second story of a building .
I watched a video of a skateboarder trying to ride off a roof onto a rail 20 feet below and he ended up nailing himself in the balls , which is worse than just landing in the dirt .
Masochists and morons torture themselves all the time .
You are blindfolded , bound , and naked on the bottom of a pile of men you did not meet on Craigslist .
Being blindfolded is n't torture .
Being naked is n't torture unless you have really bad self esteem issues .
Being bound is n't torture , although there was this Japanese video I saw where they figured out how to tie up a clitoris that might qualify .
Being all of those things and struggling to breathe underneath the crushing weight and unwashed man-musk of a meat pyramid is torture .
They can't even hear your answers to questions because some guy 's crack is in your face .
On the plus side , you are totally going to be the centerpiece photo of the Flickr page .
You have been standing up for more than 24 consecutive hours and you are not in line for a Harry Potter movie .
One of the favorite " enhanced interrogation techniques " of the CIA has been to shackle a prisoner to the floor and force them to stand in one place for more than 40 hours at a time .
Prisoners in this position are not allowed to fall asleep or sit down .
I once waited in line for Millennium Force at Cedar Point for more than an hour and I would have said just about anything by the end of that to make it stop .
I even had a totally sweet rollercoaster ride to help me get through it .
I would imagine after about ten hours you would say anything just to sit down , rollercoaster or not .
You do n't give the most reliable sort of information when you are so tired you 're seeing unicorns and will admit to grudge - fucking the Olsen Twins on the International Space Station .

J.K. Rowling is in the news again this week , with two stories breaking simultaneously .
Rowling is suing the publisher of a book derived from a Harry Potter fan site , and she is auctioning off a handwritten book of folktales from Harry Potter ’s magical world , The Tales of Beedle the Bard , to benefit charity .
It ’s awfully easy to excoriate Rowling for her greedy lawsuit while praising her for her charity auction .
Easy , and wrong — fans should be supporting Rowling in her legal action , and bitterly criticizing her decision to sell Beedle the Bard for charity .
Despite the howls of protest from the publisher of the Harry Potter Lexicon , the reference book adapted from the popular ( and Rowling - approved ) Website of the same name , Rowling asserting her copyright in her characters and stories is not a First Amendment matter .
For starters , people , J.K. Rowling is n’t the government , so she ’s not “ censoring ” you .
Rowling plans to write a similar book about her characters and inventions and has every right to stop someone else from writing the exact same book , which clearly is not the same things as a critical study of the work .
What is objectionable , though , is Rowling ’s charity auction — or , rather , her stated decision never to publish The Tales of Beedle the Bard .
( “ She owns the copyright , ” says a BBC video report on the book . )
As fans , we of course want to read the book and think it ’s a little bit outrageous that the only people who will get to read it are six of Rowling ’s close friends , and one outrageously rich Sotheby ’s bidder .
If the handwritten books were made , as Rowling claims , to thank “ those most intimately involved with the phenomenally successful series , ” could n’t she have saved a copy for those most to thank for the series ’ success — the fans ?
We do n’t begrudge Rowling ’s worthy charity the money , but surely she would make more money for charity if she published the Tales as a stand - alone book and donated all her royalties .
As it stands , the only way for ordinary fans to even get a look at some of the book ’s pages is to buy the $ 16 catalogue from Sotheby ’s — who , we suspect , will not be giving their proceeds to charity .
There ’s a New J.K. Rowling Book !
And No , You Ca n’t Read It
I write a lot of programs for embedded systems , and I prefer to program in C++ whenever possible .
However , for some smaller processors , a C++ compiler either does n't exist or else is expensive .
Recently , I needed to port an existing C++ project to a processor for which I had only a C compiler .
The project had benefited greatly from using an inheritable class structure , so I decided to try and develop a mechanism for building inheritable classes in C .
I am not the first to do this , of course , and others have published successful methods .
Miro Samek , for instance , developed a set of macros that hide the C code and allow a C++- like syntax ( see Practical State Charts in C/C++ , by Miro Samek , CMP Books , 2002 ) .
Hekon Hallingstad's class implementation used the offsetof ( ) macro to access parent class data .
Dan Saks described using C abstract types as classes ( see " Abstract Types Using C , " by Dan Saks , Embedded Systems Programming , October 2003 ) .
However , I had developed my own standalone class software over the years and my recent work was able to extend this to support classes with single inheritance .
For want of a better name , I use the name of the header file C_Classes .
Where would you use inheritance in embedded systems ?
Think of manufacturers building a range of chemical process controllers .
They all have the same liquid crystal display , analog interfaces , power supply , RS - 232 and radio interface , and similar sets of buttons and switches .
The software interface to this hardware is also going to be similar .
In this article , I introduce inheritance by defining a set of base classes that have drivers for all this hardware and well defined interfaces .
Thus , a range of instruments can use the same base class set and only need a set of derived classes that characterize the particular functionality and set of interfaces that a new instrument will use .
This makes for straightforward instrument development .
A Simple Class Structure
C++ hides the class data structure within itself and provides strict rules for how it can be accessed .
You do n't have this luxury in C , but you can create something similar by defining a single structure to contain all the data belonging to the class .
For example , I use my C_Classes method to define a skeleton class that could be the basis for a motor controller .
The class is Motor and it controls only the speed and direction .
The microprocessor I am programming has a number of ports that are connected to a number of motor controller chips .
To set a motor 's speed , you need only write the direction and revolutions - per-minute ( RPM ) to its respective ports .
To keep things simple , I just use integers .
The class data structure is defined in the Motor class header as a typedef :
typedef struct { int* m Port ; int mSpeed ; DIRECTION mDirection ; } MotorData ;
The MotorData structure is the definition template for the Motor class data .
In C++ , these variables would be declared in a private section of the class definition .
The mPort class data variable is assigned the port address for a particular motor .
This lets the same Motor class code manage several motors in the one application .
The DIRECTION type is a simple enum :
typedef enum { DR_UNKNOWN , DR_CCW , // counter - clockwise DR_CW , // clockwise } DIRECTION ;
As in C++ , the class has a constructor and a destructor .
Creating an instance of the class is a call to the constructor using the statement :
MotorData* d Motor = MotorCtor ( ) ; </pre < P > < p
>
The constructor creates and initializes an instance of the < code > MotorData < / code > structure just defined , then returns a pointer to it that is assigned to the < code > dMotor < / code > class data pointer .
Subsequently , the caller passes this pointer to the class at every method call .
This is the technique the C++ compiler uses , only it does it under the covers .
The class contains no instance data within itself :
It just provides methods to manipulate the passed - in data .
</p> < p>
Okay , that looks simple enough , but how do you call a class method ?

>Because I am developing a way to create inheritable classes , I need to be able to call methods in a base class through a derived class , add additional methods in that derived class , and override base class methods in the derived class if required .
To do this , I build a table of function pointers in RAM that provides access to the public methods of the class .
I create the definition of this table of vectors ( or < code> vtable < / code > ) as another < code > typedef < / code > that includes function pointer prototypes for each public method .
In the < code > Motor < / code > example , you need to be able to initialize the port address , and set / get the speed and direction , all via the class interface , so that makes five methods ; see Example 1 . < P > < p >< b> Example 1 : Initializing port address , and setting / getting speed and direction .</b>< br> < pre class= " brush : c ; html : collapse ; " style = " font - family : Andale Mono , Lucida Console , Monaco , fixed , monospace ; color : rgb ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) ; background - color : rgb ( 238 , 238 , 238 ) ; font - size : 12 px ; border : 1 px dashed rgb ( 153 , 153 , 153 ) ; line - height : 14 px ; padding : 5 px ; overflow : auto ; width : 100 % ; " > typedef struct {
//--------------------------------------- //
Set a copy of the port address to use .
void ( * InitPort ) ( MotorData* , int* ) ;
//--------------------------------------- //
Set / Get the motor speed .
void ( * SetSpeed ) ( MotorData* , int ) ; int ( * GetSpeed ) ( MotorData * ) ;
//---------------------------------------- //
Set / Get the motor rotation direction .
void ( * SetDirection ) ( MotorData * , DIRECTION ) ; DIRECTION ( * GetDirection ) ( MotorData * ) ; } MOTOR ;
Along with the vtable definition , the class header also includes the definition for a pointer to the vtable and prototypes for the constructor and destructor .
These are all publicly accessible :
extern MOTOR * Motor ; extern MotorData * MotorCtor ( void ) ; extern void MotorXtor ( MotorData * ) ;
Part of the constructor 's job is to build in RAM the vtable containing the five function pointers and set the public class vtable pointer ( Motor ) to point to that location .
After a call to the constructor , users of this class can call any of the public methods through the class pointer .
For example , setting the motor speed to 450 RPM , and remembering you also need to pass in the class data pointer , would be the call :
Motor-> SetSpeed( dMotor,450 ) ;
While the owner of the dMotor structure has no business ever looking inside it , after this call you would know that dMotor - > mSpeed has a value equivalent to 450 RPM .
The Constructor
So how does the class constructor build the vtable and create the data instance ?
Again , the header file contains a template of the vtable ( the MOTOR typedef ) .
Within the class code file , an instance of this vtable is defined and this instance is copied from ROM to RAM .
Continuing the example , in the Motor code file , the vtable instance along with the global class pointer declaration looks like Example 2 ( a ) .
It is crucial , of course , that the instance has the same order as the template .
The constructor function looks like Example 2 ( b ) .
Example 2 : ( a ) vtable instance and global class pointer declaration ; ( b ) constructor function .
( a)
static const MOTOR cMotor = { InitPort , SetSpeed , GetSpeed , SetDirection , GetDirection } ; MOTOR * Motor ;
( b)
MotorData* MotorCtor( void ) { MotorData * d ; //
Create the data structure // and initialize the contents .
d = Allocate ( sizeof ( MotorData ) ) ; d-> mPort = NULL ; d->mSpeed = 0 ; d-> mDirection = DR_UNKNOWN ; // Create the vtable by // copying it to RAM . if ( InstCount + + == 0 ) { CREATE_VTABLE ( Motor , cMotor , MOTOR ) ; } return d ; }
If there is a possibility that the class will have several instances , or be created and destroyed several times , then the class must ensure there is always only one vtable in RAM .
To this end , every class has InstCount as a private variable that is used to keep track of the number of instances extant for this class .
It is incremented during construction and decremented during destruction .
The actual copying is conveniently done by the CREATE_VTABLE macro .
This uses cMotor as a source , Motor as a destination , and the MOTOR structure size for both heap allocation and for the number of bytes to copy .
As an aside , my original C_Classes version for standalone classes used the simple Motor = & cMotor instead of the macro .
You can still do this for standalone classes if RAM is in short supply .
Again , the constructor must also create and initialize the class data on the heap for every instantiation .
To this end , the constructor creates a pointer that is returned to each individual caller to manage during the life of the class instance .
The Allocate function is defined in the C_Classes header and is a simple wrapper around malloc that includes an internal allocation counter .
The counter can be interrogated at any time and can be useful during debugging .
SidewaysBike
Not Your Father 's Bicycle !
Human balance is detected in the inner ear .
There are three semi-circular canals positioned at right angles to each other that detect balance in three axes .
These canals are separate and distinct .
The three types of balance are Left to Right , Front to Back and Rotational ( Yaw ) .
Left to Right balance is what people are most familiar with and is the primary balance used for riding a regular bicycle or indeed flying a plane .
In the case of flying a plane there is a visual supplement to left to right balance provided by the observation of the horizon line .
Front to Back balance has very little visual input and is the primary balance used in riding a surfboard , windsurfer and snowboard .
Front to Back balance is a finer instrument than Left to Right balance and offers a greater degree of artistic feedback .
This is evidenced by the difference between skiing and snowboarding .
Skiing ( Left to Right balance ) is faster than Snowboarding ( Front to Back balance ) ; however people like to snowboard because of the greater artistic expression .

This bicycle is ridden forward and is balanced by using human Left to Right balance .
This bicycle uses independant ( non linked ) Front and Rear steering .
The ride is very wavy sort of like skiing with a capacity to drift to the right or left .
The front and rear steering makes the bike much more maneuverable than a single steer bike .
Your hands are by your side and you do n't exert a lot of pull on the steering .
Its sort of like riding a horse where you cannot lean on the reins but all body movements come out of your seat and saddle .
The saddle is nessicarily a unicycle saddle ( You would slip forward off a regular bike saddle ) .
I would predict that the audience for this bike would be teenagers to young adults .
The original bicycle has been around for 200 years .
Do n't you think it is time for a change !

Shell says biofuels from food crops “ morally inappropriate ” July 6 , 2006
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) – Royal Dutch Shell , the world ’s top marketer of biofuels , considers using food crops to make biofuels “ morally inappropriate ” as long as there are people in the world who are starving , an executive said on Thursday .
Eric G Holthusen , Fuels Technology Manager Asia / Pacific , said the company ’s research unit , Shell Global Solutions , has developed alternative fuels from renewable resources that use wood chips and plant waste rather than food crops that are typically used to make the fuels .
Holthusen said his company ’s participation in marketing biofuels extracted from food was driven by economics or legislation .
“ If we have the choice today , then we will not use this route , ” Malaysia - based Holthusen said at a seminar in Singapore .
“ We think morally it is inappropriate because what we are doing here is using food and turning it into fuel .
If you look at Africa , there are still countries that have a lack of food , people are starving , and because we are more wealthy we use food and turn it into fuel .
This is not what we would like to see .
But sometimes economics force you to do it . ”
The world ’s top commercially produced biofuels are ethanol and biodiesel .
Ethanol , mostly used in the United States and Brazil , is produced from sugar cane and beets and can also be derived from grains such as corn and wheat .
Biodiesel , used in Europe , is extracted from the continent ’s predominant oil crop , rapeseed , and can also be produced from palm and coconut .
Holthusen said Shell has been working on biofuels that can be extracted from plant waste and wood chips , but he did not say when the alternative biofuel might be commercially available .
“ We are not resting .
We are doing what everybody needs to do .
We have worked over time on an alternative to get away from food , and this is what we call the second generation of biofuels , ” he said .
He said Shell , in partnership with Canadian biotech firm Iogen Corp. , has developed “ cellulose ethanol , ” which is made from the wood chips and non-food portion of renewable feedstocks such as cereal straws and corn stover , and can be blended with gasoline .
Ethanol is typically extracted from sugarcane or grain .

Bill Gates writing in Scientific American about the coming age of robots .
Here 's a shortened version of the article :
A Robot in Every Home , by Bill Gates , Scientific American : Imagine being present at the birth of a new industry .
It is an industry based on groundbreaking new technologies ...
But it is also a highly fragmented industry with few common standards or platforms .
Projects are complex , progress is slow , and practical applications are relatively rare .
In fact , for all the excitement and promise , no one can say with any certainty when — or even if — this industry will achieve critical mass .
If it does , though , it may well change the world .
Of course , the paragraph above could be a description of the computer industry during the mid-1970s , around the time that Paul Allen and I launched Microsoft .
...
But what I really have in mind is something much more contemporary : the emergence of the robotics industry ... [ S ] ome of the world ’s best minds are trying to solve the toughest problems of robotics , such as visual recognition , navigation and machine learning .
And they are succeeding .
...
What is more , the challenges facing the robotics industry are similar to those we tackled in computing three decades ago .
Robotics companies have no standard operating software that could allow popular application programs to run in a variety of devices .
The standardization of robotic processors and other hardware is limited , and very little of the programming code used in one machine can be applied to another .
Whenever somebody wants to build a new robot , they usually have to start from square one .
Despite these difficulties , when I talk to people involved in robotics — from university researchers to entrepreneurs , hobbyists and high school students — the level of excitement and expectation reminds me so much of that time when Paul Allen and I ... dreamed of the day when a computer would be on every desk and in every home .
And as I look at the trends that are now starting to converge , I can envision a future in which robotic devices will become a nearly ubiquitous part of our day - to - day lives .
...
From Science Fiction to Reality
The word “ robot ” was popularized in 1921 by Czech play wright Karel Capek , but people have envisioned creating robot - like devices for thousands of years .
...
Over the past century , anthropomorphic machines have become familiar figures in popular culture through books such as Isaac Asimov ’s I , Robot , movies such as Star Wars and television shows such as Star Trek .
...
Nevertheless , although robots play a vital role in industries such as automobile manufacturing — where there is about one robot for every 10 workers — the fact is that we have a long way to go before real robots catch up with their science - fiction counterparts .
One reason for this gap is that it has been much harder than expected to enable computers and robots to sense their surrounding environment and to react quickly and accurately .
It has proved extremely difficult to give robots the capabilities that humans take for granted — for example , the abilities to orient themselves with respect to the objects in a room , to respond to sounds and interpret speech , and to grasp objects of varying sizes , textures and fragility .
Even something as simple as telling the difference between an open door and a window can be devilishly tricky for a robot .
But researchers are starting to find the answers .
One trend that has helped them is the increasing availability of tremendous amounts of computer power .
...
As computing capacity continues to expand , robot designers will have the processing power they need to tackle issues of ever greater complexity .
Another barrier to the development of robots has been the high cost of hardware , such as sensors that enable a robot to determine the distance to an object as well as motors and servos that allow the robot to manipulate an object with both strength and delicacy .
But prices are dropping fast .
...
Now robot builders can also add Global Positioning System chips , video cameras , array microphones ... and a host of additional sensors for a reasonable expense .
The resulting enhancement of capabilities , combined with expanded processing power and storage , allows today ’s robots to do things such as vacuum a room or help to defuse a roadside bomb — tasks that would have been impossible for commercially produced machines just a few years ago .
A BASIC Approach
In February 2004 I visited a number of leading universities ... to talk about the powerful role that computers can play in solving some of society ’s most pressing problems .
...
At each university , after delivering my speech , ...[ a] lmost without exception , I was shown at least one project that involved robotics .
At that time , my colleagues at Microsoft were also hearing from people in academia and at commercial robotics firms who wondered if our company was doing any work in robotics that might help them with their own development efforts .
We were not , so we decided to take a closer look .
I asked Tandy Trower , a member of my strategic staff ... to go on an extended fact - finding mission ...
What he found was ... an industry - wide desire for tools that would make development easier .
...
Tandy wrote in his report to me after his fact - finding mission .
“ [ T ] he hardware capability is mostly there ; now the issue is getting the software right . ”
Back in the early days of the personal computer , we realized that we needed ... Microsoft BASIC .
When we created this programming language in the 1970s , we provided the common foundation that enabled programs developed for one set of hardware to run on another .
BASIC also made computer programming much easier ...
After reading Tandy ’s report , it seemed clear to me that before the robotics industry could make the same kind of quantum leap that the PC industry made 30 years ago , it , too , needed to find that missing ingredient .
So I asked him to assemble a small team that would work with people in the robotics field to create a set of programming tools that would provide the essential plumbing ...
Tandy ’s robotics group has been able to draw on a number of advanced technologies ...
One such technology will help solve one of the most difficult problems facing robot designers : how to simultaneously handle all the data coming in from multiple sensors and send the appropriate commands to the robot ’s motors , a challenge known as concurrency .
...
Concurrency is a challenge that extends beyond robotics .
Today as more and more applications are written for distributed networks of computers , programmers have struggled to figure out how to efficiently orchestrate code running on many different servers at the same time .
And as computers with a single processor are replaced by machines with multiple processors and “ multicore ” processors ... , software designers will need a new way to ... fully exploit the power of processors working in parallel , the new software must deal with the problem of concurrency .
...
The answer that Craig ’s team has devised to the concurrency problem is something called the concurrency and coordination runtime ( CCR ) .
...
Designed to help programmers take advantage of the power of multicore and multiprocessor systems , the CCR turns out to be ideal for robotics as well .
...
In addition to tackling the problem of concurrency , the work that Craig ’s team has done will also simplify the writing of distributed robotic applications through a technology called decentralized software services ( DSS ) .
DSS enables developers to create applications in which the ... the parts of the program that read a sensor , say , or control a motor — operate as separate processes that can be ... aggregated on a Web page .
...
Combined with broadband wireless technology , this architecture makes it easy to monitor and adjust a robot from a remote location using a Web browser .
...
As a result , the robot can be a relatively inexpensive device that delegates complex processing tasks to the high - performance hardware found on today ’s home PCs .
I believe this advance will pave the way for an entirely new class of robots that are essentially mobile , wireless peripheral devices that tap into the power of desktop PCs to handle processing - intensive tasks such as visual recognition and navigation .
And because these devices can be networked together , we can expect to see the emergence of groups of robots that can work in concert to achieve goals such as mapping the seafloor or planting crops .
These technologies are a key part of Microsoft Robotics Studio ...
Should We Call Them Robots ?
How soon will robots become part of our day - to - day lives ?
According to the International Federation of Robotics , about two million personal robots were in use around the world in 2004 , and another seven million will be installed by 2008 .
...
Although a few of the robots of tomorrow may resemble the anthropomorphic devices seen in Star Wars , most will look nothing like the humanoid C - 3PO .
In fact , as mobile peripheral devices become more and more common , it may be increasingly difficult to say exactly what a robot is .
Because the new machines will be so specialized and ubiquitous — and look so little like the two - legged automatons of science fiction — we probably will not even call them robots .
But as these devices become affordable to consumers , they could have just as profound an impact on the way we work , communicate , learn and entertain ourselves as the PC has had over the past 30 years .
I STARTED collecting examples of bizarre experiments years ago while in graduate school studying the history of science .
I confess I had no profound intellectual motive ; I simply found them fascinating .
They filled me with disbelief , astonishment , disgust and – best of all – laughter .
With hindsight , perhaps there is a deeper message .
These experiments are not the work of cranks .
All were performed by honest , hard - working scientists who were not prepared to accept common - sense explanations of how the world works .
Sometimes such single - mindedness leads to brilliant discoveries .
At other times it can end up closer to madness .
Unfortunately , there ’s no way of knowing in advance where the journey will lead .
Here are 10 of the bizarrest experiments of all time – which , it must be said , mostly fall closer to madness than to genius .
1 Elephants on acid
What happens if you give an elephant LSD ?
Researchers solved this mystery on Friday 3 August 1962 , when Warren Thomas , director of Lincoln Park Zoo in Oklahoma City , fired a cartridge - syringe containing 297 milligrams of LSD into the rump of Tusko the elephant .
With Thomas were two colleagues from the University of Oklahoma School of Medicine , Louis Jolyon West and Chester M. Pierce .
The dose was about 3000 times what a human would typically take .
Thomas , West and Pierce figured that if they were going to give an elephant LSD they ’d better not give it too little .
They later explained that the experiment was designed to find out if LSD would induce musth in an elephant – musth being a kind of temporary madness male elephants sometimes experience during which they become highly aggressive …
Democrats cave in on torture :
Key senators back attorney general nominee
By Bill Van Auken
3 November 2007
Two key Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee announced Friday afternoon that they will support the Bush administration ’s nominee for attorney general , former federal judge Michael Mukasey , virtually assuring his confirmation as head of the US Justice Department .
Senator Charles Schumer of New York , who originally proposed Mukasey for the post , and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said that they would vote in favor of the nominee .
With the judiciary panel split 10 - 9 between the Democrats and Republicans — with all nine Republicans already committed to backing Mukasey — this assures that the nomination will go to the full Senate .
As many as 20 Democrats are expected to back the nomination , giving a comfortable 70 votes for confirmation .
Schumer declared that Mukasey was not his “ ideal choice , ” but praised his “ integrity and independence . ”
Feinstein declared , “ He is not Alberto Gonzales , ” who left the Justice Department in the face of the mounting scandal over the politically motivated firing of US attorneys .
Another Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , also indicated he may vote for Mukasey .
Calling him a “ marked improvement ” over Gonzales , Feingold told the New York Times , “ He may be the best nominee we can get from this administration . ”
The rallying of crucial Democratic support for Mukasey has taken place in the context of a deepening controversy over the nominee ’s refusal to declare illegal the US government ’s blatant use of torture against those it has illegally detained around the globe .
Leading to an explicit defense of torture on the part of the administration and its supporters , the entire debate has served to expose the terminal decay of basic democratic processes and principles within the United States under the combined impact of colonial war abroad and the staggering growth of social inequality at home .
At the center of debate is the steadfast refusal of Mukasey to respond directly or truthfully to questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee on whether waterboarding — the brutal and agonizing practice utilized by the CIA , in which victims are strapped to boards and water is poured over a cloth covering the mouth while they slowly suffocate — constitutes illegal torture .
Bush spoke in support of Mukasey again Friday while in South Carolina for a campaign fundraiser for Senator Lindsey Graham , a leading Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee .
“ I strongly urge the United States Senate to confirm this man , so that I can have an attorney general to work with to protect the United States of America from further attack , ” said Bush .
The wording was significant in that it posed the paramount function of the US attorney general as that of the president ’s enforcer in the so - called war on terrorism .
Upholding the Constitution , protecting the democratic rights of the people or enforcing the laws of the land as well as international law are all regarded as superfluous in comparison to this all - encompassing crusade in which all methods are valid , including wars of aggression , illegal detention , waterboarding and other forms of torture .
Meanwhile , one of the leading Republican presidential candidates , Fred Thompson , a former senator from Tennessee , weighed in on the debate over Mukasey , indicating that as president he would support waterboarding in the name of national security .
“ I ’ve always thought that when you get right down to it , the measures have to meet the situation , ” he said , after being asked if he would oppose the torture method .
Bush also received support for the Mukasey nomination from two of the most prominent newspapers in the country Friday .
In its lead editorial , the Washington Post lamented that “ Mr. Mukasey is being judged not on his merits but as a proxy for Bush . ”
The editorial continued , “ Yet critics of the nomination , while understandably disturbed by Mr. Mukasey ’s unwillingness to label waterboarding illegal , may be working against the last , best hope to see the rule of law reemerge in this administration . ”
The distinction made by the Post between the criminality of the Bush administration and Mukasey ’s stonewalling during his Senate testimony is nonsensical .
The nominee ’s “ unwillingness to label waterboarding illegal ” has only one motive .
He knows full well that this practice is a violation of both national law and international treaties barring torture and he is well aware that Bush , Cheney , the CIA and the entire administration are criminally responsible for its use by American interrogators .
By dodging the question , Mukasey is protecting this criminality and making it clear that , like his predecessors , he will serve as a defender of the illegal acts of the White House .
So much for the Post ’s claim that he represents the “ last , best hope ” for restoring the rule of law .
In feigning an even - handed approach , the Post goes on to suggest that , instead of barring Mukasey ’s nomination , the Senate should “ do something which , for all the rhetoric , they have so far declined to do : ban torture . ”
Specifically , it called for the body to support a measure introduced by Senator Joseph Biden , a Delaware Democrat , requiring all US personnel , including the CIA , to limit themselves to interrogation methods approved in the US Army Field Manual .
The document bans waterboarding , which has been recognized by the American military as a form of torture for more than a century .
From a legal standpoint , this is nonsense .
The US Senate has passed bans on torture over and over again by ratifying the Geneva Conventions and Conventions against Torture , all of which make waterboarding an international war crime .
There is more than enough legal authority to bring war crimes charges against Bush administration officials .
From a political standpoint , the Post points to the two - faced character of the Democratic opposition to torture .
The Democrats will make noises in the Senate when they think it serves their political advantage .
But they have refused to enact an explicit ban on waterboarding by the CIA , for fear of charges that they are “ soft on terrorism . ”
The Democrats also fear a constitutional confrontation with the White House .
Both the administration and its nominee Mukasey have made it clear that they do not believe that the president is bound by such laws to the extent that they infringe upon his limitless power as commander in chief under conditions of an unending war against terrorism .
Also weighing in on the Mukasey nomination Friday was the Wall Street Journal in an editorial entitled “ Mukasey and the Democrats . ”
The Journal , whose editorial positions generally reflect the outlook of the extreme right - wing clique that determines the policies of the Bush administration , not surprisingly defended not only the nominee but torture itself .
The editorial finds it incredible that Mukasey ’s nomination has been placed in doubt when his only “ supposed offense is that he has refused to declare ‘ illegal ’ a single interrogation technique that the CIA has used on rare occasions against mass murderers . ”
In plainer words , what ’s all the fuss about a little torture against people who had it coming any way ?
The Journal defended Mukasey ’s refusal to state an opinion on waterboarding based on “ hypothetical facts and circumstances , ” on the grounds that he had not yet been briefed on “ the classified interrogation details . ”
This was the same argument made by Bush the day before .
The “ classified interrogation details ” cannot add much to the public record .
Waterboarding has been around since the Spanish Inquisition .
Known at various times as the “ water cure ” or “ Chinese water torture , ” it has always been recognized as a means of torture .
In 1902 , an American officer was court - martialed for inflicting it upon insurgents in the Philippines .
After World War II , Japanese military personnel were prosecuted for war crimes for using it against POWs .
Even the present - day US State Department denounces the practice as torture when it is used by other countries .
When American personnel carry it out , however , it is defended as an “ enhanced interrogation technique ” — the same euphemism employed by the Nazis — that is indispensable in the war on terror .
Mukasey ’s evasion of the question means only that he will continue the practice of his predecessors of defending torture and protecting the chief torturers in the White House .
And that is fine with the Journal .
“ What ’s really at stake here is whether US officials are going to have the basic tools required to extract information from America ’s enemies , ” the paper declares .
It continues : “ As for waterboarding , it is mostly a political sideshow .
The CIA ’s view seems to be that some version of waterboarding is effective in breaking especially tough cases quickly . ”
The Gestapo , it might be added , was of the same opinion .
While the scale of the latter ’s use of these methods was no doubt greater than that of the American intelligence agencies , the underlying contempt for international law , democratic rights and human dignity are much the same .
In concluding its editorial , the Journal makes the partisan — though legitimate — point that the Democrats ’ outrage over Mukasey ’s position on waterboarding is largely cynical .
It quotes a Democratic senator at a 2004 hearing : “ I think there are probably very few people in this room or in America who would say that torture should never ever be used , particularly if thousands of lives are at stake ....
It is easy to sit back in the armchair and say that torture can never be used , but when you are in the foxhole it is a very different deal .
And I respect , I think we all respect the fact that the President is in the foxhole every day . ”
The editorial identifies the senator as “ New York Democrat Chuck Schumer , who recommended Judge Mukasey for Attorney General in the first place . ”
Before announcing late Friday his decision to vote in favor of Mukasey , Schumer had maintained a studied silence on the nomination since the Senate confirmation hearings .
On Friday , however , the New York Times quoted him as saying : “ No nominee from this administration will agree with us on things like torture and wiretapping .
The best we can expect is somebody who will depoliticize the Justice Department and put rule of law first , even when pressured by the administration .
If Mukasey is that type of person , I ’ll support him . ”
How an attorney general can “ put the law first ” while defending torture and illegal wiretapping , the senior senator from New York did not bother to explain .
Going by their record the Democrats are virtually certain to let Mukasey ’s nomination pass , while allowing all those for whom it is politically expedient — including the party ’s presidential nominees — to vote against it .
Such was the path taken in 2004 when the Democrats refused to filibuster the nomination of Alberto Gonzales as attorney general , even though it was known that he played a leading role in drafting the memos providing a pseudo - legal justification for torture .
The debate , in the end , has only served to expose once again the full complicity of the Democratic Party in the wholesale attacks on democratic rights carried out over the past six years , including the legitimization of torture .
It bears noting that , in focusing the debate on waterboarding , the Democrats have deliberately obscured other fundamental questions posed in Mukasey ’s testimony .
The nominee voiced his agreement with the position that the president as commander - in - chief has the inherent constitutional power to override the law in the name of national security .
It is this reactionary conception that underlies not only Mukasey ’s backhanded defense of torture , but also his upholding of the legality of the National Security Agency ’s domestic wiretapping program .
Of course , on the latter issue , the Democratic - led Congress has already largely bowed to the demands of the White House for warrantless surveillance .
When pressed in the nomination hearing about his view that the president ’s executive powers allowed him to override the law , the nominee answered : “ We are not dealing here with black and white .
Which is why it ’s very important that push not come to shove , because the result could be not just divisive but disaster . ”
None of the senators bothered to ask what kind of disaster Mukasey had in mind .
The most obvious answer would be the imposition of an outright dictatorship .
Such are the ugly truths about the profound moral and political rot of the American ruling establishment that have been laid bare by the Mukasey nomination process .
Engaged in dirty wars of aggression and pursuing a predatory policy of colonial conquest in the Middle East and Central Asia , the American ruling elite has embraced torture as an instrument of policy .
This has found its hideous expression in Abu Ghraib and in the secret prisons of the CIA around the globe .
Military aggression abroad is ultimately incompatible with democracy at home .
That the criminal practice of torture is now openly defended in public debate in the US itself is a warning that America ’s ruling financial oligarchy is prepared to jettison the last vestiges of democratic rights and employ these same methods at home in order to keep hold of its power and wealth .

VICTIMS OF UNINSURED DRIVERS : SUE D.M.V .
PART 1 of 2 By : Devvy
December 3 , 2007 ï¿½ 2007 - NewsWithViews.com
On May 28 , 2002 , my beautiful daughter , my only child , was rear ended on the freeway in LA .
Since she was stopped because of another accident right next to her lane , the police were right there .
Brandy was wearing a seat belt and took the entire brunt of the forceful impact .
The driver who hit her car turned out to be an uninsured Mexican , who I later found out is an illegal alien .
This illegal was attending UCLA on your federal income tax dollars .
My daughter required months of medical attention and on the way to her final appointment for specialized treatment , November 8 , 2002 , she was rear ended again at a stop sign .
This driver is insured , but her mini van striking the car , causes my Brandy to be re-injured .
My daughter , still requiring physical therapy , trying to recover from this battering to her body is again struck on February 21 , 2003 .
This time she is broad sided by an illegal Mexican with no insurance who runs a red light at approximately 40 mph .
Thankfully , this uninsured illegal hit the passenger side of the vehicle or she would have killed my daughter .
The damage is extensive this time .
This illegal driver with no insurance skipped back across the border , leaving behind the carnage of a battered body that is in constant pain .
This illegal alien had phony Michigan plates on the mini van and was using a phony Michigan drivers license .
Brandy has uninsured motorist coverage , but our insurance company , realizing they are going to be on the hook for settlement money as provided for in Brandy 's policy put us through Hell .
Because this illegal alien skipped back across the border , they could n't interview her so they charged my daughter with the accident and raised her premium !
Brandy was backing out of a lot .
The street was clear .
She could have no way of knowing this mini van would come flying through a red light and hit her , but that did n't matter to our insurance company even though there were witnesses .
In the end , Brandy got nothing for all her pain and suffering .
Between the first accident and 2006 , it cost my husband and I , $ 92,000 in cold , hard cash for Brandy 's living expenses until she could get back on her feet , the bills from private investigators to track down these illegals , specialized treatment our insurance company would not pay for and lawyers bills .
There is no retirement nest egg for my husband and I , but my Brandy is still alive and for that , I thank God everyday .
She will suffer the rest of her life with the lingering problems from the accidents , i.e. , constant back aches , clinical migraines that knock her out .
The illegal alien from UCLA has gone about her business and the illegal alien who skipped back across the border could care less and neither does George Bush , Nancy Pelosi , Hillary Clinton or your state legislature .
On October 31 , 2007 , she was hit again by this woman :
This female was driving with no insurance .
She ran a stop sign and plowed into Brandy 's two month old SUV hybrid .
I asked my daughter several months ago to get an SUV for better protection because I was afraid of this happening again and thank God , she took my advice .
Another car with four young men were stopped at the other stop sign and saw the whole thing .
Also , thankfully , they stayed with my daughter because this uninsured driver actually got on her cell phone and told her " homies " ( her words ) to get on down and help her " kick my daughter 's ass . "
Yes , she intended to beat up my daughter .
These four young men prevented that and bless them for staying the whole time until the police showed up .
Fortunately , Brandy had her camera and took pictures , not just of the accident , but this uninsured driver and her friends keyed Brandy 's vehicle !
They took car keys and destroyed the driver 's side while waiting for the police to arrive .
The police , after three 911 calls , finally showed up an hour later .
They cited this uninsured driver with several citations including malicious destruction .
The tab to repair Brandy 's vehicle was $ 9,000.00 ; she just got it back three days ago .
My baby girl ( I know , she 's 32 , but she will always be my baby ) was re-injured and is back in physical therapy .
How can one person be hit by three uninsured motorists in five years ?
Because in LA you 're talking about an astronomical number of drivers with no insurance who simply do n't give a damn .
God only knows how many of them are illegal aliens since LA is a haven for these criminals who smuggle themselves into our country like thieves in the night .
I did a column about this back in 2003 and received a half dozen emails from libertarians who said it 's unconstitutional to force people to pay for car insurance and that everyone should just make nice and take care of the expenses .
All 50 states require insurance and until you are the victim , it 's easy to say you do n't want to pay car insurance and actually believe these uninsured motorists are going to come up with tens of thousands of dollars to repair your vehicle and body .
A few states have mentally ill people serving in their state legislatures who have voted to give illegals drivers licenses .
Think these illegals have insurance ?
Think again .
These criminals have NO reason to stick around and " make it right " for you and your family and they do n't .
Let me give you the numbers from my aforementioned column : " Here in California the numbers are astronomical .
Statewide , over one third of drivers lack insurance -- about 33 percent , according the California Department of Insurance .
The figures skyrocket in low - income and minority city neighborhoods : nearly 50 % .
In San Jose , California , 55 % of all drivers on the road have no insurance .
Statewide , the problem is worst in the Los Angeles , Imperial , San Diego and Alameda counties .
With the exception of Alameda , the uninsured rates in those counties reaches a whopping 90 percent range .
Alameda County 's worst neighborhood , Oakland , is 63 percent uninsured .
Just to put things in perspective : Statewide , every third car that goes by you - the driver has no insurance .
In LA , one of the two cars involved in an accident , one has no insurance . "
The time has come to hold the states responsible and since the legislatures have made themselves immune , the next logical place is the DMV .
After the third accident in February 2003 , I had a face to face meeting with California State Senator Pete Knight at the state capitol ; one of the good guys who unfortunately passed away , May 7 , 2004 .
I gave Pete all my research and he told me this :
The legislature would do nothing because of the bleeding heart liberals holding power in Sacramento .
The Democrats continue to control the legislature in California with a flaming butch dyke liberal controlling their senate .
Pete told me the only way he thought change would happen is to sue the California Department of Motor Vehicles .
They are mandated by law to make sure no person is issued a driver 's license without proof of insurance .
If they were hit for a five or ten million dollar pay out in a lawsuit , they would immediately figure out how to verify a person has valid insurance before issuing a license and if the insurance is dropped for non payment , their license is immediately yanked .

Let me tell you the loophole .
People buy insurance on the monthly payment plan which I have no problem with except that they sign up , get the certificate , get a four year license and never make another payment until it 's time to renew their license .
The way the process works now , anyone walks into a DMV with a piece of paper claiming to be valid insurance , the clerk slogs through the process and without verifying the authenticity of these insurance documents , gives the individual a license .
No " proof " of insurance , just a piece of paper anyone can create on a home computer and printer .
The DMV does n't bother to verify if the certificate is real or phony and I know for a fact that illegals are using phony insurance documents printed up off home computers to acquire a driver 's license .
They buy stolen identities off the street corner to get a license and present these phony documents with a phony insurance certificate .
Let me tell you something else : the insurance companies DO NOT CARE or they would have done something about this mess decades ago .
All of these insurance companies have powerful lobby groups and they could put the pressure on these state houses big time , but they do n't .
They just continue to raise our premiums to pay for all these accidents by people who pay nothing .
We 're all paying through the nose for insurance because others want a free ride and that includes walking away from your accident without it costing them a penny .
We would all see lower premiums if everyone were insured .
For low income families , the states offer special discount insurance you and I can't apply for , but refuse to get because they do n't want to pay even the lowest rates ; see my column here .
What needs to be done ?
Victims of uninsured drivers need to come together and file class action lawsuits in every state .
My daughter will be suing the California DMV soon because we 've had enough .
The law mandates the DMV makes sure no one is issued a driver 's license without valid insurance and since they have failed to do their lawfully required job , they are at fault and must be held accountable .
The only time these bureaucracies react is when it costs them money .
Fine .
How do you find others in your state who are victims ?
Do we have one person out there who can volunteer to slap up a simple web site like www.victimsmotorvehiclelawsuit.com and send the link to me ?
I 'll make sure it gets displayed on my web site and in my columns .
This simple web site should have fifty states with a page where victims can list their name and contact info .
Contact each other and find an attorney to represent you in a class action lawsuit .
I feel confident there are good , decent attorneys out there who would represent a group of victims .
This is the only way to force this issue and stop this insanity .
I doubt the jury is going to be sympathetic to the DMV in my daughter 's lawsuit when they see how out of control this mess really is and that they and their loved ones are also at huge risk .
Motor Vehicle Departments in all 50 states need to verify insurance at the time a license is applied for and this can be done with a simple phone call .
Individual comes into the DMV with proof of insurance that contains a direct phone number to the insurance company .
The clerk at the DMV picks up the phone and dials that number , speaks to a rep at USAA , AAA , Geico or State Farm and gives the person 's name , policy number and verifies that this individual is indeed an insured and that the insurance is paid up .
I am fully aware of the misery of the lines at DMVs .
I lived in California for 40 years .
However , what is more important - another five minutes or getting hit like my daughter over and over and over by uninsured drivers ?
The insurance companies can also make this information available to the DMVs through a simple data base restricted to use only by the DMV .
The clerk at the DMV could then type in the insured 's name , policy number and verify on line in one minute whether or not the person at the counter has insurance and that it 's paid up , but this wo n't happen unless they 're forced by a law .
Additionally , insurance companies should be required by law to immediately pump out a simple document to the state DMV when an insured has missed a payment and is no longer covered .
This way the DMV can put it in their data base within 24 hours and stop another uninsured driver from obtaining a license and then going out and maiming or killing another American and simply walking away with a slap on the wrist .
Cross verification is a good thing .
This may sound like hard ball to you , but thousands of Americans are being slaughtered or seriously injured and maimed every year on roads and highways by those who refuse to pay for insurance and illegals who have obtained phony documents to get a license .
I have cried a million tears over my daughter 's accidents .
It hurts so bad to see your child hurt so bad .
These uninsured drivers get a slap on the hand or skip across the border while you and your loved one try to pick up the pieces or grieve the rest of your life because your loved one is dead and you barely have enough for the funeral and burial .
I get quite a bit of mail each year on this one issue from people reading my 2003 column and the stories will break your heart .
If you think you and your loved ones wo n't be victims , you 're playing Russian Roulette .
Look at those numbers above .
Check your state .
I 'm confident they will be in the double digits .

BBC science and environment correspondent
The BBC team sets up on Ayles Ice Island
In a season of record summer melting in the region , the two chunks have moved rapidly through the water - one of them covering 98 km ( 61 miles ) in a week .
Their progress has been tracked amid fears they could edge west towards oil and gas installations off Alaska .
The original Manhattan - sized berg ( 16 km by five km ; 10 miles by three miles ) broke off the Ayles Ice Shelf in 2005 .
SATELLITE IMAGERY
Pictures from space show the parting of the ice blocks
Enlarge Image
It is an unsettling thought that the very ice we landed on - and filmed on - for several hours has since ripped apart .
One of the scientists on that mission was Luke Copland of the University of Ottawa , and he told BBC News that the fact that the island had headed south was significant .
" The island became more vulnerable to breaking up with the warmer temperatures in more southerly latitudes , together with having less protection from the smaller amounts of surrounding sea-ice .
" It 's relatively unusual for the ice island to drift so far south so quickly - many ice islands in the past have stayed within the Arctic Ocean , or within the northern parts of the Queen Elizabeth Islands . "
Dr Copland said that the island had travelled so far south because of the small extent of Arctic ice this summer , influenced in turn by warmer conditions .
" The low sea-ice conditions this year have played a role .
The sea-ice normally blocks ice inflow into the Queen Elizabeth Islands , but with less ice this year it has made it easier for the Ice Island to make its way in . "
And his conclusion is clear : unlike ice islands which in the past might have lasted in the Arctic Ocean for 50 years or more , this one is destined to be shorter - lived .
" Ultimately , the ice island should break up faster because of the warmer temperatures - I 'd be surprised if it lasted more than a decade or so . "
Pictured in May , this block of ice has now split into two pieces
The team which landed on the Ayles ice block in May found it to have an average thickness of 42 - 45 m ( 138-148ft ) - the equivalent of the height of a 10 - storey building .
The great mass of ice has now split apart .
Arctic sea-ice shrank to the smallest area on record this year , as measured by satellite .
The US National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) said the minimum extent of 4.13 million sq km ( 1.59 million sq miles ) was reached on 16 September .
The figure shattered all previous satellite surveys , including the previous record low of 5.32 million sq km measured in 2005 .

If this article at CNN does n’t illustrate how screwed up people are when it comes to money , I do n’t know what does .
I keep hearing the argument that mortgage brokers are evil and have caused this real estate mess , and while that may be true , for every bad broker , there are just as many cases of people who are ridiculously irresponsible .
Of course this does n’t surprise me considering that I ’ve heard advertisements telling people not to bother saving and to just use the equity in their homes .
Take this scenario that the CNN article describes :
Jackie Castleberry wo n’t be playing Santa Claus this year .
She usually buys her grandchildren , nieces and nephews lots of gifts around the holidays — bicycles , educational games , clothes — but this year she is just struggling to keep her North Las Vegas , Nevada , house .
The interest rate on her four - bedroom home loan shot up in October and she is $ 6,000 behind on her payments .
She now owes $ 168,000 on her home , which once was worth $ 220,000 but is now worth about $ 150,000 .
In the past , when times were tough , she would borrow against her home ’s equity — that ’s no longer possible .
Ok , let ’s back up a second .
First of all , it says she is $ 6,000 behind on payments , and owes $ 168,000 and the house was recently worth $ 220,000 .
It does n’t say how much she initially borrowed , but assume she borrowed $ 200,000 .
Depending on the terms of her ARM , on a loan of that rough size , at a lower rate she was probably paying anywhere from $ 900 - $ 1,200 per month .
Even if her rate shot up to 10 % , her payment would likely be in the $ 1,500 - $ 1,800 per month .
Assuming the worst - case scenario , her mortgage payment may have jumped by $ 1,000 per month , and that is almost double .
Even so , the rate went up in October .
She has made at most , 3 mortgage payments since the increase , but has probably made two payments so far .
So unless her mortgage payment went up by 200 % or more , there is no way the rate hike alone could cause her to be $ 6,000 behind ..
While not impossible , it is very unlikely .
According to an MSN article :
Let ’s look at a three - year ARM on a $ 200,000 mortgage .
Taken out in 2003 at a rate of four percent , the monthly payment was $ 955 .
Now , the rate could jump as high as 7.6 percent , boosting the payment to $ 1,375 , a 44 percent increase .
This is a much more typical example , so using 10 % was just to show how much it would take to force someone to get $ 6,000 behind in just a few months .
Either she has been behind on her mortgage well before the rate increase , or she has borrowed every penny of equity possible and can’t even keep up on those payments .
Using Home Equity Like a Savings Account
The final note that I emphasized in that article is how she stated that when “ times got tough ” she would just tap into the equity in the home .
This leads me to believe that times got tough a lot , and if she had a $ 900 / month mortgage and was still falling into trouble paying the bills , she should n’t be in a house to begin with .
Granted , it looks like she has changed jobs and might not be making as much money as she used to , but you ca n’t just drain your home equity and then complain about your payments .
You need to either try to increase your income to get back to the point where you can pay the bills , or seriously consider a change in your living arrangements .
Even more troubling is that this is fairly widespread :
Castleberry is just one of thousands of homeowners nationwide who can no longer finance their spending by tapping into their once inflated , now depreciating home equity .
Well , if you are financing your spending and buying things like Christmas gifts by pulling equity out of your home , I ’m sorry , but I am not going to feel bad for you .
This type of behavior is n’t the mortgage broker ’s fault and it is n’t the interest rate ’s fault .
This is just an extremely irresponsible use of money .
At Least Some People are Able to Learn From Their Mistakes
Money ’s also tight for Deborah Vick , a Las Vegas home loan officer who says she ’s cut back on spending since the housing slowdown took hold and cut her salary in half .
She used to have a BMW and a Land Rover , but had to give up the BMW to a company that took over her $ 600 a month lease .
“ If you have to give up a luxury item , which you probably should n’t have purchased in the first place , you know , for me it was a learning experience , ” she said .
It is too bad more people ca n’t own up to their mistakes and simply take it as a learning experience .
Instead , we hear all of these stories about how it is all someone else ’s fault that some people can’t keep up with their bills .
But if you bought a house that you could hardly afford to begin with , and constantly sucked every penny of equity out of it , maybe you should step back and look at what happened and how you can improve it .

It is clear that the Bush administration 's policy of sanctions and tacit threat of war toward Iran has lost all credibility .
This became evident as soon as the National Intelligence Estimate released this month contradicted the White House depiction of the Iranian threat .
But the report is n't a total win for Iran .
Though it has nullified the threat of war and will embolden Iran in its march toward nuclear self - sufficiency , it may also undermine the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who thrives on international crisis and tension .
President Bush may take comfort in his rhetoric that nothing has changed .
Yet , since the release of the NIE , everything has changed .
A single intelligence report has done what all of Iran 's protestations could not :
It subverted America 's coercive policy .
The facts that the weapon design research has been suspended , and that the claim of an imminent threat was exaggerated , have undermined the administration 's case for war at home and abroad .
They have even dashed its hope of isolating the Islamic republic : Russia and China are resisting new UN sanctions , and some of America 's European allies may soon relax financial restrictions they agreed on to avert war with Iran .
To add to US concerns , a careful reading of the report indicates that Iran has seemingly suspended the weaponization aspect of its program but is still constructing an elaborate enrichment infrastructure – one that will give it the option to construct a bomb in the not - too - distant future .
Because the theocratic regime now feels immune from military retribution and is confronting a fragmented international community , it is likely to be fortified in its efforts to complete the fuel cycle .
Meanwhile , Iran is cooperating with inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency and is judged by the CIA to have suspended critical components of its nuclear network .
It has no reason to cease any of its activities .
But inside Iran , the NIE may have a negative effect .
The silver lining of the report may well be the weakening of Mr. Ahmadinejad and his politics of defiance .
The president might celebrate the report 's findings as a victory for Iran , but he can not take credit for it .
Nor will it in all likelihood favor him in his ongoing tug - of - war with political rivals .
It is not Ahmadinejad 's hard - line rhetoric and uncompromising posture in negotiations that are to credit for the change in Iran 's fortunes .
Rather , they come from a decision to halt the nuclear weapons program that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blessed in 2003 , when reformists were in charge .
With war no longer imminent , the supreme leader may see less value in Ahmadinejad 's confrontational politics .
And he , not the president , has the last word in foreign policy matters .
Parliamentary elections are scheduled for March .
Much rides on the outcome .
It can either give Ahmadinejad momentum going into the presidential elections in 2009 or turn him into a lame duck .
His international grandstanding not withstanding , Ahmadinejad 's presidency is in trouble .
His faction lost in the December 2006 elections for municipal councils and the Council of Experts that will choose the supreme leader 's successor .
Since then , popular discontent with his administration has continued to grow .
This week , former president Mohammad Khatami publicly criticized the president at the prominent Tehran University , whose students protested Ahmadinejad in September .
In a recent poll , two - thirds of those who had voted for him in 2005 indicated that they will not vote for him again .
Ahmadinejad 's populist rhetoric and confrontational style are popular in some quarters in Iran , but they do not override the growing disaffection with political suppression and economic mismanagement .
While the climate of fear has not sat well with voters , Ahmadinejad has even more to worry about from the fallout of Iran 's faltering economy .
With oil at more than $ 90 a barrel , Iranian financial reserves look good .
But the Iranian economy is struggling : Capital markets are in shambles , investment at rock bottom , and flight of capital an ongoing concern .
Meanwhile , populist policies have raised inflation , impoverishing the middle class without doing much for the poor .
Noisy labor unrest has become more frequent across the country , and there has been worry over a spike in crime .
So far , Ahmadinejad has successfully used the threat of war to suppress dissent and divert attention from domestic woes to international crises he is only too happy to fuel .
He has accused rivals of espionage and collaboration with the enemy .
He has blamed economic hardships on sanctions – which he expects Iranians would be willing to endure in a climate of war .
But as a result of the NIE , Iranians may conclude that there will be no war , no new sanctions , and perhaps even a relaxation of financial restrictions .
And they may begin to put up with less and demand more from their government .
Iranians supported Ahmadinejad when it looked like the US was gunning for war , but they will probably not support their president if it turns out he is the one looking for trouble .
They want prosperity and stability and will take Ahmadinejad to task for the failures of his administration , unfulfilled expectations , inflation , unemployment , and suppression .
At first glance , the NIE appears to have undermined the Bush administration 's hard - line approach toward Iran .
But the irony is that Washington now has the ability to further undermine Ahmadinejad while regulating Iran 's nuclear program through diplomacy and dialogue .
Suddenly , Washington may be facing a Tehran that is unyielding on its nuclear prerogatives but is also more pragmatic .
The US should seize the moment with an offer of comprehensive negotiations between the two countries and the prospect of rapprochement .
These carrots will not just diminish the power of hardliners such as Ahmadinejad ; it will also provide a mechanism to ensure that Iran complies with its nonproliferation commitments .

Reduces the time it takes to return to the user ’s session when using the Photo screensaver , making it comparable to other screensavers .
Removes the delay that sometimes occurs when a user unlocks their PC .
Improves overall media performance by reducing many glitches .
In SP1 , PC administrators are able to modify the network throttling index value for the MMCSS ( Multimedia Class Scheduling Service ) , allowing them to determine the appropriate balance between network performance and audio / video playback quality .
Windows Vista SP1 includes a new compression algorithm for the RDP ( Remote Desktop Protocol ) that helps reduce network bandwidth required to send bitmaps or images via RDP .
The compression , which can be selected by administrators via Group Policy settings , is transparent to all RDP traffic , and typically reduces the size of the RDP stream by as much as 25 - 60 % , based on preliminary test results .
The Windows Vista SP1 install process clears the user - specific data that is used by Windows to optimize performance , which may make the system feel less responsive immediately after install .
As the customer uses their SP1 PC , the system will be retrained over the course of a few hours or days and will return to the previous level of responsiveness .
SP1 addresses a number of customer performance concerns with new print driver technologies , including XPS - based printing .
Security Improvements
Windows Vista SP1 includes all previously released Security Bulletin fixes which affect Windows Vista .
SP1 includes Secure Development Lifecycle process updates , where Microsoft identifies the root cause of each security bulletin and improves our internal tools to eliminate code patterns that could lead to future vulnerabilities .
Service Pack 1 includes supported APIs by which third - party security and malicious software detection applications can work alongside Kernel Patch Protection on 64 - bit versions of Windows Vista .
These APIs have been designed to help security and non-security ISVs develop software that extends the functionality of the Windows kernel on 64 - bit systems , in a documented and supported manner , and without disabling or weakening the protection offered by Kernel Patch Protection .
Improves the security of running RemoteApp™ programs and desktops by allowing RDP files to be signed .
Administrators now have the control to differentiate the user experience based on the publisher ’s identity .
Data Execution Protection ( DEP ) is a memory - protection feature available beginning with Windows XP and Server 2003 .
SP1 improves security with a new set of Win32 APIs to allow programmatic control over a process ’s DEP policy .
This will provide application developers with finer control on a process ’s DEP settings for security , testability , compatibility , and reliability .
Improves the trustworthiness of data presented in Windows Security Center ( WSC ) by ensuring that only authenticated security applications can communicate with WSC .
Improves security on wired networks by enabling single sign on ( SSO ) for authenticated wired networks .
The single sign on experience presents the user with a single point of credential entry rather than being double prompted for local and network logon .
For customers upgrading from Windows XP to Windows Vista SP1 , the MSRT ( Malicious Software Removal Tool ) will not run as part of the upgrade .
Rather the up - to - date MSRT offered monthly by Windows Update will help protect PCs .
The cryptographic random number generation is improved to gather seed entropy from more sources , including a Trusted Platform Module ( TPM ) when available , and replaces the general purpose pseudo - random number generator ( PRNG ) with an AES - 256 counter mode PRNG for both user and kernel mode .
Improves security in smart card scenarios : o Introduction of a new PIN channel to securely collect smart card PINs via a PC .
This new capability mitigates a number of attacks that today would require using an external PIN reader to prevent .
o Enables smart cards that use biometric authentication instead of a PIN .
Improves security over Teredo interface by blocking unsolicited traffic by default .
This has already been addressed in a Security Update for Windows Vista ( KB935807 ) .
Improves BitLocker Drive Encryption by offering an additional multi-factor authentication method that combines a key protected by the TPM ( Trusted Platform Module ) with a Startup Key stored on a USB storage device and a user - generated Personal Identification Number ( PIN ) .
Enhanced the BitLocker encryption support to volumes other than bootable volumes in Windows Vista ( for Enterprise and Ultimate SKUs ) .
Improves the OCSP ( Online Certificate Status Protocol ) implementation such that it can be configured to work with OCSP responses that are signed by trusted OCSP signers , separate from the issuer of the certificate being validated .
Enables a standard user to invoke the CompletePC Backup application , provided that user can supply administrator credentials .
Previously , only administrators could launch the application .
The Remote Desktop client in Windows Vista SP1 provides user interface improvements for user and server authentication .
The RDP client streamlines the multiple steps end users must follow to providing their credentials to Windows Server 2003 ( or earlier ) Terminal Servers , and simplifies the management of previously saved credentials .
Support for New Technologies and Standards
Adds support for new strong cryptographic algorithms used in IPsec.
SHA - 256 , AES - GCM , and AES - GMAC for ESP and AH , ECDSA , SHA - 256 , and SHA - 384 for IKE and AuthIP .
Adds the NIST SP 800-90 Elliptical Curve Cryptography ( ECC ) pseudo - random number generator ( PRNG ) to the list of available PRNG in Windows Vista .
Adds support for SSTP ( Secure Sockets Tunnel Protocol ) , a remote access VPN tunneling protocol that will be part of Microsoft ’s RRAS ( Routing and Remote Access Service ) platform .
SSTP helps provide full - network VPN remote access connections over SSL , removing some of the VPN connectivity challenges that other VPN tunnels face traversing NAT , web proxies , and firewalls .
Adds full support for the latest IEEE draft of 802.11n wireless networking .
Adds support for obtaining identity and invoke identity UI from an inner method via a new EAPHost runtime API as well as a configuration UI for tunnel methods .
These APIs are useful for developers working on tunneling / multi- phased EAP authentication methods as well as those who implement networking supplicants which consume EAP authentications .
Adds support for Windows Smartcard Framework to enable compliance with the EU
Digital Signature Directive and National ID / eID .
Adds support for the Parental Controls Games Restrictions for ratings from the Korean Game Rating Board ( GRB ) .
Enhances TCP
Chimney network card support so that a TCP Chimney network card can also support Compound TCP .
Adds support in the Wireless Client for a new FIPS ( Federal Information Processing ) compliant mode .
This mode is FIPS 140 - 2 compliant because it moves the cryptographic processing from the wireless network card to an existing FIPS - approved cryptographic library .
Enhances Windows Firewall and IPsec to use the new cryptographic algorithms that are Suite B compliant .
Updated drivers are delivered primarily via Windows Update and directly from hardware vendors , not as part of a service pack .
However , a small number of critical drivers are included as part of Windows Vista ( e.g. , display drivers , audio drivers ) and some of these have been updated .
Desktop Administration and Management
Allows users and administrators to control which volumes the disk defragmenter runs on .
Allows users and administrators using Network Diagnostics to solve the most common file sharing problems , not just network connection problems .
Enables polling of RMS server at regular intervals to identify new templates and download them to the local template store .
Previously these templates were pushed to clients via a combination of Group Policy and scripting .
Additionally SP1 provides an API for applications to query and access template in the template store .
Windows Vista SP1 includes a new Security Policy ( UAC : Allow UAccess ) , which allows applications to prompt for elevation without using the secure desktop .
This allows a remote helper to enter administrative credentials during a Remote Assistance session .
Allows administrators to configure NAP Clients to : Receive updates from Windows Update or Microsoft Update , in addition to WSUS ( Windows Server Update Services ) , as is the case for Windows Vista today .
Define the time a client has to retrieve and submit Statements of Health .
This allows the NAP client to respond in time when a particular connection has a timeout requirement .
Use DNS server records to discover health registration authority ( HRA ) servers when there are no HRA ’s configured through local configuration or group policy .
Allow healthy clients used by the Help Desk to establish IPSec connections to unhealthy machines to help resolve problems .
This improves the supportability of NAP by allowing Help Desk technicians with health compliant machines to establish connections ( e.g. remote desktop , file share ) to help resolve issues .
Allows administrators to add a WSD ( Web Services for Devices ) Print Device to remote Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 machines .
This can be accomplished by using the Print Management Console .
Allows the administrators to use a new admin flag to allow WMI scripted enumeration of all contents in the CSC cache .
This will enhance WMI scripted administration for offline folders in Windows Vista .
Previously this was available only through the COM API .
Improves printing to local printers from within a Terminal Server session .
Allows users to rename or delete folders while working offline with redirected folders .
This functionality is important to users that use Folder Redirection and work in offline mode for extended periods of time .
This functionality is disabled by default but can be enabled by enabling a registry setting .
Enhances the existing Vista EAPHost service by including an EAP ( Extensible Authentication Protocol ) Certification Program ( ECP ) Detection Mechanism .
This mechanism makes delivery of EAP Methods submitted to the ECP available through Windows Update .
Adds a WMI interface as a replacement for the MoveUser.exe tool which was removed from Windows Vista .
This allows customers to remap an existing workgroup or domain user account profile to a new domain user account profile .
Allows an administrator to configure properties of a network , such as the name , and deploy it network - wide via a Group Policy snap - in .
Allows KMS ( Key Management Service ) to run within a Virtual Machine environment .
Setup and Deployment Improvements
Enables global organizations to more easily deploy SP1 in a multi-lingual environment , as SP1 includes all 36 language packs .
However , this change contributes to the increased size of the standalone package .
Enables users to get updated Help content via a separate downloadable package .
This package will be released around SP1 release .
Enables support for hotpatching , a reboot - reduction servicing technology designed to maximize uptime .
It works by allowing Windows components to be updated ( or " patched " ) while they are still in use by a running process .
Hotpatch - enabled update packages are installed via the same methods as traditional update packages , and will not trigger a system reboot .
Improves migration and upgrade scenarios relating to the component that allows alternate text input “ modalities ” like speech , handwriting , and multi - byte character input editors in applications that were not written specifically to support them .
Improves OS deployment by enabling 64 - bit versions of Windows Vista to be installed from a 32 - bit OS .
This will allow IT professionals to maintain just a single WinPE image .
This will allow IT professionals to maintain just a single WinPE image .
Improves OS deployment by supporting the installation of offline boot critical storage drivers .
WinPE will automatically look to a hidden partition for drivers .
It will search that partition recursively , and if boot critical drivers are present they will be loaded .
Non-boot critical drivers will be picked up and staged , but not loaded prior to the OS coming online .
Improves patch deployment by retrying failed updates in cases where multiple updates are pending and the failure of one update causes other updates to fail as well .
Enables reliable OS installation by optimizing OS installers so that they are run only when required during patch installation .
Fewer installers operating results in fewer points of potential failure during installation , which leads to more robust and reliable installation .
Improves overall install time for updates by optimizing the query for installed OS updates .
Improves robustness during the patch installation by being resilient to transient errors such as sharing violations or access violations .
Improves robustness of transient failures during the disk cleanup of old OS files after install .
Improves the uninstallation experience for OS updates by improving the uninstallation routines in custom OS installation code .
Improves reliability of OS updates by making them more resilient to unexpected interruptions , such as power failure .
Improved instrumentation allows additional data to be sent to Microsoft via the CEIP ( Customer Experience Improvement Program ) when enabled .
This telemetry data led to the identification of numerous issues that are addressed in SP1 and resulted in improvement in the reliability of OS servicing .
( CEIP is respectful of personally identifiable information and adheres to terms discussed in the EULA . )
After the SP1 version of the OPK ( OEM pre-installation kit ) is installed , further OPK updates will not be required if a servicing stack update is issued .
( The servicing stack is the underlying set of binaries used to update the system ) .
Post SP1 , offline images may be updated using the servicing stack binaries contained in the image rather than the servicing stack binaries in the OPK .
Interoperability Improvements
SP1 exposes Ideal Send Backlog ( ISB ) information to Winsock2 clients to enable better throughput over high bandwidth , high latency links when communicating with Windows Server 2008 .
Applications that are modified to use the new ISB info will provide better throughput when sending large amounts of data over such links to other Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 machines .
Applications not modified to take advantage of this change will function as before .
SP1 includes throughput improvements to Send in TransmitFile / TransmitPackets and ftp.exe , when communicating with Windows Server 2008 over high bandwidth , high latency links .
Ftp.exe and other applications using TransmitFile / TransmitPackets on Windows Vista SP1 will achieve better throughput when sending files over such links to other Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 machines .
Feature or API Changes
GPMC ( Group Policy Management Console ) will be uninstalled with Service Pack 1 and GPEdit will default to Local Group Policy editing .
Following these changes , SP1 users can download an updated version of GPMC which will include new Group Policy capabilities including adding comments to GPOs or individual settings and searching for specific Group Policy settings .
The MSN Connection Center Dial - up Internet Access connector was removed from the Windows Vista Connection Wizard .
Includes a new Offline Files interface that exports the dirty byte count for a file that is modified offline .
This interface is exposed both through the COM APIs and WMI provider for Offline Files .
General Improvements and Enhancements
SP1 includes a number of changes which allow computer manufacturers and consumers to select a default desktop search program similar to the way they currently select defaults for third - party web browsers and media players .
That means that in addition to the numerous ways a user could access a third party search solution in Windows Vista , they can now get to their preferred search results from additional entry points in the Start Menu and Explorer Windows in Windows Vista with SP1 .
3rd party software vendors simply need to register their search application using the newly provided protocol in Windows Vista SP1 to enable these options for their customers .

3rd party software vendors simply need to register their search application using the newly provided protocol in Windows Vista SP1 to enable these options for their customers .
With SP1 , Windows Vista will report the amount of system memory installed rather than report the amount of system memory available to the OS .
Therefore 32 - bit systems equipped with 4GB of RAM will report all 4BG in many places throughout the OS , such as the System Control Panel .
However , this behavior is dependent on having a compatible BIOS , so not all users may notice this change .
Therefore 32 - bit systems equipped with 4GB of RAM will report all 4BG in many places throughout the OS , such as the System Control Panel .
However , this behavior is dependent on having a compatible BIOS , so not all users may notice this change .
SP1 reduces the number of UAC ( User Account Control ) prompts from 4 to 1 when creating or renaming a folder at a protected location .
Improvements in the Licensing User Interface and User Experience including more details in the help about activation and what happens if user does not activate ; more detailed and descriptive dialog text ; raw error codes replaced with easily comprehensible text .
SP1 modifies the text in the Ultimate Extras Control Panel to describe the Ultimate Extras program in more general terms .
Upon scanning a photo with the Vista scanning experience , SP1 will open Explorer rather than opening Windows Photo Gallery .
Users are now required to enter a password hint during the initial setup of Windows Vista SP1 .
This change was made based on feedback from top PC manufactures that many customers frequently do not remember their password and because the administrator account is turned off by default on Windows Vista , these users do not have a way to access to their PCs .
A password hint helps avoid this frustrating scenario .
Improves compatibility with 3rd party diagnostic tools that rely on raw sockets by applying the same delivery logic to control ( ICMP v4 and v6 ) and regular packages .
While not reflected in the initial release candidate this week , we will also be making changes effective with SP1 in how we differentiate the experience customers have using non-genuine versions of our software .
This is based on feedback we heard from volume license customers in particular as part of our Windows Genuine Advantage program .
Also coming with SP1 but not in the current release candidate , we will also be including updates that deal with two exploits we have seen , which can affect system stability for our customers .
The OEM Bios exploit , which involves modifying system files and the BIOS of the motherboard to mimic a type of product activation performed on copies of Windows that are pre-installed by OEMs in the factory .
The Grace Timer exploit , which attempts to reset the “ grace time ” limit between installation and activation to something like the year 2099 in some cases .
Windows Vista Alignment with Windows Server 2008
Windows Vista is aligned with Windows Server 2008 , meaning that many files are common to both products .
A result of this design is that there are cases where a common binary is modified to enable a server scenario that has limited or no effect on Windows Vista SP1 capabilities .
Here are few examples :
Schwedischer Uni-Sex
Wir sind so frei
Stockholms Studenten können diese Woche an " Sextagen " teilnehmen - mitten auf dem Campus .
Die Veranstalter locken mit Vorträgen über Pornos und den weiblichen Orgasmus , mit Dildo - Ständen und Gleitcreme - Pröbchen .
Schockierend oder typisch schwedisch ?
IGNORE the fuss over the news last week — the United Nations ’ AIDS - fighting agency admits to overestimating the global epidemic by six million people .
That was a sampling error , an epidemiologist ’s Dewey Defeats Truman .
Look instead at the fact that glares out from the Orwellian but necessary revision of the figures for earlier years .
There it is , starkly : AIDS has peaked .
New infections reached a high point in the late 1990 ’s — by the best estimate , in 1998 .
There must have been such moments in the past — perhaps A.D. 543 , when Constantinople realized it would survive the Plague of Justinian , or 1351 in medieval Europe , when hope dawned that the Black Death would not claw down everyone .
Eleven years ago , there was a milestone moment in AIDS history when Andrew Sullivan wrote an article in The New York Times Magazine titled “ When Plagues End . ”
It argued that a new treatment , the triple therapy cocktail , meant it was finally possible to envision AIDS as a chronic illness , not an inevitable death sentence .
Jeff Gatlain , a Catholic priest in KY , goes public in his criticisms of Bill Donohue on C&L .
I asked for someone in the Catholic community to speak out against his violent hate speech after his attacks of " Cavallaro " on Anderson Cooper last week and Jeff came forward .
That 's a big step for him to take .
" As a Christian , a Catholic Priest , I stand in opposition to any and all hateful speech used by anyone , especially when they do so in the name of Jesus .
I do not believe that one can claim to be a disciple of Jesus and at the same time deride , mock , insult , or threaten violence against another person .
Mr. Donohue clearly makes hateful remarks as well as violent comments towards Mr. Cavallaro and as such he insults God , his fellow Catholics and humanity for that point .
Proclaiming the Salvation of Jesus means that we are to refrain from such vile speech .
One cannot preach the love of Jesus while cursing one 's neighbor .
The two cannot co-exist .
To continually use hateful , crude , violent language is indicative of what dwells within one 's heart .
Mr. Donohue speaks only for himself and not the Catholic Church . "
Would that quote be okay ?
I am a pretty low key person and I strive to be a force of unity and healing in the parishes I serve .
I just do not want to become yet another screaming voice like Mr. Donohue .

Mail :: RFC822::Address : regexp - based address validation
Mail :: RFC822:: Address is a Perl module to validate email addresses according to the RFC 822 grammar .
It provides the same functionality as RFC :: RFC822 :: Address , but uses Perl regular expressions rather that the Parse : : RecDescent parser .
This means that the module is much faster to load as it does not need to compile the grammar on startup .
Download Mail:: RFC822::Address-0.4.tar.gz or read the documentation .
If you want to test the behaviour of the module , an online version is available .
The grammar described in RFC 822 is surprisingly complex .
Implementing validation with regular expressions somewhat pushes the limits of what it is sensible to do with regular expressions , although Perl copes well .
The regular expression below shows the complexity , although its inclusion on this page has caused some confusion :
I did not write this regular expression by hand .
It is generated by the Perl module by concatenating a simpler set of regular expressions that relate directly to the grammar defined in the RFC .
The regular expression does not cope with comments in email addresses .
The RFC allows comments to be arbitrarily nested .
A single regular expression cannot cope with this .
The Perl module pre-processes email addresses to remove comments before applying the mail regular expression .
I do not maintain the regular expression below .
There may be bugs in it that have already been fixed in the Perl module .

Abstract
Wheat is the most important cereal crop of the world .
Wheat grows well in different region in Bangladesh .
Wheat cultivation is greatly affected by sowing depth .
Sowing depth significantly influenced the seedling emergence and vigor index .
Sowing seed deeper than 4 cm delayed & reduced seedling emergence & seed production .
Seed placed at 8 cm depth resulted a greater degree ( 82 % ) of failure in emergence .
Sowing at variable depths causes appreciable differences in grain yield .
Sowing deeper than 4 cm greatly reduced grain yield .
Plant emerged from 4 cm depth had produced the highest grain yield which was attributed to greater number of spikes per unit area and seeds per spikes .
Deeper sowing caused in the number of seminal root but the total root length was significantly reduced .
Deep sowing causes unnecessary elongation of stem between the seed and secondary roots .
As a result the food reserves of the grain are taxed severely and seedling may even fail to emerge .
When sowing at 4 inches reduced emergences by almost 40 % .
Key Word : wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. ) , yield , root , water , seedling growth .
Introduction
Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. ) is the second most important cereal crop of Bangladesh .
It was cultivated in about 1.93 million acres in 1995 - 96 and the total yield was about 1.57 million tones ( MOA , 1997 ) .
In the beginning of wheat cultivation in Bangladesh in early seventies , the yield increases was rather dramatic ( Swaminathan , 1987 ; CIMMYT , 1982 ) , but for mid eighties the area under wheat and production seem to have remained static or registered a slight decreasing trend ( Ahmed et al. , 1987 ) .
Majority of wheat area is rain fed ( Guler , 1987 ) and seedbed preparation for sowing seeds is often constrained by lack of soil moisture .
During land preparation and immediately after seed sowing moisture of the top soil runs out quickly and the seeds particularly those placed at shallower depths are at risk of germination .
The risk can be avoided by deep sowing .
On the other hand , deep sowing is often reported to have adverse effects on crop establishment as well as yield .
In the light of the above discussion , the present study has been designed to examine the performance of wheat with the following objectives :
- To find out the effect of depth of sowing on the stand establishment , root systems development and yield of wheat .
- To the influence of sowing depth on the performance of wheat .
- To find out the depth of sowing depth that give higher yield .
Review of Literature
Wheat is a non traditional crop and its popularity as commodity in Bangladesh is very recent .
The spectacular growths in wheat production a ten fold increasing during 1981 - 83 period ( CYMMIT , 1982 ) , relied on the package of production technology mainly imported from outside . ( Saunderas , 1988 ) .
During the recent year however it has evident that crop improvement technology is insufficient to increase national wheat yield or even to sustain advance previously made superior germplasm .
Although systematic research on wheat improvement started in mid 60s , works on agronomic practices in what seems to be too inadequate ( Saunderas , 1988 ) . a part from research from varietals improvement .
A few studies have carried on agronomic aspect of wheat production which mainly focus on the seed rate , sowing time , cropping system ( Saunderas , 1988 ; Annonymous , 1990 ) .
but work relating to seed size or sowing depth effect on yield performance are either lacking or highly inadequate .
In this chapter we review some of the available reports .
In absence of pertinent reports based on work done in Bangladesh the relevant research findings from other countries have been reviewed .
An extensive survey conducted in wheat grown area in Tangail showed that in the seed bed most seeds are placed beyond 8 cm plough zone ( Matsunaga et al. , 1989 ) . generally the seeds are broadcast and incorporated in the soil working with ploughing and cross ploughing and resulting an uneven distribution of seeds into the plough zone .
In most cases it is found that the upper layer of the soil dries quickly after land preparation .
In that situation during sowing the seeds which fall on the shallower depth are at risk of germination due to less imbibition and seed soil contact .
On the other hand the seeds which fall below the optimum depth fall to emerge .
If the seeds are placed deeper than the length of coleoptiles the shoot have to push or displaced the superficial mechanical obstacles .
( Boouaziz et al. , 1990 ) .
However in wheat work relating only sowing depth and plant performance in wheat has been reported recently ( Saunderas , 1988 ) .
in the study 200 seeds are sown in macro plots at variable depth 2,4,6 and 8 cm. depth of sowing affected germination and emergence indicating that sowing at 8 cm was clearly detrimental .
Inadequate stand and even failure in stand establishment may result due to excessive mechanical impedance by dry surface seals ( Arndt , 1965 ) , or in absence of surface seal due to unfavorable soil moisture , since the soil water supply improves with depth , advantage should be gained by deep planting but since mechanical impedance also increase with depth ( Arndt , 1965 ; Hamid & Mohiuddin , 1992 ) .
Short coleoptile is primarily responsible for poor seedling emergence under dry land farming ( Singh et al. , 1985 ) .
Spikes per plant , spikelets per spike and kernels per spike at higher at sub optimal seeding densities ( Darwinkel , 1978 and 1980 ; Wiley & Holiday , 1971 ) and this sub optimal density depend mainly upon seeding depth and seed bed condition .
Sowing depth contribute greatly to the crops stand establishment .
Farmers seeding rate often exceed recommended dose but optimum population rarely occurred .
Tillage level , soil aggregate , size distribution in the seed bed , seedling vigor , seed health and planting depth are the major determinants of seed emergence and stand establishment ( Mccloy , 1980 )
Turner et al . ( 1982 ) observe that the cultivar differed in the potential of their coleoptile and mesopityle to elongate .
The root length & root diameter at different growth stages determine the water and nutrient uptake capacity of the plant .
The seminal roots that grow in the early stage of the wheat , their functions being concerned with absorption of water and nutrient for the growth of the young plant appear to be functional throughout life of plant .
The extent of their development and depth to which they descend is influenced by the texture of the soil and depth at which the seeds are sown ( Percival , 1985 ) .
Hoque et al. , ( 1992 ) examined the influence of sowing depth under varied seed bed condition , soil aggregate size and distribution greatly influence emergence and stand establishment of cereal crops .

Eclipse gets its biggest update on Friday .
The Europa update to the Eclipse Framework will wrap in 17 million lines of code spanning 21 projects , more than doubling last summer 's first synchronized release , Callisto , with a mere seven million lines and 10 projects .
Headlines will focus on new projects such as the dynamic language toolkit for the Web 2.0 crowd , SOA tool project , and the Mylin task - focused user interface for improved multi-tasking ( the full Europa list is here ) .
But it the steps towards a roles - based environment that mark a fresh departure for this latest Eclipse update .
Mylin plays a pivotal part in this , as it should help tackle one of the outstanding problems with Eclipse - the large number of projects and plug-ins have created a visually confusing and difficult - to - use environment for some .
" We are widening the breadth of Eclipse [ with Europa ] , " director of marketing Ian Skerrett told The Register .
" Europa will widen that gap on everyone else because it brings us into new areas on the server .
Microsoft is imitating us ... they still have governance problems .
You can't enforce licensing restrictions on capabilities , which is what they 've done with the [ Visual Studio ] Express product .
The platform needs to be open so people can innovate . "
Europa will introduce four download packages consisting of different projects , subprojects and Eclipse infrastructure elements .
The packages target Java developers with the Java Development Tools ( JDT ) subproject and an XML editor bundle ; J2EE programmers with J2EE deployment tools , a Java IDE and Mylin ; C/C++ developers with an IDE that replaces the need to separately download the Eclipse platform and Equinox ; and those targeting devices and PCs get a Rich Client Platform bundle of source code , Mylin , XML editor and plug - in development environment .
Another criticism of Eclipse is the manageability of plug-ins , which can slow the performance of the IDEs ( integrated development environments ) of individual developers .
IDE .
Eclipse plug-ins range in number between 883 and 1,400 , depending on sites .
The next synchronized Eclipse update , called Ganymede and due in June 2008 , will focus on management and provisioning , in addition to adding yet - more projects to the mass update .
Among the new projects are expected a Rich Ajax platform , SOA runtime project and more server capabilities .
One goal is to turn Eclipse into a runtime environment for server side applications , moving beyond the original IDE remit and latter rich client focus . ®
Rare Chinese Monkey Picked Tea
Legend says that over ten centuries ago , upon seeing his master pick tea leaves , a monkey climbed up and collected the leaves and brought them down for his master .
Whether it be legend or simply a cheaper form of labor , the story has turned into a rare product that you can purchase and enjoy .
Monkey Picked Tea is a rare tea that is carefully picked by specially trained monkeys in a remote mountain region of China .
It is claimed that none of the monkeys are mistreated or harmed in this process .
They say that the monkeys are treated as respected members of their family .
We have not been able to find any pictures of any monkeys actually picking tea leaves , but we did find this one video that shows a girl whip a camera around and claim the monkey was picking tea… you be the judge .

After many false starts mobile number portability ( MNP ) was implemented in Pakistan recently ( March 23 to be precise ) .
MNP allows users to switch mobile phone company while keeping their existing mobile number .
MNP was one of the key items of Pakistan ’s Mobile Cellular Policy of 2004 .
The implementation of MNP was a huge and expensive undertaking as it requires significant system changes and all phone companies have to agree to rules and tariffs for routing calls .
Pakistan Telecom Authority ( PTA ) is the government agency which was responsible for overseeing the MNP initiative .
In the beginning there was reluctance from the big mobile companies and PTCL and there were disagreements about the tariffs , which caused delays ( see timeline below ) .
There are many possible reasons why users would want to switch providers – and of course most users like to keep their existing phone number when switching – therefore the term porting .
MNP is considered a major achievement for any mobile market and it is anticipated to shake things up in the already heated mobile market .
In US for instance local phone number portability was implemented first around 1997 and Mobile number portability came fairly recently ( Nov 2003 ) after mobile companies were mandated to do so by FCC , the US communications regulatory agency .
Japan launched MNP in 2006 and experienced aggressive – even misleading – marketing tactics .
India is still far away from MNP due to a number of technical and regulatory hurdles .
Research from Japan and India indicates that about 30 % of subscribers would switch providers if they could keep their numbers .
MNP poses many technical and administrative challenges for the operators but provides a fair and competitive landscape for consumers and operators .
Usually MNP increases the potential of churn ( loss of customers ) thereby forcing service operators to work hard to retain their customers .
Within a few months winners and losers will emerge in Pakistan .
2004 : Cellular Telecom policy requires MNP implementation by Jan 2006 .

PTA sets first Quarter 2007 as the new target for MNP implementation March 2007 : MNP launched !
As with all other MNP implementations , there will be issues , system glitches and confusion .
The administrative processes for handling portability requests can be complex and hard to track at times .
I hope that the companies provide an easy - to - understand guide for their consumer to get through the portability process .
I ’m sure most consumers will agree that these teething pains are worth the freedom to choose their favorite phone company while retaining their phone number !
There are 4 steps in the process :
Certain requirements need to be met before MNP can be requested for a phone account ; such as : proof of ownership , no conflict due to existing agreement , number should have been in service for at least 60 days etc .
Fill out a form and present it to the provider to which you wish to port – called Recipient Network .
Pay the porting fee ( varies by company , up to a few hundred rupees ) .
A Number Portability Request ( NPR ) is launched by the Recipient Network and you are given a SIM and a tentative time ( at least 4 days – but could be up to 21 days ) to when you can start to use new mobile provider network on this SIM .
Information about MNP is slowly getting to the consumers .
There are still some open questions .
In case of Pakistan each mobile company has its own prefix , such as 0333 for Ufone .
This helped users to identify the phone company when making calls .
The rates for outgoing phone calls are cheaper for in - network calls and higher for calls to another company ’s number , such as Telenor to Warid ( Incoming calls are free ) .
MNP makes this a bit tricky – it will be a while before this becomes clear .
MNP Resources : PTA , Mobilink , Telnor .

The World Tonight 's Paul Moss has been in the Republic of Ireland looking at the impact of immigration .
Siobhan O'Donahue was in a hurry .
Immigration is changing Irish schools ( pic : Educate Together )
Trying to nail her down for an interview , you get the impression this is a permanent state of affairs - rushing from one meeting to another , dealing with a succession of increasingly urgent cases .
The director of a drop - in centre that looks after immigrants in Dublin , Siobhan says they are picking up the problems that nobody has sought fit to deal with : schooling , housing , access to healthcare .
She argues that Ireland invited immigrants to come and work , without giving any thought to their wider impact .
" We saw them essentially as units of labour , " she says .
" We did n't see them as people with social and community needs .
" The planning and infrastructure was n't put in place . "
And there are plenty of people to cater for .
This is a country that had few foreign residents right up until the late 1980s .
But then came an economic boom , and a relatively - poor , agricultural nation became instead the " Celtic Tiger " .
They take the money they 're earning back out of the country
Dublin local
Listen to Paul Moss ' report on Irish Immigration for BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight
The result is that now , more than one in seven people in Ireland was born outside the country .
The largest group are Poles , about 65,000 at the most recent count , but there are Lithuanians , Czechs , and also workers from beyond the EU , from Africa and Asia .
Immigrants ' anger
In fact , the percentage of immigrants here rose faster in 10 years than it did in Britain over half a century .
" The entire system has been based on a declining population , " says Paul Rowe , the director of an education charity .
There 's no one country you can point to that 's actually got migration correct
Conor Lenihan
Irish Minister for Integration
" The system is trying to reconfigure itself for expansion in a very short period of time .
It is a huge change . "
And he should know .
Last August , Paul Rowe 's charity , Educate Together , had to set up a primary school in just four weeks .
The Education Department had belatedly realised there were not enough places for immigrants ' children in the town of Balbriggan .
They had been turned down by the local schools .
Like most in Ireland , they are run by the Church , and take Catholic children as a first choice .
The result was that they ended up in an emergency facility , one that caters almost exclusively for boys and girls of African or Arab origin .
" I would rather my children knew how Irish children live , " says one mother there , disappointed to see her son going to school only with other black children .
Another was more angry : " They did n't plan it the way it should be , " she argues .
" Immigrants are really contributing to the country 's economy .
They should be provided with the proper amenities . "
' Enormous turbulence '
The Irish government insists it takes these complaints seriously .
We have to be calm , we have to avoid getting hysterical - the real test of our society is coming
Fintan O'Toole
Irish Times columnist
This year , it appointed a minister for integration , Conor Lenihan .
He is perfectly frank about the challenges Ireland faces , adjusting so fast and so late in the day to mass immigration .
But he also sees an advantage - that Ireland can learn from others ' mistakes .
" There 's no one country you can point to that 's actually got migration correct .
There 's a great opportunity for Ireland to choose its course , " he suggests .
But Mr Lenihan is also aware of the potential tensions if Ireland experiences a downturn , something many economists see on the horizon .
" The real danger is that employers might let go of Irish workers , as opposed to the foreigners , and that could cause enormous turbulence . "
Recession ' challenge '
In fact the signs of that turbulence are already apparent .
The most thorough European survey of attitudes to immigration showed that Irish people were averagely well - disposed to foreign workers , neither unusually welcoming nor unusually hostile compared to other EU countries .
The Irish government says it is doing its best to welcome migrants
But ask opinion on a Dublin street corner , and you will hear plenty of individuals whose attitude is decidedly resentful .
" They take the money they 're earning back out of the country , " I was told by one local .
" The Irish economy is losing . "
" The money 's all being given to foreigners , " says another .
" It 's not fair on the Irish public . "
Even those who support immigration are apprehensive .
The Irish Times columnist Fintan O'Toole believes passionately that the mass arrival of foreigners has benefited his country .
But he acknowledges the potential difficulties ahead .
" It 's easy to be upbeat and welcoming when the cake is getting bigger all the time .
The challenge is when you move into a period of recession .
" We have to be calm , we have to avoid getting hysterical .
The real test of our society is coming . "

Iraq was invaded in order to limit its oil production and thus keep world oil prices artificially high , a noted investigative journalist reports .
" Iraq 's output in 2003 , 2004 , and 2005 was less than produced under the restrictive oil - for - food program , " writes Greg Palast in his new book Armed Madhouse ( Plume ) .
Oil - for - food allowed Iraq to sell 2 million barrels per day during the 1995 to 2003 period .
" Whether by design or happenstance , this decline in [ Iraqi ] output has resulted in tripling the profits of the five US oil majors to $ 89 billion for a single year , 2005 , compared to pre-invasion 2002 , " Palast writes .
" When OPEC raises the price of crude , Big Oil makes out big time , " says Palast , who has contributed to BBC Television and the Guardian newspapers .
He points out the oil majors are not simply passive resellers of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) production but have reserves of their own which rise in tandem with oil prices .
" The rise in the price of oil after the first three years of the [ Iraq ] war boosted the value of the reserves of ExxonMobil Oil alone by just over $ 666 billion , " Palast wrote .
What 's more , Chevron Oil , " where [ Secretary of State ] Condoleezza Rice had served as a director , gained a quarter trillion dollars in value . "
Another big winner in the Iraq war is Saudi Arabia .
The war - stoked jump in oil prices , Palast writes , put $ 120 billion in Saudi Arabia 's treasury in 2004 , triple its normal take .
Among the big losers have been American motorists , now paying about $ 3.30 for a gallon ( 3.8 liters ) of gas .
The oil price spike has also punished US industry , costing America an estimated 1.2 million jobs .
" Higher borrowing costs for business since the beginning of the Iraq war are bleeding manufacturing investment , " Palast adds .
Rising oil prices are an anomaly .
The world 's petroleum reserves have doubled from 648 billion to 1.2 trillion barrels in the past 25 years , Palast reports .
According to free market laws of supply and demand , discovery of these immense new pools should cause prices to drop .
Big Oil 's interest is in " suppressing production , " Palast writes , stating " An international industry policy of suppressing Iraqi oil production has been in place since 1927 . "
Former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was described as threatening price stability by unilaterally increasing and decreasing production .
Iraq has 74 known oil fields but only 15 are in production and 526 known pools of oil of which only 125 have been drilled .
Again , only 15,000 rigs in Iraq are pumping up black gold , compared , for example , to 1 million rigs in Texas .
In 2005 , Iraq exported only 1.4 million barrels of oil daily , less than under Saddam , less than half its old OPEC quota , and less than a fourth of its ultimate capacity , Palast reports .
" Though technically owned by the Iraqis through their state oil company , we can expect the [ Iraqi ] crude to be gathered and controlled downstream by the same old hands , British Petroleum , Chevron , and other IOC 's [ international oil companies ] that first drew that nation 's borders , politely fulfilling Iraq 's quota assigned by the Saudis , no more , maybe less , " Palast writes .
In addition to clapping a lid on Iraqi production , Palast charges the US " promoted sabotage of oil piping , loading , and refining systems in Venezuela " to limit that country 's production .
Palast reminds that Venezuela , once the top exporter to the US , broke the back of the 1973 Arab oil embargo by replacing the oil withdrawn by Saudi Arabia .
" [ Venezuelan President Hugo ] Chavez , despised by [ US President George W. ]
Bush , was not likely to save Bush 's bacon by busting another embargo .
Therefore , Chavez had to go immediately , " Palast writes .
Palast says OPEC is a front for the international oil companies .
" If oil companies had created this cartel to fix prices , that would have made it a criminal conspiracy - cartels are illegal .
But when governments conspire for the same purpose , the illegal conspiracy turns into a legitimate " alliance " of sovereign states .
OPEC 's government cover makes the price fixing perfectly legal , and Big Oil reaps the rewards . "
Palast said Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations take Americans ' money at the pump , and in their heating and electric bills , and use it to buy up US government notes .
In 2005 , $ 243 billion in petro- dollars was collected from Americans by OPEC .
Foreigners then bought up $ 311 billion in US government debts , he said .
" All the goodies , from nuclear subs to tax cuts to war in Mesopotamia appear to be ' free ' to the taxpayer , " Palast writes .
" It 's all just put on the tab , the national debt , including the interest on it .
The actual cash needed to pay for these budget busters is first collected from US consumers via the hidden oil tax for which Mr. Bush takes no blame . "

little girl a name – Molly .
With less than six weeks to go before
the birth , the baby is kicking and it
brings Fran Lyon an undeniable thrill
of pleasure .
At least , it does now she finally feels
safe to enjoy it .
For all the innocent joys of impending motherhood
have been denied Fran since social workers
warned her four months ago that Molly would
be taken away ten minutes after birth and placed
with foster parents .
Fran , a third - year student doing a neuro - science
degree at Edinburgh University , is , to everyone
who knows her , a sociable , kind and intelligent
woman .
But to her local authority she is a danger
to herself and her baby .

Seven years ago Fran had an eating and selfharming
disorder and spent 13 months in a
psychiatric hospital followed by nine successful
months of counselling .
Now 22 , and with her emotional troubles behind
her , Fran is outraged that she should be judged a
risk to herself and her child despite a fistful of
medical reports that dispute this .
Last week , fearing
the worst , Fran moved from her home in
Hexham in Northumberland to Birmingham ,
where she hoped a different authority would treat
her more sympathetically .
But with the birth so close , she felt she could n't
take any risks with bureaucracy and on Wednesday ,
Fran took an even more drastic step .
She got
on a flight bound for Europe – and went into hiding .
Wary of revealing her whereabouts , Fran
agreed to talk about her nightmare in a lengthy
telephone call to The Mail on Sunday .

She will also
be seen in an exclusive report tomorrow evening
on Tonight With Trevor McDonald .
She said : " I would n't have done it unless I
absolutely had to .
Every time there was a twinge ,
I was absolutely petrified .
I just kept thinking ,
' Please do n't go into labour , please , not yet . '
It
was terrifying .
" It 's a lot better now that I 'm away .
Lots of
people suggested I should leave but I always
thought it was too extreme .
Then when I went to
Birmingham things were n't going to happen
quicklyenough .
Northumberland 's plan stood until
Birmingham made their own and I did n't have
vast amounts of time .
Now it 's such a relief not to
be constantly looking over my shoulder .
It has
been so fraught with other people 's interventions .
For the first time this will be just us : me
and Molly .
I just want to enjoy it .
I could never do
that before .
" For months I 've been reading a book
called Molly The Hungry Caterpillar
and feeling her kicking about .
It 's
lovely , but all the time the fear has been
in the back of my mind that these might
be the closest moments I will ever have
with her . "
Fran is in good health apart from suffering
a rare condition , angiodoema .
It
is possible her throat might swell and
she has been given tracheotomy equipment
in case of an incident .
For such a young woman , Fran seems
practical and level headed .
In just a few
days , she has organised a lease on an
apartment , had an appointment with a
midwife , booked a place at the local hospital
and made contact with Englishspeaking
mother - and - baby groups .
It is a considerable testimony to her
ability to cope – given what social services
had thrown at her .
So why did
Hexham Children 's Services feel it
necessary to take such draconian –
some might say menacing – steps
against a young woman who has battled
to put her life in order ?
As with almost all cases involving
county council children 's services ,
it is extremely difficult to discover
why or how a decision has been
reached .
As a result , it is nigh on impossible
for people to challenge what they
see as a dubious outcome .
Fran 's story began last April
when she became pregnant .
Although the baby was unexpected ,
she was delighted .
She
says : " I was shocked because I'd
had the contraceptive injection .
But I remember waking up the
first morning after I knew and
feeling secretly thrilled .
" I did n't have a clue how I was going to
make it work with university and my
job [ for two mental health charities ] but
I was determined that I was having her . "
The first problem began when she and
Molly 's father fell out .
She had become
unhappy about something he was doing
and reported him to the police .
She
ended the relationship immediately and
he is now the subject of an investigation
by police – who alerted social services .
She told them her story – that she was
brought up in Northampton in a middleclass
household where her parents were
teachers , and how at 14 she was raped
by an acquaintance .
Traumatised , she became clinically
depressed and spent the next three
years , on and off , in residential psychiatric
hospitals after being diagnosed
with a borderline personality disorder
characterised by self - harming instability
and suicidal tendencies .
For the final 13 months , Fran had
individual psychotherapy sessions and
group analysis before being discharged
into outpatient care .
By the age of 18
she had fully recovered and the diagnosis
of borderline personality disorder
was removed .
Despite it all , Fran earned
nine A - grade GCSEs , four A - grade
A - levels and her place at university .
When she became pregnant , Fran
accepted that social services might take
an interest in her and went out of her
way to cooperate .
" I was very up - front
with the mental health staff , " she said .
" I told them my history
and gave them the
names of my
doctors as I
assumed
they would want to pursue it further .
I
thought I might need to see the health visitor
a bit more often . "
Instead , Fran received a letter informing
her that a " child protection case conference "
would be held on August 16 .
Social services contacted a number of
experts .
One of them , Dr Stella Newith ,
the psychiatrist who treated Fran as a
teenager , had no doubts when called on
to give her opinion about her former
patient .
In a letter to Northumberland
County Council , Dr Newith said : " I consider
the risk of harm to a child to be so
unlikely as to be negligible .
" There has never been any clinical evidence
to suggest that Fran would put
herself or others at risk , and certainly
no evidence to suggest that she would
put a child at risk . "
It was a view backed up by Dr Rex
Haigh , a psychiatrist who worked with
Fran in the charity sector and acted as a
character witness .
He advised : " I have
no doubt that her diligence and capacity ,
particularly in dealing with complex
emotional situations , will stand her in
good stead for the rigours of parenthood .
Your efforts to protect children
would be better directed elsewhere . "
Yet the social workers decided ,
instead , to give more weight to the
views of consultant paediatrician Dr
Martin Ward Platt – even though he
made it clear he had never met Fran .
In a letter , Dr Ward Platt said : " If
the professionals were concerned
from the evidence available that
[ this woman ] probably does fabricate
or induce illness , there would
be no option but to put the baby
into foster care at birth pending a
post-natal forensic psychological
assessment . "
Fran says she was told by social
services that she was in danger of
suffering from Munchausen's by
Proxy , a controversial and unproven
condition in which a parent – usually
the mother – invents an illness in her
child to draw attention to herself .
Apart from Dr Ward Platt 's letter ,
there has been no other evidence
presented to Fran suggesting that
she was at such risk .
The syndrome
was first identified by Sir Roy
Meadow , the now - discredited doctor
responsible for evidence that led to
the wrongful convictions of Angela
Canning and Sally Clark for murdering
their children .
Dr Ward Platt also recommended
that Fran be
assessed by professionals .
Social services drew
up their " birth plan " without
doing any of these
assessments .
In October , Fran was told
the plan would mean
that Molly would be immediately
removed into care , minutes after she
was born .
Fran was also told she
could not be trusted to breast - feed
her , for fear that she might try to
take strychnine as a way of poisoning
her own child .
Fran says : " I was just horrified .
It
was horrific to sit in this room with
these people and realise that they
could not only conceive of such a
bizarre , terrible thing , but think that
I was actually capable
of it .
" In some ways I
think the whole thing
was compounded by a
lack of understanding .
There is no
evidence that Munchausen 's by
Proxy exists .
I was being asked to
prove that I would n't do something .
But how can I do that ?
They were
asking me to do the impossible . "
Fran engaged the help of Bill
Bache , the lawyer who overturned
Angela Canning 's conviction , and
John Hemming , the Liberal Democrat
MP and chairman of the pressure
group Justice For Families .
And yet all the time , she tried to
find a compromise with the social
workers .
She says : " I asked to go to a mother
and baby unit so we would be under
24 - hour supervision .
I thought it
would show I was willing to cooperate
and there could be no argument
about Molly 's safety , but there was a
lot of resistance to the idea . "
In one last attempt to find a middleway
through the nightmare , Fran
agreed to yet another assessment .
The assessor was to be appointed
by the social workers but would be
officially independent .
They chose
Professor Douglas Turkington , a
psychiatrist based at the Royal
Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle .
In his report , he said that Fran
should not be separated from Molly
but should instead be " supervised
during the immediate postnatal
period in her bonding with Molly and
be allowed to breast feed " .
It is the breakthrough Fran has
been hoping for – but she says she
ca n't risk waiting to see if social services
view it in the same light .
On November 9 , the birth plan
from Northumberland Social Services
arrived in the post .
Fran was
expecting it but nothing could have
prepared her for its conclusions .
" I just fell apart , " she says .
" It 's only
when you see it in writing that it
becomes real .
It said I would get ten
minutes with Molly until the umbilical
cord had been cut . "
Fran and her baby would then be
parted and the baby would be taken
to another room in the hospital .
Fran feared that the conditions of
the birth plan would mean that even
her mother , who she said she was
very close to , would not be able to
see the child .
She added : " They said if I did n't
consent they would get a police protection
order as soon as she was
born .
This effectively meant that
there would be a policeman stood
outside the delivery suite .
" She would be only a few minutes
old and by herself .
That was the one
thing that tore me up inside . . . the
thought of Molly lying in some
horrible hospital baby cot with no
one that loves her .
" I 'm not an impulsive or dramatic
person .
I want to sit down and work
things out .
But this was agonising .
I
knew I had to do something . "
She did n't know , then , that something
would mean fleeing abroad .
Despite the drastic upset , Fran is
not bitter .
" I suppose I feel very disappointed .
It did n't seem possible for
anyone to backtrack just a little bit ,
to say there was another way .
That 's
what I found so hard .
That and the
fact there was no compassion .
They
said it was about Molly but it certainly
never felt like that . "
But perhaps most worrying
of all is the fact that
Fran 's case , while undoubtedly
extreme , is also
indicative of a disturbing
trend .
Two thousand
babies less than a year old
were taken from their
parents last year by social
services – three times the number of
ten years ago .
Fran 's story already has echoes of
Nicky and Mark Webster , formerly
known as the Hardinghams , whose
case was highlighted in this newspaper .
They , too , fled the country in
order to stop social services taking
away their newborn baby , a boy
called Brandon , after their first
three children were adopted over
abuse allegations .
The Websters
have since returned to England and
have won a landmark case to keep
their fourth child .
And what does the future hold for
Fran Lyon , a young mother who was
dealt a rough hand as a teenager and
fought to get a normal life and
now just wants to do what 's best for
her daughter ?
Perhaps social workers know
something Fran is not revealing .
Last night a spokeswoman for
Northumberland County Council
said : " We are unable to comment on
individual cases , and we do not
believe that it is in the best interests
of any mother or child to discuss
personal details through the media ,
but unfortunately it does mean only
one side is being heard .
" Safeguarding arrangements in
Northumberland were rated as good
in a recent rigorous Government
inspection .
Ms Lyon and her legal
adviser have attended all of her case
conferences and have been fully
informed of the concerns of the professionals
involved in her case .
" Where a child or unborn baby is
subject to a child - protection plan
and they move to reside in another
authority or country , responsibility
would normally pass to the new
authority or relevant authority in
another country .
Northumberland
County Council would make sure the
new authority has all the relevant
information it needs to make
informed decisions . "
Mr Hemming said : " I think it 's
appalling and very disturbing and ,
sadly , Fran 's case is not unique .
" Of course there are situations
where you 've got to intervene
but the system all too often fails
to intervene where it should and
then intervenes where it should n't .
It 's a steamroller of a system and it
steamrollers mothers and children . "
Only one thing remains certain .
If
Fran proves herself to be a good and
loving mother , Northumberland's
carefully worked - out " birth plan " can
only ever be seen as an act of almost
unimaginable cruelty by the State .
Fran 's story is told on Tonight
With Trevor McDonald , tomorrow
at 8 pm on ITV1 .
Honey , I doomed the universe RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday November 21 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Astronomers may have unwittingly hastened the end of the Universe by simply looking at it , according to a theory reported in the latest edition of New Scientist .
The novel idea is being aired by two US physicists , who attack the notion that the universe , believed to have been created in the " Big Bang " some 13.7 billion years ago , will go on , well , forever .
In fact , the poor old cosmos is in a rather delicate state , they say .
Until recently , a common idea was that the energy unleashed in the Big Bang happened when a " false vacuum " - a bubble of high energy with repulsive gravity - broke down into a safe , zero- energy " ordinary " vacuum .
But recent evidence has emerged that places a cosmic question - mark over this cozy thought .
For one thing , cosmologists have discovered that the Universe is still expanding .
And , they believe , a strange , yet - to - be - detected form of energy called dark energy pervades the universe , which would explain why the sum of all the visible sources of energy fall way short of what should be out there .
Dark energy , goes the thinking , is a result of the Big Bang and is accelerating the universe 's expansion .
If so , the universe is not in a nice , stable zero-vacuum state but simply another " false vacuum " state that may abruptly decay again - and with cataclysmic consequences .
The energy shift from the decay would destroy everything in the universe , " wiping the slate clean , " says Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio .
The good news is : the longer the universe survives , the better the chance that it will mature into a stable state .
We are just beyond the crucial switching point , Mr. Krauss believed .
The bad news is : the quantum effect , a truly weird aspect of physics that says whenever we observe or measure something , we reset its clock .
Mr. Krauss and colleague James
Dent pointed to measurements of light from supernovae in 1998 that provided the first evidence of dark energy .
These measurements might have reset the decay clock of the " false vacuum " back to zero , back before the switching point and to a time when the risk of catastrophic decay was greater than now , said Mr. Dent and Mr. Krauss .
" Incredible as it seems , our detection of the dark energy may have reduced the life expectancy of the universe , " said Mr. Krauss .
" We may have snatched away the possibility of long - term survival for our universe and made it more likely it will decay . "
The report says the claim is contested by other astrophysicists and adds reassuringly : " The fact that we are still here means this can't have happened yet . "
They 're coming from Miami and Seattle , from the " big sky " state of Montana , and from close to home here in New Hampshire .
They 're coming to help political iconoclast Ron Paul get elected president – many as campaign first - timers who , characteristically independent , may not even feel obliged to tell the Paul camp what exactly they 're planning to do on the candidate 's behalf .
The Paulites ' push for old - style , on - the - ground politicking in New Hampshire , coming just five weeks before the primary , marks a change for a support network that has always relied on websites and online fundraising .
They 're here now because they see the Granite State – with its reputation as antitax , anti-big government , and pro-individual freedom – as especially fertile ground for a libertarian - leaning Republican candidate like Mr. Paul .
" New Hampshire is really important because it 's the first primary and it sends a message to other states about who 's viable and who the leading candidates are .
There was all this Internet enthusiasm , but we did n't have enough boots on the ground , " says Vijay Boyapati , a Google engineer who recently left the Seattle firm to work on Paul 's campaign .
Mr. Boyapati arrived Saturday in Manchester , N.H. , to head up a project of his own invention : Operation Live Free or Die , named after the state motto .
His aim is to bring 1,000 volunteers to New Hampshire to canvass for Paul .
He calculates that if each volunteer , working seven to eight hours a day , meets 100 people daily , then the project can reach out personally to almost all 100,000 residents of Manchester before the Jan. 8 primary .
Then there 's Linda Lagana of Merrimack , N.H.
Using her graphic - design talent and a small print shop , she has been creating Paul - for - president ads and fliers for months on the cheap .
Her materials have ended up in the hands of voters across the state – and are even preferred to official campaign literature .
Her highest - profile project so far : designing an advertisement published in USA Today the Wednesday before Thanksgiving .
Trevor Lyman , an online music promoter , already helped raise $ 4.2 million for Paul in a one - day Internet event Nov. 5 .
Two weeks ago he moved from Miami to Manchester , where he lives in a " frat house " with seven bedrooms , he says .
He spends his days and nights working on other " money bomb " campaigns for the GOP candidate .
At 37 , Mr. Lyman plans to cast his first vote ever – for Paul on Jan. 8 .
Once politically apathetic , these Paul supporters join many others who have become turbocharged almost overnight .
Now they 've launched Five for Freedom , a campaign to get people to contribute $ 5 each to help those who want to live and volunteer in New Hampshire .
So far , the cause has received more than 1,200 pledges .
Another money campaign is Lyman 's bid to raise $ 10 million online on Dec. 16 , the anniversary of the 1773 Boston Tea Party protest of taxation without representation .
Nearly 24,000 people have pledged to donate $ 100 .
Lyman 's fundraiser highlights an " inflation tax . "
The donation website , teaparty 07.com , links to a YouTube video in which Paul , during a TV appearance , explains the toll on citizens as the cost of living rises and the dollar declines in value .
Paul 's bricks - and - mortar campaign , for its part , is not involved in these " day to donate " efforts and uses more traditional methods , such as phone banking and literature drops , to court Granite State voters .
It bought $ 1.1 million in local TV ad time and has nine people on staff in New Hampshire , up from five a few months ago , according to the campaign .
There are signs that Paul is beginning to make a dent here , after months of registering in the low single digits in polls of likely GOP voters .
In several polls he is running fourth or fifth , with 8 percent .
But the American Research Group , which released the latest survey Friday , shows Paul at 2 percent among that GOP group .
He 's at 7 percent among independents .
Paul draws support from those who are disaffected with both the Republican and Democratic parties , says Andrew Smith , who directs the University of New Hampshire Survey Center .
" He has a cap of about 10 to 15 percent of the electorate and has n't reached it yet , " he says .
Paul 's campaign and grass - roots supporters say they can reach beyond that .
" New Hampshire is uniquely suited to be a springboard for Ron Paul , since it 's a small - government - minded state , " says Kate Rick , media coordinator for the Paul campaign in the state .
Boyapati , the former Google engineer , wants to be that springboard .
He plans to meet with a real estate agent this week to rent out 50 to 100 vacation homes in the state to Paul backers , he says , and has been flooded with e-mails from prospective volunteers , including a single mother with no savings and a retired couple from Montana .
When volunteers arrive , the plan is for them to go straight to Paul campaign headquarters , where they 'll get information packets about the obstetrician - turned - congressman and his issues .
" They 're going to train canvassers to be respectful , not leaving materials in the mailbox when people are n't home .
Etiquette is important .
We 're all guests in New Hampshire , " says Boyapati .
It probably wo n't be too long before volunteers find Paulites ' watering holes , as Boyapati did .
Murphy 's Taproom , an Irish pub in downtown Manchester , is one venue where supporters meet to talk strategy , particularly on Tuesday nights .
Boyapati was there the day he arrived and got a surprise :
Paul himself showed up , stood on a chair , and gave an impromptu speech .
" It was kind of explosive , " says Boyapati .
" The whole place was cheering and screaming . "
Many Paul supporters cite their man 's opposition to the Iraq war as the key reason he has their support .
Paul is the only Republican candidate to call for pulling US troops out of Iraq , and he voted against going to war in 2002 .
" The wake - up point was the 2006 election .
The Democrats ran on a campaign of let 's get out of the war .
It was a betrayal , " says Lyman .
" What they did was a ' surge . '
There was more war after a campaign that was against the war . "
Not all Paul 's issues are in the mainstream .
Some supporters seize upon his call to legalize competing currencies , including gold and silver , and eventually abolish the Federal Reserve , eliminate the Internal Revenue Service , and renounce America 's membership to the United Nations .
But they share a common trait : wanting to restore the Constitution , says a Paul campaign spokeswoman .
" I 'm a big constitutionalist .
Everyone falls under the constitutionalism umbrella , whether it's the war or other issues , " says the campaign 's Ms. Rick .
Paul does have huge hurdles to overcome .
In focus groups , some women see him as " inconsistent " in that he holds libertarian views but is opposed to a woman 's right to choose abortion , says Dick Bennett of the American Research Group in Manchester .
Sixty - one percent of likely GOP voters in New Hampshire say they will not vote for him under any circumstances , according to a University of New Hampshire poll .
But some say that if Paul is smart he 'll stay focused on the Granite State .
" New Hampshire is where the Republicans are going to be duking it out , " says Arnie Arnesen , a TV and radio talk - show host here .
" He has a passionate base , and this is a numbers game . "
With so many candidates in the race , she adds , " he just needs to get a majority of the minority . "
Here ’s the dirty little secret about being a software developer .
No matter how good the code you write is , it ’s crap to another developer .
It does n’t matter if the code is so clean you could eat sushi off of it .
Does n’t matter if both John Carmack and Linus Torvalds bow down in respect every time the code is shown on the screen .
Some developer out there will call it crap , and it ’s usually the developer who inherits the code when you leave .
The reasons are many and petty :
Your code uses string concatenation in that one method rather than using a StringBuilder .
So what if in this one situation , that was a conscious decision because on average that method only concatenates three or four strings together .
The next guy does n’t care .
.
So what if in this one situation , that was a conscious decision because on average that method only concatenates three or four strings together .
The next guy does n’t care .
You put your curly braces on the same line rather than its own line as God intended ( or vice versa ) .
You used a switch statement when everyone ( including the next developer ) knows you ’re supposed to replace that with the State or Strategy pattern , always !
Did n’t you read Design Patterns ?
Never mind the fact that there ’s only one switch statement and thus no code duplication .
You ’re using Spring .
NET for dependency injection , but the next guy loves Windsor .
Only idiots choose Spring .NET
( or vice versa , again ) .
Or perhaps you used dependency injection at all .
What the hell is dependency injection ?
I do n’t understand the code now ! :(
While we strive for perfect code , it is unattainable on real projects because real code is weighed down by the pressure of constraints such as time pressure .
Unfortunately , these constraints are n’t reflected in the code , just the effect of the constraints .
The next developer reading your code did n’t know that code was written with one hour left to deliver the project .
Although I admit , having been burned by misguided criticism before , it ’s hard not to be tempted to take a pre-emptive strike at criticism by trying to embed the constraints in the code via comments .
For example ,
public void SomeMethod ( ) { /*
At most , there will only be 4 to 5 foos , so string concatenation is just fine in this situation .
Here are links to five blog posts that talk about the perf implications .
Give me a break , it ’s 3 AM , I ’m hopped up on Jolt , this project is 3 months late , and I have no social life anymore .
Cut me some slack !
... */ string result = string .
Empty ; foreach ( Foo foo in Foos ) { result += foo ; } return result ; }
Seems awful defensive , no ?
There ’s nothing wrong with leaving a comment to highlight why a particular non-obvious design decision is made .
In fact , that ’s exactly what comments are for , rather than simply reiterating what the code does .
The problem though , is that developers sometimes cut each other so little slack , you start writing a treatise in green ( or whichever color you have comments set to in your IDE ) to justify every line of code because you have no idea what is going to be obvious to the next developer .
That ’s why I was particularly pleased to receive an email the other day from a developer who inherited some code I wrote and said that the solutions were , and I quote , “ really well written ” .
Seriously ?
Am I being Punk’d ?
Ashton , where the hell are you hiding ?
This is quite possibly the highest compliment you can receive from another developer .
And I do n’t think it ’s because I ’m such a great developer .
I really think the person who deserves credit here is the one giving the compliment .
I mean , my reaction when I ’ve inherited code was typically , why the hell did they write this this way !?
Did they learn to code from the back of a Cracker Jack Box !?
Who better to serve as the scapegoat than the developer who just left ?
Fortunately I had enough tact to keep those thoughts to myself .
In the future , I ’ll work harder on the empathy side of things .
When I inherit code , I ’ll assume the developer wrote it in a 72 hour straight coding binge , his World of Warcraft character held hostage , bees all over his body , with only an hour to finish the code on a 386 before everything really starts to go south .
Many positions are due to become vacant at the new Iraq embassy
About 300 angry diplomats attended a meeting at the state department , at which one labelled the decision a " potential death sentence " .
If too few volunteer , some will be forced to go to Iraq - or risk dismissal , except those exempted for medical or personal hardship reasons .
Iraq postings have previously been filled on a voluntary basis .
' Prime candidates '
The meeting was called to explain the " forced assignments " order made by state department human resources director Harry Thomas .
Who will raise our children if we are dead or seriously wounded ?
Jack Croddy
Senior US diplomat
Last Friday , he notified about 250 " prime candidates " that they had been selected for one of 48 one - year postings at the embassy in Baghdad or in a Provincial Reconstruction Team elsewhere in the country .
They were given 10 days to reply .
Senior diplomat Jack Croddy , who once worked as a political adviser with Nato forces , highlighted safety fears of staff who would be forced to serve in a war zone .
" It 's one thing if someone believes in what 's going on over there and volunteers , but it 's another thing to send someone over there on a forced assignment , " Mr Croddy said .
" I 'm sorry , but basically that 's a potential death sentence and you know it .
Who will raise our children if we are dead or seriously wounded ?
" You know that at any other [ country ] in the world , the embassy would be closed at this point . "
For months , US officials have been warning that a lack of volunteers could lead to this diplomatic call - up , says the BBC's James Coomarasamy in Washington .
Many positions are due to become vacant in 2008 .
But unions say the constantly growing embassy in Iraq is straining human resources .
An attractive financial package is being offered as well as a generous leave allowance .
But the Baghdad embassy is considered a hardship posting due to security risks and because spouses and children must be left at home .
American diplomats have been sent on forced assignments before - some had to take postings in some African countries in the 1970s and 1980s , and in 1969 an entire class of new foreign service officers was sent to Vietnam .
Floating power point
This idea might take off
We make it a rule never to feature next generation products on this site , but to wait until they are actually on the market .
The new floating wind turbine from Magenn deserves to be an exception .
It is highly likely to move from prototype to production in 2008 , and you need to know about this beauty now if you are currently evaluating your off - grid land , and wondering what you will do for power in three years time .
It floats using helium tanks , and is tethered to the ground by a 1,000 foot power cable , catching the steady winds which prevail at that height .
It was featured in the New York Times this week , because the inventors , Magenn Power of Ottawa Canada , have had $ 5 m from a Californian investor to build prototypes , and received a Patent last month .

Earlier , Doug posted a story about an expansion of freedom in the taxicab market in Minneapolis .
It seems that someone finally asked why it was necessary to set an arbitrary limit on the number of cabs operating in the city , and that someone was able to muster enough power to end the restriction .
Perhaps NYC might take it as a suggestion .
NYC , of course , is one of the most restrictive taxi markets in the country .
Virtually every portion of the taxicab business is regulated .
The number of taxi “ medallions ” is limited to roughly 13,000 , generating a competitive market where the cost of said medallion on the secondary market is into six figures .
Of course , artificial scarcity is known to rise prices , so fares are also tightly regulated , to ensure that drivers cannot take advantage of the limit by raising rates .
And on top of that , there are a host of other regulations on their operation , to the extent that taxi drivers in New York have very little control over how they execute their job .
As with most regulations , it does n’t really benefit the consumer , and often does not benefit the drivers , but is a big boon to the regulators and to the taxi companies who own the medallions .
So is NYC looking at reducing the restrictions , like Minneapolis ?
No !
In fact , they recently decided to add another little wrinkle .
Each cab will need to be outfitted with an information terminal with such features as GPS , credit - card services , and perhaps other services such as news , video , advertisement , and information on local attractions .
I can tell you , as someone who is familiar with these terminals , they ’re not cheap .
Even outside of the normal cost of installing the terminals , there are maintenance and replacement costs .
The terminals have an LCD with touchscreen , and I ’m sure the number of drunk and / or unruly passengers who put a fist or foot through the screen will make the total cost of ownership quite high on the cab owners .
On top of those concerns , each transaction using a credit card will include a service charge to the company handling the transaction .
Who will pick up all these costs ?
Well , the cabs cannot raise their rates , so the passengers wo n’t cover it .
And the city certainly is n’t footing the bill .
So who gets it ?
The cabbies themselves , of course !
And let me tell you , they ’re understandably not happy about it :
Taxi drivers angry about a new rule requiring the installation of global positioning systems and credit card machines in cabs are planning a second one - day strike in six weeks on Monday .
The city was preparing for the strike by the Taxi Workers Alliance by instituting a contingency plan that lets drivers pick up multiple passengers and charge zone - based fares .
The touch - screen monitors , which are being phased in as yellow cabs come up for inspection , let passengers pay by credit card , check on news stories , map their taxi ’s current location and look up restaurant and entertainment information .
The alliance , which claims to represent about a fifth of the city ’s 44,000 licensed cab drivers , opposes the technology , saying the 5 percent surcharge on each credit card transaction amounts to a wage cut and the GPS device allows cab companies to track drivers .
Furthermore , the alliance claims the technology does n’t work properly .
As a consumer and a technology buff , I love the idea of information terminals in these cabs .
But as an advocate of freedom , I am most certainly not in favor of forcing cabs to take the technology , and not in favor of them being unable to adjust their pricing to cover the additional level of service they ’re offering .
But in NYC , what I want as a consumer does n’t matter .
What level of service cabbies want to offer does n’t matter .
The market has been replaced by the wishes , desires , and mandates of the New York Taxi & Limousine Commission .
Freedom has no place in this brave new world .

Mike Huckabee – " Surging " Republican
By Michael Collins
" Scoop " Independent News
Washington , D.C .
Mike Huckabee is the " surging " candidate to watch in the Republican presidential primaries , at least for the moment .
The former Arkansas governor is an ordained Southern Baptist minister and a believer in the " inerrancy " doctrine of Biblical scripture .
Inerrancy means , quite simply , that the believer accepts every bit of the Bible as literal truth ( Adam & Eve , an earth just 6,000 years old , etc . )
As governor , Huckabee was an enthusiastic death penalty supporter .
He now supports World War III against Muslim " fascists " and he 's taking his message of death on the road .
A panel of talking heads on Chris Matthews ' " Hard Ball " conferred legitimacy on the Huckabee candidacy last week .
A more professional group of journalists at the Pew Forum treated Huckabee with deference by avoiding any hard hitting questions .
There was nothing about Huckabee 's February declaration of World War III or his beliefs in a final judgment in our times and no mention of his tainted past in Arkansas .
Only Kathy Kay of the BBC raised questions about the specter of the candidate 's extreme views .
Let 's see what the former Arkansas governor and minister has in store for the United States if he 's selected to win the Presidency .
After becoming governor in 1997 , Huckabee signed death warrants for 16 executions by lethal injection .
This violates the clearly worded , but frequently forgotten commandment , " Thou shalt not kill . "
He must know that World War III means even more killing and death .
But neither position seems to bother him .
In fact , he recently used death imagery in estimating the reaction of fellow Republicans to his fund raising gains : " If I were some of these guys , I 'd have to be sitting in a warm tub of water with razor blades , "
Selective Forgiveness as Governor
Charles Singleton was convicted of murder in Arkansas and executed by lethal injection during Huckabee 's term as governor .
Singleton was a diagnosed schizophrenic .
Huckabee was unimpressed and issued the required death warrant .
Supreme Court decisions mandate prisoner mental competence prior to execution .
Singleton was given ( his lawyer says forced ) antipsychotic medication to relieve his schizophrenia .
As a result , the prisoner regained a grasp on reality .
Singleton 's successful treatment for a serious mental illness then became the vehicle that allowed the state to kill him .
Of the 16 Huckabee era executions , there is a pattern of dismissing or refusing to examine legitimate questions or claims concerning mental illness .
Huckabee did find forgiveness in his heart for at least one Arkansas criminal .
Wayne Dumond was convicted for raping a 17 year old girl in 1985 .
This fourth sexual assault conviction earned Dumond a sentence of life plus 20 years .

A Simple Programming Puzzle Seen Through Three Different Lenses
The other day , I stumbled across Mark Nelson 's blog post describing a fairly simple NPR word puzzle : " Take the names of two U.S. States , mix them all together , then rearrange the letters to form the names of two other U.S. States .
What states are these ? "
Mark Nelson is a programmer , so his first instinct of course was to write a small program to solve it .
Mine too .
I immediately stopped reading his post , opened a new emacs buffer and spent five minutes coming up with this :
states = [ " alabama " , " alaska " , " arizona " , " arkansas " , " california " , " colorado " , " connecticut " , " delaware " , " florida " , " georgia " , " hawaii " , " idaho " , " illinois " , " indiana " , " iowa " , " kansas " , " kentucky " , " louisiana " , " maine " , " maryland " , " massachusetts " , " michigan " , " minnesota " , " mississippi " , " missouri " , " montana " , " nebraska " , " nevada " , " newhampshire " , " newjersey " , " newmexico " , " newyork " , " northcarolina " , " northdakota " , " ohio " , " oklahoma " , " oregon " , " pennsylvania " , " rhodeisland " , " southcarolina " , " southdakota " , " tennessee " , " texas " , " utah " , " vermont " , " virginia " , " washington " , " westvirginia " , " wisconsin " , " wyoming " ] seen = dict ( ) for state1 in states : for state2 in states : if state1 == state2 : continue letters = list ( state1 + state2 ) letters.sort ( ) key = " " . join ( letters ) if seen .
has_key ( key ) : ( old1 , old2 ) = seen [ key ] if old1 == state2 and old2 == state1 : continue else : print " found it : %s + %s , %s + %s " % ( state1 , state2 , old1 , old2 ) exit ( 0 ) else : seen [ key ] = ( state1 , state2 )
Sure enough , it gave me the answer ( and like Mark Nelson , seeing it made me realize that it probably would have been even more productive to just think about it for a minute instead of writing the code ) .
To me , that Python code is about as simple and direct as it gets .
There 's nothing clever going on there .
Just loop over the cartesian product of states x states , skip a couple obvious cases and then normalize the names of the states by sorting the letters and put them into a dictionary .
As soon as you hit a combination that 's already in the dictionary , you have your answer .
That approach to me would qualify as a " naive " or " brute force " approach .
I figured there might be a more optimized approach , but with only 50 states it was n't really worth optimizing any more .
Running it took all of 18 milliseconds .
When I went back and read the rest of the blog post , my jaw dropped .
His first pass , in C++ involved a quadruply nested loop , STL libraries , and was taking upwards of an hour to run .
Looking at his code , he really took the notion of a " brute force " approach to a level I had n't even considered .
His second and third passes improved the runtime and even simplified the code , but they still run on the order of a few seconds .
That 's for a compiled , low level language .
My Python code written without any particular thoughts toward efficiency running in an interpreter ( so the time of starting up the python process , parsing the code , and interpreting it directly , line by line without compiler optimizations are all included in the running time ) was beating it by a couple orders of magnitude .
The key , of course , is the algorithm .
Python , like Ruby , Perl , and other relatively high level languages , has supports a dictionary ( or hashtable if you prefer ) data type at the syntax level .
As a result , anyone programming in one of those languages quickly learns how to make the most of them and becomes familiar with a number of idioms , including the one I used of testing for uniqueness by keeping a ' seen ' dictionary , inserting keys one by one and looking for a collision .
It 's dead simple , commonly used in scripting languages , and extremely efficient since inserting into a hashtable is O ( 1 ) and tends to be one of the most finely tuned parts of a scripting language 's interpreter / VM .
There 's nothing Python specific about the algorithm .
In fact , in the comments on the post , Vince Huston submits a C++ solution that 's basically identical to my approach ( and probably outperforms everyone else handily ) .
If I were forced to solve the same problem in C++ , I would probably have come up with something similar .
I would not be at all surprised if Vince Huston has had some experience coding in scripting languages and Mark Nelson has n't .
The point is n't that Mark Nelson is a bad programmer .
Far from it .
Looking around at the rest of his site , at articles like his explanation of the The Byzantine Generals Problem ( which was how I ended up on his site in the first place ) , and at the books he 's written , I 'd guess that overall , he has more breadth and depth to his understanding of algorithms and programming than I do .
My point is really just to repeat the tired , broken record cry of advocates of higher level languages that 1 ) using a faster , more appropriate algorithm will usually go much further in optimization than low level optimizations ( using a compiled language , static types , fretting over clock cycles in an inner loop , etc ) and 2 ) learning different programming paradigms , languages , and idioms will improve your programming even if you end up going back to a lower level language .
In this case , some familiarity with dictionary idioms common in scripting languages helps immensely in producing a fast , simple solution .
Another comment on his post goes even further .
Tom Moertel submits a solution implemented in Haskell .
From a performance standpoint , it 's pretty much the same approach as mine , using a dictionary ( in this case , Haskell 's Data .
Map library ) to do the comparisons on normalized strings .
What makes it a really nice solution though , is that he approaches it by starting with a " clusterBy " higher order function that takes a signature function and a list and returns a list of groups clustered by the signature ( my explanation is bad ; his examples make it much more clear ) .
Essentially , instead of directly solving the problem , he creates a general purpose tool which can then trivially be applied to the specific problem at hand .
clusterBy is the kind of function that I could see being useful to other problems .
So not only does he end up with the solution to this problem , he also ends up with a useful tool to make future programming tasks simpler .
Haskell 's smooth support of higher order functions makes this a natural approach and it seems to be the way that proficient Haskell programmers end up taking on most problems .
Python had the good taste to steal a few items from Haskell 's bag of tricks though , so I was inspired to try a Python version .
Here 's a rough equivalent of clusterBy :
def cluster_by ( f, lst ) : transformed = [ f ( x ) for x in lst ] d = dict ( ) for t, i in zip ( transformed , lst ) : d.setdefault (t , [ ] ) . append ( i ) return d.values ( )
Not as pretty as the Haskell , but works essentially the same way .
Then , to solve the original problem , we need a normalize function :
def normalize (t ) : letters = list ( t [ 0 ] + t [ 1 ] ) letters.sort ( ) return " " .join ( letters )
It takes the tuple of two state names , sorts all the letters in them and returns that as a string .
The final piece is just to apply cluster_by with the normalize function to the cartesian product of states x states and find the resulting entries with multiple entries ( and since I was going Haskell - style , I decided to use list comprehensions instead of for loops as well ) :
clustered = cluster_by ( normalize , [( x , y ) for x in states for y in states ] ) print [ x for x in clustered if len( x ) >
2 ]
It runs in 25 milliseconds on my machine , so slightly more overhead than the procedural approach , but close enough to not matter and , IMO , it 's cleaner and would lend itself more to further reuse of the cluster_by or normalize functions .
So first knowing an idiom from a scripting language can produce better C++ code ( see Vince Huston 's solution ) , then taking a lesson from Haskell I 'm able to come up with better Python code .
I 'm waiting for a Prolog programmer to come along and smoke everyone next .
Dear Cecil : First , an ( elderly ) joke .
A Harvard man and a Yale man are at the urinal .
They finish and zip up .
The Harvard man proceeds to the sink to wash his hands , while the Yale man immediately makes for the exit .
The Harvard man says , " At Hah - vahd they teach us to wash our hands after we urinate . "
The Yale man replies , " At Yale they teach us not to piss on our hands . "
My question : why is it customary for males to wash their hands after urination ?
I never do , which shocks and disgusts some of my guy friends .
I bathe daily and wear fresh underpants , so how does my penis get dirty ?
It 's not like I dig a ditch with it .
However , my hands might get dirty from daily activities .
Is it not more sensible then to wash my hands before touching my clean penis ?
Is posturination hand washing a throwback to the bad old days , when sex was " dirty " and so , by extension , were sex organs ?
I 'm serious about this .
Please advise .
Tom Sharpley , Los Angeles
Cecil replies :
Good ( if elderly ) joke .
Common ( but stupid ) attitude .
Rank ( but important ) topic .
Some facts :
The purpose of washing is not to get pee off your hands .
No amount of washing will make you clean .
You have to do it anyway .
I ’ve said this before : your boxer - shorts region — from belly button to mid-thigh — is crawling with germs known as coliform bacteria .
These bacteria originated in your intestine , and some of them are deadly .
Remember punji stakes ?
They were sharpened sticks that the Vietcong concealed point up along trails and daubed with excrement .
If you stepped on one you had a good chance of contracting a fatal infection .
Similarly , an otherwise not - so - serious gunshot or knife injury could kill you if it perforated the intestine and allowed coliform bacteria to spread around your abdomen .
But you know this ( or at least you ought to ) .
What you may not know is that washing will not make the coliform bacteria go away .
They ’re holed up in the pores of your skin and nothing short of sandblasting — certainly not your morning shower — is going to get them out .
Showering merely gets rid of the ones that have strayed onto the surface .
The bacteria wo n’t do much harm if they stay put , but when you urinate your fingers come in contact with Mister P. long enough for the coliform bacteria in your pores to hop aboard .
Your fingers subsequently touch lots of other infectible items .
If you do n’t wash your hands with soap and water ( soap gets rid of the skin oil that the bacteria stick to ) … hello , Typhoid Mary .
It now dawns on you : jeez , if merely touching my privates is enough to transmit bacteria , it does n’t matter if I pee or not !
Just so .
Urine itself is actually fairly sterile .
Cecil has read reports of it being used during wartime in poor countries as —
I ’m not making this up — a sort of battlefield Bactine .
( U.S. doctors generally blanch at this . )
The lesson to draw from this , however , is not that you can go forth dripping ( yuck ) , but rather that just because you did n’t pee on your fingers does n’t mean you can skip washing up .
Watch what you eat
Dear Cecil :
After reading your column on hand washing after urination , I ’m certain I ’m going to die — that is , if coliform bacteria are as bad as you say .
My girlfriend and I often share the pleasures of fellatio and cunnilingus .
Heck , one night I even got up the nerve to perform ( ahem ) analingus .
But what about the dread coliform bacteria ?
I ’m certain some of these bacteria came in contact with our mouths at some time .
Yet I have never been sick due to these forms of sexual gratification .
Do we just swallow it and put it back where it came from ( our intestines ) or what ?
Please do n’t tell me I have to refrain from yet another fun thing to do .

Cecil replies :
Nothing like causing a national panic .
Now I know why Pat Buchanan likes to run for president .
Mrs. Adams had the same thought you guys did , probably at about the same point during the evening ’s proceedings .
“ Babe , ” I said , “ you think sex is safe ?
Let me tell you about sexually transmitted diseases . ”
Not the most romantic line I ever used .
But the truth is you can catch lots of bugs via oral sex .
Many of them are transmitted by , or have their transmission facilitated by , coliform or other fecal bacteria or , for that matter , fecal viruses .
There ’s no point in stopping now though .
You can catch most of the same germs from intercourse , kissing , or simply holding hands .
For example , a common complaint among women is urinary - tract infection , which is often caused by sexually transmitted fecal bacteria .
Research suggests these bacteria travel to the entrance of the vagina , get shoved in by the penis during intercourse , and then migrate to the bladder .
In other words , the guy helps infect the woman with her own germs .
( Doctors — male ones usually — blame this on the “ woefully short ” female urethra . )
It seems likely oral sex could accomplish the same thing , but for a given infection there ’s no way to tell .
It ’s rare that a specific sexual practice is associated with spreading germs , but there are exceptions .
About 20 years ago clinicians began noticing what has come to be called “ gay bowel syndrome , ” a collection of intestinal and rectal complaints that frequently plague gay men .
Many of these illnesses stem from infection by fecal bacteria following anal sex — specifically , anal intercourse , analingus , and fellatio following anal intercourse .
Some heterosexual couples ( estimates range from 5 to 27 percent ) also engage in anal sex , and they ’re at risk too .
The question is how much risk .
The answer is probably not much , unless they ’re unusually out there sexually .
A key factor in gay bowel syndrome and in the spread of STDs generally is multiple sex partners , which exponentially increases your exposure to infection .
In contrast , monogamous couples , whether gay or straight , soon achieve “ homeostasis ” — they ’ve swapped germs , did n’t come down with anything , and thereafter coexist in a state of microbial equilibrium .
That ’s not to say they ’re germfree ; they may simply be “ asymptomatic carriers ” of some bug that does n’t make them sick but that might lay low an outsider .
Granted , the danger is n’t very great , but it exists .
I was just reading in the Harvard Medical School Health Letter about a 51 - year - old guy who learned that hepatitis C had destroyed his liver .
He ’d had no previous symptoms , but the kicker is that he ’d contracted hepatitis C 46 years before .
Hepatitis C is n’t transmitted by fecal bacteria ; my point is that just because you do n’t think you have anything does n’t mean you do n’t .
Thus the apparent paradox : you can frolic with your honey all you want , but you still have to wash your hands after using the pot .
We ’re doomed
Mindful of our discussion about the importance of washing one ’s hands after going to the bathroom and recalling my comment that urine itself , being fairly sterile , is not the problem , a reader sent me a clipping from the March / April 1996 Yoga Journal .
Here ’s the headline : “ Drink to Your Health : Wealthy French women bathed in it , Chinese doctors used it to soothe sore throats , and now you — all squeamishness aside — can drink it to cure what ails you . ”
Guess what “ it ” is .
You guessed right .
I ’m serious .
I quote author Blake More :
“ Odds are you ’re among the 27 million Americans who recycle . …
Would you be willing to take the act of recycling a step further and internally honor your bodily home , if it meant you ’d have more energy , a stronger immune system , and an ageless complexion ?
Of course you would . ”
Welcome to urine therapy .
All it takes , says Blake , is eight ounces a day .
Blake first heard about UT from a naturopath in Japan .
Of course she had to try it — would n’t you ?
Four years later , she reports , “ I ’m a different person .
I ’m more in tune with my body ’s needs and functions , and no longer anemic or hypoglycemic .
I rarely get colds , have n’t had the flu in years , and the yeast infection that had long been plaguing me is gone . … I now feel healthy and strong . ”
Only problem is gargling with those little deodorant blocks .
She goes on to give a long list of diseases , including many related to AIDS , that urine therapy will supposedly alleviate .
The list includes everything from gangrene to hair loss to malaria .
Sure .
While I do n’t suppose there ’s any danger urine therapy will become the next macarena , I did take the precaution of checking out the concept with University of Chicago kidney specialist Dr. John Asplin .
He thought urine consumption in moderate quantities was probably harmless .
The stuff is fairly sterile , and if you do happen to have a urinary - tract infection or something , well , you ’ve already got whatever germs you ’re consuming .
( Former Indian prime minister Moraji Desai , a daily urine drinker , lived to be 99 . )
On the other hand , Asplin said , UT is n’t likely to do you much good either .
Listen to your body .
Your body is saying , “ I just got rid of this stuff , granola - brain .
Are you nuts ? “
But if you want to try it , be my guest .
Just do n’t eat any asparagus first .

WHOLESALE PRICES WHOLESALE PRICES WASHINGTON 
Consumers were more free - spending in November , but the economic boost could be hard to sustain in coming months given that November also saw the biggest jump in wholesale inflation since 1973 , according to two reports Thursday .
The Labor Department said wholesale prices for finished goods spiked 3.2 % in November from the previous month and were up more than 7 % from November 2006 .
The main culprit was energy , with gasoline soaring 34.8 % in the month .
In a cautionary sign for the Federal Reserve , core wholesale inflation — which excludes more volatile food and energy prices — was a robust 0.4 % .
The Fed , which has cut a key interest rate three times since September to buoy economic growth , and other economists closely watch core figures as a short - term indicator of underlying inflation trends .
The report " drives a stake through the heart of the argument that the U.S. does not have an inflation problem , " says Brian Wesbury , chief economist of First Trust Advisors , noting the overall price rise was the " largest single - month hike since 1973 , beating every month during the high inflation of the late 1970s as well as the month affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita . "
A key question is how much of the higher costs businesses are willing or able to pass on to consumers .
Economists will be closely watching today 's report on consumer inflation .
Separately , the Commerce Department said retail sales surged 1.2 % in November , which followed a 0.2 % increase in October .
Fed officials have expressed some concern that consumer spending , about two - thirds of economic activity , will slow under the weight of high energy prices , a falling housing market and plummeting consumer confidence .
Other economists downplayed the worries .
" Depressed consumers go shopping to cheer up , " was the headline on an advisory from PNC Financial Services to its clients .
While the November numbers suggest consumers were responding to the widespread discounting that started well before Thanksgiving , the National Retail Federation is n't worried the gains will be at the expense of December sales .
NRF spokeswoman Ellen Davis says its polling shows people finished about the same percentage of their shopping — less than 40 % — by Dec. 1 this year as they did last year .
Phil Rist , vice president of strategy at consumer insights firm BIGresearch , says holiday retail sales can be a tricky economic indicator .
" It 's always important to remember that people are working off a list of people they are buying for , " says Rist .
" The exception to that is when they are in the store … will they buy items for themselves ? "

The internet is composed of about 75 % cat pictures and 20 % unbelievable stories to amaze your friends .*
So it 's no wonder Oscar , the cat who predicts death , captured the imagination of cyberspace last week .
Oscar lives in a nursing home , and only curls up with patients who die within the next few hours .
You can read the entire report in the New England Journal of Medicine , or the shorter Associated Press story we linked here .
There are many theories about how Oscar knows who is going to die , and some ( mostly joking ) remarks about how he may be causing the deaths .
Those who work with him consider him a hospice hero .
But that 's not what I 'm posting about .
This is about the immediate and predictable flood of art and humor inspired by Oscar 's story .
More " death cat "  images after the jump .
Fark forum members raced to post LOLcats of death , some of them previously produced ,
and some are pictures of Oscar , including the first one in this article .
My brother put together and sent me this one , unsolicited , as soon as he read about Oscar .
Apelad posted the kitteh of death from his Laugh Out Loud Cats collection .
Oscar is an attractive cat .
With LOLcat Buildr and some captions that were posted in the comments on Neatorama , these were easy to produce .
Joey did this one .
I Can Has Cheezburger ?
had one .
The Flicker Can Has Cheezburger pool has several , like Poor Oscar from dominocat .
Oscar has a plaque at the nursing home that commends him " for his compassionate quality end - of - life care . "
Now he is also enshrined in LOLcat history .

Less than a week after Gen. David Petraeus spun fairy tales for Congress about a successful " surge , " the Pentagon has released their quarterly report on Iraq and they seem to have a different story to tell .
Security taking a turn for the worse here , increasing violence there , and militias growing influence everywhere .
In other words , the same things we 've been hearing for the past four years .
And now George Bush wants Congress to wait until March for another , " fresh assessment . "
So in the coming weeks , while Congress decides if we will stay the course for another six months of " breathing space " for the Maliki government , perhaps they should consider this conclusion from the Pentagon :
The growing violence in the south is one factor making it unlikely that Iraq 's leaders -- hampered by a " zero sum " mentality -- will make headway in the fall on key political resolutions , the report concluded .
" In the short term , Iraqi political leaders will likely be less concerned about reconciliation than with consolidating power and posturing for a future power struggle , " it said .
And perhaps Congress can take a moment to remember the 767 U.S. soldiers and the more than 15,000 Iraqis who have been killed since the latest plan for success began .
Bush is such a liar .
Or is he just out to lunch on the most important issue that he faces ?
In October , he charged that Iran ’s nuclear weapons program was bringing the world to the precipice of World War III , even though the White House had been informed at least a month earlier that Iran had no such program and had stopped efforts to develop one back in 2003 .
Is it conceivable that Bush was telling the truth at his press conference Tuesday when he stated that he learned of the National Intelligence Estimate report , which contained that inconvenient fact , only last week ?
Even if Bush read the NIE report , he clearly does n’t respect it , for at his press conference he said “ the NIE does n’t do anything to change my opinion about the danger Iran poses to the world — quite the contrary . ”
Not that he has anything against the NIE , whose directors he handpicked .
“ I want to compliment the intelligence community for their good work .
Right after the failure of intelligence in Iraq , we reformed the intelligence community . ”
But whether or not the intelligence agencies are reformed , the president still ignores them .
He did n’t listen when they told him he was wrong in claiming that Iraq had purchased yellow cake uranium from Niger and he does n’t listen now when they tell him his alarms about Iran are without factual foundation .
The difference this time around is that because Bush is a discredited lame duck the intelligence chiefs were a bit more forthcoming with their findings in a report that has , in part , been made available to the public .
The whole episode shows that our democratic system retains at least some essential checks and balances , but it also is depressing to see that , in this instance at least , the fanatical leader of a theocracy seems to have a higher regard for truth than does the president of the world ’s greatest experiment in representative democracy .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who took office as Iran ’s president in August of 2005 , two years after Iran ’s nuclear weapons program ended , has now been vindicated in his claims that Iran has abandoned the weaponization program .
Not so Bush , who has summarily dismissed the intelligence community ’s findings and , using his favorite tactic in dealing with debacles , is sticking to his original story .
A story , as in the case of the earlier Iraq threat inflation , that too many in the mass media and Congress , including some leading Democrats , have bought .
Take Hillary Clinton , who said that “ Iran is seeking nuclear weapons , and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is in the forefront of that ” by way of defending her vote for a resolution that , like the one she voted for before the Iraq war , blindly supports rather than seriously questions the president ’s case for war .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama was absolutely correct in calling candidate Clinton out on that vote and challenging her lame excuse that she had not read the full intelligence report before her Iraq war vote .
“ Members of Congress , ” Obama cautioned , “ must carefully read the intelligence before giving the president any justification to use military force . ”
Not a bad idea .
In the case of Iraq ’s non-nukes , the intelligence evidence supporting Bush was flimsy at best when it did not directly contradict his key assertions .
In the case of Iran , it is now publicly understood that there is no such evidence , flimsy or otherwise .
But do n’t count on that to stop the bipartisan coalition of invasion hawks from pushing on .
Once again , they will attack the United Nations ’ experts , who have been proved right in Iran as they were in Iraq .
A spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency pointed out that the NIE report supports the agency ’s view that there is “ no evidence ” of an undeclared nuclear weapons program in Iran and “ validates the assessments of [ IAEA Director General ]
Mohamed ElBaradei , who continuously said in his public statements that he saw no clear and public danger , and that therefore that there was plenty of time for negotiations . ”
Can we get ElBaradei to run in the Iowa caucus ?
Why are our leading presidential candidates so easily fooled ?
It ’s humiliating to all of us who believe in a free press , separation of powers and individual liberty that a system of government designed by its founders to hold leaders accountable can be so easily manipulated by an unremarkable loser who has been rewarded throughout his life for screwing up .
It is hoped that this time around the truth will catch up with him before he gets us in yet another bloody war , just to show he can .
We ’ve moved !
You will be redirected to our new home in five seconds .

By chance , I came upon a blog entry by Masahiro Sakai ( 酒井政裕 ) in which he , after reading my short comment on my previous homepage “ Do you know that the S combinator is injective ?
I have a simple algebraic proof ! ” , tried to construct the inverse of S and showed that S⁻¹ ○ S = id in , guess what , Agda !
Wow , people were actually reading what I wrote !
This made me feel that I have to be a bit more responsible and , at least , provide the proof when I claim I have one .
So , here it is .
S is injective
Recall the definition of S :
S : ( A -> B -> C ) -> ( A -> B ) -> A -> C S = λ x y a -> x a ( y a )
I am assuming a simple semantics of sets and functions , and by S being injective I mean that S x = S x ' ⇒ x = x ' , which can be trivially shown below :
S x = S x ' ≡ { η expansion , for all y : A -> B , a : A } ( ∀ a , y : S x y a = S x ' y a ) ≡ { definition of S } ( ∀ a , y : x a ( y a ) = x ' a ( y a ) ) ⇒ { choose y = K b for some b } ( ∀ a , b : x a ( K b a ) = x ' a ( K b a ) ) ≡ { definition of K : K b a = b } ( ∀ a , b : x a b = x ' a b ) ≡ { pointwise equality } x = x '
I would usually leave out the ∀ ‘s in derivations , but in this case , they are explicitly written to emphasise that b is indeed universally quantified .
So , what is the inverse of S ?
Now that we know S is injective , there ought to exist some function S⁻¹ such that S⁻¹ ○ S = id .
Nakano san claimed that a definition would be :
S⁻¹ : ( ( A -> B ) -> A -> C ) -> A -> B -> C S⁻¹ = λ x a b -> x ( K b ) a
That S⁻¹ ○ S = id is easy to see :
S⁻¹ ( S x ) a b = ( S x ) ( K b ) a = x a ( K b a ) = x a b
From another direction , we have only S ○ S⁻¹ ⊆ id since S is not a surjective function .
How the range of S look like ?
Inspecting the definition of S .
Since y is applied only once to a , the value of y on other input does not matter .
That is , the range of S consists of only functions e such that :
e y a = e y' a for all y , y ' such that y a = y' a ...... ( 1)
We will show that S ( S⁻¹ e ) = e for all e satisfying ( 1 ) :
S ( S⁻¹ e ) y a = { definition of S } S⁻¹ e a ( y a ) = { definition of S⁻¹ } e ( K ( y a ) ) a = { by ( 1 ) , since K ( y a ) a = y a } e y a
Inverting higher - order functions ?
Some endnotes .
Once Nakano and I thought we discovered how to invert higher - order functions ( and even derive the necessary side conditions , like the one on e above ) by drawing λ expressions as trees and manipulating them .
It turned out that I overlooked something obvious in the very beginning and the result was a disaster .
Does anyone know of some related work on inverting higher order functions ?
The only one I know is Samson Abramsky ’s paper A Structural Approach to Reversible Computation , but I am not sure whether it is about reversibility / invertibility in the same sense .

Stupid Friend ..
He came round mine explaining that his PS3 just died for no reason .
I asked him if he used any buggerd games , dvds , or blu-ray .
He said no .
I asked him if he dropped it etc .
No , no no .
So I went round his to have a look .
He had put black duct tape over the air vents .
All of them .
I said ' why have you put duct tape over the vents ?'
He replys with this :
' I am really cautious about my ps3 .
I really look after it .
I do n't want dust getting inside it so I covered up the holes to stop dust from getting in . '
I was in tears .
LATEST :
My friend has got a phone call from some Sony branch .
Apparently he will be getting a new PS3 .
They explained that the system had overheated ( Duh ? ) and that he should take care of where he puts his ps3 .
They suggested a well ventilated area LMAO !
Anyway , they said the system should have shut down automatically but it did n't .
And the reason they are giving him a new one is because they do n't have any refurbished systems in there branch LMAO !!
Guess they havent experienced a broken PS3 b4 lol .
Wow , as so many people are reading this .
you should check out Yes , my friends ps3 broke .

Sony is said to have yet another PlayStation 3 firmware update ready for download before Christmas , with the gift for movie - loving gamers being Profile 1.1 compatibility for Blu-ray Discs .
Competing format HD DVD has had support for Profile 1.1 features such as picture - in - picture , secondary audio , and local storage since its inception , while in the Blu-ray spec they were optional .
There are n't any Profile 1.1 Blu-ray titles on the market yet , and only a single 1.1 - compatible player for sale from Panasonic , so this is really about having one more bullet point on a box for fanboys to argue about .
The only major HD DVD feature that becomes required in Profile 2.0 is Internet connectivity , so downloadable content will still be optional for some 1.1 - compatible BD players -- but not the PS3 with its built - in Ethernet jack .
Considering the PS3 is still one of the cheapest and most widely - owned Blu-ray players , and Sony continues to improve its capabilities via firmware updates , PS3 fans and Blu-ray Disc aficionados have that much more ammo to use in the never - ending format war .

Too Sick to Work : Colds and Flu
You wake up with a scratchy throat , followed shortly by sneezing , a runny nose , and coughing .
It could be the common cold , which is most contagious during the first two days after symptoms start .
The onset is most infectious because of “ a high viral load , ” Cummins says , “ but people can be contagious for several days or even up to a week . ”
A cold does n’t always bring fever , but some people develop a mild one at the beginning .
“ Even though fever makes you feel terrible , it ’s actually your friend because it ’s your body ’s attempt to get rid of whatever ails you , ” says Linda Haynes , MD , an associate clinical professor of family medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine .
What ’s a true fever ?
Many patients , even nurses on occasion , will report a fever to Haynes if they get a thermometer reading of 99 degrees .
“ That ’s not a fever , ” Haynes says .
“ Technically , we consider a fever anything over 100.3 degrees . ”
Resting at home when you have a fever or severe cold symptoms , such as lots of coughing and sneezing , will not only aid your recovery , but also spare your coworkers from infectious droplets .
If you have mild coughing and sneezing and no fever -- and you feel that you need to go to work -- take measures to reduce chances of infecting others .
Be sure to cover your mouth when sneezing or coughing .
Wash your hands frequently to prevent transmission , or use alcohol - based hand sanitizers .
Compared to colds , flu symptoms are more severe and tend to come on abruptly .
The flu also penetrates deeper into the respiratory tract .
Often , the flu announces itself with chills .
Fever is also common in the first few days , and a sick person ’s temperature may rise to 102 or 103 degrees .
Other flu signs : muscle aches , headache , a runny nose , sore throat , cough , weakness , and fatigue .
The flu delivers a punch powerful enough that many people want to take to bed for a few days .
Again , fever and severe symptoms are strong signs that you 're too sick to work and should stay home .
The flu usually goes away in seven to 10 days in otherwise healthy people , although they may still have a cough and feel tired when they return to work .
Although most people will need a few days off to recuperate , they can go back to the workplace 24 to 48 hours after their temperature has returned to normal .

Much has been written about WHY to impeach .
But even among people who believe Bush and Cheney lied or intentionally misled the congress about WMDs and reasons to go to war , even among people people who believe that Bush and Cheney have treasonously violated laws and betrayed the constitution , some people do n’t believe there should be impeachment proceedings .
I ’ve listed , below , some of the most common objections to impeachment , with rebuttals to them .
It is important to keep in mind that impeachment is a constitutional tool , primarily to be used , in the early stages for hearings and investigations .
Most in congress seem to think of impeachment focusing on the Senate impeachment trial , ignoring history .
Keep in mind that Richard Nixon never ended up being tried by the Senate .
After hearings exposed the levels of lawbreaking and corruption , a group of Senate Republicans took “ the walk ” to the White House to tell Nixon he had to go , that if he did n’t , they were ready to remove him .
Of course , that was after Agnew had been pushed to resign , with hearings that disclosed enough to show how dirty he was .
This is the scenario that will unfold for the Bush / Cheney administration .
Judiciary committee impeachment hearings will disclose enough about Cheney so he will resign .
Then hearings on Bush will reveal enough dirt so the GOP leaders will cut their losses at some point , when supporting Dubya no longer seems at all viable , when the GOP brand will be close to going down the toilet , and they ’ll take “ the walk ” to visit George to tell him he has to quit or they will side with the Dems and remove him .
Bottom line -- impeachment will never reach the Senate .
But for these things to happen , Nancy Pelosi has to put impeachment back on the table and let John Conyers , head of the house judiciary committee , do the job he ’s ready to do — start impeachment investigations of Cheney and Bush .
It worked to get rid of Gonzales .
It will work for Cheney , then Bush too .
Here are some common arguments against impeachment , with their rebuttals .
Frankly , if the Dems fail to impeach , and they fail to end the war , and they let Bush ’s disastrous economic policies and his massive war spending continue , the USA will be in even worst trouble than the horrific mortgage / housing and dollar crash and credit disaster we are already in .

It 's funny how anniversaries sneak up on us .
The monstrosity above is an early prototype of the Atari CX2600 Video Computer System that went into production in October 1977 .
The $ 199 system came bundled with Combat , two rubberized joysticks , a pair of paddle controllers and a handy dandy RF modulator to mangle your parents ' TV reception .
The prototype was built by Steve Mayer and Ron Milner in 1975 , and it's now part of the Computer History Museum 's permanent collection .
They relied upon a DEC PDP - 11 minicomputer to cross -compile the system 's software because there simply were n't any suitable off - the - shelf microcomputers ; the Apple II , Commodore PET and Radio Shack TRS - 80 were still years away .
The 2600 very nearly did n't happen .
The early prototypes relied on a circuit board full of video circuitry which was miniaturized into a single IC , the TIA ( Television Interface Adapter ) .
Development costs skyrocketed , and Atari founder Nolan Bushnell realized in 1976 that the company simply did n't have the financial strength to complete the project as Pong sales plateaued .
He sold the company to Warner Communications for $ 28 million , and it is rumored that the final development cost of the system was more than $ 100 million .
It proved to be an insanely risky but shrewd gamble for Warner .
The custom TIA chip was the key to making the system commercially viable .
Microcomputer hardware was phenomenally expensive in the mid 1970s , and the first production version was built around only three main chips : the MOS 6507 CPU ( a low - cost version of the famed MOS 6502 processor that would eventually power millions of home computers ) , MOS 6537 RIOT ( 128 bytes of RAM , two bidirectional I /O ports and a programmable timer ) , and Jay Miner 's crude TIA video chip .
The only other significant component was the cartridge ROM .
Early games such as Combat were crammed into 2 K of ROM - a mere 2048 bytes - because memory was incredibly expensive .
At the time , no one could imagine using the full 8 K that the 6507 was capable of addressing .
Incredibly , a handful of later titles included a whopping 32 K of bank - switched ROM .
The Atari 2600 's impact upon the gaming world was immense .
No less than eight variations were produced over its stunning 14 year lifespan , along with three Sears - branded models and over a dozen clones .
The system sold in excess of 40 million units , and AtariAge lists well over 1300 different game titles .
This is all the more incredible because the system was envisioned to have only a two or three year lifespan before being replaced by something more sophisticated .
That day never came .
Even though Atari made repeated attempts to surpass their initial design , the 2600 remained the pinnacle of the company 's console gaming success .
The Atari 2600 prototype is part of the Computer History Museum 's permanent collection in Mountain View , California .
Special thanks to Atari Age for allowing us to reproduce their images as part of Atari Week .
Happy Birthday , VCS .
As for you ...
Have you played Atari today ?
From the first sight this Russian young lady is nothing special , but scroll down for details about her :
She ’s Russia ’s Power - Lifting champion , many awards and titles she has , but as people say when they meet her on the street they ca n’t even imagine that she is an athlete .
A Barbary macaque is groomed by a fellow member of its species , Macaca sylvanus .
New research indicates that females shout during sex to help males ejaculate .
Female monkeys may shout during sex to help their male partners climax , research now reveals .
Without these yells , male Barbary macaques ( Macaca sylvanus ) almost never ejaculated , scientists found .
Female monkeys often utter loud , distinctive calls before , during or after sex .
Their exact function , if any , has remained heavily debated .
Counting pelvic thrusts
To investigate the purpose behind these calls , scientists at the German Primate Center in Göttingen focused on Barbary macaques for two years in a nature reserve in Gibraltar .
The researchers found that females yelled during 86 percent of all sexual encounters .
When females shouted , males ejaculated 59 percent of the time .
However , when females did not holler , males ejaculated less than 2 percent of the time .
To see if yelling resulted from how vigorous the sex was , the scientists counted the number of pelvic thrusts males gave and timed when they happened .
They found when shouting occurred , thrusting increased .
In other words , hollering led to more vigorous sex .
Counting monkey pelvic thrusts is admittedly " quite weird , but it 's science , " researcher Dana Pfefferle , a behavioral scientist and primatologist at the German Primate Center , told LiveScience .
" You get used to it . "
Quite promiscuous
Male and female Barbary macaques are promiscuous , often having sex with many partners .
This means sperm levels can get quite drained .
The females shout when they are most fertile , so males can make the most use of their sperm .
Pfefferle noted her research suggests these calls might also make females more attractive to other males .
She added these shouts might play different roles in other species .
Pfefferle and her colleagues detailed their findings online Dec. 18 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
So even the ghostwriter had a ghostwriter : Bob Hostetler , an evangelical pastor and author from Ohio , rewrote many passages , especially in the section that narrates Flew ’s childhood .
With three authors , how much Flew was left in the book ?
“ He went through everything , was happy with everything , ” Varghese said .
Cynthia DiTiberio , the editor who acquired “ There Is a God ” for HarperOne , told me that Hostetler ’s work was limited ; she called him “ an extensive copy editor . ”
“ He did the kind of thing I would have done if I had the time , ” DiTiberio said , “ but editors do n’t get any editing done in the office ; we have to do that in our own time . ”
I then asked DiTiberio if it was ethical to publish a book under Flew ’s name that cites sources
Flew does n’t know well enough to discuss .
“ I see your struggle and confusion , ” she said , but she maintained that the book is an accurate presentation of Flew ’s views .
“ I do n’t think Tony would have allowed us to put in anything he was not comfortable with or familiar with , ” she said .
“ I mean , it is hard to tell at this point how much is him getting older .
In my communications with him , there are times you have to say things a couple times .
I ’m not sure what that is .
I wish I could tell you more .
. .
We were hindered by the fact that he is older , but it would do the world a disservice not to have the book out there , regardless of how it was made . ”
MANY AUTHORS DON'T WRITE their own books .
Some do n’t even read them : sports fans will remember when the basketball player Charles Barkley complained that he was misquoted in his own autobiography .
It could be that two years ago , when Varghese started writing Flew ’s book , Flew was a fuller partner in the process than he remembers ( the section on Flew ’s childhood could hardly have been written without his cooperation ) .
And perhaps he was recently reading those philosophers whose names he now does not recognize .
Two years ago , he might have had a fruitful conversation with Brian Leftow , a man he does not remember .
Two years ago , he and Gary Habermas might indeed have been good friends .
But it seems somewhat more likely that Flew , having been intellectually chaperoned by Roy Varghese for 20 years , simply trusted him to write something responsible .
Varghese had done him so many kindnesses .
He introduced Flew to Gerald Schroeder and John Haldane , and , I learned , he flew to England to chauffeur Flew to meetings with Leftow and the Christian philosopher Richard Swinburne ( although when Leftow and Swinburne appear in the book , the conversations are described as if Varghese were not present ) .
Varghese also gave Flew adventures , jetting him to Dallas and New York , putting him in a DVD documentary , getting his name in the papers .
If at times Flew could be persuaded , by a letter or a phone call from an American atheist , that Varghese and his crew were not the eminent authorities on science they made themselves out to be , he was always happy to change his mind back .
These Christians were kind and attentive , and they always seemed to have the latest research .
To believe that Flew has been exploited is not to conclude that his exploiters acted with malice .
If Flew in his dotage was a bit gullible , Varghese had a gullibility of his own .
An autodidact with no academic credentials , Varghese was clearly thrilled to be taken seriously by an Oxford - trained philosopher ; it may never have occurred to him that so educated a mind could be in decline .
Habermas , too , speaks of Flew with a genuine reverence and seems proud of the friendship .
Intellectuals , even more than the rest of us , like to believe that they reach conclusions solely through study and reflection .
But like the rest of us , they sometimes choose their opinions to suit their friends rather than the other way around .
Which means that Flew is likely to remain a theist , for just as the Christians drew him close , the atheists gave him up for lost .
“ He once was a great philosopher , ” Richard Dawkins , the Oxford biologist and author of “ The God Delusion , ” told a Virginia audience last year .
“ It ’s very sad . ” Paul Kurtz of Prometheus Books says he thinks Flew is being exploited .
“ They ’re misusing him , ” Kurtz says , referring to the Christians .
“ They ’re worried about atheists , and they ’re trying to find an atheist to be on their side . ”
They found one , and with less difficulty than atheists would have guessed .
From the start , the believers ’ affection for Antony Flew was not unrequited .
When Flew met Christians who claimed to have new , scientific proof of the existence of God , he quickly became again the young graduate student who embarked on a study of the paranormal when all his colleagues were committed to strict rationalism .
He may , too , have connected with the child who was raised in his parents ’ warm , faithful Methodism .
Flew ’s colleagues will wonder how he could sign a petition to the prime minister in favor of intelligent design , but it becomes more understandable if the signatory never hated religious belief the way many philosophers do and if he never hated religious people in the least .
At a time when belief in God is more polarizing than it has been in years , when all believers are being blamed for religion ’s worst excesses , Antony Flew has quietly switched sides , just following the evidence as it has been explained to him , blissfully unaware of what others have at stake .
My first evening in Beijing my new friends Fred and Pockey took me to a beautiful restaurant on HouHai Lake in the center of Beijing .
Very pretty at night with the lights on the water .
It was very dark though and we all struggled to read the menus by the light on Fred 's cell phone .
So I 'm picking out what I want to eat and going through the menu and something stops me in my tracks .
A collision between Web 2.0 and food in my first hours of Beijing .
I look down at the menu and say to Pockey , " Okay , I know my Cantonese is barely passable and my Mandarin is non-existent , but you have got to tell me what 303 is . "
She says " What number ? "
" Sam ling sam "
She finds it and starts laughing .
It is Stir - fried wikipedia .
So , after much discussion , here is what we think happened .
" Hey I 'm making the new menu , what 's the english name for those flat crispy mushrooms ? "
" Um , there is n't one . "
" Well what should I put down here ? "
" I do n't know , look it up in wikipedia . "
" What ? "
" Wikipedia ! "
Wikipedia with peppers looks like this :
And it is delicious .
So , thanks Jimmy Wales , for adding to the experience .
Update : Many people asked what the name of the restaurant was .
While I was in China , things were happening so fast that I just did n't notice .
But Pockey was quick to tell me .
She says :
" South silk road ( cha ma gu dao ) is the name and its at the ( hou hai ) "
Another Update : Mr. Codeman38 in the comments to this post directs us to another photo of Wikipedia in Beijing !
Utterly bizarre .
私の師匠の話をしようと思います。全くの専門外から
えぃやぁと、この業界に入り込んだ私を鍛え上げた師匠です。私はようやく当時の師匠の年齢に追いついたけれど、しかし師匠に遙か及ばないのです。
* * *
思えば、師匠は相当変な人でした。
朝は会社に来ないし、リーダの仕事である判子押しを新人だった私に押しつけちゃったりと、ハチャメチャな人でしたが、専務も社長も
師匠にだけは何も言えないという、マンガのような人でした。
曰く 「眠いときは寝てから仕事する。それが一番効率的だ」。曰く「誰でも出来る仕事は新人にやらせても一緒だろう」。師匠は徹底的な合理主義者であり、常に合理的な最適解を出します。その前にタブーなんてのは全くなかったりします。ようするにハッカーだったのです。
私の会社は デスマーチが常態と化していいました。そのなかで師匠は、デスマーチを起こさなかったし、炎上しているプロジェクトは師匠の手にかかると鎮火しました。たとえ最悪の状況でも胴体着地はしてみせる。どんな危機的状況であっても コントロールは師匠の手の中にありました。私は師匠の仕事っぷりにすっかり痺れてしまったのです。
一方で会社はとても酷かったです。 「同時に3つのプロジェクトを進めて初めて一人前だ」と言われ、皆複数のプロジェクトを掛け持ちしてました。定時で一つ、残業時間で一つ、休日で一つ。だから、緩急がなく常にピンチでしたし、一カ所で起きたデスマーチは森林火災のように一気に会社中のプロジェクトに広まりました。それでも、師匠の管理するプロジェクトチームだけは火災と無縁で、・・・その代わり同時に処理せよと放り込まれる炎上プロジェクトはどんどん増え、育てた戦力はそちらのチームに剥ぎ取られていきました。
しかしそんなやるせない状況下でも、師匠は 健全にプロジェクトを動かせるような工夫を絶やしませんでした。人手が足りないと言えば新人をつぎ込まれ、ようやく一人前になりだした3年目を目前にはぎ取られる。そんなサイクルを繰り返す。どないせいっちゅうんや、な状況下で師匠は、新人がいきなり戦力になって勝手に育つような仕組みと作ってしまうというハックをしていました。
要はコードが読めて書けばいいんでしょう？
例えば 、C言語は サブセットでした。ループはwhile だけだったし、一行で一つの処理をすることを推奨されていた（これはデバッガ対策でもあったが）。文字列渡しは必ず & str_buf [ 0 ]
のように配列を意識させる書き方を徹底していたし、ポインタは変数名に
_ptr を含むなど、ポインタとして解る名前を付けるようにしていた、ようするにコードの字面を具現側に傾けるよう配慮されてました。コーディングスタイルは
とにかくシンプルなルールになるように。どれもこれも
よちよちあるきの新人のためのコーディング規約です。
しかし、極めつけはコメントで それは奇っ怪ながら非常に良くできた仕組みでした。たしか、こんな感じだったです。
RESULT_TYPE ConsoleScanNumber ( const char * query_msg , int * number_ptr ) { char input_buf [ CIN_BUF_LEN ] ; char lf_chk_buf [ CIN_BUF_LEN ] ; char * lf_ptr ; int convert_cnt ; if ( query_msg [ 0 ] != ' \ 0 ' ) { printf ( & query_msg [ 0 ] ) ; } fgets ( & input_buf [ 0 ] , CIN_BUF_LEN , stdin ) ; memcpy ( &lf_chk_buf [ 0 ] , &input_buf [ 0 ] , CIN_BUF_LEN ) ; while ( TRUE ) { lf_ptr = strchr ( &lf_chk_buf [ 0 ] , '
' ) ; if ( lf_ptr != NULL ) { break ; } fgets ( &lf_chk_buf [ 0 ] , CIN_BUF_LEN , stdin ) ; } convert_cnt = sscanf ( input_buf , " %d " , number_ptr ) ; if ( convert_cnt == 1 ) { return ( OK ) ; } else { return ( NG ) ; } }
コメントがまるで擬似コード（！）。Cが読めなくても 処理の流れが読めます。リーディングはこれでOK。ではライティングは、というと、私はコードをコメントから書け、そしてコメントとコメントの狭間にコードを落とし込むのだ
と言われました。コードをセパレートするコメントはたとえ構文上の文章構造がなくても、プログラムには常に構造があるのだということを意識させました（そのブロックにそぐわない処理をいれると直ぐ気づく）。
またセパレートされたブロック間のコードが大きくなったらそこをそのまま関数に分割しろと言われました。これは、（当時知らなかったけれど）構造化プログラミングです。このスタイルでコーディングをすると、自然に良い（スパゲティでない）プログラムが作れるようになる、そんな補助輪になってくれるコーディング規約です*1。
もちろん、このコーディングスタイルは、保守にべらぼうに工数がかかるし、冗長です。
なので普通の状況下では ナンセンスなのですが、しかし実際あの環境ではとても有効で、師匠以外のチームの平均社会人歴は
2年を割るような状況でも、私たちのプログラムの品質は高く、不具合もほとんどありませんでした。当時は当たり前だったけど、今思い返せばびっくり。
師匠の元で育った人材は社内的にも「優秀」のレッテルが貼られるようになり、師匠の弟子であることだけで一目置かれました。だから、私も、まぁつい天狗になってしまって、手痛い失敗をしたのですが、、、その失敗談は次の機会ってことで。(^^;*2
* * *
K のこと - Backnumbers : Steps to Phantasien を読みました。素晴らしい文章で、同時にとても懐かしかった。
K が踏み固めた足元にある泥沼を私は見ていなかった . 道半ばに満足していた .
私は師匠を思い出す。あの果てしない底なし沼のなかで私に足場があったのは、師匠のおかげ。今、私は泥の中で足を踏み出すような仕事を未だに続けています。今でこそ結構うまく歩けるようになったもんだと自分でも思えるけれど、師匠の元を離れて初めて自分だけでズブリと沈んだ沼の感触を私は忘れられない。私は歩けると思っていたけれど全然歩けなかった。なくなって、初めて解るありがたみ。そんなもんです。
もう、師匠とあうことは無いでしょう。実は私は逃げ出した不肖の弟子で、連絡手段も今はもうありません。（風の噂には体をこわしたと聞きます。大丈夫かなぁ）。あの頃は逃げ出さないと死んでしまったから、その選択は後悔していないのですが、でも、今でも
もっと長く師匠の歩き方を見ていたらなと思うことはあります。盗みたいと思う。だって私は、年齢しか当時の師匠に追いついていないから。
Harriet Miers and Bush Chief of Staff to face contempt charges Michael Roston
Published : Monday July 23 , 2007 Print This Email This Former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and Joshua Bolten , the current Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush , will likely be charged with contempt by the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday this week .
" This investigation , including the reluctant but necessary decision to move forward with contempt , has been a very deliberative process , taking care at each step to respect the Executive Branchs legitimate prerogatives ,  said Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , in a statement .
" I 've allowed the White House and Ms. Miers every opportunity to cooperate with this investigation , either voluntarily or under subpoena .
It is still my hope that they will reconsider this hard - line position , and cooperate with our investigation so that we can get to the bottom of this matter . "
Through an attorney , Miers had had earlier stated that she does not fear contempt charges .
She refused to comply with a subpoena and appear before the House Committee on July 12 as part of the investigation into the firing of 9 US Attorneys .
Bolten also has failed to turn over documents sought by House Democrats .
The Bush chief of staff was ordered to comply with the subpoena by 10 AM this morning .
White House on contempt proceedings : ' Spectacle '
In Monday afternoon 's press conference , White House Press Secretary Tony Snow dismissed the contempt charges as " a fishing expedition that 's woefully short on fish . "
He repeated the White House 's offer for off - the - record interviews for officials like Miers on the US Attorneys firings , and suggested that the Justice Department was unlikely to proceed with contempt charges , " if precedent is any guide . "
However , he insisted that the White House would not make that judgment for the Justice Department .
" You have to leave that up to the Justice Department , they have to make that determination , " he said .
Snow had earlier pointed to quotes from Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , in 1999 and 2000 in which he called the threat of contempt charges against Clinton administration officials a ' spectacle . '
Leahy also noted , according to the White House Press Secretary , that there was a Justice Department tradition of refusing to bring contempt charges against White House officials .
After a vote is held in the Committee , the contempt charges must be passed by the full House of Representatives .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested on Saturday that she would support contempt charges at the least for Miers .

Federal marshals posing as supporters peacefully arrested a couple convicted of tax evasion who had been holed up in their New Hampshire mountaintop home for months , vowing to die fighting rather than surrender .
Ed and Elaine Brown let the marshals into their secluded Plainfield compound about 7:45 p.m. Thursday , U.S. Marshal Stephen Monier said .
The Browns were arrested before they realized they had been deceived , Monier said Friday at a news conference .
Their turreted house had become a commune for anti-government activists and militiamen who traveled from around the country to visit the couple , bringing them food and ammunition .
“ Ultimately , this open - door policy that they seemed to have -- which allowed the Browns to have some supporters bring them supplies , welcome followers and even host a picnic -- this proved to be their undoing , ” Monier said .
“ They invited us in .
We escorted them out . ”
Monier said no one else was in the Browns ’ home when the undercover agents entered .
“ This ended exactly the way we wanted it to end , ” he said , “ without a shot being fired and with no one getting hurt . ”
Authorities discovered a large number of weapons , explosives and ammunition on the property , Monier said , and booby traps had been set up along the perimeter of the house .
The couple were turned over to the custody of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons , Monier said .
Each is expected to serve a 63 - month sentence .
The Browns stopped paying income taxes in 1996 , saying that the Constitution and Supreme Court decisions supported their claims that ordinary labor cannot be taxed .
Ed Brown , a former exterminator , had repeatedly demanded , “ Show me the law ! ”
But a judge ruled against them in January , convicting the Browns of conspiring to evade paying taxes on $ 1.9 million in income from Elaine ’s dentistry practice .
Ed , 65 , immediately went into hiding , and Elaine , 67 , joined him after both failed to show up for their sentencing in April .
Government and law enforcement officials cut off power , Internet , telephone , cellphone , television and mail service to the couple ’s 110 - acre compound .
But the Browns had equipped it with solar panels , a watchtower , a satellite dish and a stockpile of food .
The couple had attracted national attention from websites and radio shows devoted to discussing their cause .
Supporters held fundraiser concerts on the Browns ’ property and set up a blog and MySpace page for them .
Last month , authorities arrested four men accused of assisting the Browns .
Shaun Kranish , a supporter from Rockford , Ill. , who had visited the Brown home , said that he was discouraged by their arrests and that he found it hard to believe they had not put up a fight .
“ We were not told , ” he said , “ how or what types of weaponry were involved in taking them . ”

The story of Alhassan Bangoura has been fairly well documented in the gathered media over in Britain over the last few days .
That article is probably the best description of the circumstances that Bangoura faced while living in Sierra Leone , from his inevitable execution , to his exile from the country of his birth , faced with human trafficking along the way , before ending up being scouted in a park by Watford , signing on professional terms with the club , and becoming a noticeable , if not necessarily integral part of the club ’s push towards Premiership survival last season , and their rise to the top of the Championship table this time around .
He has been offered a contract with the promotion chasers until 2009 , who clearly see him as a talent worth keeping hold of , believing he may well play a part a second time around in the Premier League if Watford continue to perform to the level which they can and have thus far this season , despite their recent blip in form .
As important as this is to the story , ( it must be said that Bangoura ’s case would be a non-issue were it not for the scope that a professional football club provides ) , it is all something of a side - issue , given what may be potentially at stake if the Asylum and Immigration Authorities enforce their ruling from the week .
Now , given the cirumstances that were stated within the BBC article , the mind boggles how the Immigration Authority can approve the deportation of any person who has been through an ordeal such as Bangoura’s .
Of course , life is not nearly as hard now for him , earning a good sum per week on a contract with a Premiership - chasing football club , married with a newborn son having arrived 10 days ago , but if Bangoura is deported , not only will he lose the life that he has earned by proving his ability and prowess as a footballer , he will probably lose his life .
As simple as it gets , if Al Bangoura is sent back to Sierra Leone any time soon , the Poro Secret Society will find him , they will almost certainly torture him , and then for their own personal retribution , they will mutilate him .
It really is one of those situations where you have to put yourself in the position that Bangoura faces , and imagine what future , if any lies ahead for him if Britain sends him back to his ravaged home country .
Find the sense and justice in that , I ’m lapsing away from the football side of the matter here somewhat , but there ’s far more at stake than just sport .
Adrian Boothroyd is always a man who has earned my admiration for his ability as a manager and a person , he ’s learning with every game what coaching a side is all about and if the Watford board back him for years to come , they may well be able to establish themselves in the Premiership , while his forthright views always managed to hit home , because it is clear that he knows what he is talking about .
In this respect , he certainly could have chosen his words a little better in some respects , but his view is embodied well enough through his words , and certainly you ’ll have to go far to find anyone with half an ounce of sense that disagrees with what he has to say .
He put it better than I ever could , so I ’ll leave it to the man himself …
“ After the immigration hearing I said that I had faith in British justice but obviously I was totally mistaken because it ’s a completely ludicrous decision , ” Boothroyd said .
“ This country , great as it once was , seems to allow anybody in to send benefits wherever they fancy and we have one young man here who pays his taxes , has a fiancee and a newborn son and somebody somewhere thinks it ’s a good decision to send him back to Sierra Leone .
It ’s ridiculous .
As highlighted in the Times article , the Labour MP for Watford , Claire Ward , has promised to take up Bangoura ’s case up with the Immigration Minister , Liam Byrne , in a bid to ensure that Bangoura can remain in the country on a permanent basis .
Some of you cynics may question why he deserves such preferential treatment in comparison with other , perhaps even more damning cases dotted around the country .
The simple fact of the matter is that he does n’t deserve preferential treatment in the same way that no - one does , and that every case should be taken on it ’s merits , rather than the status of the individual involved .
But this is the only case that will attain a media scope on this level , and in that respect , it brings the issue home to people of how bizarre rulings in cases such as these can be .
The Immigration Authority has condemned people to torture and death before with it ’s decisions , they will do it in the future , long after the Al Bangoura case has been consigned to history .
But now that a matter like this is in the public domain , it is important that everything is done to save at least one life , even if in the relative context of matters , it is a privileged life .
If Al Bangoura is sent back to Sierra Leone , then it will be a black stain on the name of the Immigration Authority , and it will almost certainly be Bangoura ’s blood on their hands .
I cannot tell you the ins and outs of Alhassan Bangoura as a player , and I am not going to pretend that I know everything about his playing style , his potential as a future star for Watford or anything else relative to his career .
Simply put , the footballing issues need to be put to one side for now , despite the scope that they have provided in bringing his case to the attention of the local and national media , they are not important right now .
I implore readers of this article to sign up to the petition that Claire Ward will be presenting as part of her argument against the deportation of Al Bangoura , be it at the appeal which has been lodged , or at another point in the near future .
Her parliamentary e-mail is wardc@parliament.uk , so I would urge you to send a brief message voicing your support for the campaign of Bangoura , be you a Watford fan , a Manchester United fan , a Hartlepool fan , a Motherwell fan , hell , even if you ’re a Luton fan , register your support .
It may well prove to be a futile effort in the end , but it is important to consider what is potentially at stake in this situation , not only for Al Bangoura , but for his friends , for his colleagues , for his club , and especially for his wife and baby boy .
It ’s a small contribution , but at least it ’s something .
NB : Matthew from TheOffside , who runs the England and Leeds United blogs , brought this matter to light within his blogs before I wrote this article .
His contribution to the matter must be noted and appreciated as well relating to this matter .
You can find his brief piece on the matter at the link below :
British Government poised to condemn young African footballer to death
" An Italian labor union RSU is in dispute with IBM -- pay negotiations there look like there will be an effective pay cut for very many Italian IBM staffers , " he e-mails me .
" The union is expecting hundreds of avatars of Italian IBM workers , as well as IBM staff from around the world , and other trades unionists , to converge flash - mob style later this month , to demonstrate and spread the word about the dispute . "
News that IBM has a corporate campus in Second Life is so last year ago .
Launching a union protest against IBM in Second Life is where it 's at now .
At least according to John Wood of Tigmoo , a blog network for UK labor unions , with a site in SL .
There 's more resources at the site of Uni Global , a Swiss union federation involved with the protest , in preparation for its September 25th launch , including links for getting a " Strike Kit " at their SL headquarters .
More from the AFL - CIO 's blog here , which reports that the dispute is over a 1,000 Euro paycut -- about $ 1,377 a year .
At this point , it 's too early to determine how effective such a mobilization will be , and whether it'll involve any of the IBM staff who work at the Second Life campus .
I 'm checking with IBM and the protest leaders and will update accordingly .
Update , 6:40 PM : Just had a quick interview with Uni Global SL spokesperson , aptly named UNIglobalunion Oh .
Are you planning to protest on the IBM campus ?
UO : Yes we are planning to be present on the IBM sim .
But if they throw us out we have other alternatives for our virtual strike !
How many actual IBM employees are expected at the protest , and how many who already work at their SL campus ?
UO : It 's hard to predict how many IBM employees will join as most of them have given us their private email addresses to join the strike .
A few of them have given IBM addresses , which has just allowed us to confirm the participation of IBM workers in a number of different countries .
Indeed , we are expecting 18 countries to participate in the strike -- at least .
I 'm not sure any of them work on the IBM [ Second Life ] campus !
It seems for now we are fighting issues in real life for IBM Italy workers ...
I 'm not sure IBM would appreciate SL workers joining the strike .
Yet , they are more than welcome to go on strike with us !
Why is protesting in SL the most effective means of pushing this issue forward ?
UO : Protesting in SL is ONE of the means of pushing the issue forward .
We need dialog with IBM and a better deal for the thousands of employees in Italy .
One of the ways of getting there might be to catch their attention - and the media 's attention - with our planned SL actions .
Update 2 , September 18th : Second Life - based IBM staffer Jaymin Carthage , while declining to comment on the specifics of the protest , offers general thoughts on his company - hosted blog .
Excerpt :
In the specific case of the Italian labor union , if it was my choice , I would treat it like a real world protest .
I would meet with the leaders ( to discuss their protest , not their grievance , that is presumably being taken care of elsewhere ) .
If they were willing to have a non-harassing protest of a set duration I would cooperate with them in having it done .
Perhaps providing a company spokesperson in a set location that people witnessing the demonstration could converse with to get the company view on things .
Once over it would be business as usual .
Not leaflets left by either the company or the protesters giving their views .

A modern - day sufferer of tularemia – the disease can cause skin ulcers and even respiratory failure ( Image : Plamen Padeshki )
Ancient written texts from the Middle East may reveal that the use of biological weapons dates back more than 3300 years , according to a new review .
The historical documents hint that the Hittites – whose empire stretched from modern - day Turkey to northern Syria – sent diseased rams to their enemies to weaken them with tularemia , a devastating bacterial infection that remains a potential bioterror threat even today , says the review .
Experts caution that more evidence is needed to firmly establish that the Hittites intended to spread disease using the animals .
But they add that if this proves true , it might represent the earliest known use of biological warfare .

Tularemia , also known as rabbit fever , can pass from animals such as rabbits and sheep to humans through various routes , most commonly through insects such as ticks that hop between species .
The bacterium responsible for tularemia , Francisella tularensis , causes symptoms ranging from skin ulcers to respiratory failure .
Modern medication can stop the tularemia from becoming fatal .
But without proper antibiotic treatment , about 15 % of infected individuals die , says Siro Trevisanato , a former microbiologist who has delved into the ancient texts .
Hittite plague
Tularemia is rare in many countries today , but remains a problem in some countries including Bulgaria , says Trevisanato , now based in Oakville , Ontario , Canada .
He believes tularemia is to blame for a deadly epidemic dubbed the “ Hittite plague ” which raged through the Middle East in the 14th century BC .
Around 1335 BC , letters to the Egyptian king Akhenaten reported a pestilence in Simyra , a Phoenician city near what is now the border between Lebanon and Syria .
The texts describe a terrible illness causing disabilities and death .
Most tellingly , they mention that , because of the plague , donkeys were banned from being used in caravans .
According to Trevisanato , this indicates that the people living in the city were hit by tularemia .
The disease can infect donkeys and the insects that they carry , so preventing the use of donkeys for transport may have been an attempt to quell its spread .
Roaming rams
A decade later , the Hittites to the north attacked the weakened area around Simyra .
“ The Hittites were able to steal booty , including animals , and brought the animals home , ” along with the tularemia the livestock harboured , Trevisanato explains .
Not too long after , the Hittites themselves apparently began to suffer from an epidemic of tularemia .
History seems to have repeated itself a few years afterwards when another ancient people , the Arzawans from western Anatolia , saw the weakened Hittites to their east and decided to strike .
“ They thought , if we attack now , we can push the border back to where we want , ” Trevisanato says .
But strangely , during this period of warfare between 1320 and 1318 BC , records indicate that rams mysteriously began appearing on roads in Arzawa .
The Arzawans took the sheep to their villages and used them for livestock breeding .
Soon after , though , they began to suspect a link between the appearance of the animals and the terrible disease ravaging their communities .
“ They started wondering ‘ Why do these rams start showing up on the road ? ' ” says Trevisanato .
He believes that among the Hittites , “ somebody must have had the bright idea ” to send diseased rams over to their Arzawan enemies .
Ultimately , the Arzawans were so weakened that their attempt to conquer the Hittites failed .
Modern threat
Trevisanato ’s theory is intriguing , says Jonathan Tucker , at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Washington , DC , US who studies the use of chemical and biological weapons .
He points out that there is no vaccine for tularemia and that experts consider it a “ possible or likely biological warfare agent ” in the present day .
Still , in order to consider the rams as a true biological weapon , evidence is needed to clearly prove that the Hittites understood the full ramifications of these animals towards their enemies , says Mark Wheelis , at the University of California , Davis .
“ The intent would have to be not to just freak the enemy out , but to actually transmit disease , ” he explains .
Until such intent to spread disease is proven beyond a doubt , Wheelis says any theory is speculative .

Power of the People Moves Corporate Media to Do the Right Thing
IMPEACHMENT ?
Power of the People Moves Corporate Media to Do the Right Thing by Dave Lindorff Wexler ( D - FL ) said that he thought Democratic leaders in Congress , who have been aggressively blocking efforts to begin impeachment hearings , are risking alienating progressive voters next November by failing to act on impeachment .
A massive outpouring of angry mail and phone calls to the nation 's leading newspapers led to editors calling Congress members Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) , Luis Gutierrez ( D - IL ) and Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , after having turned down an op -ed by the three calling for immediate hearings on the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney .
At least one of those papers , the Miami Herald , which is in Rep .
Wexler 's congressional district , reversed itself and decided to run an edited version of the editorial it had rejected only days earlier .
Wexler , speaking on Florida Progressive Radio Thursday night , said it was clearly grassroots pressure and reporting on the Internet ( inclulding by this site ! ) that forced editors at the Miami Herald to change their position on the editorial .
( To hear Wexler 's interview , go to : Wexler on FPR )
He is calling on Americans who want to see Congress begin impeachment hearings to put even more pressure on Congress to also change its position .
" I think it 's obvious that Congress is way behind the people on this , " he said , " and it 's quite obvious that in this case the people have gotten it right . "
Wexler said , " If the people in Congress could come up with reasons why the abuses of this administratiion are not serious to impeach , then I 'd say Congress should not listen to the grassroots , but I do n't think anyone in Congress could say that with a straight face .
In fact , it 's the opposite .
They 're saying , ` Even though this administration has committed these crimes against the constitution , we can't do anything about it . ' "
Wexler said that he thought Democratic leaders in Congress , who have been aggressively blocking any effort to begin impeachment hearings , even to the point of pressuring state and local party activists into not passing impeachment resolutions , are risking alienating progressive voters -- both Democrats and independents -- next November by failing to act on impeachment .
" If Congress were really popular , with say 58 percent favorable ratings , then maybe they could do that , " he says , " but the fact is that this Congress is very , very unpopular . "
Wexler urged activists in favor of impeachment to put increasing pressure on their own congressional representatives , on their local news outlets , and on other members of the Judiciary Committee to support hearings on Cheney 's impeachable actions , and vowed to bring a petition he has set up on line , which has garnered over 120,000 signatures in less than a week 's time , to show every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee .
" I will be asking every Democrat on that committee to support immediate hearings , " said the six - term Congressman .
Wexler praised his colleague , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , for pressing forward with the impeachment issue , and for submitting a bill ( H Res 799 ) for the impeachment of Vice President Cheney .
In another example of the effect of people power is that Rep. Anthony Wiener ( D - NY ) , yet another member of the House Judiciary Committee , has signed onto Wexler 's call for immediate hearings .
Of the four , only Baldwin is a co-signer of Kucinich 's impeachment bill .
Since she is one of six members of the Judiciary Committee who are co-signers , that makes a total of nine Judiciary Committee members now who are in favor of Cheney impeachment hearings .
That leaves 13 Democrats on the Judiciary Committee , including Chairman John Conyers , who have not expressed any support .
But of those 13 , five -- Conyers and Reps. Brad Sherman , Mel Watt , Bobby Scott , and Artur Davis , voted against a Democratic leadership move to table ( and thus kill ) Kucinich 's bill last Nov. 7 , thus suggesting that they are in favor of hearings on the measure .
If those five sign on to Wexler 's call , that would mean a clear majority -- 13 - 8-- of Democrats on the Judiciary Committee in favor of hearings on Cheney 's impeachment .
In another development , Rep. Gwen Moore ( D - WI ) added her name to the Kucinich Cheney impeachment bill , bringing the total number of co-sponsors , plus Kucinich himself , to 25 -- the number who initially signed on to impeachment hearings on Richard Nixon in 1974 .
Things are definitely moving in the right direction .
The bankrupt and cynical effort by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic Party leaders to snuff out the impeachment demands of a majority of Americans and of the vast majority of Democrats is crumbling .

じゃあ、 document .evaluate には何を渡せばいいの？ ここで、 XPath の登場です ！
( ﾟ∀ﾟ ) o彡゜XPath ！XPath！
document.evaluate は以下のように使います！ var result = document .evaluate ( '//div ' , document , null , 7 , null ) ; result.snapshotLength ; result.snapshotItem(0 ) ; result.snapshotItem( 1 ) ; ね？簡単でしょ ？
The worst purchase I ever made was my Compaq Presario laptop .
It has been a near endless cause of headaches .
I was playing around with some settings and when I rebooted my computer I noticed that it prompted me with the Windows login screen … except there were no user accounts ?!
I did the usual process of grabbing the boot CD , logging in to the Recovery Console where it prompted me for an Administration password that I did not know .
Doh .
Web searches revealed that the default administrator password for Compaq Presario computers is blank , but that did n’t work .
I grabbed a handy - dandy Ubuntu Linux live CD I had lying around , booted it , but it was configured not to be able to mount the Windows partition .
Grrarrgh .
If only there was a way to get to a login console other than that crappy Windows welcome screen .
I had an idea , so simple it was guaranteed not to work .
I rebooted yet again and went to the broken welcome screen .
This time I pressed Control - Alt - Delete .
Nice try Mr. Gates .
You almost had me , but I ’ve outfoxed you this time !
Of course , as soon as walked away from the laptop for two minutes the hibernation mode kicked in and it locked up again .
If only there was a way to turn that off …
Disabling the Windows login prompt for password
Start Menu >>
Run… type : Control Userpasswords2
Uncheck “ Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer ”
Disabling the Windows prompt for password after hibernation
Start Menu >> Control Panel >>
Power Options >>
Advanced Tab Uncheck
“ Prompt for password when computer resumes from standby ”
I stand secure in the knowledge that I can go another two years without having to know the administrator password for that danged laptop .
In a culture increasingly obsessed with fat content , it seems only natural that there should be a backlash .
In this case , it comes in the form of fat burgers .
Dangerous Dan's Diner in Toronto offers a fat burger almost guaranteed to make you hurl .
The 24 ounce burger is called , " The Quadruple C , " also known as , " The Collosal Colon Clogger Combo . "
It features a quarter pound of cheese , a quarter pound of bacon , 2 fried eggs , a large shake and poutine .
Holy crap , that 's healthy !
The review of The Quadruple C comes to me from an obsessed burger junkie in Toronto , but I discovered these lovely pictures on a blog named LongDongWong .
The blogger had the opportunity to witness his friend attack the Quadrople C , and noted , " It took [ my friend ] over half an hour just to eat the burger without ever touching the fries and gravy .
During the meal , the urge to hurl was ever present . "
Tasty .
The better part is that LongDongWong knew what happend the next day when his friend , " Did n't really want to eat anymore .
He only wanted to have soup .
I guess it did n't help that his burps smelled and tasted like burger .
"
If your craving for bacon is itching your stomach right now , you can rest assured that fat burgers are n't just available at niche diners .
For example , Wendy's has been promoting the already - infamous .
The Baconator is a 1 / 2 bound burger that features 6 strips of bacon and two pieces of cheese .
It also provides you with 51 grams of delicious fat .
I 've already developed a nice slogan that I 'm offering royalty free , " 900 % more fat , 100 % more taste . "

Fortune Magazine -- Port Fourchon feels like the edge of the world .
As you drive south on Louisiana Highway 1 through Bayou Lafourche , open marshes seem to stretch endlessly until you reach this spot , 60 miles below New Orleans .
There , the marsh once known as trembling prairie meets the Gulf of Mexico .
This is an oil - services installation .
And though its existence is unknown to most Americans , it is vital to them .
Without Port Fourchon and its fleet of vessels bringing food , supplies , equipment , and reinforcements to platforms in the gulf , the U.S. would lose access to nearly a fifth of all the oil and gas it uses .
Port Fourchon is also home to pipelines , miles and miles of them .
There are the feeders from the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , which accommodates the massive tankers that deliver 11 percent of the nation 's foreign oil .
There are conduits that supply two of the nation 's strategic petroleum - reserve facilities .
There are countless more for companies such as Shell ( Charts ) , Chevron ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , and BP ( Charts ) .
All told , the pipelines at Fourchon connect to half of the refining capacity in this country .
And they 're a key stem in a broader branching of pipelines in southern Louisiana , which combine to transport 27 percent of America 's oil and 30 percent of its natural gas .
If the port seems like a mirage on the edge of the marsh , that may be because its permanence is anything but assured .
The port sits in a region that , although it escaped the most cataclysmic destruction of Katrina and Rita , is being ravaged by two slow - moving but equally ruinous phenomena : erosion and the sinking of the land .
Some 25 square miles of Louisiana have been collapsing into the gulf each year for three - quarters of a century .
A total of 1,900 square miles , roughly the area of Delaware , disappeared between the 1930s and 2005 , and another 217 square miles were pulverized into liquid by Katrina and Rita .
And that land loss , says Ted Falgout , who has run Port Fourchon for 28 years , poses a growing threat not only to the people who live here but also to the U.S. energy supply .
" We 're on a train wreck here , " says Falgout .
" We have not designed the energy infrastructure - or any infrastructure - [ to handle land loss ] . "
The problem afflicts all of southern Louisiana .
As land turns to water , it is exposing thousands of miles of oil and gas pipelines that were built underground and were not designed to withstand water or waves .
" There are places where a pipeline that was laid in marsh , well protected , is now in five or six feet of water - in an open bay that is subject to a vessel coming across and hitting it , " says Falgout .
" That 's the thing that [ oil companies ] are spending their money on right now .
It 's so huge that they 're just putting out fires . "
Most energy and pipeline companies seem loath to discuss the issue , but there are signs of anxiety .
" The pipeline companies are very - I do n't want to say nervous - they 're very concerned , " says Clifford Smith , chairman of T. Baker Smith , an engineering firm that has been designing and servicing pipelines in Louisiana since 1913 .
" We 're constantly doing what we call as - builts " - inspections of existing pipelines - " and remedial work , " he says .
" Accidents are happening because of the changes in topography .
It 's a big thing . "
One of the few oil companies willing to talk describes land loss as a chronic challenge , but not an imminent crisis .
" It 's a real concern , " says Melody Meyer , a vice president who heads Chevron 's Gulf of Mexico operations .
" But we 've always been able to manage it . "
At least one oil executive views the threat in more dire terms .
In 2004 , Ed Landgraf , environmental coordinator for Shell Pipeline , sounded the alarm in congressional testimony .
He characterized the destruction of land as " alarming " and called it a " national problem with serious national implications . "
As he put it , " Much of [ southern Louisiana 's ] infrastructure is at risk as the coastline continues to disappear . "
His conclusion : " National energy security can be maintained only if Louisiana 's coast is restored and preserved . "
Landgraf uttered those words a year before Katrina .
Since then , the risk has increased " exponentially , " according to Robert Twilley , a professor of coastal science who heads Louisiana State University 's Gulf Restoration Initiative .
Rita and Katrina knocked out gulf platforms and refineries and sent gasoline prices soaring , but the land - based pipelines largely survived .
Now , though , Twilley says the ongoing loss of terrain means there will be even less margin of safety - for New Orleans , for southern Louisiana , and for the pipelines - the next time a hurricane blows through .
The good news , if you can call it that , is that the destruction wrought by Katrina has raised awareness of coastal erosion .
Louisianans understand that the very marshes that are being destroyed help shield them from hurricanes .
But it 's not clear if the message has penetrated Washington .
And that raises the inevitable question :
Will it take another Katrina to impel a major effort to protect the Louisiana coast ?
One man takes on the gulf
Ted Falgout might appear to be an unlikely candidate to run an oil support facility :
He was trained as a fisheries biologist .
But in Louisiana that is n't such a strange mixture .
Now 56 , he grew up on Bayou Lafourche , where his family has lived since the Acadians - better known as Cajuns - settled there in the 1800s .
His father was a fisherman , a trapper , and an oilfield worker .
Like his dad , Falgout has kept a foot in both worlds :
In addition to running the port , he co-owns an alligator farm .
Port Fourchon has enjoyed huge success under Falgout 's leadership .
His operation , a state commission , consists of 1,200 acres rented to a wide variety of companies that service rigs and platforms in the gulf .
The port has helicopter pads and an airport , and each plot comes with access to a slip so that each tenant 's boat can make their way into the gulf .
When Falgout started , the port had two tenants .
Now it has more than 250 , including oil majors such as BP , Chevron , ConocoPhillips ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , and Shell and giant services companies such as Schlumberger ( Charts ) , Baker Hughes ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , and Halliburton ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
Meanwhile , Falgout has spent years trying to raise awareness of land loss , repeatedly testifying before Congress about the threat to Louisiana 's coast .
As he does that , he has been preparing for the day , perhaps only ten years away , when his facility is no longer on the mainland .
" We can sustain Port Fourchon as an island on the edge of the Gulf of Mexico , " he says .
More than a decade ago Falgout sank barges filled with rocks off Fourchon 's south coast to temper erosion and storm surges .
Now he 's building a forested ridge on the north of the port to protect it from surges there .
And he 's been leading a campaign to raise Highway 1 , which accommodates about 1,200 trucks a day , onto stilts so that it can operate even when the land on which it now sits ceases to exist .
Oil companies , too , are grappling with the coastal forces , though it's hard to discern because pipelines are mostly out of sight under the bayou muck .
As I 'm skippered in a boat up and down Fourchon 's bayous on a sweltering July day , the most common evidence of the infrastructure are signs that dot the edge of the water : warning : do not anchor or dredge .
oil pipeline .
But inside a bayou called Belle Pass , you can see one oil company tackling an erosion problem .
A Chevron barge with two cranes on it floats there , in the process of replacing 11 miles of pipe .
On the barge , workers are welding sections of ten - inch pipe that will be lowered into the water .
Later , water jets will force it down into a 48 - inch - deep trench , after which it will be covered with the mud .
The new pipe is a replacement for a 1960s - vintage predecessor , says Becky Roberts , president of Chevron Pipeline , which owns or operates 2,500 miles of pipelines in southern Louisiana .
The old pipe " had become exposed over time , " she says .
" We knew we needed to do something different .
And we chose to take on more expense and move that line to an area that would cause the least disruption [ to the coast ] and would give the most protection for the pipeline in the future . "
The replacement process is laborious , made even more so on the previous day when company workers stumbled across two non-Chevron pipelines that were n't marked on their maps .
" I 'm going to treat them as if they 're hot [ until proven otherwise ] , " explains Joe Adams , a contract engineer on the barge .
( By " hot " he means full of oil or gas . )
So work stops , and the Chevron team has to wait for surveyors to see whether the pipelines are actually transporting something - and if so , who owns them .
" It 's going to be a spaghetti factory out there , " says Adams of the tangle of pipelines he expects to encounter .
" Spaghetti bowl " is a phrase often used to describe the energy infrastructure in , variously , southern Louisiana , the gulf , and Texas .
The system is a gigantic jumble that evolved without much overall planning .
Some oil companies meticulously mapped as they built ; others did n't .
As a result , says John Snead of the Louisiana Geological Survey , " nobody knows exactly how many pipelines there are in any part of the state . "
His best estimate is 14,000 miles of " transmission lines " in Louisiana .
That leaves out , for example , small " flow lines " - say , a four - inch pipe running from an individual oil well to a collection facility .
In recent years the state of Louisiana has embarked on the grueling process of improving its infrastructure maps .
People trudge through marshes looking for so - called witness posts , aboveground markers for pipelines .
After one such study , notes Roland Guidry , Louisiana 's oil - spill coordinator , " some of the companies were flabbergasted that their pipelines were over a quarter of a mile off from where they thought . "
Oil lines and the environment
Louisiana 's pipelines may not always be easy to locate , but their environmental impact is well understood .
Along with levees and shipping channels , the pipelines - or rather the canals dug to lay them in the marsh - cause erosion and land loss .
In its natural condition the Mississippi River fed the terrain along its banks with regular floods that replenished the land 's sediment .
But after hundreds of years of levee building on the river , its sustaining silt pours out into the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico .
In effect , the land in southern Louisiana has been starved and is slowly sinking , even as sea levels rise because of climate change .
Meanwhile , endless channels and canals have been carved out of the marshes for shipping and for oil and gas wells and facilities .
Those canals eat away at the marshes and allow damaging incursions of salt water , which can kill freshwater vegetation .
" All this was marsh when I was a kid , " says Allen Moreau , 41 .
" My grandaddy could walk across it . "
Moreau , who runs a charter fishing boat , is piloting up a bayou in Venice , La. , on another 95 - degree July day .
The area he is describing as formerly solid land is open water .
Also on the boat is George Pivach , general counsel for the Venice Port Complex , a smaller version of Port Fourchon in Plaquemines Parish .
As we float further south , Pivach points to two parallel rows of rocks extending several hundred feet .
He explains that they marked where one of the bayous joined the gulf .
Two decades later the bayou is gone , and the lines are stranded a mile out in the gulf like a landing strip in an aqueous desert .
Every so often Pivach calls my attention to a " well jacket , " a protective apparatus for an oil well .
The wells , he says , were constructed on solid land , but now they are their own little islands .
The flow lines that take oil from the wells to bigger collection facilities periodically poke out of the water .
They were originally built underground , Pivach explains , so the oil companies did n't erect signs to warn passing boats of the protruding pipes .
Since Katrina , awareness of land loss has crested and created a sense of purpose in Louisiana .
The state legislature this spring passed a master plan to restore the coast .
And after Governor Kathleen Blanco sued the U.S. Department of the Interior last year , the federal government agreed , for the first time , to give the state 38 percent of the royalties it collects for oil drilling in newly developed areas of the gulf .
That may amount to $ 500 million a year .
There 's still a long way to go .
The state plan will cost an estimated $ 50 billion over 30 to 40 years .
That $ 500 million in annual royalties could go a long way to funding it , but the money wo n't fully kick in for another decade .
The biggest aid would come from new federal funding , and so far not much is happening there .
Even if Washington does come through with serious funding , many Louisianans fear that the lion 's share will go to the levees - some of which , as noted , are part of the problem .
Mississippi river levees , shipping channels , and oil and gas canals cause land loss .
So how do you reverse that loss unless you plan to get rid of some levees - which would expose people to floods - or close down shipping channels or oil canals ?
The state 's master plan shows a laudable willingness to make some of those brutal choices , but many Louisianans wonder whether the feds will go that far .
" This is a life - or - death situation , okay ? " says Sidney Coffee , Blanco 's chief advisor on coastal issues and chair of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority .
" We 're beyond urgent down here in what we 're dealing with , " she says , " and we 'll never get from here to there if we keep the same process that we have right now , the same federal process . "
You can detect a strain of resentment in Louisiana these days .
The refrain goes like this :
We sacrificed our environment to give the country oil - and now the country does n't want to help us protect the land that allows it to flow .
Not everyone buys this increasingly common interpretation of events .
( Skeptics recall the decades in which 50 percent of the state 's tax revenues came from oil companies .
As longtime environmentalist and Tulane law professor Oliver Houck wrote last year , " Today we tell Congress that we ' sacrificed ' ourselves for the national good .
Never has there been such a willing , complicit sacrifice .
We made a bundle of money , wasted most of it , and blackballed anyone who questioned what it was doing to the Louisiana coast . " )
But it 's clear that others are not going to volunteer to replace Louisiana .
" The last time I checked , " says Falgout , " there was nobody waiting in line to take Louisiana 's place in servicing the energy industry .
Okay ?
Certainly not California and Florida .
The environmental impacts to moving somewhere else would be huge .
And in this country , it just ai n't going to happen . "
It will be hard to restore the coast without industry support .
Most oil companies say they endorse coastal restoration ; many even write checks to America 's Wetlands , a foundation that is raising awareness of the issue .
But the companies have not taken a public role in , say , lobbying Congress .
( For now , the prevailing industry view is to address the issue pipeline by pipeline .
As Chevron 's Roberts puts it , " We 're used to operating in difficult environments . " )
Once you have the energy people actively involved , then you have to bring in the shipping and fishing industries , the developers , and , not least , the whole morass of various government entities .
It 's a daunting challenge , notes Mark Davis , a thoughtful senior research fellow at Tulane who used to run the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana .
But for all the obstacles , Davis has some hope :
The country has taken on daunting challenges before , he says - the Interstate Highway System and even past projects on the Mississippi .
" The scale of action we 're talking about is not unprecedented , " he says .
" But it took a sense of national purpose .
Not federal purpose .
That 's the key thing here .
That 's why people should care about what happens here .
It 's not because you have to love Cajun food or you love pulling some oil company 's fat out of the fire .
It 's because , quite frankly , the country has a lot at stake here . "

Newswise — A team of scientists led by Dr. Radha Maheshwari , professor of Pathology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences ( USU ) and Rajesh Loganathan Thangapazham , a graduate student , have shown that green tea has antitumor effect in breast cancer cells .
The recently concluded study will be published in the Journal of Cancer Biology and Therapy , December 2007 , Volume 6 , Issue 12 .
Cancer is a disease caused by the increased proliferation of cells which group and form a lump called tumor .
Tumors can be benign or malignant .
Cells from malignant tumors break away from the original tumor and spread to other parts of the body growing and forming new tumors .
They can invade , penetrate into blood and lymphatic vessels , circulate via the bloodstream and can grow in a normal organ or tissue anywhere in the body .
Unfortunately treatment options for metastasis are very limited and usually represent the end stage of the disease .
Unlike malignant tumors , benign tumors do not invade and , with very rare exceptions , are not life threatening .
Chemoprevention broadly implies the use of a chemical substance of either natural or synthetic origin , to prevent , hamper , arrest or reverse a disease .
Phytochemicals are plant based non nutritive components with substantial medicinal properties .
Dr. Maheshwari's study observed that green tea can inhibit the invading capacity of these breast cancer cells and have also identified the mechanisms involved in death inducing and invasion inhibiting effects of green tea .
Epidemiological studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer is found to be less in Asian countries consuming green tea .
These studies have greater clinical significance since the ability of these phytochemicals to activate anti-cancer program of tumor cells might determine the success of chemotherapy .
A study by Dr. Maheshwari that was published earlier this year in Cancer Letters showed that green tea is effective in delaying tumor incidence as well as in reducing the tumor burden .
Green tea was found to inhibit growth of tumors as well as induce death of breast cancer cells .

GHC is packaged for a number of operating systems and distributions .
While they may lag behind the latest GHC release , advantages such as dependency checking and ease of uninstallation mean we recommend using them anyway , unless you have a particular need for new features or bug fixes .
The OS - specific packages ( eg. RPMs on Linux ) are generally a better bet than the vanilla .tar. bz2 binary bundles , because they will check for dependencies and allow the package to be uninstalled at a later date .
However , if you do n't have permission to install binaries on your system , or you want to install somewhere other than the default place ( / usr or /usr / local on a Unix system ) , then you 'll need to use a .tar. bz2 binary bundle .

How to Harvest Passwords
Just put up a password strength meter and encourage people to submit their passwords for testing .
You might want to collect names and e-mail addresses , too .
For the record , here ’s how to choose a secure password :
So if you want your password to be hard to guess , you should choose something not on any of the root or appendage lists .
You should mix upper and lowercase in the middle of your root .
You should add numbers and symbols in the middle of your root , not as common substitutions .
Or drop your appendage in the middle of your root .
Or use two roots with an appendage in the middle .
Even something lower down on PRTK ’s dictionary list — the seven - character phonetic pattern dictionary — together with an uncommon appendage , is not going to be guessed .
Neither is a password made up of the first letters of a sentence , especially if you throw numbers and symbols in the mix .
And yes , these passwords are going to be hard to remember , which is why you should use a program like the free and open - source Password Safe to store them all in .
EDITED TO ADD ( 12/5 ) : Note that I am not actually accusing them of harvesting passwords , only pointing out that you could harvest passwords that way .

I have a hard time listening to Republicans say that the Democrats cannot transcend their anger .
They use stupid catch phrases like “ Bush Derangement Syndrome ” to discredit people ( not just Democrats , according to most pundits , you too suffer from BDS , Andrew ) .
There is a special amount of irony in the party that spent over 200 congressional hours investigating Clinton ’s Christmas card list and less than 10 investigating how we got into the Iraq war accusing the opposition of being driven by blind hatred .
I now live in a country where the president and vice president have the power to detain an American citizen off of the street , send him to a secret prison , torture him , and detain him indefinitely without him ever hearing the charges against them .
We have been lied into a war that was executed with criminal incompetence , our economy has been devastated because of lax oversight of banks giving out bad loans , we have lost a major city and the list goes on and on .
My anger is n’t driven by irrational hatred .
In 2000 , I considered myself a Republican .
But now that party stands as an affront to everything that America stands for .
I have every right to be angry .
Which have bigger brains , chimpanzees or baboons ?
If you guessed chimps , you ’re right .
Chimpanzees are our closest relatives on the planet .
They share between 98.6 % and 99 % of our genes , depending on who ’s counting .
They are way up there in animal brainpower .
An average chimp ’s brain is more than twice as large as the brain of a baboon .
Now for question number two .
Which are smarter , chimpanzees or baboons ?
The answer is … baboons .
But how could that be ?
Chimps are brainier .
Should n’t they also be , well , umm , brainier ?
Brighter by far ?
If baboons are winners on IQ measures , does n’t that mean that intelligence is not just a matter of brain matter ?
The answer is yes , there ’s more to intellect than the number of neurons in your skull .
So what ’s the extra ingredient you need to turn brains into smarts ?
The answer is a bit surprising .
Nimble minds need more than just a lot of synapses between brain cells .
They need the power of groups .
They need a force that pulses from the web of connection between group members … from the sum that ’s bigger than its parts .
They need what Gerardo Beni calls “ swarm intelligence , ” what Tom Atlee and Robert D. Steele call “ Collective Intelligence ” and what I call “ Group IQ . “
Bacteria exploring new territory and sharing information on their finds .
Courtesy of Eshel Ben Jacob .
What in the world is Group IQ ?
For a hint , let ’s look at the very first creatures to self - assemble on this planet .
Let ’s look at our oldest ancestors , the creatures who pioneered life on the early earth over 3.5 billion years ago , bacteria .
A bacterial species that comes readily to mind is Eschericia coli .
Eschericia coli is one of your most faithful companions .
It lives in your gut and mine .
It ’s also a bacterial species microbiologists can’t keep their hands off of .
It thrives in petri dishes and shows off its stuff in ways that are easy for a curious researcher with a good microscope to see .
And , like baboons , E. coli are much , much smarter than most of us think .
E coli are sugar junkies .
Their favorite food is glucose .
But when times get tough and the foods they like the most are nowhere to be found , they ’ve got genetic tools they use to reengineer their string of genes , their genome , and their metabolism so they can eat far less tasty stuff , milk sugar — lactose .
However there ’s a substance E. coli have seldom come across in their long history on this planet .
It ’s a chemical from the bark of poplars and willow trees .
Its name is salicin .
We use salicin as a pain killer .
It ’s the key ingredient in aspirin — a drug we did n’t begin to crank out in mass quantities until 1897 .
So in the 1980s and 1990s , several researchers decided to throw E. coli a curve .
They gave colonies of these creatures nothing but salicin to eat .
Now this is a bit like asking you and me to invent a new way to grow our gut and to retool the metabolic machinery of our cells so we can digest aluminum foil , gobbling it up like carrot cake , using it as our favorite food .
Solving the salicin problem , the problem of turning salicin into an appetizer or an entrée , is a tough one .
It involves a mutation , a big change , in your genome , a change that carries you forward a giant step but gets you essentially nowhere .
Then it takes another big step with no payoff — rejiggering your genome in a way takes you backward — that makes you even LESS capable of eating and surviving than you were before .
Only then can you take the big step forward in the reengineering of your gene - string that lets you eat salicin with ease .
The odds against pulling off this big step forward , this big step back , and the final step forward again are huge .
The odds against the trick are especially staggering if you think a bacterial colony is mindless and that it makes all of its changes using the genie - in - the - bottle of today ’s mainstream evolutionary theory , Neo Darwinism .
The Neo Darwinian magic mechanism for change and upgrade is random chance , random mutation .
The odds of reengineering yourself to make salicin by random mutation alone — without a group brain -- are ten billion trillion to one .
Why ?
Because according to Neo Darwinian evolutionary theory , a big step backward like the one in the salicin two - step will kill your species off .
Any bacteria who try it will be goners .
They wo n’t live to reproduce and pass their new mutation on .
So no way should a chain of mutations happen in which one step cripples something as basic as your ability to eat .
Yet E. coli can reliably pull off the trick of reengineering their genes so they can eat salicin .
How in the name of heaven or hell do they do it ?
The answer comes from one of my partners in crime , Eshel Ben Jacob , head of the Israeli Society of Physicists , former head of the Physics department at the University of Tel Aviv , and a man whose close to 20 years of breakthrough research in microbiology have landed in the queen of the science journals , Nature , and on the cover of The Scientific American .
Ben -Jacob is also kind enough to tolerate me .
A colony of bacteria the size of the palm of your hand is populated by more citizens than all the human beings who have ever lived .
The number of bacteria in that colony can vary from one to seven trillion .
Each one of these trillions of bacteria has its own equivalent of a brain .
It has what Ben Jacob calls a computational engine .
That computational engine is its genome .
We 'll dive further into the computational engines of bacteria in our next exciting episode !
Go on to Part II .
Unlike most U.S. journalists who went to Iraq to cover a war , Dahr Jamail went to try to stop it .
In his new book , Beyond the Green Zone : Dispatches from an Unembedded Journalist in Occupied Iraq , Jamail writes of volunteering as a rescue ranger at Denali National Park in Alaska while news of the invasion and occupation of Iraq played on the radio .
He had to get out of Anchorage , and in November 2003 , Jamail got on a plane to Amman , Jordan , and then , a few days later , shared a taxi across Iraq ’s western desert to Baghdad .
" My going to Iraq was an act of desperation , " he wrote .
" I was tormented by the fact that the government of my country illegally invaded and then occupied a country that it had bombed in 1991 . "
Once in Iraq , Jamail set about reporting the stories of regular Iraqi people .
He spent months in Iraq ’s hospitals , morgues , and mosques .
His journalism covers some of the most mundane , but important , aspects of the U.S. occupation  like gas lines , checkpoints , and bombed out telephone switching stations .
His stories appeared in numerous outlets around the world , including IPS .
Most significantly , Dahr Jamail is perhaps the only U.S. journalist to document firsthand the human costs of both U.S. sieges of Fallujah , in April and November 2004 .
In covering those sieges , Jamail reported numerous violations of the Geneva Conventions , from the use of cluster bombs and white phosphorus ( which is similar to napalm ) on densely populated civilian areas , to the blocking of relief supplies from reaching the city , to U.S. military raids into hospitals and shots fired at ambulances .
So many Iraqi people were killed in the assault on Fallujah , he notes , that the municipal football stadium had to be turned into a graveyard for the dead .
Visiting the site , he wrote : " I tried hard to imagine a soccer field back in the United States being turned into a graveyard  headstones above ground and buried , shrapnel - shredded bodies underneath , populating a dry field where children once laughed , ran , and kicked soccer balls  but my imagination failed me . "
For Jamail , the sieges represent unpunished war crimes and his book is , in part , an effort to push the perpetrators a little bit closer to justice .
The sieges also represent the climax of his book , which essentially ends when he leaves Iraq for the final time in February 2005 .
" You do n’t need current events to know what is going on , " he told IPS .
" You need to know what set the conditions for all this . "
Since February 2005 , there have been numerous developments in Iraq , including an election , a new prime minister , and perhaps most importantly , a much trumpeted " troop surge " which the George W. Bush administration maintains is leading to " progress " in Iraq , especially in western Anbar Province , home to Fallujah .
Jamail sees these current developments through the prism of the U.S. military ’s previous efforts there .
" What I see in Anbar province is a macro version of what they did in Fallujah after the failed April siege , " he said .
" They got their asses kicked .
They could n’t take the city so they fund , arm , and back the militias in the city and leave .
So troop deaths go down , they get to pretend that they ’ve turned over control to the Iraqis and things are getting better .
The reality is now in Anbar they ’ve gone back to funding and backing Sunni militias on a huge scale , and it ’s a ticking time bomb . "
Beyond the Green Zone is the latest entry in a crowded field of books by U.S. journalists attempting to present the Iraqi side of the war .
While the stories that Jamail tells still rarely make the nightly news or the front pages of U.S. newspapers , they have been related in a series of books , the most well - known being Night Draws Near by Pulitzer Prize - winning Washington Post reporter Anthony Shadid .
A number of independent journalists , including this reporter , have also published books on the topic and several scathing documentary films have been released .
This combination of silence from the mainstream media and excellent reportage by the independent press has created a paradox .
On one hand , most of the events that Jamail chronicles in Beyond the Green Zone have already been well - documented .
On the other hand , most U.S. citizens remain oblivious to them .
" The media is not even beginning to show what ’s really going on in Iraq , " Jamail told IPS , " and so most people here have no idea what ’s happening . "
" People get that the war is not going well , " he said , " but that does n’t show any of the gravity of the fact that today half the country of Iraq is either a refugee , in desperate need of emergency care , wounded , or dead .
What would the reporting look like if that was the situation here ?
It would be off the charts : ‘ Just look at this catastrophe !
People are suffering .
Look what happened to this family ’s children ! ’
But instead we have this type of reporting that just kind of touches on the fact that things are not going so well , but it does n’t really show how bad it really is . "
Reading as a journalist who has spent significant time reporting from Iraq under U.S. occupation , two aspects of Beyond the Green Zone particularly hit home .
The first are the book ’s photos , one of which appears before each chapter : from a cover image showing a young Iraqi boy standing nervously near a U.S. tank , to photos of dead bodies in a morgue , to anti-U.S. fighters holding a rocket launcher , Jamail ’s photographs ring truer than any other images this reporter has seen of the Iraq war .
Jamail jokes that his photos are " amateurish " because they lack the compositional complexity of more experienced war photographers .
But the fact is that the truth of the Iraq war is not all that complex .
The main truth of the war is death .
Jamail ’s pictures provide that truth simply , showing how the occupation appears through the eyes of a normal person .
Jamail ’s section on his return home is also particularly insightful .
After witnessing the second siege of Fallujah , Jamail returned to the United States in the winter of 2004 .
" The differences thrust in my face on returning home to America were glaring , " he wrote .
" There were no checkpoints in the United States .
People did n’t have to stop their cars , have guns aimed at them and their children , get out to be searched , and have their vehicles searched .
No military vehicles roamed the streets , carrying soldiers who aimed their weapons at powerless civilians who watched them pass .
There was mail service and the phones worked on the first try .
You could order take - out and have it delivered to your door .
There were employees of the city who cleaned the streets , watered the trees and grass , and kept the parks clean . "
This disconnect between the destruction in Iraq and peace on the home front is universal .
You can hear it from nearly every journalist and soldier who has been to the war zone .
Jamail goes a step further and links U.S. apathy about the war to its continuation .
" The front lines of American imperialism were frightening , " he wrote .
" In Iraq , there was no hiding the raw , ugly face of corporations profiting from the blood and suffering caused by the brutal occupation of Iraq .
Yet , back in the United States  the country that launched the invasion and now supported the occupation  people were going about their daily lives , to my amazement .
If news got too intense , people were able to simply turn it off and take a walk , or go to a movie , or call a friend . "
Beyond the Green Zone is an effort to break through that apathy .
" As journalists , it ’s our moral obligation to talk about what ’s actually going on , " he told IPS , " and if people see that and decide to turn off the TV that ’s their call , but I ’ve got to do my job .
I want to tell people ‘ Sorry , your government just invaded another country and totally eviscerated it .
Deal with it . ’ "

As it continues the fight against terrorist worldwide , the United States is watching cautiously as a vital ally teeters on the edge of anarchy .
" In the war on terror there is no country more strategically critical than Pakistan , " ABC's Terry Moran said on Nightline Monday , " and tonight Pakistan is on the edge of a political abyss . "
The nuclear state , which is battling encroaching al Qaeda fighters at its borders , has descended into chaos after President Pervez Musharraf declared a state of emergency and suspended Pakistan 's constitution .
Taliban fighters and al Qaeda terrorists who had sought refuge in the mountainous border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan are moving into more populated regions of Pakistan and they appear emboldened by the chaos erupting from Musharraf 's crackdown .
" Pakistani analysts are increasingly questioning General Musharrafs contention that emergency rule was needed to help him fight terrorism , " reports David Rohde in a New York Times analysis Tuesday .
Across the country , policemen and intelligence agents have been diverted from hunting terrorists to arresting lawyers , who apparently are being assessed as the greater threat to the generals rule . "
The threat becomes even more dire when one considers what would happen to Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal if the country becomes further destabilized .
Estimates of Pakistan 's weapons cache range from 24 to 48 nuclear warheads and some say there could be as many as 100 nukes in the country .
ABC
News correspondent Jim Sciutto reports that officials believe there is a " very real " possibility that those weapons could fall into the wrong hands .
" The nightmare scenario for US officials , " Sciutto says , " that a government collapse could put Pakistan 's nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists . "

Mr Rudd will focus on education , environment and the economy
He appointed Julia Gillard as deputy PM and education minister , and a former rock star , Midnight Oil singer Peter Garrett , as environment minister .

Wong becomes the country 's first Asian - born minister , with responsibility for climate change .
Meanwhile , the Liberal Party has elected a new leader to replace John Howard , defeated in last week 's vote .
Brendan Nelson , the outgoing defence minister , beat the outgoing environment minister Malcolm Turnbull for the job .
Rock on
Kevin Rudd has not yet been sworn in as Australia 's next prime minister , but he is impatient to tackle what he describes as the challenges of the future .
LABOR'S CABINET Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education and Workplace Relations : Julia Gillard Treasurer : Wayne Swan Foreign Minister : Stephen Smith Environment , Heritage and Arts Minister : Peter Garrett Climate Change and Water Minister : Penny Wong Minister of Defence : Joel Fitzgibbon Attorney - General : Robert McClelland
In naming his ministers , it is clear that the " three Es " are his main priority - the economy , education and the environment , says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney .
By far the most eye - catching appointment is that of Peter Garrett as environment minister , our correspondent says .
Mr Garrett , who has been an MP since 2004 , is best known as the former front man of rock group Midnight Oil , who had an international hit with the song Beds Are Burning .
Penny Wong , a Malaysian immigrant , has been named Australia 's first minister specifically dedicated to climate change and water conservation .
Opposition changes
At the same time as Mr Rudd announced his new ministry , the Liberal Party has elected a new leader to replace John Howard .
Mr Garrett was first elected to parliament in 2004
With the party 's former deputy leader Peter Costello signalling his desire to pursue a career in the commercial sector , the Liberals opted for Brendan Nelson , the outgoing defence minister .
He beat the expected favourite , outgoing environment minister Malcolm Turnbull , by a narrow vote of 45 to 42 .
Mr Nelson likes electric guitars , fast motorbikes and used to wear an earring .
But his political persona is nowhere near as racy .
He is a medical doctor , and the beleaguered Liberal Party will need all of his recuperative powers , our correspondent says .
June 7 , 2007  -- President Bush 's nominee for surgeon general , Dr. James W. Holsinger Jr. , wrote a paper in 1991 that purported to make the medical argument that homosexuality is unnatural and unhealthy .
Doctors who reviewed the paper derided it as prioritizing political ideology over science , and Democratic aides on Capitol Hill say the paper will make his confirmation hearings problematic , if not downright bruising .
Holsinger , 68 , presented " The Pathophysiology of Male Homosexuality " in January 1991 to a United Methodist Church 's committee to study homosexuality .
( Read the paper here . )
The church was then considering changing its view that homosexuality violates Christian teaching , though it ultimately did not do so .
Relying on footnotes from mainstream medical publications , Holsinger argued that homosexuality is n't natural or healthy .
" A confirmation fight is exactly what the administration does not need , " said David Gergen , a former adviser to Presidents Nixon , Ford , Reagan and Clinton , who predicted the paper would cause a " minor storm " among Democrats on Capitol Hill .
" You have to wonder given the quality of some of the nominations that have gone forward recently , whether the selection group in the White House has gone on vacation , " Gergen said .
" There has been a growing criticism the administration favoring ideology over competence , and this nomination smacks of that . "
White House Avoids Direct Response to Paper
" Dr. Holsinger has dedicated his life to the care of others and public service and his respect for all is evidenced by his actions and his career , " said White House spokesman Emily Lawrimore .
" On numerous occasions , he has taken up the banner for under represented populations and he will continue to be a strong advocate for these groups and all Americans .
Dr. Holsinger is a highly respected , well - qualified physician and educator .
His impressive medical background , which includes leading one of the Nation 's largest healthcare systems , decades of service in the armed forces , along with his commitment to combating childhood obesity , will serve him well as Surgeon General .
We urge the Senate for a swift confirmation . "
HHS : Paper Not Reflective of Holsinger 's Thinking
But Holly Babin , a spokeswoman for the Department of Heath and Human Services -- the agency that will take the lead on trying to achieve Holsinger 's confirmation -- insisted that the paper was by no means reflective of Holsinger 's thinking .
" That paper was a survey of scientific peer - reviewed studies that he was asked to compile by the United Methodist Church , it 's not that he was saying ' this is what I believe , ' " Babin said .
" It 's a reflection of the available scientific data from the 1980s .
It should be noted that in 1991 , homosexuals were banned from the military and several years before that , homosexuality and Haitian nationality were considered risk factors for HIV / AIDS .
Over the last 20 years , a clearer understanding of these issues has been achieved .
Asked about medical experts who disputed that Holsinger 's paper expressed opinions timely in 1991 and pressed to explain what Holsinger 's views on homosexuality are currently , Babin said , " we look forward to the confirmation process , where we can share Dr. Holsinger 's qualifications and views . "
Advocacy Groups Protest Nomination
Those answers will likely not quell the controversy .
Critics say the paper certainly seems to be written from Holsinger 's point of view .
Noting that Holsinger also belongs to a church that offers a ministry to " cure " gays of the sexual orientation , gay and lesbian rights advocates immediately protested Holsinger 's nomination .
" His writings suggest a scientific view rooted in anti-gay beliefs that are incompatible with the job of serving the medical health of all Americans , " said the Human Rights Campaign in a statement .
" It is essential that America 's top doctor value sound science over anti-gay ideology . "
Democrats will likely be sympathetic to such arguments .
Holsinger 's confirmation hearing , which has yet to be scheduled , will be heard by the Senate Health Committee , chaired by longtime gay rights advocate Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Mass .
Members of the committee include three Democratic presidential contenders -- Sens. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , and Barack Obama , D - Illinois -- eager to prove their bona fides during the primary season to the gay and lesbian community .
Holsinger , a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Kentucky College of Public Health , did not return calls for comment .
When announcing his nomination on May 24 , Bush said that as " America 's chief health educator , [ Dr. Holsinger ] will be charged with providing the best scientific information available on how Americans can make smart choices that improve their health and reduce their risk of illness and injury . "
What Holsinger 's Paper Argues
Holsinger wrote that " [ a ] natomically the vagina is designed to receive the penis " while the anus and rectum -- which " contain no natural lubricating function " -- are not .
" The rectum is incapable of mechanical protection against abrasion and severe damage ... can result if objects that are large , sharp or pointed are inserted into the rectum , " Holsinger wrote .
The cardiologist details many different diseases gay men can catch , and several sexual practices they may engage in , including " anal eroticism , " which can lead to injuries and even death .
" From the perspective of pathology and pathophysiology , the varied sexual practices of homosexual men have resulted in a diverse and expanded concept of sexually transmitted disease and associated trauma ? "
In the context of the larger argument in his church as to whether homosexuality should be accepted , Holsinger presented a medical and scientific argument that anal intercourse was not natural .
" It is absolutely clear that anatomically and physiologically the alimentary and reproductive systems in humans are separate organ systems , i.e. , the human does not have a cloaca , " he said , referring to the posterior orifice that serves as the one opening for genital , urinary and intestinal tracts in amphibians , birds and reptiles .
The surgeon general nominee wrote that " even primitive cultures understand the nature of waste elimination , sexual intercourse and the birth of children .
Indeed our own children appear to ' intuitively ' understand these facts . "
A Political Agenda ?
Professor Eli Coleman , Director of the Program in Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota Medical School said that the paper seems to have a pre-1970s view of human sexuality .
" I an't imagine that any scientific journal would be able to publish this material because of its very narrow views of homosexuality , " he said .
In fact , if one of his students handed the paper in , Coleman would give it a failing grade , he said .
" I find it rather outdated in terms of its scientific knowledge and also narrow in its view of homosexuality , " Coleman said .
" It concerns me because I think our public policy really should be based upon best available science . "
" It 's a totally faulty paper .
The man does n't know anything about human sexuality , " said June M. Reinisch , Ph.D. , director emeritus of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender & Reproduction .
" There 's clearly a political agenda in this paper .
This is not a scientific paper . "
Paragraph by paragraph , Reinisch said Holsinger presents faulty arguments .
Many homosexuals do not engage in the sexual act he criticizes ; 40 percent of heterosexuals do .
" It seems to me he 's arguing the only way reproduction happens is in a loving heterosexual environment which is of course not true , " Reinisch said , noting artificial methods , rape and one - night stands .
Reinisch , who was director of the Kinsey Institute when Holsinger wrote this paper , said that if Holsinger " is going to come up with this position in 2007 I think I can clearly say that he is not qualified to be surgeon general . "
Holsinger holds a doctorate in anatomy and physiology and an M.D. from Duke University .
He spent much of his career working for the Veteran 's Health Administration .
From 2003 to 2005 he was Kentucky 's secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services .
mysqldiff -- a utility for comparing MySQL database structures
Update 2011/11/6 : Finally a new release !
( 0.43 ) - available here or from CPAN .
mysqldiff is a Perl script front - end to the CPAN module MySQL :: Diff which compares the data structures ( i.e. schema / table definitions ) of two MySQL databases , and returns the differences as a sequence of MySQL commands suitable for piping into mysql which will transform the structure of the first database to be identical to that of the second ( c.f. diff and patch ) .
Database structures can be compared whether they are files containing table definitions or existing databases , local or remote .
N.B . The program makes no attempt to compare any of the data which may be stored in the databases .
It is purely for comparing the table definitions .
I have no plans to implement data comparison ; it is a complex problem and I have no need of such functionality anyway .
However there is another program coldiff which does this , and is based on an older program called datadiff which seems to have vanished off the 'net .
For PostgreSQL there are similar tools such as pgdiff and apgdiff .
Here is the latest version of mysqldiff ( what 's new ? ) ; however it is strongly recommended that you install from CPAN via normal CPAN installation mechanisms .
There is also a git repository .
Please see the mysqldiff manual page .
Please see the INTERNALS section in the mysqldiff manual page .

British polling agency : More than one million Iraqi deaths since US invasion
By Patrick Martin
15 September 2007
As part of its campaign to justify a long - term US occupation of Iraq , the Bush administration has increasingly resorted to warning of chaos and even genocide in the wake of a withdrawal of American troops .
But a new report suggests that something akin to genocide is already taking place , under American auspices .
The British polling agency ORB reported Thursday that the death toll in Iraq since the 2003 US invasion has passed the one million mark .
According toORB , US - occupied Iraq , with an estimated 1.2 million violent deaths , has “ a murder rate that now exceeds the Rwanda genocide from 1994 ( 800,000 murdered ) , ” with another one million wounded and millions more driven from their homes into internal or external exile .
ORB ( Opinion Research Business ) , which has conducted polls in Iraq since 2005 , released the findings of a survey of 1,461 adults across the country .
Among other questions , it asked : “ How many members of your household , if any , have died as a result of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 ( i.e. , as a result of violence rather than a natural death such as old age ) ?
Please note that I mean those who were actually living under your roof . ”
Of those responding , 78 percent said their households had experienced no violent deaths , 16 percent had experienced one death , 5 percent two deaths , 1 percent three deaths or more .
Given the number of households in the country , 4,050,597 according to 2005 census figures , this works out to nearly 1.2 million deaths .
By far the worst death rate was in Baghdad , where nearly half of all those interviewed reported at least one violent death in their household .
The reported death rate in Diyala province ( Baquba ) was 42 percent , and in Ninewa province ( Mosul ) , 35 percent .
The survey found that 48 percent of the violent deaths were due to gunshot wounds , 20 percent to car bombs , 9 percent to aerial bombardment , 6 percent to other ordnance or explosions , and 6 percent to accidents .
The figure for aerial bombardments is particularly noteworthy since such deaths — numbering well over 100,000 according to the ORB study — go virtually unreported in the American media .
This is doubtless because such killings are entirely the work of the US and British occupation forces , the only ones equipped with helicopters and warplanes .
The ORB survey found a far higher death rate than the figures released by Western media outlets , the US - established Iraqi government in Baghdad , or the United Nations .
But it dovetails with the public health survey conducted last year by a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University and published in the British medical journal Lancet , which estimated the death toll ( as of early 2006 , nearly 18 months ago ) , at about 665,000 .
The Lancet figures were denounced by the US and Iraqi governments and dismissed by the American media , and the ORB figures are likely to face the same fate .
The study ’s findings were reported only in passing in Friday ’s daily newspapers , most prominently by the Los Angeles Times and Boston Globe , not at all by the New York Times or Washington Post .
None of the network evening news broadcasts on Friday even mentioned the ORB report .
Opinion Research Business is not a left - wing or antiwar group , but an established polling organization , founded in 1994 by Gordon Heald , who headed Gallup Britain from 1980 to 1994 .
Its customers include the huge mining concern Anglo American , the Bank of Scotland , and the Conservative Party .
Its non-executive director is Geoffrey Martin OBE , currently special adviser to the secretary general on strategic relationships of the British Commonwealth .
The ORB survey was based on face - to - face interviews conducted between August 12 and August 19 among a nationally representative sample of 1,720 adults ( of whom 1,461 responded ) , with a standard margin of error of 2.4 percent .
Random sampling was used to select those interviewed in 15 of Iraq ’s 18 provinces .
For security reasons , no interviews were conducted in Al Anbar or Karbala provinces , or in the province of Irbil , where Kurdish authorities refused to allow field interviews .
Since Anbar and Karbala are among the bloodiest battlefields of the war , and Irbil among the quietest , the exclusion of the three provinces would more likely to lead to an underestimation of the death toll than an exaggeration .
The ORB study was made public on the same day that President Bush went on national television to deliver a report on conditions in Iraq that was nothing short of delusional .
With a million Iraqis dead , a million wounded , and four to five million displaced , Bush hailed the return of “ normal life ” to the devastated country .
“ Sectarian killings are down , and ordinary life is beginning to return , ” he said .
The next day Bush and Vice President Cheney appeared before hand - picked audiences to press their campaign for an unlimited US occupation of Iraq .
Bush spoke at the Marine base at Quantico , Virginia and Cheney at the Gerald Ford Museum in Michigan and the headquarters of the Central Command in Florida .
Cheney claimed that the result of a rapid US troop withdrawal would be “ chaos ” and “ carnage , ” declaring , “ In all the calls we ’ve heard for an American withdrawal from Iraq , these negative consequences have n’t really been denied , they ’ve simply been ignored . ”
Cheney raised the specter of Iranian intervention in a post - US Iraq , which “ would unloose an all - out war , with the violence unlikely to be contained within Iraq .
The ensuing carnage would further destabilize the Middle East and magnify the threat to our friends throughout the region . ”
Bush , speaking before an audience of 250 Marines and their families in Quantico , claimed , “ We got security in the right direction and we are bringing our troops home . ”
Also Friday , the State Department quietly released a report noting that religious freedom has sharply deteriorated in Iraq over the past year because of the upsurge in sectarian killings , with minority religions ( Sunnis in Shiite areas , Shiites in Sunni areas , secular Iraqis , Christians and smaller groups in all areas ) subjected to systematic persecution .
The report cited “ frequent sectarian violence including attacks on places of worship , ” as well as “ harassment , intimidation , kidnapping , and killings , ” adding that “ non-Muslims ( are ) especially vulnerable to pressure and violence , because of their minority status and , often , because of the lack of a protective tribal structure . ”
The Democratic Party is fully complicit in the creation of conditions of near - genocide in Iraq , since the congressional Democratic leadership has refused to cut off funding for a war which has cost the lives of more than one million Iraqis , as well as over 3,700 American soldiers .
In response to Bush ’s Thursday night speech , there were renewed professions of impotence by leading Senate Democrats .
Barack Obama , who began his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination touting his antiwar credentials , said the Democratic - controlled Congress could not force Bush to accept a deadline for ending the war .
“ One way of ending the war would be setting a timetable , ” he said in a speech in Iowa .
“ We ’re about 15 votes short .
Right now it does n’t look like we ’re going to get that many votes . ”
Obama was referring to the 67 votes required in the Senate to override a presidential veto .
He was silent on the fact that there are other constitutional methods of ending the war , such as refusing to appropriate the funds to finance it , which the Democratic congressional leadership has rejected .
Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota , chair of the Senate Budget Committee , told Congressional Quarterly , “ The truth is we do n’t have the votes to end the war . ”
He said Senate Democrats would seek to “ move the things that we can move on domestic issues ” in order to “ have tangible accomplishments , ” rather than persist in debates on Iraq .
Other senators endorsed this view , including Charles Schumer of New York , who said , referring to the upcoming 2008 campaign , “ This election is shaping up to be about change .
Not only change in Iraq , but change at home . ”
Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado said , “ The Democratic message has to focus on things that are good for the middle class .
The war should not be the only issue . ”
In the House of Representatives , Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not scheduled any vote on Iraq war policy this month , although the defense authorization bill still remains to be adopted for the fiscal year beginning October 1 .
All indications are that the congressional Democrats will rubber - stamp both the authorization and the emergency funding bill for the war , expected to approach $ 200 billion , which has not yet been sent to Congress by the Bush administration .
The silence from the Democratic and Republican parties and the media on the latest evidence of mass killing and social devastation in Iraq as a result of the US colonial war and occupation underscores the complicity of the entire American ruling elite and all of its official institutions in a war crime of catastrophic proportions .
While Sony is faring well in Japan , sales are lagging in the US
As a result the PS3 will now cost $ 500 ( £ 249 ) , between $ 100 and $ 200 more than versions of the Microsoft Xbox 360 and twice as much as the Nintendo Wii .
The Xbox 360 and Wii have been significantly outselling the Japanese firm 's PS3 in the US market .
The news came as Microsoft said it would not be cutting the Japanese price of its Xbox to lift lacklustre sales .
Microsoft made the announcement a week after it said it was spending $ 1bn to repair problems with the Xbox 360 .
Japan problems
The Xbox price tag of about 38,000 yen ( $ 300 ) is " very competitive " and below that of the console 's US price , Microsoft Japan 's vice president said .
Xbox sales in Japan have been lagging behind those of rivals - Sony 's Playstation 3 and Nintendo's Wii .
According to games magazine publisher Enterbrain , Microsoft has sold 122,565 Xbox consoles in Japan during the first six months of the year .
That compares with 1.78 million Nintendo Wii sales and 503,554 Sony PS3 sales .
However , it is a different story in the US market with Nintendo and Microsoft outselling their rival several times over
" Our initial expectation is that sales should double at a minimum , " said Sony Entertainment America chief executive Jack Tretton .
" We 've gotten our production issues behind us on the PlayStation 3 , reaching a position to pass on the savings to consumers , and our attitude is the sooner the better . "
The move also comes just ahead of the launch of the latest version of the PS3 .
The new console will boast an improved 80 - gigabyte hard drive and is expected to sell for around $ 600 .
Sony Computer Entertainment Europe is expected to make an announcement at the E3 event - one of the biggest conferences in the game industry calendar - about the new console on Thursday .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Foreclosures have devastated whole neighborhoods in Cleveland and other cities , but the real impact on the finances of cities is still to come .
Treasurer 's offices all over the country are bracing for the day when lenders stop paying the taxes on many properties in the worst hit neighborhoods .
Many houses in Cleveland 's central city neighborhoods have been so damaged by looting , fires and weather that they are almost total losses .
The lenders will eventually walk away from them .
" The lenders will come to us and say , ' We just can't hold the properties any longer .
We do n't want to pay the demolition costs .
Here 's the property , ' " said Jim Rokakis , Treasurer of Cuyahoga County , which includes Cleveland , one of the cities hardest hit by foreclosures
The trend will not be confined to Midwestern cities like Cleveland , where the local economies have been clobbered by manufacturing job losses .
Many Sun-Belt cities now rank high on the list of foreclosures , especially in California .
In a report released this week , the United States Conference of Mayorsforecast a reduction in property tax collections in California of nearly $ 3 billion for 2008 .
" Across the country , there has been a boom in property tax volume growth .
That 's going to stop , " said Jim Diffley , the Global Insight economist who put together the analysis for the Mayor 's Conference .
Cities that counted on the continued growth , will have to scramble to close revenue gaps as tax growth flattens out .
Even if lenders sell off still viable homes to new owners , those homes could still bring in lower tax revenues .
Many of these homes will turn over only at fire - sale prices and the new owners will want assessments redone .
Existing homeowners in areas with plunging values will ask for reassessments too .
At a town meeting in Cuyahoga County this week , the first question residents raised was , " How do I get my property revalued , " said Rokakis .
Rokakis reported that his county has already fielded 14,000 requests for reassessment in 2007 and he predicted between 20,000 and 25,000 more next year .
The housing bust will also affect state coffers .
During the past two years , the number of homes sold has dropped some 40 % .
That has sent state transfer fees and deed and mortgage registration taxes plunging .
That will have an indirect impact on city governments .
" Any time there 's fiscal stress at the state level , that channels down to local levels as well , " said Diffley .
What foreclosures and the housing bust do not reduce is the cost of services to heavily impacted communities .
And many new costs arise along with foreclosures .
For example , the suburban city of Shaker Heights , Ohio , will spend $ 500,000 this year just to maintain empty properties .
The cost to Cleveland Heights merely to keep lawns trimmed at abandoned homes has risen to $ 75,000 annually from a mere $ 6,000 three years ago .
Mary Smith waited hours for a glimpse of the bride
As Princess Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten on 20 November 1947 , Mary Parker , formerly Mary Smith , of Bexhill - On - Sea , joined the well - wishers lining the royal route .
The 17 - year - old typist 's account of her " perfect day " lay undiscovered in the family attic for decades until found by her son and sent to the BBC news website .
I left home at 0615 and after meeting my friend Jean at the station we caught the 0641 train to town .
Alighting at Charing Cross at 0730 we proceeded to move step - by - step towards Whitehall , along with several other thousands of people , continually being requested to buy flowers , posies , ribbons , streamers , periscopes , mirrors on sticks , hot chestnuts , toffee - apples , in fact anything that was likely to keep us amused while we were standing waiting .
At 0745 we arrived in Whitehall , outside the War Office , and took up our stand , about three rows back from the edge of the pavement .
From where we were standing we could see quite plainly the horse guards across the way .
People began to collect behind us and soon we were considered to be " some of the lucky ones in the front " by those that were standing behind us .
Those in the front row had nearly all been there throughout the night , and conversation revealed that most of the others had been there since 0400 and 0500 .
Princess Elizabeth looked really lovely , and radiantly happy as she stood smiling beside her husband
Mary Smith , 17
At 0800 , Whitehall was closed to all traffic , apart from those vehicles , which had something in connection with the wedding itself .
From then onwards it was a continual stream of cars , some carrying famous people , others people we did not know .
Mostly women
Among them were Mr Churchill , Mr Anthony Eden , the choirboys , and the beefeaters , all of whom received loud cheers from the crowds .
Many other famous people passed , waving as they went , but as most of them were foreign royalty we could not distinguish them .
At about 1000 the armed forces began to arrive , and rather subdued our spirit when we realised that they were to stand in front of us .
However , we were particularly lucky in being just between two soldiers , so we had quite a clear view .
It must have been our lucky day , as there seemed to be only short people in front of us .
It was interesting to notice that the majority of the spectators were women .
The crowd 's patience was rewarded by the bridal party on the balcony
At about 1030 , we were entertained with a selection of old - time dance music , played to us on gramophone records by Harry Davidson .
This was followed by some more music , this time played by the band of the Grenadier Guards , who were lined up opposite the barracks ready for the procession .
By this time the crowds were beginning to get a bit restless , and many people were fainting from fatigue as the crowds grew denser .
There were quite a number of stretcher cases and the St John 's Ambulance men were being kept very busy .
As Big Ben boomed out 1100 , the excitement grew and suddenly the guards were drawn to attention .
Loud cheers echoed from Trafalgar Square as the first of the procession began to pass .
First came the big saloon cars carrying various members of all the royal circle , intermingled with the bridesmaids , going in twos .
It must have been our lucky day , as there seemed to be only short people in front of us
Mary Smith
Then came Queen Mary , gracefully waving to either side , dressed in a coat of gold and turquoise , with a silver fox fur at her neck .
Now it was beginning to get really exciting .
Officers shouted words of command all down the line and as the guards drew to stiff attention the advance guards to the Queen 's coach came into view .
These were followed by the splendid Household Cavalry , stately and bold on their beautiful black chargers .
Everybody began to push as the royal coach came into view conveying the Queen and Princess Margaret - the chief bridesmaid .
' Trifle nervous '
I think the princess looked particularly pretty with her white tulle dress and orange blossom head - dress .
The Queen too looked lovely in an apricot coloured dress accompanied by pink plumes in her hat .
We had a marvellous view and could see every detail .
The coach was followed by Household Cavalry and a mounted police escort .
Mary in 1950 with her own future husband , Alan Wootton
As the hands moved slowly round the clock there were cries of " Here she comes " and " Hurrah " .
The band started playing the national anthem after the guards and the cavalry had passed , and after what seemed an eternity - actually only three and a half hours , the great moment arrived and along came the Irish coach carrying the bride , sitting on her father 's right hand , looking very beautiful , and very stately , but , I thought , just a trifle nervous as she raised her hand in salute to the cheering crowds who lined her " route to happiness " .
Now we had an hour to wait before we should again see our princess , this time a married woman .
Suddenly the voice of the Archbishop of Canterbury sounded over the loudspeakers .
There was a tense silence throughout the crowds as the bride and bridegroom shared their solemn vows .
I have never known so many people to be so quiet as they were during that hour .
A police officer 's horse caused some amusement when it began to neigh during the service .
There were immediately a few polite " voices from the deep " asking him to be quiet , and thus causing considerable embarrassment to its rider .
As soon as the Wedding March resounded and the abbey bells rang out , everybody put away their sandwiches and prepared themselves for a good view once more - the past hour seemed to have been " cue for lunch " .
' Gracie , Gracie '
First came the bride and bridegroom in the glass coach , followed by the bridesmaids .
Then came the King and Queen , other members of the Royal Family and the guests .
By this time the crowds began to stir and the crush began .
We decided to make our way towards Buckingham Palace .
Then we intercepted the crowds coming the opposite direction , from Trafalgar Square .
We could not move , and I felt as if every breath in my body was being squeezed out of me .
Wartime sweetheart Gracie Fields sang for the crowd from a rooftop
We finally found ourselves across the road , outside the Whitehall Theatre [ Trafalgar Studios ] , and suddenly there were shouts of " Gracie , Gracie " .
Yes , it was Gracie Fields herself , right up on [ a rooftop ] , about six stories up .
After a vigorous wave of the hand she commenced to sing Now Is The Hour , and for a second time the crowds were hushed , as they listened intently to every word , which reached us so clearly , from that great songstress .
What showmanship , to be able to sing a song , without a microphone , from the top of a six - storey building .
Everybody seemed to have sorted themselves out after this great spot of entertainment , and we made our way round towards Pall Mall , through Admiralty Arch .
Here we met another minor crush , but managed to push our way through .
At this moment there were loud cheers , and we knew that the Royal Family had appeared on the balcony .
When a lady fainted in front of us and the police sorted us out a bit I sat on a policeman 's shoulder and had a grandstand view .
Radiantly happy
People began to move when the Royal Family had gone in so we [ went ] round to the palace gates .
Here we were nearly against the railings , and thought we would get a good view , but when time passed by and nobody appeared on the balcony we began to think it was of no avail .
There must have been literally thousands behind us by now , and it was impossible to get out , even if one wanted to .
The newly - married princess 's dress gleamed with pearls and lace
At 1600 we were rewarded for our patience and the bride , bridegroom and bridesmaids appeared .
Just before this , we had caught sight of Princess Margaret and the Duke of Gloucester peeping through one of the windows .
Up till now we had been entertained with cries of " We want the bride " .
Princess Elizabeth looked really lovely , and radiantly happy as she stood smiling beside her husband .
We could see quite plainly the pattern of the dresses , and we could see the pearls gleaming on the wedding gown .
By this time we were beginning to feel a bit peckish and decided that we did not want to stay until the pair were ready to leave for their honeymoon , so we pushed our way through the crowds and proceeded through St James 's Park , as the Mall was absolutely packed with people , waiting to cheer the couple on their way .
Perfect day
At Admiralty Arch we came to a standstill and were forced to stay there until the procession came by .
Once again luck must have been with us , and we had a perfect view .
The princess was dressed in her favourite colour , love - in - the - mist blue , and they both looked very happy as they passed by in their open landau , waving to either side .
Now everything was really over and after having a cup of tea in a tiny cafe we managed to catch the 1712 train home .
It was surprising how quickly the crowds had dispersed , and travel was back to normal again .
This had been , what I thought , a really perfect day , and was well worth the hours of waiting .
I think special credit ought to be given to the police force and St John 's Ambulance brigade , who , although extremely busy all day long , were cheerful and bright , and caused amusement more than once .
Dodd 's filibuster threat scuttles immunity in Senate , for now ; Reid wo n't credit Dodd Nick Juliano and Mike Sheehan

Print This Email This Senate to return to controversial FISA update after new year After nearly 10 hours of discussion Monday , the Senate decided to delay a final vote on a controversial domestic spying bill until the new year , under the threat of a protracted filibuster from Sen.
Chris Dodd .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spent the afternoon Monday huddling with Senate leaders and fellow Democrats to try to work out a deal over an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
As the FISA update was written , it included a provision for legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated a warrantless wiretapping scheme that Dodd and other Democrats said was illegal .
" We have tried to work through this process , and it appears quite clear that on this bill we are not going to be able to do that , " Reid said around 7:30 p.m.
Monday , after senators had spent the day debating propositions of the FISA update .
Dodd , a 2008 Democratic presidential candidate , canceled campaign events in Iowa and spent the day urging his colleagues to block a proposal to shield phone and Internet companies that gave the National Security Agency private call and e-mail records from an unknown number of Americans under the program President Bush authorized after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
" Today we have scored a victory for American civil liberties and sent a message to President Bush that we will not tolerate his abuse of power and veil of secrecy , " Dodd said in a statement released after Reid pulled the bill .
" The President should not be above the rule of law , nor should the telecom companies who supported his quest to spy on American citizens .
I want to thank the thousands of Americans throughout the country that stood with me to get this done for our country . "
The 64 - year - old Connecticut senator indicated he would have been willing to keep the floor all night if needed to prevent the immunity provision from moving through the senate .
" I rarely come to the floor with this much anger , " Dodd said .
" I 've never seen contempt of the rule of law such as this . "
Despite Dodd 's triumphant assertion , " the decision had nothing to do with the efforts of Dodd and his allies , " a Reid spokesperson told the Washington Post Granting immunity to the telecoms -- as President Bush has demanded -- would invalidate some 40 lawsuits that have been filed against telephone and internet companies .
Plaintiffs in those suits say the telecommunications industry acted illegally and ignored the constitution in facilitating warrantless government wiretaps aimed at Americans .
Shortly after noon Monday , the Senate voted 76 - 10 to proceed to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed with regular debate on a proposed FISA update from the Intelligence Committee that includes telecom immunity .
A Judiciary measure without immunity is pending as a substitute amendment .
Dodd controlled much of the action on the floor after debate on the measure began this afternoon , but his filibuster still had not begun in earnest by 7 p.m. as Senate leaders continued to negotiate over how they would handle proposed amendments to the FISA update .
A half - hour later , Reid lamented that senators could not come to an agreement on how to proceed and would have to delay consideration of the FISA update until at least January 15 , when the Senate returns from a recess that is to begin at the end of this week .
The Senate still has a raft of spending and tax bills and other legislation it needs to clear from its plate before the week is over .
Dodd said he hoped the Senate would be able to reach a compromise that would excise the immunity proposal from the FISA update before the chamber re-convenes in January .
If immunity persists in the bill , Dodd said , he would resume his promised filibuster .
During the daylong debate in the Senate , Dodd was joined by other Democrats in panning the proposal to spare the telecoms from judicial review of their actions , even though the Bush administration has failed to give all of the Senators access to internal documents that provided legal justifications for the warrantless wiretapping program , which became known as the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
Reid said he wrote to Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell asking that he give all senators ' access to the documents , which previously were handed over only to the Judiciary and Intelligence committees .
Sen .
Ted Kenney ( D - MA ) urged against " amnesty " for the telecom companies because we cannot let the country off the hook simply because they think they 're acting as patriot .
Kennedy invoked a New York Times report that the National Security Agency wanted to become a " powerful , permanent presence " on US communication networks , and he said that 's what would happen if Congress continues to let phone companies off the hook .
" If the phone companies simply do the NSA 's bidding in violation of the law , " Kennedy said , " they create a world in which Americans can never feel confident that their e-mails and phone calls are n't being tapped by government . "
Kennedy also excoriated President Bush 's threat to veto any FISA update that lacks a retroactive immunity provision .
" So if we take the president at his word , he 's willing to let Americans die to protect the phone companies , " Kennedy said , his voice rising in anger .
" The president 's insistence on immunity as a precondition for any FISA reform is yet another example of disrespect for honest dialogue and the rule of law . "
In the course of Monday 's debate , some senators who had previously supported the grant of immunity seemed to be wavering .
Sen. Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) , who serves on both the Intelligence and Judiciary committees that reported the FISA update , introduced an amendment Monday she said would " narrow " the grant of immunity to telecom companies .
Feinstein 's amendment would require a FISA court judge review authorization letters the administration sent to telecoms every 45 days to keep the president 's warrantless wiretapping program running .
She also indicated that her support for the Intelligence Committee 's immunity proposal was wavering .
" I 'm not inclined to vote for immunity , unless this amendment is adopted , " Feinstein said .
Dodd 's stand in the Senate came less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses , and he was the only presidential candidate in the chamber to leave the campaign trail for the FISA debate .
All three -- Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton , and Joe Biden -- had said they would support Dodd 's filibuster .
" Believe me when I say if I did not speak today , my conscience would not rest , " Dodd told his colleagues .
He praised the Senate as a chamber in which even a " minority of one " can mount a protest against unacceptable legislation , to counteract the president 's bully pulpit , as he sought to turn his minority into a " majority " of senators against telecom immunity .
Accusing telecommunications companies of " betraying millions of customers trust " by handing over phone records to the government for construction of a massive database , Dodd said blocking lawsuits against the companies would eliminate the last bastion of oversight of the president 's warrantless wiretapping program .
" Was it legal ? "
Dodd asked .
" That I do n't know , but if we pass this bill we will never know . "

What are Firefox Extensions ? ( for Dummies )
Firefox as we all know is one of the most prominently used web browsers these days .
being completely open source , it allows users and third party corporations to create really sweet modifications or add - ons also termed extensions .
These extensions are really small in size ( 10 - 200 kb ) and can usually substitute a fully featured application itself .
These are distributed through .xpi files towards which firefox is sensible enough to recognise and autorun the extension installation .
Its as easy as a click to install extensions and here are some of my favorites with the links to install them .

Throughout hours of debate , several Republican opponents of the legislation said its supporters were trying to ram it through while much of the California delegation was back home because of the wildfires in their state .
Ten of the 26 members who did not vote today are from California , and 8 of the 10 are Republicans .
A week ago , President Bush ’s veto of the original bill was sustained , as the 273 - to - 156 vote in support of the bill was 13 short of the toll needed to overturn the veto .
Forty - four Republicans voted then to override the veto , and the suspense before today ’s vote was whether the bill ’s supporters would convert any Republicans .
But only 43 Republicans voted for the bill today .
“ It ’s unfortunate that even after a week of meetings and adjustments to the bill at the Republicans ’ request , they would still apparently prefer to play politics instead of reauthorizing a program the vast majority of the country supports , ” Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois , chairman of the House Democratic Caucus , said after today ’s vote .
“ Once again , Republicans have chosen partisanship over pediatrics . ”
The Senate will probably approve the revised bill next week .
There is a veto - proof majority in favor of the bill in the Senate , but today ’s vote in the House , as well as last week ’s , signal that it will sustain Mr. Bush ’s veto again .
If that happens , Democrats said , they may extend the existing insurance program for children through next summer .
They would then schedule another vote on the issue in September or October , in the hope of inflicting maximum political damage on Republicans just before the 2008 elections .
Larry Dossey , M.D.
It does n't matter , according to Larry Dossey , M.D. in Healing Words , whether you remember to do it at the appropriate time or do it early or later .
He says the action of mentally projected thought or prayer is " non-local , " i.e. not dependent on distance or time , citing some 30 + experiments on human and non-human targets ( including yeast and even atoms ) , in which recorded results showed changes from average or random to beyond - average or patterned even when the designated thought group acted after the experiment was over .
Study 1 : Achterberg ( Saybrook ) ; Distant Intentionality
Warning Sign I1 : the experiment is not reproducible from the report .
You can't tell what is being measured or how those measurements are compared .
The experiment has not been reproduced , by Achterberg or by others .
( Here 's one way to look at lack of reproducibility : if nobody has reproduced a study , then every rational person who knows about the study and has the possibility of reproducing it has made the bet that the expected value of reproducing it is less than whatever else they are doing instead .
Now if you could convincingly demonstrate what Achterberg claims , you should have an excellent chance of a Nobel Prize , which is about $ 1 million , plus the fame .
I estimate the cost of an fMRI experiment like this is $ 5,000 .
So a rational person with the means who chooses not to reproduce the experiment is saying that the chance of it working is less than about 1 % ( depending on details of their utility function ) .
Sloppyness / typos : the results sections says " One of the two clusters was highly statistically significant ( p=0.000127 ) " .
But if you look at Table 1 , you see that the other cluster is also statistically significant ( p=8.51E -09 , or 0.00000000851 ) .
Why was n't that mentioned ?
In personal communication , Dr. Achterberg said that it was a typo , that it should have been 8.51 .
She also says that the p value for cluster 1 in Table 1 is a typo ; it says 0.00127 but it should be 0.000127 , as it appears in the RESULTS section and abstract .
But if they are typos in Table 1 , then there are paired typos , because the next column gives the logarithms of these numbers , which are consistent with 8.51E - 09 and 0.00127 , not with the numbers that Dr. Achterberg mentions .
Warning Sign D1 : lack of randomized controls .
The best control would be to put a similar number of patients in the fMRI with no sender involved .
But that is expensive , so the next best thing is what the authors have chosen : a block design where there are blocks of time with one kind of stimulant interspersed with the other kind , in this case send and no-send .
The problem is that the pattern of send / no - send intervals was the same for all subjects .
The lack of randomization on a subject - by - subject basis is a fundamental error that can be fatal to the validity of the experiment .
For example , suppose that patients were nervous , or somehow otherwise in a different brain state in the first two minutes of the procedure .
( Or bored in the last two minutes . )
All of this difference would be recorded for the " no- send " state , potentially resulting in a significant difference , even though the difference was actually due to the timing , not the sending .
This confound could have been avoided if only the experimenters had randomized the block order .
To demonstrate the problem , I did a simulation where I generated 480 random numbers per subject , representing the 480 time slices in the experiment .
I repeated this generation of random numbers 20 times .
I compared the send and no-send intervals of random numbers using a T - test ; none of the 20 trials found a significant difference at the p=5 % level .
I then repeated the simulation under the assumption that subjects would be anxious when first entering the fMRI machine , that this anxiety would last for between one and two minutes ( chosen at random uniformly ) , and that during the anxious period the fMRI signal would be chosen from the top 20 % of output levels as compared to the non-anxious period .
I repeated this simulation 20 times , and 12 of the trials showed a significant difference between the send and no-send intervals at the p=5 % level ; 5 were significantly different at the p=0.1 % level .
So you choose : does this experiment show that ( a ) everything we 've discovered in centuries of observations of physics is wrong ; ( b ) there is random variation when you deal with only 11 subjects ; ( c ) patients can get nervous when encased in a large , noisy machine ; or ( d ) something else .
Warning Sign D6 : it looks like the authors are trying to apply a statistical model with one too many free parameters ; a potentially fatal flaw .
fMRI is a great technology , but it relies on measuring changes in blood flow that take a few seconds to register .
This is called the hemodynamic delay .
Since we do n't know for sure how long this delay will be , we need to deal with it in some way .
One standard way to deal with the problem would be to ignore the first few seconds when we switch from send to no-send or vice - versa .
This is called a break period .
Also , another standard approach is to jitter the stimulus by a second or so -- rather than start every stimulus exactly on a boundary between recording slices , have some start in the middle of a slice .
Achterberg et al. apparently did not use breaks nor jitters .
How did they model the hemodynamic delay ?
The paper is not clear , but one sentence bothers me : " A goodness of fit statistic ( r squared ) indicates the degree of fit between the hemodynamic model and the actual brain activity during the time course recorded . "
To me , this suggests that the length of the hemodynamic delay is a parameter that is fit by some model ; their software computes the delay period that best fits the model .
Here 's the flaw : with a free parameter , you can impose order on a process where order does not exist .
To test this , I ran a simulation where I generated random numbers chosen uniformly from the range - 100 to +100 .
I generated 11 sequences of numbers , corresponding to the 11 subjects in the experiment , and 480 numbers per sequence to represent an fMRI reading once every 3 seconds of the 24 - minute experimental protocol .
I then divided each sequence into twelve equal parts , corresponding to the off - on parts of the experimental protocol .
I then computed the difference between the sum of the numbers in the on parts and the sum of the numbers in the off parts .
But I did this allowing hemodynamic delays of from 0 to 30 seconds .
By choosing one delay or another , I got the difference between the means to vary between 0.09 and 3.30 .
A difference of 0.09 is not significant ( p = 0.95 ) while a difference of 3.30 is significant ( p = 0.03 ) .
So , even with a sequence of random numbers , I can get a significant difference ( or not ) , just by choosing my hemodynamic delay .
If the authors ' search for the hemodynamic delay parameter was anything like my simulation , then it is possible that the results reflect an artifact of the parameter choice rather than any pattern in the data .
Unfortunately , one can't tell from the article exactly what they did .
Warning Sign D7 : overzealous data mining .
It appears they were looking for changes in any part of the brain .
There are a lot of parts of the brain ; if you look at enough parts , you 'd expect some to differ just by chance .
They should either decide ahead of time what areas are likely receptors of the transmitted thoughts and look only at those , or do another study looking only at the areas found to be relevant in a pilot study .
In personal communication , Dr. Achterberg writes :
We were " data mining , " and doing absolutely the appropriate study for a pilot endeavor .
It seems we are in complete agreement : what she did was perfectly appropriate as a pilot .
Where we disagree is what to do next .
I would say that the next step after the pilot study is to do a real study ; the wrong thing to do is publish the pilot as if it were real .
Vaughan
Bell writes about the common problem of data mining whole - brain imaging studies , rather than zeroing in on the appropriate part of the brain with a separate study .
\
fMRI of dead fish brain a study involving the fMRI of a dead fish .
They found the dead fish 's brain showed statistically significant results in the experimental task .
Their conclusion however is not that the dead fish can accomplish the task ; rather it is that " relying on standard statistical thresholds ( p < 0.001 ) and low minimum cluster sizes ( k > 8 ) is an ineffective control for multiple comparisons " .
See the discussion on this at the Neuroskeptic blog .
Warning Sign D8 : lack of a theory .
Since the experiment proposes an effect that contradicts known physics and physiology , there should be some explanation of how the effect is achieved .
The authors say that " the results of this study may be interpreted as consistent with the idea of entanglement in quantum mechanics theory . "
This is a partial theory , but it raises more questions than it answers : how do the particles of sender and subject get entangled ?
How does that entanglement lead to a causal effect in the subject ?
How does a causal effect in a particle of the subject lead to a macro - effect on brain state ?
When we assess whether there is anything to this study , we need to assess whether there are answers to these questions .
The final flaw : the results are either poorly worded , or do not directly address the question of how the period of time involving " sending " compares to " no sending " .
Here is the entire RESULTS section , verbatim ( my emphasis added ) :
The FSL software produces a quantitative table of cluster results that includes : cluster size , probability for each cluster , z scores , x , y , z coordinates of the cluster in Talaraich space and contrast of parameter estimates ( see Table 1 ) .
If a cluster is significant in a group analysis it means that there were specific brain regions in which the combined subjects had enough activation to raise the z score above the noise level threshold .
In other words , if all of the subjects had random activation at different places in the brain , then there would be no group activation .
One of the two clusters was highly statistically significant ( p=0.000127 ) .
Significant areas of apparent activation in the group analysis and total number of pixels activated for the group are reported in Table 2 .
A scan representing the group activation as a whole appears in Figure 2 .
It seems like what was done was : add up and average all the activations in the " send " condition , and subtract the activations from the " no send " condition .
Then you get a single set of summed activations , and look for deviations from zero .
Clearly , there were deviations , but that does not really address the questions .
We want to know how the " send " and " no send " conditions compare ; by lumping them all together , we 've lost the ability to do that .
Consider Fig. 2 from the article .
We see a picture of total activation regions in two areas of the brain , but what we really want to see is a comparison : what does a brain ( or an average over several brains ) look like in the send condition , and how is that different from the no-send condition ?
The result section is saying that the subjects had activation at " specific brain regions " and " different places in the brain " , but says nothing about how those activations are correlated with the time intervals of the conditions .
Table 1 , Table 2 , and Figure 2 all mention spatial regions , but nothing about time intervals .
In the DISCUSSION section , they do say " the results show significant activation of brain regions coincident with DI [ distant intentionality ] intervals . "
But they do n't say whether there was also significant activation coincident with non-DI intervals .
They correctly point out that " if all of the subjects had random activation at different places in the brain , then there would be no group activation . "
So they have proved that the activation in the brain is not random .
But they have not proved that it is non-random because of the send vs. no-send conditions .
It would have been easy to do a simple T - test or other test comparing the send vs. no-send condition , but they elected not to do that .
So not only have they failed to prove their premise ; they have n't even attempted to address it in the results sections .
In the abstract they do say " Significant differences between experimental ( send ) and control ( no send ) procedures were found . "
Unfortunately , the results section does not back up that claim .
Thus we can't evaluate the paper because we do n't know what it is claiming .
Study 2 : Byrd ( UCSF ) ; Prayer for Cardiac Patients
A relative of mine recently went in for surgery and sent out an email asking for supportive thoughts during the operation and thoughtfully noted that since the operation was early in the morning when we might be sleeping , thatI was perplexed .
On the one hand , if there really was good evidence of mind - over - matter ( and operating backwards in time , no less ) you 'd think it would be the kind of thing that would make the news , and I might have heard about it .
On the other hand , if there is no such evidence , why would seemingly sensible people like Larry Dossey , M.D. believe there was ?
I had a vague idea that there were some studies showing an effect of prayer and some showing no effect ; I thought it would be interesting to research the field .
I had just written an essay on experiment design , and this could serve as a good set of examples .
Our starting point will be a January 2007 interview with Dossey .
A sidebar in that interview highlights five studies that Dossey puts forth as his best case that prayer and other mental intentional acts can have an affect on the health of patients :
The body of the interview refers to three more studies , so we will consider all eight :
The first study is by Jeanne Achterberg of Saybrook Graduate School and colleagues .
She had eleven faith healers choose one subject each , who were placed in an fMRI machine .
Then the healers would alternately send and not send positive energy to the recipients , in twelve periods of two minute each .
The experiment measured the recipients ' brain activity and attempted to determine whether there were differences between the " send " and " no send " states .
When asked if there are any possible flaws in the study , Dossey said " " Let 's see if we can .
( The " warning signs " refer to my essay on experiment design . ) Dossey says " The most famous prayer study was conducted by Dr. Randolph Byrd . "
( Actually , I ( and many others ) think Benson 's study is most famous .
But Byrd 's is certainly well known . )
Byrd 's study is Positive therapeutic effects of intercessory prayer in a coronary care unit population , and was published in the Southern Medical Journal in 1988 .
Byrd studied 393 patients in a coronary care unit , split them into a control groups , and an experimental group for which a team of intercessors were given the subjects names and told to pray for " a rapid recovery and prevention of complications and death . "
Byrd then measured the death rates and three variables related to " rapid recovery " ( length of hospital stay , length of coronary care unit stay , and re-admissions ) .
There were no statistical differences between the two groups for " rapid recovery " or for " death " .
As for " prevention of complications , " the story is more complicated .
Byrd measured 24 other variables ( see table 2 in the article ) ; of these , 18 variables ( such as requiring major surgery , angina , and gastrointestinal bleeding ) showed no significant difference at the p=5 % level , and 6 variables ( such as heart failure , pneumonia and requiring antibiotics ) did .
But Byrd did n't declare before the study that these were the important variables .
So it is a clear Warning Sign D7 , overzealous data mining , to pick the 6 out of 30 significant variables after the fact .
Certainly you can use these 6 variables to inform another study , but you can't count the results from this study .
Furthermore , it is Warning Sign D6 to treat variables as independent when they are not .
For example , congestive heart failure automatically leads to a need for diuretics ;
Byrd counts these as two separate significant results .
That 's like saying you had a positive result on both " temperature ( Fahrenheit ) " and " temperature ( Centigrade ) . "
Byrd goes on to get a positive result with p=0.1 % , but he does this by inventing a scoring method for adding up the various measures .
This is Warning Sign D7 again : Byrd made up the scoring method after the data was in ; he should have made it part of the hypothesis before the data was gathered .
This is also a Warning Sign D2 , lack of a double - blind study .
Although the patients and Byrd were blinded , Byrd was not blinded when he made up this scoring method , and his assistant , Janet Greene , was not blinded throughout , even though she interacted with the patients and did data entry .
There is also a problem with Warning Sign D3 , too few subjects .
Although 393 subjects sounds like a lot , far fewer had serious problems .
For example , 7 patients in the control group had cardiopulmonary arrest , compared to 2 in the prayer group .
The difference is significant , but the numbers are very small .
This study appears to be done fairly well , with good randomization and controls , although some problems with blinding .
The results are inconclusive : some variables are positive ; some negative .
Byrd has stated that the paper was rejected from two jourtnals before it was accepted to the Southern Medical Journal .
The study should best be interpreted as a pilot study to help focus future research .
Study 3 : Harris ( University of Missouri ) ; Prayer for Cardiac Patients
Given an inconclusive study like Byrd , a good idea is to try to reproduce it .
Fortunately , an attempt was made by Harris et al .
They replicated all the cases where Byrd found no significant difference , such as length of hospital stay and mortality .
For the variables that Byrd found a significant difference , Harris found no significant difference .
In fact , of the 35 variables listed in Harris ' Table 3 , only one , " Swan - Ganz catheter " showed a significant difference at the=5 % level .
By random chance , you 'd expect 1.75 variables to show significance at the=5 % level .
But , Harris also commits Warning Sign D7 , over - zealous data mining , to come up with threescoring method from the one Byrd used -- one of the three showed a significant difference , at the=4 % level .
Tessman and Tessman have a further analysis .
Here 's another curiosity about the Harris study : Nicholas Humphrey points out that there were some patients who did so well that they recovered and checked out of the hospital before any prayers could be organized for them .
It turns out that four times as many of the " to be prayed for " group recovered quickly , compared to the " not to be prayed for " group .
This is significant at the p=0.1 % level .
What conclusion can you draw from this ?
( 1 ) someone was trying to slip more of the healthier patients into the " to be prayed for " group ; ( 2 ) God preferentially heals people who are about to be prayed for , thereby causing them not to be prayed for ; or ( 3 ) if you collect enough numbers and do enough data mining , you can find multiple statistically significant results ?
I prefer ( 3 ) , but you take your choice .
Although this study is cited in the sidebar of Dossey 's interview as one of the best studies , Dossey himself says in his book Healing Words that " this study has missed the mark .
. . . we would expect greater evidence than a few small percentage points of improvement .
We would want to see statistically significant life - or - death effects , which simply did not occur . "
I think that 's an accurate assessment of this study , as it stands on its own .
It should also be noted that this study fails to replicate Byrd 's findings , so we can add Warning Sign I1 : lack of reproducibility to both Byrd and Harris .
Taken individually , Byrd and Harris are both professionally - done studies with mixed results : they suggest prayer may have an effect on some variables but not on the seemingly most important ones such as death rates .
Taken together , they show that we do n't yet have any single variable for which intercessory prayer works reproducibly .
For those who believe in intercessory prayer to a responsive omnipotent being , this is difficult to explain :
God can't affect death rates nor speed of recovery ; all he can do is make you 5 % less likely to need antibiotics in one out of two studies ?
It reminds me of Woody Allen 's line : " If it turns out there is a God ... the worst that you can say about him is that basically he's an underachiever . "
Study 4 : Tloczynski ( Bloomsburg University ) ; Prayer for Anxiety
In this study , non-specific non-directive prayer was performed for subjects , who were undergraduate students in a psychology course .
The hypothesis was that the prayed - for students would show a significant decrease in scores for anxiety , depression , college maladjustment and Type A behavior , as measured by standard tests of those indicators .
The conclusion was that the prayed - for students had a significant decrease in anxiety , but no significant difference in the other indicators .
The first thing that stands out about this paper is Warning Sign D3 : too few subjects .
There were only eight subjects in the study .
You can argue whether 20 or 200 or 2,000 subjects is appropriate , but clearly 8 is too few .
The second issue is Warning Sign D1 : lack of a control group .
Due to the small number of subjects , the experiment used a multiple baseline single - case study , which means that all subjects start in the control group , and then they move to the treatment group at different times .
( The " single - case " part means that each single subject is a complete control / treatment case . )
In this experiment , all 8 subjects start in the non-treatment group .
After a week , 2 subjects move to the treatment group ( they are prayed for ) .
After 3 weeks 2 more move , and again 2 more after 5 weeks .
The final 2 subjects stay in the non-treatment group for all 7 weeks of the experiment .
A third issue is Warning Sign D2 : lack of a double - blind study .
The subjects were not aware of their treatment status , but the experimenter was -- in fact the experimenter was the one who performed the prayer .
As the article points out , this has the advantage that the experimenter knows that the prayers were performed consistently , but the disadvantage that it is not blind : the experimenter / professor might be inadvertently signaling something to the subjects in class .
In the article , the experimenter judges that there is only a very small risk of the experimenter doing this .
Multiple - baseline studies are designed for cases where it would be unethical to withhold treatment .
They are popular in education studies .
You can't take half the class and say " we 're not going to teach you to read . "
But you can teach different things to different parts of the class at different times of the year .
According to Barger - Anderson et. al ( 2004 ) , Warning Sign I1 ( lacking reproducibility ) is particularly important in single - case designs .
They state , " Many replications of any single - case research design are needed to prove cause - and -- effect relationships .
Further , no experiment , regardless of the method , should create a general assumption of a cause - and - effect relationship after only one completion of the study . "
Indeed , the question of cause - and - effect is the key one for this experiment .
Here is the data from the experiment , presented two ways :
On the left we see anxiety scores for each of the 8 subjects .
Each subject has a different color , and the data points with circles are before prayer started for the subject ; the points with crosses are after the subject was prayed for .
On the right we see average scores for each week of the experiment .
The orange line with circles is the average score of those who were not prayed for , the green line with crosses for those who were , and the grey for all subjects .
The grey line shows a decline over the seven weeks of the experiment .
Is that because something outside of the experiment tended to make the students less anxious ?
Or is it the fact that more subjects are being prayed for over time that makes them less anxious ?
Unfortunately , this study can't distinguish .
Is it noteworthy that the cumulative anxiety of all the not - prayed - for students goes down , and the cumulative anxiety of the prayed - for goes up over time ?
The experiment does n't answer these questions .
Consider the blue - line subject in the left - hand figure ; this subject is abut 50 % more anxious than the others .
As we see in the right - hand figure , when anxious guy is in the nontreatment group ( weeks 1 - 3 ) , his group ( orange circles ) has above - average anxiety scores , and when anxious guy switches to the treatment group ( weeks 4 - 7 ) , that group has above - average anxiety .
Could one subject explain all the results of the experiment ?
In the end 8 subjects are just too few to draw any conclusions , especially when the 8 are trying to do double duty as test and control .
Ladies and Gentlemen , you need a proper control group !
If you think you have a clever experimental design that gets around the need for a control group , carefully write down all the reasons you think it works on a piece of paper .
Study the paper carefully .
Then throw away the paper and get a control group anyway .
Gary Loveman , an executive at the Harrah's ( casino ) company , echoes this sentiment , telling the Wall Street Journal " There are two ways to get fired from Harrah 's : stealing from the company , or failing to include a proper control group in your business experiment . "
That said , there are cases where you can't have a control group , for ethical reasons .
For example , Smith and Pell ( 2003 ) jokingly doubt the efficacy of parachutes when jumping out of planes , because there are no studies with a control group that gets no parachute .
But for most situations where death is not on the line , find a way to incorporate a control .
Also , I applaud the use of a quick eight - person experiment as a pilot study .
In this case , the pilot study could have been used to suggest that an actual experiment look at anxiety and not the other three variables ( which showed no effect at all ) .
The mistake in this case , as in the Achterberg case , was to publish the pilot study ; it would have been better to do a real study with a sufficient number of subjects .
Study 5 : Cha ( Cha Hospital , Korea ) ; Prayer for Pregnancy
The authors failed to obtain informed consent ; neither the patients nor their doctors were told about the experiment .
This by itself does not dispute the results of the study , but it is considered unethical , and launched an investigation by the home institution , Columbia University .
In the wake of this controversy the lead author , Dr. Lobo , claimed that he had not even heard of the study until 6 to 12 months after it had been completed .
Lobo withdrew his name from the paper .
The second author , Daniel Wirth , a parapsychologist with no medical training , was the one who actually executed the experiment .
He has been accused of completely fabricating another study .
In May 2004 he pleaded guilty in a Pennsylvania court to thirty - five counts of mail fraud , bank fraud , and other felonies .
He stole over $ 3 million using false identities .
He was sentenced to five years in federal prison .
The Journal of Reproductive Medicine withdrew the paper from its web site .
withdrew the paper from its web site .
In February 2007 , the final author , Cha , was censured by the Journal Fertility and Sterility for plagiarizing , almost word for word , a paper published by Jeong - Hwan Kim in another journal , and perjuring himself by signing a statement that the work was original .
Cha was banned from publishing in Fertility and Sterility for three years and has left Columbia .
The next study , by Cha , Wirth , and Lobo in 2001 , claimed that prayerpregnancy rates forfertilization patients , at= 0.1 % .
However , the validity of the study has been called into question :
So we 're left with zero authors associated with the study who have not been penalized for fraud .
Believing this study looks like a Warning Sign I8 : believing liars and cheats .
Study 6 : Leibovici ( Rabin Medical Center , Israel ) ; Retroactive Prayer
Now let 's move on to the final study cited by Dossey as an " amazing example . "
This is a study by Dr. Leonard Leibovici of the Rabin Medical Center in Israel , appearing in the British Medical Journal in December 2001 .
In 2000 , Leibovici looked at patients admitted to the hospital for brief stays in 1990 - 96 .
He randomly assigned them to one of two groups , and had prayers said for the members of one group .
The control group got no treatment .
Mortality rates showed no difference , but subjects in the prayed - for group had less fever and shorter hospital stays , significant at the=4 % level .
Note that the praying was all done 4 to 10 years after the patients had either recovered or died .
So this means -- what ?
It is not clear .
By our current understanding of time and causality , the results of the experiment were already determined as soon as the patients were assigned to one group or the other .
There was no need to actually do or not do the prayer , since the results had already occurred , and could be computed right then and there .
An alternative explanation , requiring a new understanding of time and causality , is that the prayer in 2000 somehow changed the patients outcomes in 1990 ; or maybe the prayer had just affected the assignment of patients to the control or prayer group .
What is Leibovici 's take on this ?
He says :
The purpose of the article was to ask the following question :
Would you believe in a study that looks methodologically correct but tests something that is completely out of people 's frame ( or model ) of the physical world - - for example , retroactive intervention or badly distilled water for asthma ?
Leibovici answers his own question as follows :
if the pre-trial probability is infinitesimally low , the results of the trial will not really change it , and the trial should not be performed .
This , to my mind , turns the article into a non-study .
Here Leibovici is saying that his whole purpose in publishing the study was to point out what I called Warning Sign I4 ( confusing P( H|E ) with P( E|H ) ) .
His reasoning is as follows : what 's the prior probability ( before the experiment ) that thoughts can influence events in the past ?
We have no evidence of it ever occurring , we have no theory for how it could occur , but we have copious evidence and theory that says that it does not happen .
So reasonable values for the prior probability of it happening in this case could be anywhere from one in a trillion to one in a googolplex .
If we believe the experiment , which comes in at a p=4 % level , we should update the probability to a higher value , but the result is still infinitesimally small , so Leibovici 's point is that the experiment does n't matter .
Note that the article was published in the Christmas issue of the British Medical Journal , which traditionally includes articles of a light - hearted or humorous nature ( such as the Smith and Pell December 2003 paper on the efficacy of parachutes ) .
Clearly , Leibovici and the editors meant it as a kind of joke , to challenge our understanding of statistical results .
( This subtlety was lost on many commenters . )
I think the most interesting comment was by Martin Bland of the University of York .
He essentially has a logical proof that an ethical study proving the efficacy of retroactive prayer is logically impossible .
The proof goes like this ( my words ) :
According to Clause 30 of the Declaration of Helsinki , " at the conclusion of the study , every patient entered into the study should be assured of access to the best proven prophylactic , diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by the study . "
Now suppose you have done a study proving retroactive prayer works .
If you do n't offer retroactive prayer to the control group , you 're being unethical .
If you do offer it , then the control groups should be retroactively cured .
Thus , in the end there should be no difference between the control group and the treatment group , and therefore the study cannot show an effect .
One final issue is what I call Warning Sign D8 ( lack of a theory ) .
First Dossey argues that a theory is not necessary :
No mechanism known today can account for the effects of remote , retroactive intercessory prayer ...
However , the significant results and the flawless design prove that an effect was achieved .
To quote Harris et al : " when James Lind , by clinical trial , determined that lemons and limes cured scurvy aboard the HMS Salisbury in 1753 , he not only did not know about ascorbic acid , he did not even understand the concept of a `nutrient . '
There was a natural explanation for his findings that would be clarified centuries later , but his inability to articulate it did not invalidate his observations . "
He has a very good point that this experiment by Lind -- one of the first applications of the scientific method to medicine -- was done without a modern theory of vitamins or nutrients .
However , as I point out in D8 , Lind had a perfectly good partial theory : " diet affects health " .
This partial theory constrained the design of Lind 's experiment .
For example , if he fed limes to seaman Smith he would then look for a change in Smith 's health in the following days or weeks .
He would not look for a change to Smith in the past , nor for a change in the seaman who carried the limes to Smith .
Dossey goes on to propose his own partial theory for retroactive causality : " In one of the most profound discoveries in science , a new class of phenomena was recognized : " non-local events , " in which distant happenings are eerily linked without crossing space , without decay , and without delay . "
Here he is using the theory of Quantum Electrodynamics as a metaphor for something eerie , but he 's not saying exactly what .
Dossey is correct in pointing out that experiments on subatomic particles are consistent with the idea of nonlocality , and Einstein did indeed call this " spooky action at a distance . "
Does quantum theory license Dossey 's idea that anything goes -- mind over matter , prayer working backwards in time , whatever ; it 's all non-local ?
Dossey seems to think that there 's plenty of slop in Quantum theory ; it all seems so strange , so anything 's possible ; why could n't thoughts affect a patient 's health a decade before ?
This invocation of nonlocality may work as a metaphor , but it does n't work as physics .
It is true that photons act nonlocally , but what connection does that have to consciousness ?
Or to macroscopic causation going backwards in time ?
I know of no evidence nor any theory that would account for this .
Furthermore , Quantum Electrodynamics is actually the exact opposite of " anything goes . "
It is the most precise , most predictable theory ever invented in any field .
For example , before Quantum theory the magnetic moment of the electron was defined as 1 Bohr magnetron .
From the theory you can see that this is actually an approximation , and the more precise value can be calculated as 1.0011596525 Bohr magnetons ; this matches the experimentally derived value of 1.0011596522 magnetons to 10 digits of accuracy .
Compare that to the gravitational constant , 6.67428 × 10-11 N m2 /kg2 , which has only 6 digits of accuracy .
According to physicists , Dossey would have a ten - thousand - times better argument if he invoked gravity rather than quantum theory as his metaphor .
After all , gravity is nonlocal as well .
Two objects with mass are " eerily linked without crossing space , ... and without delay " by gravity .
But of course , gravity does not sound as mysterious as quantum forces , so it would sound silly to say " gravity is nonlocal and we do n't understand it completely , therefore thoughts can influence events in the past . "
But let 's drop physics and get back to statistics .
Dossey disagrees with Leibovici's take on his own experiment .
Dossey says " Leibovici 's auto - rejection brings a dangerous level of arbitrariness to the scientific process .
Why disqualify one study and not another , when both had acceptable methods ? "
I totally agree with Dossey that there is no need to disqualify any study - - a proper Bayesian analysis incorporates all the evidence .
We should accept the results of any study for what they are worth -- but no more .
Similarly , we should accept any theory as a possibility -- but give it an appropriate probability .
If , like Dossey , you have a prior probability of somewhere near 50 % that thoughts can influence events in the past , then this study ( if you believe it was reliably done ) should , according to Bayes ' Rule , cause you to update your probability to about 96 % .
If , like Leibovici , or most other people , you have a prior probability more like one in a trillion , then you should update to about 24 in a trillion .
Leibovici says this is close enough to no change that you can effectively discard the study .
From a practical point of view he 's right that you should n't spend much time worrying about possibilities that are 24 in a trillion .
But from a theoretical point of view he 's wrong -- we should not discard the study completely , because if we accumulate 10 independent , unbiased confirmatory studies at the p=4 % level ( with no non-confirming studies ) , we should update all the way from 1 in a trillion to about 1 in a hundred , at which point we would want to treat the possibility very seriously indeed .
So what are the chances of quantum theory justifying causal effects in health backward in time ?
Is it one in two or one in a trillion ?
Nobel laureate physicist Steven Weinberg said " quantum mechanics has been overwhelmingly important to physics , but I cannot find any messages for human life in quantum mechanics that are different in any important way from those of Newtonian physics . "
There are mysteries in quantum theory , but not as to what actually happens -- that can all be predicted out to the tenth decimal place .
The only " eerie " part is why it happens that way .
As Feynman put it : " While I am describing to you how Nature works , you wo n't understand why Nature works that way .
But you see , nobody understands that .
I can't explain why Nature behaves in this peculiar way . "
Study 7 : Benor ( Wholistic Healing Publications ) ; Spiritual Healing
Dossey also mentions a meta-study by Daniel J. Benor M.D. titledfrom the journalBenor looks at 131 studies and finds that 56 have positive results at a significance level of =1 % , while 75 do not .
Does that constitute positive or negative evidence ?
If , like Gary Posner , you 're a stickler for credentials , you 'd say it constitutes no evidence at all , because these are all either unpublished student theses or from parapsychology journals , and not from established scientific journals .
If you think that spiritual healing constitutes a new physical phenomenon ( rather than just a medical treatment ) then you , like Victor Stenger , would see a Warning Sign I6 : accepting the wrong p value , and insist on the p=0.01 % level of physics journals and would say that these are 131 out of 131 negative results .
If you 're a serious statistician , you would note that Benor uses a simplistic and error - prone technique called vote - counting .
This is a clear Warning Sign D6 : the wrong statistics .
( See an analysis by Bangert - Downs and Rudner , which states " conclusions from vote - counting can be very misleading . " )
If you 're Benor or Dossey , you say the jury is still out , but the fact that 56 is way more than 1 % of 131 is evidence favoring spiritual healing ( and you do n't mention the 75 other studies ) .
Here 's how I look at a meta - analysis like Benor's .
A meta-analysis asks the question :
Assuming that ( A ) there is one single phenomenon that all these experiments are testing , and ( B ) there are no systematic flaws in the experiments , what is the probability that random variation in outcomes would lead to these results , given that the underlying phenomenon is positive ( or negative ) ?
An arsenal of sophisticated statistical tools is employed to answer such questions , but we can bet a first - cut answer with a trivial analysis .
First , suppose there is a real phenomenon .
Then you would expect about 99 % of studies ( or 130 out of 131 ) to show it at the p=1 % level , But we only saw 56 positive results ; fewer than half the expected number .
On the other hand , if there is no real phenomenon , we would expect only 1 out of 131 positive results , but we actually observed 56 .
Without even doing the math , it should be clear that the observed results are very unlikely either way .
There is not enough data in the Benor paper to actually do the math , but I think the chances of the observed results given the assumptions are somewhere between 1 in a billion and one in 1030 .
Therefore , we should examine the assumptions .
We could question assumption ( A ) and posit some set of conditions under which spiritual healing works and some conditions under which it does n't work , and see how the experiments match up with this theory .
Or we could question assumption ( B ) and try to find flaws in some of the experiments that would explain the contradictory results .
This seems promising since 6 out of 6 of Dossey 's best examples of studies had numerous pervasive problems .
Here 's one completely speculative possibility : assume that about 90 % of these studies are flawed and should be discarded .
Assume that leaves us with 6 positive and 8 negative studies at the 1 % level .
Assume that for every published study there are 42 unpublished negative results due to the file - drawer effect .
This model fits eactly the expected number of positive and negative results if there were no effect of spiritual healing .
Now I realize I made many assumptions in this speculative model .
But even if you think there 's only a one - in - a - million chance of this model being accurate , that 's still thousands or billions of times more likely than the alternative suggested by Benor .
In the end , a meta - analysis only helps explain random error in sampling ; it cannot explain systematic error in experiment design .
As an aside , I will mention the controversy over meta - analysis of mind - over - matter studies unrelated to healing .
For example , the meta-study by Radin and Nelson ( and a book by Radin ) describes a total of 515 experiments by 91 authors on extra-sensory perception or ESP : a subject tries to guess the roll of a die or the next number from a random number generator .
It turns out that the experiments report a persistent effect of slightly better than chance guessing , equivalent to guessing the flip of a coin a little less than 51 % of the time , rather than 50 % .
This may not seem like much , but because the total number of trials is in the millions , it is very unlikely that this deviation happened by chance ( something like a 10 - 50 chance ) .
There was an exchange between Radin and the eminent statistician I. J. Good over the magnitude of the file - drawer effect necessary to explain the 51 % disparity , but I wo n't go into that , because it really does n't matter .
It matters to Radin , because he thinks there are only two possibilities : either there is a file drawer effect , and the statistics show no anomaly , or there is no file - drawer effect , and therefore ESP is real .
But for someone who can imagine other possibilities -- perhaps the random numbers generated in the experiments were not completely random , and the subjects unconsciously picked that up , or perhaps there were errors in recording the results -- this becomes a matter of " yes , I accept that there is a non -random effect here , but is it more likely that the effect is due to ESP or to errors in the experimental method ? "
Statistics can provide only a partial answer to that question .
Skeptics point to a number of reasons for concluding that the results of the experiments are indeed non-random , but that the reason is not ESP : ( 1 ) the lack of an explanation for why the effect should always be at the 51 % level , and not at 66 % or 75 % ; ( 2 ) the detection of error or fraud in multiple past studies , ( including all known cases of claims of high ( e.g. 66 % or 75 % ) results ) ; ( 3 ) the lack of a physical theory ; ( 4 ) the known fact that data recorders can easily make mistakes at the 1 % level , and so on .
Study 8 : Klingbeil ( Spindrift Institute ) ; Yeast and Atoms
Other Studies
What about thoseAs far as I can tell , these are all the works of Christian Scientists Bruce and John Klingbeil , who founded the Spindrift Institute in Oregon in 1969 .
They did experiments where they prayed for yeast , seeds , and other things .
They had an excellent methodological idea -- eliminate the possibility of a placebo effect by using non-sentient subjects .
Unfortunately their results were never peer - reviewed or published in scientific journals , making it difficult to evaluate them .
The Klingbeils apparently did self - publish some of their experiments , shortly before they committed suicide in 1993 , but I have been unable to find copies .
It appears these studies have not been replicated by any other lab .
Now let 's look at some studies that Dossey did n't mention .
The first three are often cited as the largest and best - controlled studies of intercessory prayer ; they all happen to be on prayer for cardiac patients :
Study 9 : Benson ( Harvard , Templeton Foundation ) ; Prayer for Cardiac Patients
The next three are recent meta-analyses of intercessory prayer :
And finally , some studies that perhaps should not be taken seriously , but might be instructive :
The John Templeton Foundation financed this study , intending it to be the definitive answer on the efficacy of prayer .
They spent $ 2.4 million and enlisted 1.7 million people to pray .
The study looked at 1802 heart patients from several prestigious medical centers .
Like other studies this one had double - blinded prayed - for and non-prayed - for groups .
But they also added a third group , which was explicitly told they would receive prayer .
Intercessors were instructed to pray " for a successful surgery with a quick , healthy recovery and no complications . "
By all accounts the study was properly controlled and blinded ( except for the third group , who knew they would be prayed for ) .
The conclusion of the study was :
Intercessory prayer itself had no effect on complication - free recovery from CABG [ coronary artery bypass graft surgery ] , but certainty of receiving intercessory prayer was associated with a higher incidence of complications .
In other words , there was no significant difference between the blinded prayed - for and not - prayed for groups .
Overall , most commenters say the study was done well , but there was criticism of the fact that no pictures of the patients were given to the prayer - givers , and only first names and last initials were used .
Also , prayer - givers were instructed to include the phrase " for a successful surgery with a quick , healthy recovery and no complications " in the prayers , and some reported that this was unnatural for them .
One curious outcome of this study is that the group that knew they were going to be prayed for did worse , at a statistically significant level .
The experimenters speculate the patients may have felt " hey , if some stranger needs to pray for me , I must be really sick " , and responded poorly because of that .
This is a possible explanation , but the result is still surprising : normally placebos are quite powerful medicine , and if patients were told they were receiving a treatment that they believed would be beneficial , we would expect improved results .
Perhaps a more balanced experimental design would include a fourth group : one that knows they are not being prayed for .
Such a study was done by Walach et al. on chronic fatigue syndrome patients .
They found that there was no significant difference between the blinded treatment and non-treatment roups , but that the patients who knew they were being prayed for did better than the ones who knew they were not .
This suggests that , even if prayer itself has no effect , the expectation of prayer has an important placebo effect , and should be considered as part of a treatment program .
Study 10 : Aviles ( Mayo Clinic ) ; Prayer for Cardiac Patients
As delivered in this study , intercessory prayer had no significant effect on medical outcomes after hospitalization in a coronary care unit .
Study 11 : Sloan ( Duke ) ; Prayer for Cardiac Patients
Neither therapy alone or combined showed any measurable treatment effect on the primary composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events at the index hospital , readmission , and 6 - month death or readmission .
Study 12 : Masters ( Syracuse ) ; Meta -Analysis of Prayer
There is no scientifically discernible effect of IP [ intercessory prayer ] as assessed in controlled studies .
Study 13 : Hodge ( Arizona ) ; Meta -Analysis of Prayer
Overall , the meta - analysis indicates that prayer is effective .
Is it effective enough to meet the standards of the American Psychological Association 's Division 12 for empirically validated interventions ?
No .
Thus , we should not be treating clients suffering with depression , for example , only with prayer .
Study 14 : Roberts ( Oxford ) ; Meta -Analysis of Prayer
These findings are equivocal and , although some of the results of individual studies suggest a positive effect of intercessory prayer , the majority do not and the evidence does not support a recommendation either in favour or against the use of intercessory prayer .
We are not convinced that further trials of this intervention should be undertaken and would prefer to see any resources available for such a trial used to investigate other questions in health care .
Study 15 : Galton ( Royal Geographical Society ) ; Prayer for British Royal Family
Francis Galton
There is not a single instance , to my knowledge , in which papers read before statistical societies have recognized the agency of prayer either on disease or on anything else .
...
Had prayers for the sick any notable effect , it is incredible but that the doctors , who are always on the watch for such things , should have observed it . "
This study of 799 subjects was similar to the Benson study above .
There was no third group , but they did separate both the prayed - for and non-prayed - for groups into low - risk and high - risk .
The study appears to be well - controlled and blinded .
The conclusion was :
This study of 748 heart patients differs from the other two in that it enlisted 12 different denominations to do the prayer : Jews , Muslims , Buddhists , and various Christian denominations .
The study also considered soothing music , imagery and touch therapy , known as MIT .
All together there were four groups : prayer or non-prayer crossed with MIT or non-MIT .
The conclusion :
This meta - analysis looked at 14 prayer studies .
They looked for all the studies published before August 2005 matching the terms " intercessory prayer " in the PsycInfo and Medline databases , and also looked at references from these articles and from review articles .
The conclusion was :
This meta - analysis looked at 17 studies , including many of the same studies as Masters .
Hodge found that there was a difference in favor of prayer that is statistically detectable , but that the difference in outcomes is not clinically important :
One serious problem with this meta- analysis is that it includes the discredited Cha / Wirth study .
Masters reported that removing Cha / Wirth eliminates 88 % of the ( non- significant ) effect in his study ; Hodge does not report whether the effect would persist if Cha / Wirth was removed .
This new study ( April 2009 ) searched ten databases for all randomized controlled trials relating to intercessory prayer .
They found ten , and did a meta- analysis .
This was part of the Cochrane Collaboration , which does systematic reviews of medical literature , and has very good guidelines for doing the analysis .
The lead author of this study is Chaplain at Hertford College , Oxford .
She and her colleagues report that there was no significant effect of prayer on death , clinical state , or re-hospitalization rates .
They conclude that prayer is not promising enough to spend any more money studying , but since it appears to do no harm , there is no reason to recommend for or against it :
OK , so this prayer study , Statistical Inquiries into the Efficacy of Prayer , is n't one of the biggest , nor one of the best , but it is the , so I could n't resist slipping it in .
It was done by a famous statistician , Francis Galton ( 1822-1911 ) and published in thein 1872 .
Galton says : Then Galton proposes an experiment of his own .
He notes that British subjects frequently say prayers for the health of the Queen and other royals .
Are those prayers effective ?
He shows a chart of the average lifespans of various groups :
Group Number Avg. Life Members of Royal houses 97 64.0 Clergy 945 69.5 Lawyers 294 68.1 Medical Profession 244 67.3 English aristocracy 1,179 67.3 Gentry 1,632 70.2 Trade and commerce 513 68.7 Officers in the Royal Navy 366 68.4 English literature and science 395 67.6 Officers of the Army 659 67.1 Fine Arts 239 66.0
According to this table , the royals have the lowest life expectancy , so it appears that all those prayers are not working .
Galton 's study has an important place in the history of scientific reasoning , but it has several serious flaws .
Most importantly , there is a selection bias ( Warning Sign D4 ) : a Royal child counts as a royal from birth , and thus a childhood death will bring down the Royal 's average .
In contrast a child born to a non-royal who dies before taking up a profession does not bring down the average of any profession .
So we can say that Galton 's study does not provide a serious result ( perhaps he himself did n't think it was very serious either ) , while still admiring it as one of the first examples of evidence - based medicine .
There have been other studies along similar lines to Galton's .
For example , a study by W.F. Simpson in 1989 found that graduates of Principia College , a school for Christian Scientists , who advocate prayer rather than medical treatment , had significantly higher death rates than similar students from secular colleges .
This study does not have the confounds of Galton 's study ; if anything you would expect that the Christian Scientist students would have lower rates of dangerous practices such as drinking and smoking and thus you would expect them to live longer .
Another study by Asser and Swan looked at 172 children who died after their parents refused medical care , preferring to rely on prayer .
Asser and Swan found that , if you assumed the typical cure rates of medical treatments for the stated causes of death , at least 135 of these children would have recovered .
However , this conclusion is invalid because of selection bias : it considers only the children who did die , and we do n't have recovery rates on the children who did not die .
Study 16 : Brown ( Indiana ) ; Proximal Intercessory Prayer
Western and Mozambican Iris and Global Awakening leaders and affiliates who administered PIP all used a similar protocol .
They typically spent 1 - 15 minutes ( sometimes an hour or more , circumstances permitting ) administering PIP .
They placed their hands on the recipient 's head and some - times embraced the person in a hug , keeping their eyes open to observe results .
In soft tones , they petitioned God to heal , invited the Holy Spirit 's anointing , and commanded healing and the departure of any evil spirits in Jesus ' name .
Those who prayed then asked recipients whether they were healed .
If recipients responded negatively or stated that the healing was partial , PIP was continued .
If they answered in the affirmative , informal tests were conducted , such as asking recipients to repeat words or sounds ( e.g. hand claps ) intoned from behind or to count fingers from roughly 30 cm away .
If recipients were unable or partially able to perform tasks , PIP was continued for as long as circumstances permitted .
Rural Mozambican subjects exhibited improved audition and / or visual acuity subsequent to PIP .
The magnitude of measured effects exceeds that reported in previous suggestion and hypnosis studies .
D1 : Lack of a Randomized Controlled Trial .
There was no control group ; all subjects were in the treatment group .
That means the conclusion is exceptionally poor : they can't say that their patients who received treatment did better than patients who did n't .
All they can do is compare their patients to ones in completely different studies .
That comparison is worthless .
D2 : Lack of Double - Blinding .
There was no blinding ; patients and healers ( who were also the test scorers ) both knew that everyone was in the treatment group .
D3 : Too Few Subjects .
There were only 24 subjects in the treatment group ( and no control group ) .
D4 : The Wrong Subjects .
Rather than choose a cross-section of subjects , the experimenters specifically chose subjects from rural Mozambique who were attending an evengelical revival meeting -- subjects who would be favorably inclined to ( consciously or unconsciously ) demonstrate a benefit from prayer .
( The experimenters note that previous trials in the USA had negative results . )
D5 : The Wrong Questions .
Subjects self - assessed when they were healed , and were then tested with eye charts and an audiometer .
The problem with this is that the tests are still subjective , and the experiment was not double - blinded .
So , if a subject says the letter on an eye chart is " E , no F? E ? " , the healer may well reason " Well , he said he was improved , and I know that my PIP treatment is powerful , so I 'll mark that one as correct . "
With no blinding , no control group , and no purely objective tests , we can't really say if the results show anything at all .
Control group : there should have been a control group that did not receive PIP .
If it were me , I would have had three groups , one that received touch and prayers , one that got just the touch ( perhaps with a substitute voice message , as described below ) , and one that got neither ( perhaps with some alternative placebo treatment ) .
That would help distinguish whether the touch or voice or both are important .

That would help distinguish whether the touch or voice or both are important .
Blinding : Admittedly it is harder to blind a study that involves active touching than one that involves remote prayer .
Still , it would have been easy to properly single - blind this study .
For example , you could give the subjects headphones and eye shades so that they do not see or hear whether the healer is praying or not .
Alternatively , if it is important for the patient to hear the " soft tones " , the study could have used healers who spoke a different language from the patients , with one group reciting prayers and another reciting some other script .
That takes care of single - blinding ; for double - blinding the study should have had someone other than the healer administer the post - treatment hearing and vision tests , someone who did not know which group the patient was in .

Wrong subjects : Results from each population tested should have been reported .
Subjects should have been objectively evaluated for hearing / vision before , immediately after , and several days after treatment .
That , along with a proper control group , should suffice .

Wrong questions :
This problem goes away once we have proper double - blinding and a control group .
Conclusions
Conclusion 1 : Assessing the Evidence for Intercessory Prayer
Here " Proximal Intercessory Prayer " ( PIP ) means the laying - on of hands : the healer touches the patient while praying for a health improvement .
Brown et al .
( see also an accompanying editorial ) describe the protocol :
They conclude : This study is instructive because it achieves a rare pentafecta , triggering all five of the most important experiment design warning signs :
This study can tell us nothing about proximal intercessary prayer , but it is a perfect example of howto do experiment design .
Here 's how it could have been better done :
Before doing the research for this essay , I had had a vague idea from reading various newspaper reports that studies of the medical efficacy of prayer were mixed : some studies showed a positive effect , some not .
In fact , after actually reading the 14 studies above , a different picture emerges .
We can grade each study as positive ( P ) , negative ( N ) , or flawed ( F ) :
Num Result Author Comment 1 ( F ) Achterberg Clearly shows that brains do not behave completely randomly while in an fMRI machine .
However , poor experimental design means we can't tell if the variation is due to anxiety or boredom or to distance intentionality .
2 ( P,N ) Byrd A mostly well - done study that is negative on most variables ; on all variables when you combine with Harris .
3 ( P,N ) Harris
A well - done study that is negative on most variables ; on all variables when you combine with Byrd .
4 ( F ) Tloczynski
Too few subjects to draw any conclusion .
5 ( F ) Cha
The work of a felony fraudster and a plagiarist and can't be taken seriously .
6 ( F ) Leibovici Intended to be taken as a joke and is best interpreted that way .
7 ( F ) Benor Reporting on unpublished studies that are difficult to evaluate , using the flawed methodology of vote - counting .
8 ( F ) Klingbeil Never published any peer - reviewed studies .
9 ( N ) Benson A well - done study with all negative results .
10 ( N ) Aviles A well - done study with all negative results .
11 ( N ) Sloan A well - done study with all negative results .
Together these are the three best .
12 ( N ) Masters A meta - analysis with negative results .
13 ( F ) Hodge A meta - analysis with some positive results , but the author claims the results are not clinically important .
Also , it seems likely that the positive results stem solely from the discredited Cha study .
14 ( N ) Roberts A meta - analysis with negative results .
15 ( F ) Galton Best treated as a joke .
15 ( F ) Brown
Got every experiment design choice wrong .
In sum we find 9 flawed studies ( from which we can draw no conclusion ) and 5 clear negative studies ( which say that for the conditions they studied , there is no solid evidence that intercessory prayer performs better than no prayer ) .
There are also two good studies , Byrd and Harris , which individually show a positive effect of prayer on some variables and no effect on other variables , but taken together are negative : they show that no variable has a consistent , repeatable effect .
It certainly looks like intercessory prayer , when measured in a scientific experiment , is not effective .
Why is the impression from actually reading the studies so different from my original impression from reading newspaper reports ?
It may be because , as I write elsewhere , some reporters are more interested in giving " both sides of the story " than in doing a little work to discover if there is actually compelling evidence to support a point of view .
Also , it is easy for a reporter to jump from " the study was significant at the 5 % level " to " it works ! " , and finally , reporters never mention the studies that are not published .
Conclusion 2 : Religious Implications
Old Testament Theists can point to Deuteronomy 6:16 , which states " You shall not put the Lord your God to the test " and claim that of course prayer does n't work when part of an experiment , but it does work otherwise .
" and claim that of course prayer does n't work when part of an experiment , but it does work otherwise .
Theists of any faith can say that God works in mysterious ways , has a plan for each person 's eternal soul , and does not care to change that plan just because someone asks .
Or , since none of the studies actively prohibited an outsider from praying for a subject , it may be that subjects in both the control and treatment groups were in fact prayed for , and God does not work by majority rule .
Theists of particular doctrines can say that the prayers were performed incorrectly , according to their doctrine .
Deists can say the results are consistent with a God who created the Universe and passively oversees it , but does not answer prayers .
Atheists can use the results as evidence against a God .
Conclusion 3 : Assessing Dossey
Happily , there 's something in the results of these studies to please everyone , regardless of their religious beliefs :
Note that the Sloan study , which used 12 religious denominations , have had an outcome where one religion worked and the others did n't .
But instead it reported that all 12 are equally ineffective .
You can interpret that as evidence that God is great and loves all people equally , or as evidence that God ( or each of 12 Gods ) is not listening , or not responding , or does not exist .
Statistics puts limits on which interpretations are plausible , but statistics cannot tell you how to choose among these alternatives .
Larry Dossey M.D. seems like a a sensible , intelligent , nice guy , dedicated to helping people .
How could he look at the same studies we have covered here and see an overwhelming preponderance of evidence for the efficacy of prayer , rather than the reverse ?
How could he say he found " no flaws " in Achterberg , when we could so easily find seven serious flaws ?
( I recognize that Achterberg is a co-author with Dossey 's wife , so he has reasons to be charitable . )
How could Dossey support the Cha / Wirth / Lobo study in January 2007 , when he must have known by then that Lobo had repudiated the study and Wirth had been convicted of fraud ?
How could Dossey call the Leibovici study " an amazing example " of the effectiveness of prayer , when Leibovici himself saw it as a joke , and called it a " non-study " ?
How could Dossey cite Tloczynski , a non-blinded study with 8 patients , and omit Benson , a double - blinded study with 1.7 million that is generally regarded as the best study in the field ?
I realize the interview was a short piece , but citing the six studies Dossey does and failing to mention Benson , Aviles and Sloan would be like an historian arguing that Germany is the greatest military power in the history of the world by citing the Franco - Prussian War -- and neglecting to mention World War I or World War II .
How could Dossey do that ?
After reading Tavris and Aronson 's book Mistakes Were Made ( but not by me ) , I understand how .
Dossey has staked out a position in support of efficacious prayer and mind - over - matter , and has invested a lot of his time and energy in that position .
He has gotten to the point where any challenge to his position would bring cognitive dissonance : if his position is wrong , then he is not a smart and wise person ; he believes he is smart and wise ; therefore his position must be correct and any evidence against it must be ignored .
This pattern of self - justification ( and self - deception ) , Tavris and Aronson point out , is common in politics and policy ( as well as private life ) , and it looks like Dossey has a bad case .
Ironically , Dossey is able to recognize this condition in other people -- he has a powerful essay that criticizes George W. Bush for saying " We do not torture " when confronted with overwhelming evidence that in fact Bush 's policy is to torture .
The essay , argues that Bush has slipped into self - deception to justify himself and ward off cognitive dissonance .
Just like Dossey .
Dossey may have a keen mind , but his mind has turned against itself , not allowing him to see what he does n't want to see .
This is a case of mind over mind , not mind over matter .
Conclusion 4 : Final Lessons
If you are n't trained to recognize the types of errors I outline here and in my other essay , you can easily interpret a claim that " pneumonia was significantly less in the treatment group at the p=5 % level " as meaning " there is a 95 % chance that treatment is effective in reducing cases of pneumonia . "
After reading these essays you should realize that the two statements are not at all equivalent ( regardless of whether the treatment is prayer , antibiotics , or anything else ) .
I really like that Dossey said " We need a single standard where we subject both conventional and alternative medicine to the same high standards . "
I agree with Dossey that the standard for publication in medical journals should be more strict .
Perhaps Victor Stenger is right in saying that studies should be accepted only with p closer to 0.1 % rather than 5 % , but I do n't think that relying solely on the p value is the right way to decide .
In fact , I 'm questioning the whole idea of p values , or at least the idea that they should be so prominent in publications .
A recent article by J. Scott Armstrong says " I briefly summarize prior research showing that tests of statistical significance are improperly used even in leading scholarly journals .
Attempts to educate researchers to avoid pitfalls have had little success .
Even when done properly , however , statistical significance tests are of no value . "
By that he means that it is always better to give confidence intervals rather than significance levels .
If I say that X is a better treatment than Y with significance p=5 % , you have n't learned much about the magnitude of the difference between X and Y .
But if I say the 95 % confidence interval for X is a 55 % to 67 % cure rate and the corresponding interval for Y is 42 % to 54 % , then you have a much better idea of the real difference .
I think it would be great if there were an online international registry of experiments : when you start an experiment , you register your hypothesis and methodology and get a timestamp .
Your submission could be kept secret for a year or two if you desire .
When you go to publish , you need to show that your experiment was properly registered ahead of time .
If you fail to publish , researchers still have a record of file - drawer effect experiments .
Anyone can learn to be a better judge of evidence .
This essay and its companion attempt to teach the basics .
By the way , my relative pulled through the surgery with no complications .
Hmm , were all you readers praying for a good outcome retroactively ?
Maybe there is something to this retroactive intercessory prayer thing after all ...
