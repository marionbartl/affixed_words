You seriously just ca n’t make this shit up :
Liberal bias has become the single biggest distortion in modern Bible translations .
There are three sources of errors in conveying biblical meaning :
* lack of precision in the original language , such as terms underdeveloped to convey new concepts of Christianity
* lack of precision in modern language
* translation bias in converting the original language to the modern one .
Of these three sources of errors , the last introduces the largest error , and the biggest component of that error is liberal bias .
Large reductions in this error can be attained simply by retranslating the KJV into modern English .
Thus , a project has begun among members of Conservapedia to translate the Bible in accordance with these principles .

The raid that rocked the Met :
Why gun and drugs op on 6,717 safety deposit boxes could cost taxpayer a fortune
More than 500 officers smashed their way into thousands of safety - deposit boxes to retrieve guns , drugs and millions of pounds of criminal assets .
At least , that 's what was supposed to happen .

Operation Rize :
An officer uses an angle grinder to open lockers containing safety - deposit boxes
The Finchley Road is one of the busiest thoroughfares heading out of London .
It leads traffic north past Lord 's Cricket Ground and the multimillion - pound houses of some of the country 's richest hedge - fund managers all the way to the M1 .
At three in the afternoon it 's always pretty slow going , but on this particular summer Monday the traffic was almost at a standstill .
This was partly because the normal three lanes going north had been cut down to one .
But it was also because of drivers slowing down to a crawl so they could gawp at the massive police operation unfolding on a busy corner of the road .
Police vehicles - both cars and menacing armoured trucks - jammed up two lanes .
Dozens of armed officers in bulletproof vests were standing ready , waiting to be called inside an anonymous - looking building .
From the sheer manpower and weapons on display it looked like the capital was under another terrorist attack .
But while this was the Metropolitan Police 's most ambitious operation in its 180 - year history , it had nothing to do with national security .
Only hours before , at a special briefing , teams from SCD6 ( the Economic And Specialist Crime unit ) and C019 ( Specialist Firearms Command ) hunkered down with technicians armed with angle grinders and drills .
Also present were dog handlers , their animals trained to sniff out guns , drugs and explosives .
In all , more than 500 officers had gathered to receive orders to raid smart addresses in well - heeled parts of the capital .
The locations included three of Britain 's largest and most well - established safety - deposit box depositories in Edgware , Hampstead and Park Lane as well as an office and the homes of the three directors of Safe Deposit Centres Ltd , which owned the vaults - two in Hampstead and one in Barnet .
For most of those at the briefing , arriving just before 3 pm on June 2 last year , this was the first they had heard of the operation .
Secrecy had been paramount and , with so many involved , keeping the operation ' airtight ' had been one of the largest headaches in the pre-planning for what was codenamed ' Rize ' .
The police rolled through London in a convoy : scores of patrol cars , armed - response vehicles , outriders on their bikes , vans with their windows shielded by metal cages .
With a
Met film unit recording everything , detectives forced their way past startled security guards , demanding receptionists open the secure doors that led to the normally hushed strong rooms , which in the three centres housed 6,717 safety deposit boxes .
Cash found in deposit boxes .
More than £ 53 million in cash was impounded , some of it stuffed into supermarket bags
Over the next few hours , the three depositories were transformed into makeshift evidence - sorting centres , decked out with tables to bear the contents of the safety - deposit boxes that were soon to be forced open .
Within a day , the first stage of the operation was finished but it would take over ten more to complete the next intricate and prolonged phase .
Investigators wearing gas masks and blue overhauls used power tools to chop away at the locked doors that protected the boxes themselves .
They had rehearsed this bit for many hours , on mockups , trying numerous methods to get quickly and safely at the deposit boxes .
Forged passports found in deposit boxes
Diamond drill bits forced down into the locks proved disastrous , potentially damaging evidence inside .
Instead , they settled on Makita angle grinders , with which they now effortlessly hacked at the hinges , allowing them to slide out the individual strong boxes , some as small as an A4 pad .
Larger ones required a more bullish approach - strong - arm tactics that the police maintained were essential as key - holders would have been unlikely to co-operate .
As the first of the boxes was opened , detectives began probing the contents .
Many were spilling over with bank notes and jewellery .
Each was given a rough designation - for instance , ' cash ' or ' gun ' - and the words scribbled onto labels before they were placed in sealed evidence bags that were loaded into vans and given an armed escort to their final and secret destination , a secure counting house .
Here , every one of the thousands of boxes was to be intimately scrutinised .
Not only did detectives have to itemise what they had found but match the contents to a person .
A few of the box - holders ' identities had been acquired through months of police surveillance .
Others were revealed in vault registers seized by police during the raid .
Some used aliases and would be hard to track down ; more still would be identified by scrutinising the vaults ' CCTV cameras .
Sixty officers would sift , analyse and count until November 2008 and beyond , racking up £ 1.4 million in overtime bills alone .
There was a lot at stake .
Never before had the British police been granted a warrant as broad as this .
The raids had been made possible under a controversial law , the Proceeds Of Crime Act ( POCA ) , which came into being in 2002 and introduced an array of wide - ranging new powers to seek out and confiscate dirty money - the houses , cars and boats bought by criminals .
However , lawyers watching the police operation unfold were quick to warn that the strong - arming of these vaults and the crashing into each and every box was tantamount to the police having obtained permission to smash down the doors of an entire housing estate .
David Sonn , of Sonn Macmillan
Walker , one of the largest criminal defence practices in London , says , ' POCA was never intended for this .
No one objects when criminals are caught and their assets seized - but shaking down everyone to get to them is specifically not what lawmakers wanted . '
A handgun belonging to a suspected drug dealer ( left ) and items seized include police riot gear , guns and swords ( right )
Aware of the controversy , Scotland Yard went on a charm offensive , with Assistant Commissioner John Yates giving a series of briefings .
' This is a huge operation to tackle criminal networks who we believe are using safe deposit facilities to hide assets , ' he reassured the media .
The raids had come after 18 months of scrupulous intelligence gathering that had led detectives to suspect the vault owners were turning a blind eye to the worst kinds of criminality , enabling major villains to conceal , transport and launder their ill - gotten gains , said Yates .
Brushing aside concerns about the invasion of privacy , he asserted that ' the majority ' of the boxes seized belonged to criminals .
Evidence was soon put on show that seemed to underscore his position .
More than £ 53 million in cash was impounded , some of it stuffed into supermarket bags .
Most of the money , said the Met , was ' the proceeds of armed robberies and international drug trafficking ' .
Unnamed Yard sources speculated that some had come from the 2006 Securitas depot robbery in Tonbridge , Kent , and that a mysterious haul of gold grains wrapped in plastic and squashed inside suitcases could be linked to the Brinks Matt heist of 1983 .
There were sufficient diamonds and pearls to string up as bunting for a street party .

In one box in Edgware , bags of white powder when tested turned out to be 140g of 81 per cent pure cocaine .
Lying next to it was £ 62,500 in cash .
Another box , crammed with notes , was identified as belonging to a Russian woman whose boyfriend was the son of a convicted major - league drugs dealer .
A semi-automatic Glock 9 mm , the weapon of choice for British gangsters , was lodged in Box 1653 at the Hampstead depository , rented by 44 - year - old Gavin Leon , who was jailed for five years last March .
A Brocock firearm and nine rounds of ammunition , together with £ 20,000 in cash , some heroin and weighing scales had been deposited in a box belonging to John Derriviere , a 47 - year - old who is now wanted by police .
A £ 100,000 stash left in a box in Edgware turned out to belong to convicted drug dealer David Wilson , 38 , from Dagenham , a nest egg he intended to collect after completing a 24 - month sentence .
Scrutinising the vault 's CCTV , police also identified drug trafficker Yaset Berhane , 27 , whose box contained £ 122,000 in cash , some of it marked by Sussex Police in an earlier drugs sting , leading to Berhane 's jailing in March 2009 for drug trafficking and money laundering .
When vice - squad detectives raided five premises connected to a southeast Asian businesswoman who had more than £ 100,000 in cash in one box , they found brothels worked by girls who had all potentially been trafficked to the UK , as well as a string of foreign bank transactions showing £ 800,000 flowing out of the UK .
In the months after Rize there were more than 40 arrests and 11 prosecutions .
However , by talking to scores of box - holders , none of whom have spoken before , Live has uncovered a different version of Operation Rize , one that shows how the vast majority of those caught up in the raids were innocent .
They have had their lives turned upside down over the past 17 months .
Many have struggled to recoup their money and possessions , been forced into legal trench warfare with police lawyers and told they must prove how they came by the contents of their boxes .
This is also a story told through secret legal papers , including confidentiality agreements struck with some vault depositors whose cases threatened to topple the entire operation .
Although the police told a judge that ' nine out of ten ' of all of the thousands of box - holders were probably criminally minded , criminally connected or felons , the paper trail reveals that perhaps only as few as ten per cent of the boxes have any connection to serious crime .
More worryingly , according to eminent lawyers and barristers , Operation Rize has seen the Yard employ unethical tactics , driving a coach and horses through the new POCA legislation , leaving the Met facing a raft of legal actions that could potentially cost taxpayers millions of pounds .
The police raid at Hampstead .
Never before had the British police been granted a warrant as broad as this
' Rize is a juggernaut veering out of control , ' said one barrister who helped advise on POCA during its passage through Parliament , ' and now a sharp tool that we badly needed to drain criminal cash has been tarnished , potentially damaging it and inhibiting its use ' .
Within days of the raids , the police set up a helpline to deal with potential inquiries .
They were overwhelmed by the response .
One detective told Live : ' Everyone presumed we had bagged a load of villains who would not dare claim their iffy property .
But thousands of the box - holders complained . '
Some of the box - holders contacted lawyers .
These were people far removed from the criminal underworld .
Many had been with the company from the beginning , drawn to the likeable Jewish businessman who ran it .
Leslie Sieff founded the company in 1986 , although by the time Operation Rize unfurled he'd been bought out by developer Milton Woolf .
In one box there was 140g and cocaine and £ 62,500 in cash beside it ...
In another , a Glock 9 mm , the weapon of choice for British gangsters
Many of the clientele were families who had fled turmoil , pogroms , coups and wars and long had a cultural preference for locking away money and jewels , building up a vehement distrust for the integrity of traditional banks .
Here , stepping down the spiral staircase at the back to the darkened boxes below , they felt reassured that their most important possessions were safe .
One survivor of Nazi Germany in his seventies told us how he had placed a bag of diamonds there - security if ever he or his descendents needed to run again .
' My wife and I had escaped from Germany with nothing but these gems , ' he said .
' She sewed them into our clothing before we crossed occupied Europe , reaching Britain by ship when the jewels were snipped out and locked up . '
There was a rabbi too , Yitzchak Schochet , of Mill Hill Synagogue , who said : ' Safety deposit boxes are supposed to be confidential .
The whole situation was very unsettling and an intrusion of privacy . '
Another client , an Indian millionaire entrepreneur with connections to the House of Lords , described how he was ' treated like a convicted man just because I had wealth in cash ' .
A Hindu priest described to Live how his family 's valuables had been carried in the Sixties from Madhya Pradesh , India , to London ' in a gunny sack ' .
Among the possessions seized by the police were elaborate handcrafted bracelets , gold rings set with uncut stones , and a bejewelled wedding tikka ornament to be draped on the forehead of a new bride .
' These items had always been in our family , ' the priest said , ' We had cash in there too .
But now we had to prove how we bought them and where that money , saved over the years , had come from . '
Officers painstakingly record the contents of the safety - deposit boxes
Under POCA , the burden of proof lay with the box - holders .
Finding evidence for wartime treks across Europe , or charting migration stories from the Partition of India and beyond , would cost many of the box - holders tens of thousands of pounds .
Mark Richardson , a former military intelligence officer and now a forensic accountant , who has been employed by several box - holders to explain their wealth , told us : ' We had to get one family 's diamonds carbon - dated at great expense to demonstrate to the police that they had been cut in the Thirties , which tallied with their story of fleeing Germany before World War II . '
Lawyer Sara Teasdale , of City practice Roiter Zucker , whose client had kept more than £ 900,000 in his box at the vaults in Edgware as cash flow for his business leasing black cabs , said : ' The police are " deep - pocketing " - hauling people through a protracted legal process that they know is so costly that most will roll over . '
One angry box - holder rented Box 73 at the Park Lane depository .
Alexander Temerko , formerly a vice president of Russian oil giant Yukos , whose billionaire boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky had fallen foul of President Putin , had fled to London as Khodorkovsky was jailed for eight years in Russia .
When I got my box back , £ 9,000 cash and some smaller items of jewellery were missing - a gold baby 's bracelet and a gold ring
On his arrival in the UK , Temerko had locked five crates of legal documents into his safety - deposit box .
However , as a result of Rize , the papers were now in the hands of the Met , which claimed they were evidence of an alleged criminal conspiracy whose participants were British , obliging the police to investigate .
Incandescent , Temerko hired an expensive lawyer , Ian Burton , of BCL Burton Copeland .
Burton recommended Clare Montgomery , a barrister from Cherie Blaire 's chambers , Matrix .
Within weeks of Operation Rize , Temerko's team set about applying for a Judicial Review of the judge 's decision to grant the controversial Rize warrant and demanded the return of Temerko 's files , which they claimed had been taken unlawfully .
Montgomery and Burton highlighted case law that specifically stipulated ' fishing expeditions ' were barred to the police , even under POCA .
In other words , the police were not allowed to seize property in the hope that it would later prove to be criminal .
The legal team also demanded sight of the police evidence that had convinced the judge to issue the warrant in the first place .
Across town , in Camden , some less high - profile but equally infuriated welltodo box - holders did the same .
John and Estelle Selt , aged 62 and 73 , wealthy retired shopkeepers , had rented a box for 15 years .
Inside it was £ 150,000 and three valuable bracelets .
Determined to clear their names , the Selts put up the £ 50,000 needed to launch their own Judicial Review that also focused on the lawfulness of the original warrant .
Following seven months of legal fencing , with the police guarding its Rize file , the twin Judicial Reviews finally succeeded in prising from the Yard a startling 32 - page ' skeleton discussion ' .
This document - which we were able to obtain after being given a case number by a senior source in Customs and then trawling through court records at the Royal Court building - provides an extraordinary insight into how the police managed to obtain a warrant for Rize .
The document provides a summary of two confidential meetings between the Met , its legal advisors and the judge who signed the Rize warrant in May 2008 .
The document revealed the Met had begun targeting Safe Deposit Centres Ltd in January 2007 , in an operation led by DCI Mark Ponting .
Armed police during the raid .
In all , more than 500 officers had gathered to receive orders to raid smart addresses in well - heeled parts of London
Using undercover officers posing as potential customers , Ponting 's team of detectives had drawn maps of the vault interiors and tried to determine the number of clients and their identities .
They also probed the rigour with which the company enforced Financial Service Authority ( FSA ) guidelines on properly identifying box - holders and keeping a watch out for anything suspicious .
Convinced that the vaults were part of a moneylaundering conspiracy , the Met Commissioner had then asked for RIPA ( Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ) warrants to tap the phones of the vault 's directors , as well as intercepting their emails and letters - an operation completed by October 2007 .
Now the police decided to raid , and in an unprecedented move they planned to break into all of the deposit boxes simultaneously .
The Met hired Kennedy Talbot , one of Britain 's most experienced barristers dealing with POCA .
Talbot approached a senior judge at Southwark Crown Court in November 2007 .
But Southwark rejected the request .
The police application was also riddled with simple errors , according to the skeleton document , including a claim by undercover officers that there were 18,000 boxes , three times the actual number .
Police also named Leslie Sieff as a director , when available records showed that he had sold the majority of his shareholding as far back as 1998 and would soon resign as a director .
Undaunted , the Rize team tried again the following year .
This time the Met went out of London to a court that rarely heard complicated money - laundering cases , putting their arguments before Judge Ken Macrae , in Croydon .
In a practice known as ' judge shopping ' , one that is lambasted by judges and lawyers - though not illegal - the police hoped to get the right result by finding a court more sympathetic to their goals and less up to speed with judicial debates on the proportionality of a warrant .
David Sonn , of Sonn Macmillan
Walker , says : ' This was highly unusual and totally unethical . '
The police should have gone back to Southwark .
The Met has refused to discuss why they went to Croydon stating simply : ' We will not discuss details of the evidence relied upon for warrant applications . '
Having amended the number of safety - deposit boxes to a correct 6,717 , and after admitting ' there is a lot we do n't know ' , the police claimed to have found a shredded list behind one of the centres that when reconstituted revealed the identities of boxholders .
SCD6 had analysed it and concluded that in a sample of 391 names between ' 82 per cent and 90 per cent were suspicious or connected to crime ' .
A statistician was then hired who used this sample of only five per cent of the total client base to conclude that nine out of ten of all of the thousands of box - holders were probably criminally minded or felons , an opinion later expressed more stridently with Judge Macrae , who was told that ' all of the boxes might contain criminal property ' .
Macrae was swayed .
He authorised a warrant under POCA on May 30 2008 .
Minutes had been taken of the judge 's meetings with Talbot and Ponting .
They tell how the Rize plan had been rejected by one senior judge only to be put to a second who was wooed with statistics rather than hard new evidence .
Other court documents obtained show that the legal teams preparing their judicial reviews took the 32 - page transcript to pieces and in so doing lambasted the whole Rize operation .
' The warrant was extraordinarily broad , ' Temerko's team warned , and ' completely unprecedented ' , representing the widest ever seen by lawyers in Britain , one that on this ground alone was liable to be quashed by High Court judges .
The police had only provided the court with ' bare assertions ' rather than hard evidence .
A High Court judge was advised , ' The gross interference in privacy outweighed any benefit to the investigation . '
The file concludes : ' This is a remarkable and untenable case of guilt by association ' that trampled on rights to privacy enshrined by Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights .
This guarantees all individuals the right to privacy , barring states from intruding unless serious crimes have been committed .
Siobhan Egan from lawyers Lewis Nedas added : ' The police had also made some bizarre errors . '
The POCA legislation barred the seizing of legal papers but they had five crates belonging to Temerko .
The police changed course .
They notified Temerko's legal team that they were now acting under the Criminal Justice and Police Act , which allowed such privileged documents to be held .
' However , this law can only be invoked when a written notice has been given to everyone , box - holders and vault owners , ' said Egan .
Alerted , the police ran around serving the directors of the Park Lane vault and their box - holders with written notices - without realising that the law could not be applied retrospectively , and that the notice had to be handed over ' at the time ' of the raids .
On June 4 2009 , the Met caved in .
Temerko was offered an agreement .
In exchange for dropping his Judicial Review , all five crates of his documents were returned ' in sealed police evidence bags ' , with the police even agreeing to pay his costs , as well as accounting for their own , a combined figure estimated at more than £ 250,000 .
In return , the Russian agreed to keep ' the terms of this consent order confidential ' .
His silence had been assured .
The Selts won too .
A similar deal was offered to them , their goods returned and costs paid .
Statistics were by now causing the police significant problems .
Mark Taylor , a former fraud investigator for HM Customs and Excise , now an associate director of Vantis , an accountancy firm advising families caught up in Operation Rize , kept a tally .
Of the 6,717 boxes targeted by detectives in the biggest raid in the Met 's history , just over half were occupied .
And of those that were full , 2,838 boxes were now handed back , a figure that represents 80 per cent of the number of boxes seized .
Eight out of ten box owners were provably innocent .
Taylor said : ' Of the £ 53 million in cash that the police took , £ 20 million has also been given back and £ 33 million is now being referred to as " under investigation " , of which only £ 2.83 million has been confiscated or forfeited by the courts . '
This figure represents just over five per cent of the total money stored in the vaults , although the Met has 690 ' suspect ' boxes that it is still investigating .
That means of the total number of boxes , around ten per cent are being probed for villainy , a long way from the nine out of ten cases the Met surmised they would find while wooing Judge Macrae .
Lawyers have seen their Rize cases squeezed and intimidated .
Sara Teasdale revealed how the police were first adamant that her client 's money was criminal cash , threatening forfeiture , only to try and turn the box - holder 's business partner against him , enticing him to wear a wire so as to entrap him into admitting it was also money stolen from his own company .
Teasdale said : ' They first tried " wrong money " .
Then it was company money .
Even when they dropped criminal proceedings against him in February 2009 , they inexplicably continued with civil forfeiture proceedings . '
The Yard was trying all it could to get the cash .
' They were sitting on almost £ 1 million , and having referred to my client anonymously in press releases as an example of why they had raided , they needed to win . '
But this case was recently lost by the Met too , leaving the box - holder with £ 200,000 in fees , money he is now seeking back from the police .
Others going after the Yard include some who claim that money and jewels have gone missing from their boxes .
Many have spoken to Live about their plight , although they have asked not to be named because the information is personal .
One goldsmith from north London fought for over a year to get his £ 40,000 cash and valuables back , then claimed it was not all there .
He has now filed an official complaint .
' The police kept saying , " Why have you got all this cash ? " and I showed them my books . '
His premises were raided twice , the second time by 20 officers .
' They found nothing because I had done nothing and eventually this summer , everything was returned to me .
But £ 10,000 was gone - and my wife 's diamond earrings . '
The Met has strenuously denied all allegations of theft , pointing out that anyone stealing from the boxes would have been caught on camera since officers videoed the entire operation .
Another box - holder who is alleging theft , a wealthy Russian émigré party - planner from north London , who had £ 64,000 in cash and £ 250,000 worth of jewellery , including heirlooms from Russia , successfully challenged the police to produce the video .
' I am meticulous , ' she said .
' I have a receipt for everything .
When I got my box back , £ 9,000 cash and some smaller items of jewellery were missing - a gold baby 's bracelet and an 18 - carat gold ring . '
The initial police footage , she claims , had a time code and showed her box being carried to a table .
But then the tape was interrupted and when it restarted the footage was being shot from a new camera , at a different angle and without a time code , with real time having moved on many seconds .
She told Live : ' It only takes seconds for a small envelope of cash or a gold ring to be swiped from the table and into someone 's pocket .
I was staggered . '
After failing to get adequate answers from the Met 's own Directorate of Professional Standards , her lawyers have gone to the independent Police Complaints Authority , along with 70 other box - holders .
The Met maintains Operation Rize was an absolute success .
DCI Ponting said : ' The MPS is committed to targeting those who benefit from the proceeds of crime , restraining and confiscating criminal property and seeking to forfeit cash and assets under the Proceeds Of Crime Act 2002 .
As in the case of Operation Rize , this legislation enables the police to reduce harm to communities , disrupt criminal networks and take out community criminal role models .
By taking the cash out of criminal lifestyles , money is put back into the public purse and contributes to restoring community confidence .
' In 2008 / 9 the MPS deprived 4,787 criminals of £ 21 million .
Comparative figures for 2002 are 239 criminals deprived of £ 1.5 million .
In addition to £ 21 million actually permanently deprived from criminals , the MPS also has a cash balance of £ 40 million detained under POCA awaiting forfeiture and perhaps as much again in restrained assets .
This equates to over £ 100 million in all , of which Operation Rize has been a major contributor . '
Detective Chief Superintendent Nigel Mawer from SCD6 added , ' Rize continues to be a hugely complex inquiry .
We still have almost 700 boxes under active investigation as well as a number of trials pending .'
However , Lawyer David Sonn said : ' Would an operation like Rize ever be run again ?
I doubt it .'
Facing hefty fees for defending itself before two Judicial Reviews , being pursued for millions of pounds in legal fees by innocent box - holders , and now facing inquiries into theft , the political , judicial and financial costs of the operation are beginning to stack up .
And yet when it first kicked off , one of the things that had endeared Rize to everyone was its revenue - earning capacity , something revealed in a tucked - away minute of the Metropolitan Police Authority from September 2008 .
Warning that the police were lagging behind in meeting targets set to seize criminals ' assets , it stated : ' To achieve the target a further £ 36.6 million of assets need to be seized in the remaining nine months . '
This was ' a challenging target ' .
However , ' with the emerging results from Operation Rize , the seizures are likely to make a major contribution toward the final total .'
In fact , the operation may end up costing the taxpayer a fortune .
Rize has certainly helped put a number of hard - line criminals behind bars , but at what cost ?

* Illustration : Michael Gericke * Major league athletes are rewarded for talent , toughness , and single - minded dedication .
Major league team owners , on the other hand , are rewarded for mediocrity .
Having bought their way into a league , lackadaisical owners can extort hundreds of millions of dollars from their hometowns ( and charge exorbitant ticket prices ) under threat of decamping for another city .
They can allow wretched teams to languish year after year and pocket the league 's revenue - sharing money rather than invest it in talent , knowing that when they 're ready to sell , a scrum of millionaire suitors will materialize .
That 's because big league teams in the US — and the leagues themselves — are , in effect , monopolies .
Major League Baseball even has an explicit antitrust exemption .
Without name recognition , fan loyalty , and access to top talent , an upstart league does n't stand a chance .
How to spark owners with the same competitive fire they demand of their players ?
Stefan Szymanski and Stephen Ross have a plan :
Make teams compete for a spot in the majors .
Szymanski , an economics professor at City University London , and Ross , a law professor at Penn State , borrowed their model from European soccer .
In that system , no team is assured of a place in the top national league .
Instead , each league has multiple levels : England 's Premier League , Spain 's La Liga , and Italy 's Serie A are all the top rungs of their respective ladders .
At the end of each season , the bottom few teams at each level are relegated to the rung below and are replaced by that level 's winners .
Applied to American pro sports , the European system would eliminate the artificial scarcity that owners exploit .
Anyone with the resources could simply start their own team and play their way up into the top tier .
As a result , owners looking to boost their take by threatening to skip town would find they had no leverage , since other cities big enough to support a serious contender for the top tier would already have one .
And there would be no such thing as a perennial cellar dweller ; teams that performed poorly would be demoted .
Demotion would cut their value , driving even the most complacent owner to do what it takes to get competitive .
" You 're sharpening the incentives , " Szymanski says .
Of course , team owners would n't like it , but they could be convinced .
Szymanski holds out hope that a bit of moral suasion from high places would suffice .
" It 's possible for courts and the legislature to decide the public has had enough of this monopoly system .
The government can tell the leagues that if they do n't sort themselves out in a sensible structure , government will do it for them , " Szymanski says .
" It would be very Barack Obama , I think . "
Wired 's Smartlist 2009 12 Shocking Ideas That Could Change the World
PETER BRIETBART , a contributor to the Freethinker , and a student of politics and philosophy at the University of Sussex where he is chair of the Secular Society , was there to see the Church totally routed –and he grabbed the opportunity to interview CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS after the debate , organised by Intelligence Squared .
There are few experiences more pleasing than watching Christopher Hitchens and Stephen Fry utterly demolish their opponents in debate .
Last night , in the Methodist Central Hall , Westminster , they squared up to MP Ann Widdecombe and Nigerian Archbishop Onaiyekan , who were tasked to defend the motion that :
The Catholic Church is a force for good in the world .
Oh , the humiliation !
The voting , according to The Telegraph‘s Andrew M Brown – who described the Archbishop as “ particularly hopeless ” – gives a good idea of how it went .
Writes Brown :
Before the debate , for the motion : 678 .
Against : 1102 .
Do n’t know : 346 .
This is how it changed after the debate : For : 268 .
Against : 1,876 .
Do n’t know : 34 .
In other words , after hearing the speakers , the number of people in the audience who opposed the motion increased by 774 .
My friend Simon said it was the most decisive swing against a motion that he could remember .
One highlight included the lovely hostess Zeinab Badawi asking the Archbishop if Jesus actually said anything about homosexuality , and him replying “ that ’s not the point . ”
Another was Fry ’s noting that the Church is obsessed with sex .
He makes the comparison with food , exclaiming that only two kinds of people are obsessed with food : the anorexic and the obese .
In a religious context this boiled down either to celibacy or child abuse .
And to see Stephen Fry finally speak his mind on the topic of religion was a pure delight .
But the masterstroke , the coup de grace , came from Christopher Hitchens , whose breadth and depth of knowledge meant that the debate was no longer a mere discussion , but a devastating prosecution of the Catholic Church for crimes against humanity .
Within minutes of Hitchens ’ opening , the full realisation of the evils of the Church became apparent to all but the most obstinate of believers .
The institutionalised rape and torture of children ; the teaching that condoms can cause AIDS ; the historical atrocities ; the endorsement of dictators ; the justification of slavery ; the subjugation of women ; the suppression of enlightenment thinking ; the torture and murder of heretic scientists and the bullying and hatred of homosexuals , were but a few of the issues covered .
Hitchens suggested that the Archbishop should not have come here to debate , but to beg for forgiveness on behalf of his wicked organisation .
I could write more about the debate but I suspect you ’ll be more interested in the interview with Christopher Hitchens .
I caught up with him after the momentous Fry / Hitchens victory , and he was visibly eager to speak to the Freethinker :
It ’s lovely to speak with you , thanks for the time .
It ’s very nice of you to say so .
By all means , ask away .
How would you respond to the religious apologists who would say that the majority of religious activity is benign in nature ?
Well , I have a standard reply , I hope you do n’t mind .
I ’ve evolved it over a lot of debates , and put it to a lot of religious believers and spokesmen , and I ’ve never yet had a reply :
Name for me a moral action or a moral statement ever made or committed or uttered by a believer , that a non -believer could n’t have made .
No -one ’s ever come up with one .
Name for me now a wicked thing done or an evil thing said because of their religion – you ’ve already thought of one .
There ’s wickedness in print and in action , directly so with religion .
Goodness can be found in the giving of yourself to other fellow creatures .
And for it ’s own sake , I should add , not so you ’ll spread the word , sign up more people so you can keep on saying your number is a billion .
That ’s not a good motive for charity .
So , although it ’s a question one has to ask , I think it is a fatuous question .
What would you say to those who level accusations of racism against those who criticise Islam ?
It ’s an increasingly popular stance on the Left .
Indeed .
The creepy word “ islamophobia ” has been coined to give the idea , without actually saying so , that quarreling with Islam involves a dislike of Muslims - the majority of whom are darker skinned than I am .
But that ’s absurd because Islam promises to be a religion of universality .
It at least does say that .
Some religions are n’t accessible to all .
Judaism for example .
Well , you can convert , but it ’s not quite the same .
Rather more painful to join .
Quite so .
There ’s always a special preachment .
For a long time you could n’t be black and be a Mormon , for example .
In America you could , but you could n’t be a deacon , and you did n’t really have a soul .
That kind of thing .
Islam , at least , does n’t do that .
So it ’s pathetic to say that there ’s any racial prejudice in criticism of Islam , as pathetic as it would be to ask Ann Widdecombe if she thought that being against Catholics meant being against Italians .
Which , incidentally , at one point in America , it probably slightly was .
Bush , we discover , told Jacques Chirac that the biblical demons of Gog and Magog were at work in Iraq .
Have you heard about that ?
What are your thoughts ?
Yeah , I do n’t believe Chirac .
I do n’t know what the truth of the matter may be , but I do know that Jacques Chirac is an untrustworthy scumbag .
And anyway , that ’s not the way Bush talks .
I do n’t believe the Palestinian guy who said that Bush told him that God told him to invade Iraq , either .
Bush is a Methodist .
What he ’s said , and he ’s said it often , is that once you ’ve worked to a certain point , you can do no more – it ’s in God ’s hands .
That ’s fatalism .
Actually he ’d make a very good Muslim .
And if he ’d been born in Saudi Arabia , he would be one , just as he’d be a protestant if he was born on the right side of Belfast .
Here ’s another – a chance to be a little more witty .
Voltaire once said that the religion of one age becomes the literary entertainment of the next .
What do you predict for the future of religion ?
Yes , Voltaire is right , of course .
But that does n’t mean that the thing wo n’t keep on mutating .
I mean , I do think we are mammals and primates .
We are in some sense programmed to look for patterns , we ’re easily scared , and we often put up with a crap theory over no theory at all .
And we ’re afraid of dying .
And we ’re only partly rational .
Our pre-frontal lobes are too small , our adrenaline glands are too big , because we ’re adapted to the savannah , from which we fled .
So I think religion is not eradicable , but then , I would n’t want it to be eradicated .
I ’d be sad , in a way , if it did die out , because it is human .
But I think it can be domesticated in the same way as our violent tendencies .
We have other anti-social or superstitious tendencies which we can , at least for a while , rid ourselves of .
It ’s the job of civilization to bring superstition under bounds and keep it there .
If all writings from throughout human history were to be destroyed , and you could choose to save the writings of a single author , who would you choose , and why ?
That ’s a very good question .
Well , here ’s what I would look for .
I ’d look for the author from which you could reconstruct the work of many , many other writers because of references , quotations , allusions that one is supposed to get .
That ’s a cunning answer .
Very tactical .
Yes , well , that would put Shakespeare very high , for example .
From that there ’s a great deal of Biblical stuff , classical , Italian renaissance , history , mythology … there ’s a huge amount of other learning in it .
I do n’t think there ’s any other writer of bodies of canon in that way .
So from that we could work out quite a lot about what we were before , as a species .
But for that reason , not because of it ’s extraordinary beauty and wisdom .
Otherwise it would be Darwin .
It would have to be Darwin .
His work , too , is full of great references , and teaches us a great deal about the natural world .
He was a literary type .
Ah , I had hoped you might say Darwin .
That might just be my choice , too .
Next , what can we do , as individuals or groups , to further the cause - if you can call it that - of reason and unbelief ?
Well , it may sound like a religious , or confessional answer , but you have to start with yourself .
We all have to overcome our own irrationalities and superstitions first .
That ’s a lifetime of education , and it ’s worth having .
I try and do it everyday .
I expose myself to other people ’s opinions , writings and so forth , so that ’s the main thing .
Oh , and if you do well enough , you might just get asked your opinion .
The other thing is not to give anything the go -by .
You have to get up and say no when someone suggests there should be a tax break for churches , or that the bishops should sit in the House of Lords , or anything like it .
Oppose anything that trespasses on the secular line of the separation of church and state , because civilization begins where the separation of church and state begins .
There are no exceptions to that in any country .
So it ’s in the general interest , as well as your own , that we patrol that line with great vigilance .
It ’s been a pleasure .
Thank - you .
You ’re very welcome !
( CNN ) -- Support for abortion rights has fallen sharply in the past year , with Americans now split roughly 50 - 50 between those who back legal access to abortion and those who oppose it , according to a new survey .
Anti-abortion activists demonstrate on Capitol Hill in Washington in September .
The findings mark a dramatic shift in public opinion , supporters of abortion rights have outnumbered opponents for many years , with one brief exception , studies have shown .
But only 47 percent of Americans now feel abortion should be legal in all or most cases , a drop from 54 percent a year ago , according to the poll .
Meanwhile , 45 percent say it should be illegal in all or most cases .
That 's up from 41 percent a year ago .
Given the survey 's margin of error , the two camps are statistically tied .
" These data suggest that a number of people have changed their minds in the past year , " said Gregory Smith of the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life , one of the survey 's authors .
It 's not only one type of person or group whose opinion has changed , he said .
" There was a drop seen in many , many demographics : men and women , people with a college degree and those with less education , people with various religious backgrounds , " he said .
The only groups whose opinions on abortion did not change were African - Americans -- who tend to oppose it -- and young people and those not affiliated with any particular religion , who tend to say it should be legal , he said .
" Beyond that , this movement [ was ] across the board , " he said .
Anti-abortion activists welcomed the findings .
" This is great news .
This poll shows that the pro-life movement is winning hearts and minds .
Pro-lifers are making an effective case that all women deserve better than abortion and that every child deserves a chance to be born , " said Cathy Ruse , the senior fellow for legal studies at the anti-abortion Family Research Council in Washington .
The Rev. Flip Benham , a Dallas , Texas - based anti-abortion activist , said the survey reflected a change he had already seen taking place .
" It 's something that we have known for a long , long time that 's been beneath the radar , " he said .
" The heart of America is changing and only with time do the laws reflect that change . "
" When the church will come out into the streets , we win the battle , " said Benham , director of operations for Operation Save America .
" We have to return to the God of our founding fathers and our pilgrim fathers , " he said .
But Terry O'Neill , the president of the National Organization for Women , firmly rejects religious opposition to abortion .
" Abortion is a blessing when it is chosen freely by a woman who needs it .
It is a blessing , " she said , citing the Rev. Katherine Ragsdale , dean of the Episcopal Divinity School .
O'Neill has been in that position herself , she said .
" When I was in my early 20s , I thought I needed an abortion .
I was escaping a very violent marriage that lasted about eight months , " she said .
" The young man I was married to exploded and severely battered me . "
She fled to her parents ' home .
A month later , she began to suspect she was pregnant with her abusive husband 's child .
" If I had had a baby , I would have been tied to that man for the rest of my life , " she said .
" I did n't need the abortion , as it turned out , but if I had needed that abortion , it would have been a blessing .
" I knew I was going to become a mother , but not with that man , not with that pregnancy , " she said .
She said it was important to distinguish between people who oppose abortion and those who want it to be against the law .
" I do realize that a lot of people in this country consider themselves to be pro-life , " she said .
" They also do n't want it to be a crime for a woman to get an abortion . "
Smith , the researcher , suspects the election of President Obama , a pro-choice Democrat , may be one cause of the shift in public opinion .
" Look at the timing , " he said .
" Through October of last year , the findings were consistent , with supporters outnumbering opponents , " he said .
Pew first noticed the change in public opinion in a survey in April , and did a larger study in August to confirm it .
Opponents of abortion feel more strongly about it than supporters of legal access , he said .
" Some people , particularly on the right , have become more entrenched , more certain of their own positions on abortion , " he said .
" Conservative Republicans are more certain about the correctness of their own position and less likely to say they want to see compromise .
They are concerned that Obama will go too far in supporting abortion rights as president , " he said .
" On the left you see some relaxing of views . "
But the survey also found that the number of people who felt passionately about abortion is falling .
About four out of 10 people in the survey could not define Obama 's position on abortion .
" That is an indicator that although opinions have moved , this issue right now is not at the top of the political debate , " Smith said .
But the subject has crept into the battle to reform America 's health care system , with opponents of abortion in both parties determined to prevent federal dollars from funding abortions .
Under the Hyde amendment , federal money currently can be used to pay for abortions only in case of rape , incest and to protect the life of the mother .
There have been at least two abortion - related slayings in the United States this year , one on each side of the debate .
George Tiller , a doctor known for performing abortions , was killed in May .
Tiller was shot in the head at point - blank range on May 31 as services began at Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita , Kansas .
Scott Roeder , a 51 - year - old anti-abortion activist , is charged in Tiller 's killing .
He has pleaded not guilty .
Anti-abortion activist Jim Pouillon , 63 , was shot dead outside a school in Owosso , Michigan , on September 11 .
He was associated with Benham 's Operation Save America .
Harlan James Drake , 33 , is accused of shooting him and another man in separate locations that day .
Authorities do not believe that Drake knew Pouillon ; only that he was offended by anti-abortion material that Pouillon had displayed across from the school all week , according to Sara Edwards of the Shiawassee County prosecutor 's office .
The Supreme Court , the country 's main legal battleground on abortion , has ruled only once on the hot - button subject since 1992 , in a close 2007 decision that upheld federal restrictions on a controversial late - term abortion procedure called " partial birth abortion " by its opponents .
Judge Sonia Sotomayor , then a federal appeals court judge , deflected questions about abortion this summer when she faced Senate confirmation hearings for a seat on the Supreme Court .
She was confirmed .
The court has not announced any abortion - related cases on its 2009 - 2010 docket .
The 1973 Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade effectively legalized abortion in the United States .
In 2005 , 1.21 million abortions were performed , down from 1.31 million in 2000 , according to data compiled by the Alan Guttmacher Institute , which aims to " advance sexual and reproductive health worldwide through research , policy analysis and education . "
About 2 percent of American women age 15 - 44 had an abortion in 2005 , the latest year for which the institute has information .
The rate has been falling gradually since 1981 , when it peaked at just under 3 percent , institute figures show .
The new findings come from a telephone survey of more than 4,000 adults in August 2009 , conducted by the Washington - based Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life and the Pew Research Center for The People & The Press .
CNN Supreme Court producer Bill Mears contributed to this report .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The National Organization for Women has sharply criticized comedian David Letterman , accusing him of promoting a hostile , uncomfortable work environment .
David Letterman 's behavior with employees has created " a toxic environment " in the workplace , NOW says .
" The latest Letterman controversy sheds new light on the widespread objectification of women in the workplace , " NOW said in a statement Tuesday .
" Most women can attest to the fact that many workplaces are plagued with inappropriate behavior by men in power . "
The " Late Show With David Letterman " host admitted last week on his CBS program that he had sex with unnamed employees and had testified about those liaisons before a New York grand jury as part of an alleged extortion attempt .
A CBS producer , Robert " Joe " Halderman , is accused of threatening to go public with embarrassing information about Letterman 's private life unless the 62 - year - old funnyman ponied up $ 2 million .
Watch NOW 's president slam Letteman , CBS »
Letterman made a public apology Monday to his wife , Regina Lasko , who , he said , had been " horribly hurt by my behavior . "
He said he is trying to repair that relationship .
" Either you 're going to make some progress and get it fixed , or you 're going to fall short and perhaps not get it fixed , so let me tell you folks , I got my work cut out for me , " Letterman told the audience Monday night .
Letterman married Lasko in March , and they have a 5 - year - old son together .
All the affairs took place before the marriage , Letterman 's production company has said .
One of the women who engaged in a sexual relationship with Letterman was identified as Stephanie Birkitt , an assistant to the talk show host and also a former live - in girlfriend of Halderman .
Letterman spokesman Tom Keaney said that Birkitt is on a paid leave of absence from the show .
NOW said Letterman 's behavior was inappropriate in the workplace , saying all employees should be respected for their talent and skills .
" Recent developments in the David Letterman extortion controversy have raised serious issues about the abuse of power leading to an inappropriate , if not hostile , workplace environment for women and employees , " NOW said in Tuesday 's statement .
Men such as Letterman make decisions on hiring and firing , who gets raises , who advances and who does entry - level tasks , NOW said .
" As ' the boss , ' he is responsible for setting the tone for his entire workplace -- and he did that with sex .
In any work environment , this places all employees -- including employees who happen to be women -- in an awkward , confusing and demoralizing situation , " the group said .
" The National Organization for Women calls on CBS to recognize that Letterman 's behavior creates a toxic environment and to take action immediately to rectify this situation .
With just two women on CBS ' board of directors , we 're not holding our breath . "
Those board members are Shari Redstone , vice chairwoman of the board and president of National Amusements Inc. , which operates motion picture screens , and Linda Griego , president and chief executive of Griego Enterprises Inc. , a business management company .
CBS airs " Late Show With David Letterman , " which Letterman 's company , Worldwide Pants Inc. , produces .

Belgian Grand Prix venue Spa Francorchamps has been reopened following the suspension of a ruling which temporarily closed the circuit because of noise complaints , AUTOSPORT understands .
The track was briefly closed in response to complaints raised by a not - for - profit anti-noise organisation whose name literally translates as ' the quiet ones ' .
Although the group originally lodged its objection in 2007 , the local authorities did not take action until this week , when a 17 - year closure order was imposed .
However , following a meeting of government officials , sources have said that the closure of the circuit has been called off pending further legal discussions to take place next week following Spa 's decision to appeal against the decision .
This means that this weekend 's blue riband Spa Six Hours historic event can go ahead , although a lasting solution to the noise disputes still needs to be found .
Circuit boss Pierre - Alain
Thibaut admitted in an interview with Belgium 's Le Soir that the situation " calls the whole viability of the track into question " , but added that since the original complaints were made the track has made significant developments in reducing the environmental impact of its activities .
" Since the complaint was made , the situation has changed , " said Thibaut .
" The track has worked hard to reduce noise pollution and our relationship with local residents has been much improved . "
Sources at Spa claim that the track complies with the stipulated noise limits , and are hopeful that the situation will not threaten the long - term future of the circuit .
BIRMINGHAM , Ala . --
The Southeastern Conference has suspended officials from last weekend 's Arkansas - Florida game after the crew was involved in its second controversial call of the year .
Referee Marc Curles ' crew called a personal foul on Arkansas defensive lineman Malcolm Sheppard in the fourth quarter as the Gators were rallying for a 23 - 20 victory .
The league said there was no video evidence to support the call .
The same group of officials called the LSU - Georgia game earlier this month , which included a late unsportsmanlike conduct penalty the league said should n't have been called .
" A series of calls that have occurred during the last several weeks have not been to the standard that we expect from our officiating crews , " SEC commissioner Mike Slive said Wednesday .
" I believe our officiating program is the best in the country .
However , there are times when these actions must be taken . "
SEC associate commissioner Charles Bloom said this is the first time the league has publicly suspended a football crew like this .
The SEC says the crew will be removed from its next scheduled assignment Oct. 31 and will not be assigned to officiate as a crew until Nov. 14 .
The league said the crew 's bowl assignments could also be impacted .
" The entire crew shoulders responsibility for each play .
I have taken this action because there must be accountability in our officiating program , " Slive said .
" Our institutions expect the highest level of officiating in all of our sports and it is the duty of the conference office to uphold that expectation . "
Arkansas coach Bobby Petrino said in a statement : " We took the appropriate steps to address any issues we had with the league regarding this matter earlier in the week .
Our focus as a football team has been and remains on this weekend 's game against Ole Miss . "
Fear of dangerous strangers is keeping our kids and teens from using their neighborhood playgrounds and parks .
Instead , they stay inside and play virtual table tennis on their Nintendo Wii .
It ’s not the same thing .
Researchers in the Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation at the University of Alberta , looked at perceived opportunities and barriers to physical activity in an inner-city neighbourhood in Edmonton .
Study data revealed three themes that influenced youngsters ’ opportunities for physical activity , with positive and negative factors for each .
The first theme identified was “ neighbourhood characteristics . ”
Positive neighborhood characteristics include “ walkable ” neighborhoods with plenty of parks and playgrounds and nearby amenities .
Negative neighborhood characteristics include perceived “ stranger danger ” fears related to drug users , bullies , prostitutes , gang members and fear of abduction deterred children and youth from visiting these places .
The second theme was “ family involvement . ”
Researchers found that while children and youth were rarely allowed out alone , involvement by a family member , for example , accompanying them to a park to play , increased their engagement in physical activity .
The third theme was the “ availability of adult - supervised programs . ”
On the positive side , we have neighborhoods with a large variety of programs offered by dedicated , hard - working staff and volunteers .
Conversely , neighborhoods with minimal resources ; poor staff and volunteer recruitment and retention , and little public knowledge of program availability suffered badly .
Even when kids did sign up for available programs , there was a high dropout rate .
Conclusion
If we want our kids to grow up fit and strong and healthy , we need to :
Take back our neighborhood parks & playgrounds ( easier said than done )
Get involved with our kids ’ lives … not just drop them off at the rec center Push our governments for more public fitness programs

Mr Parkes was leaving Superstar Boudoir when he was attacked Six boys arrested after a homophobic attack on an off - duty trainee police officer outside a gay bar in Merseyside have been bailed .
James Parkes , 22 , was set upon by a group of up to 20 people on Stanley Street on Sunday night .
Four boys aged 15 , one 17 and one 14 , were held on suspicion of assault .
Mr Parkes is in hospital with multiple skull fractures and other injuries .
He was attacked as he left Superstar Boudoir in Liverpool city centre .
Detectives have been reviewing CCTV footage of the area , which has been sealed - off .
Det Ch Insp Tim Keelan , who has appealed for witnesses to come forward , said : " We are treating the assault as a homophobic hate crime and this incident shows there are still some people who have not learnt that crimes of this type are completely unacceptable .
" People who commit hate crimes can expect the full attention of the police and we will not rest until the offenders are brought to justice . "
Abuse ' escalates '
Mr Parkes , who is openly gay , was with his partner and another man and a woman when he was attacked .
One of his companions was punched in the face .
The trainee was a police community support officer until earlier this year and was in the middle of training to become a full police officer by early 2010 .
Stanley Street is popular with Liverpool 's gay community High- visibility police patrols have been stepped up in the area where he was attacked .
Derek Munn , of gay rights charity Stonewall , said that despite some good work by police , attacks on gay and lesbian people were on the increase in Britain 's towns and cities .
" It 's true that there has been a significant increase in the way police and the criminal justice system take homophobic hate crime seriously - and that 's good , " said Mr Munn .
" But we know from our own research funded by the Home Office that one in five lesbian and gay people experienced a hate incident in the last three years , but three in four of them did n't bother to report . "
Mr Munn said problems often began with abuse in the street , which often went unreported , before escalating into violent attacks .
" If it ( abuse ) is not dealt with you can end up with the situation where young men in certain towns and cities in Britain clearly think it 's acceptable to beat people up critically just because they think they 're gay . "

A man who was arrested after he shone a torch at an Apache attack helicopter flying " 10 ft " above his garden will not be charged , police have said .
Torben Merriott , 63 , of Stradbroke , Suffolk , was arrested on " suspicion of " acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft " on 18 September .
Police said Mr Merriott had been released from his bail conditions and no further action would be taken .
Mr Merriott said the experience had been " demeaning and humiliating " .
Mr Merriott , who runs a stage lighting firm , criticised police for being " heavy - handed " and " wasting resources " .
He said he might complain .
' Felt vibrations '
He said he was awoken by an " almighty noise and vibration " at 0100 BST on 18 September .
" My first reaction was that it was an earthquake , " he said .
" It was a clear night but pitch black and I could feel the vibrations beating against my chest - very frightening .
" That was when I realised it must be a helicopter really low and very close .
I could n't see any navigation lights from the direction of the noise so I shone my torch . "
Mr Merriott said he found it hard to be believe the pilot would have lost control in the face of his torch .
" Do n't tell the Taliban that all they need is a 10 - quid torch to bring down some of our finest young fliers in their multi-million pound , high - tech gunships , " he said .
The Ministry of Defence said the shining of any kind of light at a helicopter was dangerous because pilots could be dazzled .
Was it Kim Jong -il ?
Or was it a fake North Korean leader that entertained Bill Clinton on that mission to Pyongyang to retrieve the two imprisoned American journalists ?
In the absence of fact , the Hermit Kingdom has long been a free - fire zone for outlandish rumour .
And they got more outlandish than ever after Mr Kim reputedly suffered a stroke in August 2008 .
Mr Kim was variously said to be close to death , about to be toppled by a coup , or desperately fixing the succession for his youngest son .
Or was he really someone else ?
The mainstay of the Kim - is - fake cottage industry is a Japanese university professor called Toshimitsu Shigemura , who once claimed that the real Mr Kim died in 2003 , and that everything since has been make - believe .
One Mr Kim , he maintains , even flatly confessed to a Japanese visitor , " I am a double . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Clinton visit in August had Mr Shigemura 's alarm bells ringing again , when the former President was pictured alongside a far healthier looking Mr Kim than the wan and feeble Great Leader seen after North Korea test - fired a long range missile on April 5 2009 .
" They were totally different people , " Mr Shigemura asserted to the Christian Science Monitor this week .
Most experts can't quite believe the North would have sent out a bogus Kim to spend more than three hours in Mr Clinton 's company , including what the North 's official media called 75 minutes of " exhaustive " private talks .
But evidence that he sometimes uses doubles is strong .
Did the man who reportedly had a stroke 14 months ago really make 122 visits this year to factories , state - run farms , military bases and the rest , as logged by the media – to prove , presumably , that Mr Kim was alive , well and very much in charge ?
A double , or doubles , are " possible " , Choi Jin-Wook , a specialist at the Korea Institute of National Reunification told the Monitor .
" These dictators always need lookalikes for national security reasons .
Kim Jong - il is giving ' on the spot guidance ' too often for his health . "
Fakery moreover is nothing new for totalitarian regimes .
The Soviet Union was doctoring photos from its very earliest days .
Saddam Hussein is known to have made much use of doubles ; so too , it is said ( albeit on somewhat flimsier evidence ) , did Hitler and Stalin .
And was it not once rumoured that Paul McCartney has been played by an impersonator ever since he " died " in 1986 ?
In fiction , even the US is not immune .
In the 1993 hit movie Dave a temp agency manager who happens to be a doppelganger of the US President is drafted into the job by a scheming White House aide when the real president has a stroke .
So might Bill Clinton not really have been Bill Clinton ?
And what ruler would not use doubles on occasion if he or she had the chance ?
Who wants to attend the boring factory ribbon - cuttings and dreary conferences a democratically elected leader must endure ?
How nice to be able to send a lookalike and focus on things that really matter , like grooming one 's son as successor .
A conversation with Do No Harm Producer / Director Rebecca Shanberg
" Whistleblowers ... are absolutely essential to Congress doing its job of oversight ...
All of Congress could n't hire enough staff to know where of the skeletons are buried ...
We need whistleblowers ... like Rehberg and Bognato [ who ] are the best of people because they 're willing to put everything on the line . "
Do No Harm
One of my best friends from college was working for Kekst , the crisis PR firm that Dick Scruggs [ class action lawyer who took on the tobacco industry ] hired to help publicize his class action lawsuits against the non-profit hospitals .
She started telling me about the work that they were doing , and about the two whistleblowers , and I was fascinated .
Over the next two months , she came back to Chicago and I was hooked .
We set up a meeting in the Atlanta airport and that 's how it all started .
It was with Charles Rehberg , John Bagnato , and two attorneys who were a part of the national class action law team - David Merideth and John Crongeyer .
Yes , this was the first time I had worked with them .
What initially struck me was how much information they had amassed and how it had never been put together in this way before .
They showed us a PowerPoint presentation in the Atlanta airport that was mind - blowing - and they were just two guys who stumbled into this because they were trying to figure out why their hospital was so protective of its territory .
From the
website : Bagnato and Rehberg uncovered millions of dollars in offshore bank accounts and lucrative for - profit businesses under the control of Phoebe Putney Hospital .
Board members held exclusive contracts with the hospital and politicians received timely contributions , under shockingly legal practices .
idea of what would ultimately happen
No - we had no idea - we thought that the hospital would make things difficult for Charles and John , but we never imagined that they would end up being indicted .
It just kept shocking us - one thing after another .
The day after John and Charles were indicted , we were in Georgia and it was terrible to see what it was doing to Charles ' family .
There is a lot the did n't make it into the film about the indictments - it was a very drawn - out process and exhausting for Charles and John .
John and Charles both said at the time ( and in the film ) that they thought the hospital wanted to prevent anyone else from speaking out against them .
In some ways , if that was their purpose , they succeeded .
Many people in Albany told us that they were afraid of speaking out because of what might happen to them .
Both were indicted on charges of assault , a felony .
If [ they were ] convicted , it would result in the loss of John 's medical license and make it virtually impossible for Charles to practice as an accountant .
The charges were false - they were never actually at the meeting in question , and , no assault took place - as was proven by a tape made at the scene .
Their families felt the pressure as well , as they describe in the film , and that took a toll on John and Charles .
John was forced to leave his practice because he could no longer practice at Phoebe , and Charles went through a time of enormous stress , worried that his countersuit against Phoebe would bankrupt him .
I 'm not a policy expert , so I think they best way to answer your question is to share some thoughts on the story put together by one of our incredible partners , The Access Project .
I hope this works !
is a must see for anyone concerned with excessive health care costs or accountability .
It exposes the lack of a rational pricing system or transparency in hospital billing and collection practices .
In the current economic environment , American tax payers need assurances that tax - exempt hospitals are , in fact , doing no harm especially for patients who are uninsured or underinsured .
This riveting account of excessive practices at one non-profit hospital in Georgia is sure to inspire people to take action and demand more oversight and accountability from hospitals that are receiving federal funding to meet community need . "

Mr Bush 's wars in Afghanistan and Iraq provoked widespread criticism , and his steering of the US economy drew censure .
But he is likely to be paid around $ 100,000 ( £ 61,000 ) for a 40 - minute speech on his experiences as leader of the free world - so he may yet have the last laugh .
Chills win as the “ Paranormal ” phenomenon grows
It was a weekend of surprises at the box office .
The most pleasant for those of us who prefer a chill up the spine to a gag reflex was the outstanding performance of “ Paranormal Activity , ” which handily defeated the dismemberment sweepstakes of “ Saw VI ” despite being in over a thousand fewer theaters than its horrific competitor .
As documented by Carl DiOrio of The Hollywood Reporter and the bean counters of Box Office Mojo , Paramount ’s extremely wise ultra - ultra - ultra - low - budget paranormal pick - up earned an estimated $ 22 million as it expanded to 1,945 screens this week with a outstanding per screen average of $ 11,321 .
That ’s compared to an estimated $ 14.8 million for the latest “ Saw ” entry ( two more are still scheduled , including the inevitable 3 - D installment ) with a per screen average of $ 4,875 , less than half of its spooky competitor .
The irony in all this is that , now that critics have had to paid their shekels to see the unscreened “ Saw VI , ” not only has it gotten better reviews than the last few entries — which is , of course , not the same thing as getting good reviews — it turns out to have at least an attempt at political content with a plot that involves both the sub - prime mortgage and health care debacles .
Seems to me that Lions Gate really had nothing to lose by screening this for critics and the political angle might have generated a bit more interest .
“ ‘ Sicko ‘ for real sickos !
‘ Capitalism : A Hate Story ’!
says Geekboy Moonraker of ‘ Ain’t it Bloody Disgusting ' ” might have at least captured a bit more attention .
Though , reading Owen Gleiberman ‘s highly negative review , it ’s interesting to note that both “ Zombieland ” and “ Saw VI ” do call attention to our nation ’s obesity epidemic .
While we ’re talking horror , just a quick side note that the week ’s highest per-screen average was Lars von Trier ’s infamously graphic , though artistic , wave of mutilation , “ Antichrist . ”
The Cannes controversy - starter earned an estimated average of $ 12,250 on six screens in its first week .
Presumably , this one is going for the kind of earnings of a good old - fashioned succès de scandale .
Warner ’s “ Where the Wild Things Are ” came in at # 3 , dropping a somewhat more than expected 55.9 % with an estimated $ 14.42 million .
That ’s actually holding a bit better than I expected , given the film ’s somewhat arty approach and slightly muted reviews .
Meanwhile , the critically dissed “ Law Abiding Citizen ” from Overture and “ Couples Retreat , ” a much needed fiscal bright spot for Universal , seem to have their fans .
Both are holding rather well and collecting roughly $ 12.7 and $ 11.1 million respectively .
Way under - performing , however , was Summit ’s CGI animation version of Osamu Tezuka ’s “ Astro Boy . ”
A lot of people are calling the film underrated and our Jason Zingale seemed pretty fond of it as well , but the usual family audience simply failed to show .
The result was a horrible sixth place showing for the $ 65 million budgeted family film on its opening weekend , with an estimated take of only just over $ 7 million .
This might be just my own pro-retro tendencies overriding whatever common sense there is the Hollywood conventional wisdom , but I really wonder if the film might have done better with traditional 2 - D animation .
I certainly prefer the look of the original television series in all it ’s black and white glory to the less appealing character designs — to me , anyway — in the new version .
I ’d argue there ’s still a place in the world for old - style animation , and this may be Exhibit A .
You ’d certainly never see the gang at Pixar visually mutilating an anime classic in this way .
( John Lasseter is , of course , one of the strongest advocates around of keeping 2 - D. )
Less of a surprise was the poor performance of “ Cirque du Freak : The Vampire ’s Assistant , ” which pretty much had box office doom written all over it .
With an estimate of under $ 6.35 in over 2,700 theaters on its opening weekend , it ’s a another blow to the struggling Universal .
Doing a bit better in terms of per-screen averages is the week ’s other new semi-major release , “ Amelia . ”
The biopic starring Hillary Swank about the legendarily disappeared flyer , Amelia Earhart , brought in just over $ 4 million with a just under $ 5,000 per screen average .
It might not be onward and upward , however .
The small problem is that no one seems to like this movie very much , certainly not our own David Medsker .
If , as were we were told on Friday , Fox Searchlight really is expecting awards buzz and good word of mouth to significantly bolster the $ 40 million flying flick , they ’re far higher than poor Ms. Earhart ever got .
In one of the busiest shopping districts in Long Beach , Calif. , bicyclists are kings of the road in an experiment that turns frustrated motorists into serfs .
The seaside city south of Los Angeles is encouraging bikers to get right in front of cars .
It painted a 5 - foot - wide green stripe down the middle of one of the two lanes in either direction of the Belmont Shore section of the city .
Even though cars were whizzing by at 30 miles an hour yesterday , bikes were free to ride right in their path .
PREVIOUSLY ON DRIVE ON : Have bicyclists ' " rights " gone too far ?
ON DRIVE ON'S FORUM : Can you identify Mystery Car 6 ?
Some locals are livid about the experiment , which began in June .
" It 's stupid .
I ca n't even believe it , " said John Cameron , who has lived in the area for 50 years .
" To put them out in traffic is just stupid . "
It 's slowing down traffic and putting bikers in harm 's way , Cameron said , adding that he rides a bike himself , but he says he always stays to the right .
Long Beach is leading the pack as bikers assert more " rights " around the country :
Drive
On came to Long Beach to check out the bike vs. car feud after we reported last week how more bicyclists are riding directly in the path of cars , instead of on the shoulder or to the right of the road .
Bikers say it 's sometimes unsafe to ride at the far right side of the road .
But it in Maryland recently , center - of - the - road biking led to a death , a bicyclist killed by the car of a driver on the way to work one morning .
By installing the lane and other bike lanes around the city , Long Beach is trying to become a bike - friendly city .
The Press - Telegram , the leading newspaper in the city , reported that the city has won $ 11 million in federal funds to create bike lanes and other improvements .
It has the nation 's first Bike Station downtown , where commuters leave their bikes to take public transportation .
One of the city 's leading bike advocates , John Case , stands behind the experiment .
" The green bike lane basically makes a statement to all car drivers in Long Beach that ( the ) vision embraced by the city council to be the most bike friendliest urban city in the USA means there will be changes in the urban street scheme to accommodate and encourage urban bike commuting , " Case says .
But the green stripe through Belmont Shore rankles many .
Barber Mike Schafer , whose shop gives him a front - row seat to the bike action in Second Street outside , says the green lane is causing a lot of trouble .
Bikers on beach cruisers are meandering along in the center of the lane , disregarding honking horns of the drivers being held up for blocks behind them , he says .
One of them " just gave us ' the bird . ' "
For the bikers , " there should be signs saying ' Keep up with traffic . ' "
Bicycle advocates say bikers in the center of the lane helps slow down traffic .
But cars vastly outnumber bikes .
Second Street can get 40,000 cars a day , compared to an average of 400 bikes a day when traffic was checked earlier this year , the Press - Telegram reported .
About a dozen stoplights are only about 500 feet apart in the area , filled with bars and restaurants that make bikes convenient for getting around .
Jeweler Dave Mancia says his customers are divided -- bikers like it and motorists hate it .
And for him ?
" It 's good but it can be dangerous , " he says .
He says he sticks to riding his bike in the alleys that parallel the thoroughfare .

There is a booming market developing in Real Estate called the short sale .
An out product of untrustworthy loan granting , liberal equity loans , a decrease in real estate values , and a sluggish job market , many people are stuck in houses they can no longer afford to keep .
In essence , their loan is more than the value of their house .
They feel stuck between the rock ( aka the bank ) and a hard place ( aka their finances ) .
The solution is called a short sale .
The term “ short ” does not mean quick or less time .
It means “ short ” as in less money .
For one reason or another , the bank is not going to recoup the amount of the loan on a sale .
That is a given .
It is going to come up short .
The last thing a bank wants is another foreclosure .
They do not want the hassle of putting the property on the auction block and getting pennies on the dollar .
They can not afford to assume that much loss over and over again .
The bank officers know this and their desire is to get rid of these problematic properties as fast as possible .
A short sale , or agreeing to say two - thirds of what is owed is a viable solution .
If someone owes you a $ 100 , would n’t you prefer to get back $ 75 or $ 80 now and walk away than to wait for months and then only get back $ 25 ?
Of course you would , especially if you had loaned twenty or thirty folks each $ 100 .
That is the way banks see the situation as well .
With so many foreclosures being plopped on their doorsteps , the bank officers would relish the thought of accepting payment in full upfront on a short sale .
In fact , short sale is the preferred method used by banks to liquidate property
The amount of foreclosures and pre-foreclosures are on the rise at an alarming rate .
It is not going to slow down anytime soon .
Now is the time for a savvy investor to step in , negotiate short sales , fix up and flip houses .
If you can get a once valued at $ 400 k house for a short sale price of $ 309 K , put in $ 15 K of repairs and sell it for $ 370 K , thus making a $ 46 K profit , would you do it ?
Oxford University has slipped in the ­international league table of the world 's top universities - in a study which shows the advance of academia in Asia that will soon pose a challenge to the Ivy League and Oxbridge .
The study , from Times Higher Education and QS Top Universities shows that overall the UK still punches above its weight , second only to the US .
The UK has four out of the top 10 slots and 18 in the top 100 .
But there has been a significant fall in the number of North American universities in the top 100 , from 42 in 2008 to 36 in 2009 .
However , the number of Asian universities in the top 100 increased from 14 to 16 .
The University of Tokyo , at 22 , is the highest ranked Asian university , ahead of the University of Hong Kong at 24 .

Argentina to decriminalize personal marijuana use
Argentina became the second Latin American country this week , after Mexico , to make a major step toward drug legalization after a decision by the country ’s supreme court :
The judges say the government should go after major traffickers and provide treatment to consumers , not jail .
The court struck down a law providing for up to two years in prison for possession of small amounts of narcotics .
The case involved several young men caught with marijuana cigarettes in their pockets .
The decision does n’t legalize drug possession outright .
But Argentina ’s Cabinet chief favors decriminalizing drug consumption , and was waiting for Tuesday ’s ruling before forwarding a proposed law to Congress .
President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has called for decriminalization as well .
With Brazil and Ecuardor considering similar measures , Latin America seems to be going through a major rethink on drug policy .
This year ’s report by the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy , which was chaired by three former regional presidents and included my boss , may have been a big factor as well .
What effect this will have on the drug debate north of the border remains to be seen .
U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske has taken a " wait - and - see attitude " toward Mexico ’s decriminalization .
Despite the developments in Latin America , the Obama adminsitration probably is n’t going to touch drug policy right now given everything else on the agenda , ( not that this has stopped Barney Frank . ) but it does feel like there ’s a shift going on in the global debate .

Fisker Automotive has responded to the false news reports about its recent loan from the U.S. Department of Energy .
As a brief refresher , below is a clip of the Fox News coverage , thanks to Media Matters :
Fisker Automotive CEO Henrik Fisker writes :
—
American automaker Fisker Automotive was recently approved for a conditional loan of $ 528 million by the Department of Energy ( DOE ) .
While news reports were mostly factual , some ignored or marginalized the truth , or sensationalized irrelevant aspects of the loan and our company .
Fisker Automotive would like to present the facts .
Fisker Automotive is an American car company based in Irvine , California .
The company ’s goals are to help restore the U.S. as a leader in the global auto industry and to eliminate America ’s dependence on foreign oil .
These DOE funds will help Fisker Automotive create or save at least 5,000 U.S. jobs , bring to market affordable , American - made plug - in hybrid vehicles and save more than 821 million gallons of gasoline ( 43.2 million barrels of oil ) by 2016 .
No DOE funding will be used for overseas operations .
Through private funding , and at no cost to taxpayers , the company has already supported hundreds of American jobs by partnering with major auto suppliers to develop the world ’s first production plug - in hybrid car , the Fisker Karma .
This will put the American auto industry ahead of foreign competition .
The Karma has been designed and engineered in the U.S. with the majority ( 65 % by cost ) of its parts sourced from American suppliers .
Fisker Automotive searched for a U.S. plant to assemble the Karma , but none were willing or able to build the 15,000 of these advanced vehicles per year Fisker required .
The low - volume Karma will therefore be assembled in Finland by Valmet Automotive , one of the most respected contract auto builders in the world .
The next generation Karma will be built entirely in the U.S .
The Karma is a technology leader necessary to reduce costs for Project NINA , the development of a more affordable , family - oriented plug - in hybrid vehicle to be made in America at a retooled assembly plant in 2012 .
The resulting vehicle will sell for about $ 39,900 after federal tax credits .
Engineering on Project NINA has already begun .
Fisker Automotive expects to export half its vehicles , the most of any American car company .
As reported by the DOE , $ 169.3 million of the loan will be used by Fisker Automotive as the company works with primarily U.S. suppliers to complete engineering work on the Karma .
This work will be conducted in Pontiac , Michigan and Irvine , California .
The remaining $ 359.36 million will support Project NINA and its manufacture of 75,000 - 100,000 plug - in hybrids per year at a retooled U.S. assembly plant , beginning in 2012 .
The DOE loan is conditional .
In order to receive the funds Fisker Automotive must meet very specific milestones .
Money is disbursed in small amounts only if the company successfully reaches these milestones .
The funds will be repaid , with interest , to the American taxpayer .
Some have asked questions about the cost of the cars .
Any new technology is expensive .
Televisions , cell phones , refrigerators and even cars themselves were once too expensive for most .
In time , however , costs come down .
The same will happen with Fisker ’s plug in hybrid electric vehicles .
The DOE loan to Fisker Automotive represents just two percent of the agency ’s $ 25B Advanced Technologies Manufacturing Loan Program ( ATVMLP ) , created by Congress in November 2008 to help promote the development of energy - efficient , advanced - technology vehicles .
American cars have long been underrepresented in the global marketplace , especially those in premium segments .
The U.S. used to be known for building the most exciting and desirable cars in the world .
It is time America is again at the forefront , and gives buyers the choice to purchase a desirable environmentally friendly car .
When it comes to cars , an environmental strategy is no longer an option , it is a necessity .
With the help of the Department of Energy , Fisker Automotive is taking action and making an investment in the future .
We are immensely proud of what we are doing , and that we are doing it here in America .
It is unfortunate how false information can be disseminated and it is our intention to correct as much of it as possible .
– Henrik Fisker , CEO

Kimi Raikkonen says he is yet to decide if he will continue racing in Formula 1 next year after it was announced he will not be at Ferrari .
The former world champion , who joined Ferrari in 2007 and went on to win the title , will be replaced by Fernando Alonso from next year , despite having a contract that run out at the end of 2010 .
Although Raikkonen has been linked with a return to McLaren , the Finn admitted he is still thinking about whether he wants to race on in F1 or not .
" So far I have not talked too much about what I will do next , as I still have time to make my decision and I will let you know when I have , " Raikkonen said ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix .
" For the moment , I have n't decided what I want to do next , whether I want to continue racing or not .
I had a contract for next year , but now I do n't , so that changes things .
So maybe I race , maybe I do not . "
He said switching to the World Rally Championship was a possibility .
" Yes , there 's a chance to do that , but there 's as much of a chance that I continue in Formula 1 .
I will decide before the start of next year for sure !
If I do decide to stay in Formula 1 , I would n't go to any of the small teams , where I would not have the chance to fight for the championship .
" If I race next year , that would be my goal , otherwise there is no reason to be in Formula 1 .
I achieved what I wanted , but if I race , then of course , I want to win more races and championship titles . "
Raikkonen said there were many factors for his decision to agree to terminate his contract early , and insisted he was pleased with his call .
" There are many reasons why this has happened , " said the Finn ahead of the Japanese GP .
" In F1 , even if you have a contract , there can always be different options in life .
There is not just one reason why this happened and we all reached the same decision .
" I 'm still happy with what I have done in making this decision and I think I will still have a good future .
Usually when you make a contract , you stick with it to the end , but there were reasons why it did not work out , but I 'm okay with how things have turned out . "
He added : " I have nothing bad to say about them as we always had a good relationship .
I do n't think anyone expected Ferrari to have this sort of season , which turned out to be so difficult .
But this can happen in F1 sometimes , when you do n't deliver a car capable of always being at the front , but this is just one year and we will wait and see what happens next .
" I would not have done anything different : of course I would like to win more races , but in terms of decisions about my life , I would not do anything differently to the way I have done it .
I am happy with what I have achieved , even if whenever you look back , you think you might have done things differently , but that 's easy to say when you look back .
" But in terms of contracts and so on , I would not do anything different .
With Ferrari , I have achieved what I set out to do in winning the title .
" We had good times and sometimes more difficult times , but that 's part of this business and you just have to get through those moments .
We won many championships , one for me , two for the team and I have happy memories . "

8.0 - RC2 Available
The second of the Release Candidates for the FreeBSD 8.0 release cycle is now available .
At this point we feel most of what has been discovered during public testing that is feasible to fix as part of the release process has been addressed .
So the current plan is to have 8.0 - RC3 in about two weeks .
Details about the current target schedule along with much more detail about the current status of the release is available here :
http://wiki.freebsd.org/8.0TODO
If you notice problems you can report them through the normal Gnats PR system or on the freebsd - current mailing list .
I do cross-post announcements to freebsd - stable because this particular release is " about to become a stable branch " but when it comes to watching for issues related to the release most of the developers pay more attention to the freebsd - current list .
ISO images for all supported architectures are available on the FTP sites , and a " memory stick " image is available for amd64/i386 architectures .
For amd64/i386 architectures the cdrom and memstick images include the documentation packages but no other packages .
The DVD image includes the packages that will probably be available on the official release media but is subject to change between now and release .
For sparc64 there is now a livefs cdrom , disc1 includes the documentation packages , and the DVD image has the set of packages that currently build for sparc64 ( which is a sub- set of the set provided for amd64/i386 ) .
If you are using csup / cvsup methods to update an older system the branch tag to use is RELENG_8_0 .
The freebsd - update ( 8 ) utility supports binary upgrades of i386 and amd64 systems running earlier FreeBSD releases .
Systems running 7.0 - RELEASE , 7.1-RELEASE , 7.2-RELEASE , 8.0- BETA1 , 8.0 - BETA2 , 8.0- BETA3 , 8.0 - BETA4 , or 8.0 - RC1 can upgrade as follows : # freebsd - update upgrade -r 8.0 - RC2
During this process , FreeBSD
Update may ask the user to help by merging some configuration files or by confirming that the automatically performed merging was done correctly .
Systems running 8.0 - BETA3 may print the warning INDEX - OLD . all : Invalid arguments when downloading updates ; this warning is a harmless bug ( fixed in 8.0 - BETA4 ) and can be safely ignored .
# freebsd - update install
The system must be rebooted with the newly installed kernel before continuing .
# shutdown -r now After rebooting , freebsd - update needs to be run again to install the new userland components : # freebsd - update install

Werelderfgoed
is een typevoorbeeld van Belgische architectuur uit de 17de eeuw .
De huizen waren oorspronkelijk niet in dezelfde stijl gebouwd , omdat er toentertijd geen sprake was van onafhankelijke architecten .
De huizen werden ontworpen door steenhouwers , metselaars , meubelmakers , schilders , beeldhouwers en schrijnwerkers zodat hun beroep het karakter van het huis bepaalde .
De eerste vermelding van de Grote Markt van Brussel vinden we terug in de 11de eeuw toen er openluchtmarkten werden georganiseerd .
In de 13de eeuw werden de , deen hetgebouwd .
In de 14de eeuw werden het stadhuis en de gildenhuizen gebouwd .
Deze laatste waren in hout .
Precies daardoor gingen ze in vlammen op bij de zware beschieting door Franse kanonnen onder leiding van maarschalk de Villeroy in 1695 .
In vijf jaar tijd herbouwden de handelaars de huizen in de stijl die door de gemeenteraad werd goedgekeurd .
Het stadhuis is een staaltje van burgerlijke hoog - gotiekstijl .
Niettegenstaande het gebouw eenzelfde stijl vertoont , was het niet het werk van één architect .
De Belforttoren werd als eerste in 1327 gebouwd .
De bouw van het eigenlijke stadhuis werd toevertrouwd aan Jacob van Thienen .
Tussen1402 en 1421 werd de oostelijke vleugel van het stadhuis gebouwd .
Dat is het huidige stadhuis .
In 1444 volgde de kleinere westelijke vleugel ( eerstesteenlegging door ) .
De oostelijke vleugel met de klokkentoren werd afgewerkt met versierde zuilen , beelden , torentjes en bogen en een reeks van beeldhouwwerken .
Architectverhoogde de oorspronkelijke middeleeuwse belforttoren tot 96 meter tussen 1449 en 1455 .
De toren staat niet in het midden en de ingang staat op haar beurt niet in het midden van de toren .
Bovenop ziet u de patroonsheilige van Brussel , In 1840 werd tot een grote renovatie overgegaan : de hele voorgevel werd versierd met 203 beeldjes van alle hertogen en hertoginnen die Brabant had gekend tussen 580 en 1564 .
In het boogwerk boven de ingangspoort bevinden zich verschillende beelden : Sint - Sebastiaan , Sint - Kristoffel , Sint - Michiel , en de heilige Gorik .
Links van de ingangspoort ziet u de zogenaamde leeuwentrap .
Binnen in het stadhuis zelf bevinden zich 15 de - 16de - 17de - en 18de - eeuwse Brusselse wandtapijten , maar ook gotisch houtsnijwerk en wapenschilden van de gilden .
Hier bevindt zich De Vos : dit huis werd voor het eerst in de 14de eeuw vermeld .
In 1645 werd het in steen heropgebouwd .
Na de verwoesting van 1695 werd het in Lodewijk XIV - stijl heropgebouwd .
Omstreeks 1699 werd het het gildenhuis van de garen - en bandverkopers of reizende kooplieden ( kramers ) .
Boven de ingang vindt u een gouden vos .
De gevelversiering is in Vlaamse barokstijl .
U ziet er onder andere bas - reliefs van kinderen die de functies van de marskramers uitbeelden .
De keuze van kinderen is logisch als je weet datde patroonheilige van de kooplieden was .
De heilige man staat in de nok van het puntdak .
Het nummer 6 heet De Hoorn naar de afbeelding van een hoorn tussen de begane grond en de eerste verdieping .
Het heeft een gevel in Italiaans - Vlaamse stijl .
Het huis werd in 1434 aangekocht en werd het gildenhuis van de schippers ( Brussel was indertijd een eilandje in de Zenne ) .
Niet te verbazen dus dat u op de tweede verdieping vergulde decoraties terugvindt die ankers , touwwerken en zeesterren voorstellen .
Op het nummer 5 vindt u De Wolvin of het huis van de boogschutters : het stamt uit de 14 de eeuw en werd in hout opgetrokken .
In de 17de eeuw werd het aangekocht .
De feniks bovenaan staat symbool voor de geschiedenis van het gebouw : het werd twee keer verwoest ( 1641,1649 ) en telkens heropgebouwd , maar in 1691 werd het door de Franse beschietingen getroffen en brandde het af .
Naast De Wolvin staat Den Sack , een huis met puntgevel .
Dit was het gildenhuis van de kuipers ( tonnenmakers ) en de meubelmakers .
Het werd gebouwd in 1644 en doorstond de bombardementen van 1695 vrij goed .
De twee onderste verdiepingen zijn nog de oorspronkelijke .
Het volgende huis heet In Den Cruywagen .
Hier waren de vettewariërs ( verkopers van vette waren als olie en kaarsen , vetsmelters ) thuis .
De naam van het gebouw wordt tweemaal op de gevel voorgesteld .
Op de hoek van deze huizenrij vindt u Den Coninck van Spagnien .
Op de gevel schittert de gouden buste van Sint - Aubertus , de patroon van de bakkers .
Op de tweede verdieping staat Karel II van Spanje met achter hem Turkse vlaggen en 2 geketende gevangenen , die de macht van de koning aangaven .
Voor deze huizenrij steekt u de Boterstraat over .
Deze huizen werden niet door de gilden gefinancierd waardoor ze de eenvoudigste van de Grote Markt zijn .
Hier vindt u florerende café - restaurants .
De groep begint bij Den Ezel in het nummer 39 .
Den Eyck en t Voske daarnaast zijn twee huizen die onder één dak zijn ondergebracht .
Den
Pauw is het type huis dat destijds door welgestelde burgers werd gebouwd .
Het elegantste huis van deze rij is ongetwijfeld Den Helm , een huis met een puntgevel .
Tussen Den Helm en het Broodhuis loopt de Vlees- en Broodstraat .
Het Broodhuis , dat de oorspronkelijke Broodhalle verving waar bakkers hun brood kwamen verkopen , wordt ook Koning van Spanje genoemd .
Keizer Karel wilde een Broodhuis in gotische stijl .
In 1872 werd het gesloopt , waarna het werd heropgebouwd naar de oorspronkelijke plannen uit 1515 .
Nu is er het museum van Brussel gevestigd : u kan er via kunstwerken de geschiedenis van Brussel ontdekken en u vindt er 400 exemplaren vanmet allerlei soorten klederdracht .
De Haringstraat steekt u over om bij het Ammanskamerke te komen .
Dit is een volkse naam voor het kleine huisje dat een vergelijking maakt met het kleinste kamertje in elk huis waar zelfs de hoogste gezagsdragers af en toe naartoe moeten .
Het huis daarnaast heet De Duif en is een voormalig schildershuis .
Hier woonde ( 1852 ) , die uit eigen land ( Frankrijk ) vluchtte na de Franse staatsgreep van 1851 .
Nu kun je hier de wereldberoemdebewonderen en kopen .
Oorspronkelijk bestond Den Gouden Boot , het huis naast De Duif , uit twee huizen :  De Mol en  Den Gouden Boot .
De kleermakers hadden hier hun vaste plek .
In 1695 maakte de gilde er één gebouw van .
Het huis van de kleermakers : boven de ingangsdeur staat de heilige Barbara , patroonheilige van de kleermakers , en op het puntdak de heilige Bonifacius .
In zijn linkerhand klemt hij een schild met een schaar , het embleem van de kleermakers .
Het volgende huis , Den Engel , werd door dezelfde architect ontworpen en vormt aldus een eenheid met Den Gouden Boot .
Bij Joseph en Anna , twee huizen onder één dak , kunt u heerlijke pralines proeven en kopen .
Godiva zal u zeker niet onbekend in de oren klinken .
Daarnaast bevindt zich Den
Hert dat door een steenhouwer met eigen handen werd gebouwd .
Hij bootste de vroegere houten gevel na .
U steekt de Heuvelstraat over om tot de volgende majestueuze huizenrij te komen die de tweede smalle kant van de Grote Markt opvult .
Eerst is er De Weegschaal waar u een biertje kunt gaan drinken .
Dit huis verzinkt bijna in het niets in vergelijking met het Huis van de Hertogen van Brabant , dat vernoemd wordt de bustes van de hertogen die de sokkels van de zuilen versieren .
Achter de gevel bevinden zich zes gildenhuizen in neoclassicistische stijl ( een vermenging van de Brabantse en Italiaanse stijl ) .
Het complex bestaat uit zes afzonderlijke panden onder één dak .
Vijf ervan werden gefinancierd door gilden .
U ziet een rijk versierd fronton met een allegorie van de vrede die door nijverheid en handel werd tot stand gebracht .
Nu bevinden zich er drank - en spijsgelegenheden .
Rechts van het Huis van de Hertogen bevindt zich De Roem .
Hier debuteerde ooit het beroemde Brusselse ketjein de Brussels Jazz Club .
Het eerste huis heet De Bergh Tabor .
Boven de deur zijn er drie stenen vlaggen verwerkt .
Daarom wordt het in de volksmond au trois couleurs genoemd .
Daarnaast bevindt zich De Roos .
De naam is afkomstig van de familie Van der Rosen , eigenaar in de 15de eeuw .
Een welgestelde Brusselaar kon toen dergelijk huis laten bouwen .
Het nummer 23 , Den Engel , is opgetrokken in neo - klassieke stijl en wordt gekenmerkt door orde , strengheid en eenvoud .
Vroeger prijkte er bovenaan een grote houten engel .
Na de verwoesting aan het einde van de Tweede Wereldoorlog werd de aarstengel Michael geplaatst .
Het Brouwershuis heette in de 13de eeuw  De Hille ( de heuvel ) , daarna  De Gulden Boom .
In de 15de eeuw vergaderden de leerlooiers er , later werden zij vervangen door de behangers .
Na de verwoesting van 1695 werd het door de brouwers heropgebouwd .
Nu is er in het Brouwershuis eenondergebracht , waar u een authentieke brouwerij uit de 18de eeuw kunt bezichtigen met proeverij .
Rechts naast het Brouwershuis vindt u De Zwane met de meest klassieke en barokke gevel van de Grote Markt .
Na de verwoesting van 1695 werd het huis heropgebouwd in Louis XIV - stijl .
Een teken van verzoening naar de man die de bombardementen had uitgevoerd .
Boven de ingang ziet u een afbeelding van een zwaan in polychrome steen .
Hier schrevenenhun ' Communistisch Manifest ' in 1847 .
In 1885 werd hier de Belgische Werkliedenpartij gesticht .
Verderop ligt
De ster op nummer acht .
Het is het kleinste gebouw op de Grote Markt met een illustratie van de naam op het dak .
Het was de werkplaats van de amman , wat afgeleid is van ambt man , een gerechtsofficier van de hertog .
Vanaf het balkon woonde hij de terechtstellingen op de Grote Markt bij .
Hier stierf ook de Brusselse heldin 1388 .
Burgemeesterzorgde ervoor dat het historisch karakter van het gebouw toch bewaard bleef door het huis op palen te laten plaatsen zodat er ruimte genoeg voor passage was .
Als hulde aan de burgemeester kreeg hij een gedenkplaat in de straat die naar hem vernoemd werd .
Aan de zijkant van De Sterre , in de Karel Bulsstraat , vindt u een beeld van Everard Serclaes die gesneuveld zou zijn bij de verdediging van Brussel in de 14de eeuw .
Het beeld werd ontworpen door Julien Dillens .
U vindt er drie bas - reliëfs die roemrijke episodes uit de Brusselse geschiedenis weergeven en waarbij t Serclaes betrokken was .
Velen denken dat het strelen van de bronzen arm van de stervende t Serclaes een jaar van geluk inleidt .
Op 2 december 1998 werd de Grote Markt van Brussel door de Commissie voor het Werelderfgoed van de Unesco op de prestigieuze Werelderfgoedlijst geplaatst .
Ousted President Manuel Zelaya dramatically reappeared in Honduras on Monday , almost three months after being forced out of the country in his pajamas -- sneaking back in and taking refuge in the Brazilian Embassy .
" I am here for the restoration of democracy , " Mr. Zelaya said on Honduran television .
He told local media he wanted to " initiate a national and international dialogue " that would permit his return to power .
A few thousand Zelaya supporters surrounded the embassy in Tegucigalpa , raising fears of violence between his backers and the interim government of President Roberto Micheletti .
Mr. Micheletti's government had vowed to arrest Mr. Zelaya if he returned .
Some of the demonstrators said they would march to the presidential palace on Tuesday to throw out Mr. Micheletti's government and install Mr. Zelaya .
Mr. Micheletti's government had set a Monday curfew from 4 p.m. to 6 a.m. , and later extended the curfew through Tuesday evening .
In a television address , Mr. Micheletti , flanked by his cabinet and Gen. Romeo Vasquez , the Honduran army 's chief of staff , said the Brazilian government should turn over Mr. Zelaya to Honduran authorities so he can face legal charges .
Mr. Micheletti said Mr. Zelaya's " irregular " return did n't change anything , as Mr. Zelaya had been removed from power following a Supreme Court order .

Emma and I enjoyed the novelist Margaret Drabble ’s recent observation that depression is useful “ for stripping off ways of getting through life that prevent you from having to think . ”
“ Happy and buoyant do n’t force you into action on the page , ” Drabble ( pictured , in an earlier era ) told Daphne Merkin .
These kinds of arguments in favor of depression as a creative impetus — not uncommon from writers — tend to be greeted with wariness by mental health practitioners , who typically view depression , and the obsessive rumination that flows from it , as an affliction to be cured , in every case .
Yet some scientists are suggesting that depression — peculiarly prevalent for a mental disorder — is not a malfunction at all , but an evolutionary adaptation , a state of mind which can have debilitating effects , but also promotes highly analytical thinking .
Depressed people , they contend , tend to “ dwell on a complex problem , breaking it down into smaller components , which are considered one at a time . ”
A special depression receptor enhances focus , allowing “ depressive rumination to continue uninterrupted with minimal neuronal damage . ”
Writing speeds the process :
if depressive rumination were harmful , as most clinicians and researchers assume , then bouts of depression should be slower to resolve when people are given interventions that encourage rumination , such as having them write about their strongest thoughts and feelings .
However , the opposite appears to be true .
Several studies have found that expressive writing promotes quicker resolution of depression , and they suggest that this is because depressed people gain insight into their problems .
From this perspective , depression is less a malfunction than “ an intricate , highly organized piece of machinery that performs a specific function . ”
Updated to add : A friend writes ( and I agree ) : “ Did you read Hermione Lee ’s Virginia Woolf ?
She ’s so astute about Woolf ’s mental illness , and makes the point over and over that her depressive episodes got in the way of her work , and then killed her .
I ’m of course reacting to your post !

The key test in mental illness is the effect on day - to - day functioning including employment , study and relationships .
In my practice if a client or relation of a client cannot demonstrate that there is an adverse effect on what is termed “ functioning ” ( I know , very ugly term ) then I do n’t necessarily treat .
If the client requests treatment at that point I do n’t hold it back , but I wo n’t push it .
This is the case with the majority of the people I work with too . ”

Obama declares swine flu a national emergency
President Barack Obama has declared the swine flu outbreak a national emergency
President Barack Obama has declared the swine flu outbreak a national emergency , the White House said today
Obama signed a proclamation that would allow medical officials to bypass certain federal requirements .
' The proclamation enhances the ability of our nation 's medical treatment facilities to handle a surge in H1N1 patients by allowing , as needed , the waiver of certain standard federal requirements on a case - by - case basis , ' a statement said .
Officials described the move as similar to a declaration ahead of a hurricane making landfall .
Swine flu is more widespread now than it 's ever been and has resulted in more than 1,000 U.S. deaths so far .
Health authorities say almost 100 children have died from the flu , known as H1N1 , and 46 states now have widespread flu activity .
The White House said Obama signed the declaration on Friday evening .
About 148,000 people were injured during the four years Just over 85,000 Iraqis were killed in Iraq between 2004 and 2008 , according to the first estimate from the Iraqi government since the war began .
The figure is based on death certificates issued by the ministry of health and included 15,000 unidentified bodies .
It counts violent deaths of military , police and civilians , but does not include foreigners or insurgents .
Previous attempts to calculate the number of dead have been controversial .
Past reports have used a number of different methods to produce estimates ranging from more than 100,000 to well over half a million deaths since 2003 .
The Ministry of Human Rights included the figure in a larger report into human rights in the country .
' Terrible figures '
It does not include the first months of the war after the 2003 US - led invasion , as there was no functioning Iraqi government at that time to keep track .
" Through the terrorist attacks like explosions , assassinations , kidnappings and forced displacements , the outlawed groups have created these terrible figures which represent a big challenge for the rule of law and for the Iraqi people , " it said .
Among the deaths were 1,279 children , 2,334 women , 263 university professors , 21 judges , 95 lawyers and 269 journalists .
The data covers only violent deaths , such as people killed in shootings , bombings , mortar attacks and beheadings .
It does not include indirect factors such as damage to infrastructure , health care and stress that contributed to more deaths .
About 148,000 people were injured during the same period .
The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Baghdad says the numbers may be staggering but they are relatively conservative .
Advocates for and against the invasion have accused each other of manipulating the figures to suit their own political ends , our correspondent adds .
The reality is that , amid the chaos and violence that followed the invasion , the true number may never be known .
The most recent numbers from Iraq Body Count , a non-governmental organisation that has tracked civilian casualties since the war began , puts the number of fatalities at 93,540 .

Talking Heads was already a post - punk powerhouse before Jonathan Demme ’s fabled 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense helped make the band a pop-culture legend .
Now the movie can be experienced with heightened visual clarity and auditory bliss , thanks to Tuesday ’s release of the film ’s 25th - anniversary edition on Blu-ray .
That timely release will give Talking Heads loyalists and latecomers alike a chance to answer a question that ’s been burning down the house :
Is Stop Making Sense the greatest concert film ever ?
Stop Making Sense caught Talking Heads at the apex of its second life , guitarist Jerry Harrison explains in the exclusive clip above of a previously unseen press conference conducted by the band in 1999 during the film ’s theatrical re-release .
The clip appears as an extra on the Blu-ray edition of the movie .
“ I thought that Fear of Music , you might say , completed the earlier vision of the band , ” he says , referring to the band ’s third studio album .
“ Remain in Light was the beginning of a new vision . ”
That vision was greatly enhanced by Demme ’s film , where the Heads ’ rebooted polyrhythmic funk — previously found on studio classics like 1980 ’s Remain in Light and 1983 ’s Speaking in Tongues — was performed live in Hollywood before an ecstatic audience stripped entirely out of the picture .
Instead , Demme foregrounded the core group of Harrison , vocalist David Byrne , bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz , as well as a smoking backup section composed mostly of graduates from George Clinton ’s Parliament - Funkadelic mothership .
Eschewing trendy MTV jump - cuts for beautifully long takes and featuring the suggestive title sequences of Pablo Ferro ( who worked on Stanley Kubrick ’s Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange ) , Stop Making Sense was a celebration of music and art writ large .
In a giant suit , if you will .
“ That you could throw something completely new at an audience , and they would accept it , ” Byrne adds in the clip , “ that for me was an incredible feeling . ”
The high - def Blu-ray edition , released by Palm Pictures , piles on much more of the new beyond that one - hour press conference .
Also on board are bonus performances of “ Cities ” and “ Big Business / I Zimbra , ” as well as new audio commentary from all the Heads and director Demme .
There is also a storyboard - to - film comparison , the insanely hilarious video short “ David Byrne Interviews … David Byrne ” ( viewable at right ) and more .
The only thing left to be settled is whether Stop Making Sense is the finest concert film ever made , rather than just one of the best ( as critic Leonard Maltin argued upon its release ) .
The movie faces tough competition from D.A. Pennebaker ’s Dont Look Back , which chronicled Bob Dylan ’s 1965 U.K. tour , as well as Gimme Shelter , which captured not just the Rolling Stones Altamont Speedway concert but also the cultural death of hippie idealism , thanks to crowd violence ending in a fatal stabbing of a gun-toting man by a member of the Hells Angels , who provided security for the concert .
( Whoever came up with that idea must surely have eaten the brown acid . )
One can only imagine if that clumsy film could have been improved by integrating footage from a young George Lucas , whose camera reportedly jammed while filming .
Other concert - film favorites are similarly problematic .
Woodstock ‘s maddening split screens suck a lot of life out of some of the most legendary performances of all time .
Similarly , the dream sequences of Led Zeppelin ’s The Song Remains the Same skew the film strange , and sometimes silly .
All these and more are heavy competition for Demme ’s classic .
So you make the call : Does Stop Making
Sense sit atop the pile of fine films capturing an artist or band at its peak performance ?

[ It seems to have gone through nearly as many name alterations as the Sugababes have line - up changes .
It ’s the sequel to RPS - championed Russian existentialist minor classic Pathologic , the game Walker described as Oblivion with cancer .
It ’s finally translated to English .
It ’s time to send the man who Butchered Pathologic to see Wot He Thinks of The Void … ]
A year and a half ago I wrote an article on RPS talking about how Pathologic was the most important game you never played .
Lots of you went out and bought it , and I appreciate that , but most of you reported back that you could n’t stomach it and dropped out after an hour or three of play .
Next month developers Ice - Pick Lodge release their next game , The Void , in English .
This time , the translation is a fine piece of work .
This time the game is much smoother , easier ride .
This is an article devoted to why The Void is the most important game you are GOING TO FUCKING PLAY .
You hear me ?
Let ’s GO .
The Void !
Is !
A game where you play a soul who finds themselves in an afterlife with no memory of the person they once were .
We all have our hopes , fears and preconceptions of what the afterlife is meant to be like .
The Void takes all of these in both arms and fumbles them into a bin , preferring instead to deploy all of Ice - Pick Lodge ’s imagination and creativity in creating something fantastical , the likes of which we ’ve never seen before .
In other words , a place that ’s actually worth exploring .
Desolation is the word , and the word is whispered .
If an area is n’t blasted and blackened then it ’s been twisted into a useless shape , and everywhere is still and sterile as a full moon .
To call a game eerily beautiful is fast becoming a cliché so I ’m going to sidestep that , but I will say that the Void musters up both the ugliest and most beautiful imagery I ’ve seen all year .
The sound design lurking behind these barren vistas is similarly haunting .
Percussion is slow and aimless , voices are never raised , but sometimes seem too loud .
There is dripping , clunking , grinding .
And in those few areas where the soundtrack does become excitable it seems to have no idea what to do with itself , always repeating or giving birth to confused - sounding solos .
A recurring theme in the Void is hunger , and that has a hand in the way areas are designed .
At the very least an area will hint at bare cupboards , while most regions appear either farmed into oblivion or torn apart by some omnipotent brutalist in search of sustenance .
Your own character , your soul , must constantly be fed if you want to survive .
Likewise , passive NPCs must be fed if you want to progress , hostile NPCs roam the Void consuming what they find , and even the mindless Predators that sit in an area will pluck away at what ’s available there .
To take some words from the mouth of one of the The Void ’s characters -
“ There ’s only hunger , slumber , and waiting for the end to come . ”
So what is it , this substance everybody needs ?
What is it that ’s lacking in such great quantities to have rendered the world exhausted ?
Food ?
No .
Water , perhaps ?
No .
Colour .
Colour is all in the Void .
Colour is what stops everyone from slipping away into nothingness , and in the case of your mute character the removal and application of colour is your only means of interacting with the world .
To break it down into terms we ’re all used to , your amassed colour is simultaneously your health , currency , inventory , mana , conversation options and weaponry .
Just as the real challenge in Pathologic was completing your objectives while manipulating a plague - ridden town ’s economy , the real challenge in The Void is completing tasks while constantly having to harvest and tend to the world ’s colour .
Broadly , you have to sow colour to reap it back .
Take the fireflies you ’ll encounter from time to time .
They ’re flighty , egg - like things , easily spooked .
Sacrifice some colour by depositing it on the ground and they ’ll lap it up as they pass , allowing you to snatch the colour inside them .
Gardens are a better deal .
You can infuse dead trees with colour then return to them much later once they ’ve bloomed , pulling out more colour than you put in .
There are many , many methods like this , waiting to be discovered .
That ’s not the half of it though .
Check out the way colour works once you ’ve actually acquired it :
All those bulbs on the right are your ‘ memory ’ , and show colour you ’ve picked up .
Each bulb only has limited space , and colour held in your memory in this way is useless .
However , colour held in your memory can be transferred into your body , ‘ couching ’ it .
Your body must always have some colour couched in it , or you die .
Couched colour , however , constantly drains out of your body into the ‘ palette ’ on the left .
Again , each bulb in your palette only has limited space .
Colour in your palette can , finally , be spent to affect the world , fight , or talk to people .
So , your body is kept alive by constantly turning the colour you pick up into colour you can use .
Colour is spent predominantly by drawing glyphs , which are magical symbols you collect throughout the game .
Hold down ctrl and you can trace these glyphs with the mouse while the game continues in accommodating slo -mo ( which in combat will never feel slo enough ) .
The first glyph you get is the Donor glyph , for example , which allows you to give colour to something else .
This is followed by glyphs like Shell , which protect you , or Hawk , which binds together twigs to create an aggressive flying creature you guide with further dabs of colour .
I ’ve already seen people comparing this mechanic to [ zelda - derived dog - god - painting console game – Ed ]
Okami , which is about as correct a sentence can be while still getting on my nerves .
Okami was beautifully constructed but had an utterly straight - laced structure .
To put The Void in the same sentence as something so safe is doing it a disservice .
I ’m not nearly done talking about this colour system .
It ’s far more complex than this .
I ’m also not going to say anything more about it , because learning to master colour is the game .
Rather than Okami I ’m much happier comparing The Void with old cult favourite Vangers , which I ’ve just remembered also came from a Russian developer .
These are both games which revel in dropping the player into an utterly alien environment and letting them sink or swim , games where the real opponent is your own ignorance .
And that ’s the crux of it , really .
The most satisfying moments in The Void come from deducing some minute detail of life in this crippled land , and using it to best one of the other inhabitants .
And what inhabitants .
So in the Void live Sisters , Brothers and Predators .
Or more accurately , Sisters , Brothers , Predators and You .
You encounter the Sisters first .
They ’re all beautiful women who embody the ennui of the Void .
Ageless , mercurial , stoic and knowledgeable , they wait out the game in their respective chambers .
The more energetic ones might brood , scheme or berate you from the safety of their thrones , or couches , or swing - sets , but they ’re ultimately sad figures and unable to turn down your gifts of colour whenever you need something from them .
Choice Sister quote : “ Nobody cares about anything anymore .
And nobody knows why nobody cares . ”
The Brothers are another story , and are at least half responsible for The Void being as disturbing to play as it is .
The Brothers are the few souls who managed to come crawling up from the colourless realm that exists beneath The Void , though they suffered terribly in the process .
They ’re all blind , for a start , and have names like Triumphator and Whaler .
And .
Well , nightmarish is a word that ’s long since lost its original meaning and become a synonym for scary , so I need to be more specific : their character design is like something you ’d see in the worst gorgonzola - fueled dream .
One of the Brothers is a non-existent musical instrument who ’s constantly blowing into and winding himself .
Another is attached to the ceiling from a rope , and has a ribcage with extends far enough that it becomes a birdcage .
Then there ’s the guy with a fanny for a face .
He ’s a charmer , actually .
Since arriving in the Void each Brother has long since paired off with a Sister and now ‘ protects ’ them with a miserable zeal .
Since they ’re all hopelessly powerful , the early game in The Void is in convincing the Brothers you ’re one of them ( which for all you know you might well be ) while you muster enough colour and glyphs to defend yourself .
You ’ll soon develop a monstrous loathing for the Brothers since you ’re forced to watch them wander the map , cleansing areas of colour .
Getting a Brother in one of your gardens is always particularly painful .
Finally , there ’s Predators .
Predators are the bantams of the Void and are just horrid jerks .
In a game where your primary concerns are always ‘ How much colour do I have ’ and ‘ Where am I getting more from ’ , Predators exist to chew colour from both the world and you , if you get close .
The question of how to deal with Predators was what first made me realise where the game was going .
This was an hour or so in .
When you encounter your first Predator a Sister guides you through battering it with colour until it dies , then she congratulates you .
COOL !
You think .
And so you get into the habit of unthinkingly crushing Predators you find with colour .
Before long a Brother gives you a reprimand , telling you flinging colour around is taboo .
Then the colour itself starts whispering at you , telling you you ’re wasting your soul .
Then you pick up from a conversation about something else that there ’s a relationship between colour spent in an area and the Predators that appear .
Suddenly , you ’re not sure if killing Predators is a mistake .
Suddenly , you ’re thinking .
Just as Pathologic was really a story that had the confidence to lie to the player , The Void is a game that has the fearlessness to mislead you , to obfuscate the rules of the world and make you rely on your own intuition and experience .
In a year where mass - market games development is trying harder than ever to ensure even the most casual gamer is never confused or lost , I find Ice - Pick ’s attitude here much appreciated .
And there ’s something else that I liked in Pathologic that ’s still present in The Void , though it ties in with this same ethos of treating the player as an adult .
There ’s an incredible freedom to The Void .
For instance , ( and this is what blows a hole in any comparisons with Okami , Zelda or Metroid ) the order in which you acquire Glyphs is partly randomised .
Second , failing a Brother ’s task does n’t end the game , it just results in that Brother coming after you , giving you the opportunity to best him .
Third , once you stumble across the secret to it , you can murder Sisters at will .
This is Ice - Pick lodge allowing the sabotage of their own narrative , just like they did with Pathologic .
But you know what ?
That ’s okay !
Just as walking next to a pond , lake or river in real life when there ’s no safety barrier brings a strange , animal excitement , so does playing a game with the knowledge that this path you ’re following is of your own choosing , and that a mistake or willful decision would change things irrevocably .
Here it ’d be possible to write another 4,000 words breaking apart the design of The Void further , peeling and segmenting it just like I did with Pathologic .
It ’s unquestionably a game that deserves it , but it ’s not something I can do now .
I was always comfortable spoiling parts of Pathologic because I was writing two years after the UK release and in any case , I knew 95 % of people would n’t be able to hack its tone , structure and shoddy translation .
That ’s not the case this time .
This is a review , a buyer ’s guide , of a heroically inventive , entertaining game , and writing any more would simply be spoiling what hopefully you ’re now keen to find out for yourself .
Wait .
Shit .
You ’re meant to talk about flaws in a review too , right ?
First : The Void is hard , and requires some degree of perseverance .
I do n’t consider this a problem , but some people will .
Likewise , I was only angry at myself when I had to reload an old save because of a fuck - up that came from me misreading a single letter of a character ’s name .
I did not consider this the game ’s fault .
You might .
Second :
There is at least one minor bug that I know of .
Third : Transferring colour to and from your body to maximise your effectiveness before an action can get tedious fast if you ’re retreading old ground .
That ’s it !
You can pre-order The Void from here .
As a kind of epilogue , let me finish by saying that I ’m going to be doing one final piece of writing on The Void later in the week on the subject of breasts and art .
Because , y’know , The Void ’s got me thinking .
About breasts .
And art .
It should be good .
Come for the breasts !
Stay for the art .
On the Slave - Trade To the Editor of the
Federal Gazette
March 23d , 1790 .
Sir , Reading last night in your excellent Paper the speech of Mr. Jackson in Congress against their meddling with the Affair of Slavery , or attempting to mend the Condition of the Slaves , it put me in mind of a similar
One made about 100 Years since by Sidi Mehemet Ibrahim , a member of the Divan of Algiers , which may be seen in Martin ’s Account of his Consulship , anno 1687 .
It was against granting the Petition of the Sect called Erika , or Purists who pray ’d for the Abolition of Piracy and Slavery as being unjust .
Mr. Jackson does not quote it ; perhaps he has not seen it .
If , therefore , some of its Reasonings are to be found in his eloquent Speech , it may only show that men ’s Interests and Intellects operate and are operated on with surprising similarity in all Countries and Climates , when under similar Circumstances .
The African ’s Speech , as translated , is as follows .
“ Allah Bismillah , &c .
God is great , and Mahomet is his Prophet .
“ Have these Erika considered the Consequences of granting their Petition ?
If we cease our Cruises against the Christians , how shall we be furnished with the Commodities their Countries produce , and which are so necessary for us ?
If we forbear to make Slaves of their People , who in this hot Climate are to cultivate our Lands ?
Who are to perform the common Labours of our City , and in our Families ?
Must we not then be our own Slaves ?
And is there not more Compassion and more Favour due to us as Mussulmen , than to these Christian Dogs ?
We have now about 50,000 Slaves in and near Algiers .
This Number , if not kept up by fresh Supplies , will soon diminish , and be gradually annihilated .
If we then cease taking and plundering the Infidel Ships , and making Slaves of the Seamen and Passengers , our Lands will become of no Value for want of Cultivation ; the Rents of Houses in the City will sink one half ; and the Revenues of Government arising from its Share of Prizes be totally destroy’d !
And for what ?
To gratify the whims of a whimsical Sect , who would have us , not only forbear making more Slaves , but even to manumit those we have .
“ But who is to indemnify their Masters for the Loss ?
Will the State do it ?
Is our Treasury sufficient ?
Will the Erika do it ?
Can they do it ?
Or would they , to do what they think Justice to the Slaves , do a greater Injustice to the Owners ?
And it we set our Slaves free , what is to be done with them ?
Few of them will return to their Countries ; they know too well the great Hardships they must there be subject to ; they will not embrace our holy Religion ; they will not adopt our Manners ; our People will not pollute themselves by intermarrying with them .
Must we maintain them as Beggars in our Streets , or suffer our Properties to be the Prey of their Pillage ?
For men long accustom ’d to Slavery will not work for a Livelihood when not compell’d .
And what is there so pitiable in their present Condition ?
Were they not Slaves in their own Countries ?
“ Are not Spain , Portugal , France , and the Italian states govern’d by Despots , who hold all their Subjects in Slavery , without Exception ?
Even England treats its Sailors as Slaves ; for they are , whenever the Government pleases , seiz ’d , and confin’d in Ships of War , condemn’d not only to work , but to fight , for small Wages , or a mere Subsistence , not better than our Slaves are allow’d by us .
Is their Condition then made worse by their falling into our Hands ?
No ; they have only exchanged on Slavery for another , and I may say a better ; for here they are brought into a land where the Sun of Islamism gives forth its Light , and shines in full Splendor , and they have an Opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the true Doctrine , and thereby saving their immortal Souls .
Those who remain at home have not that Happiness .
Sending the Slaves home then would be sending them out of Light into Darkness .
“ I repeat the Question , What is to be done with them ?
I have heard it suggested , that they may be planted in the Wilderness , where there is plenty of Land for them to subsist on , and where they may flourish as a free State ; but they are , I doubt , to little dispos’d to labour without Compulsion , as well as too ignorant to establish a good government , and the wild Arabs would soon molest and destroy or again enslave them .
While serving us , we take care to provide them with every thing , and they are treated with Humanity .
The Labourers in their own Country are , as I am well informed , worse fed , lodged , and cloathed .
The Condition of most of them is therefore already mended , and requires no further Improvement .
Here their Lives are in Safety .
They are not liable to be impress ’d for Soldiers , and forc’d to cut one another ’s Christian throats , as in the Wars of their own Countries .
If some of the religious mad Bigots , who now teaze us with their silly Petitions , have in a Fit of blind Zeal freed their Slaves , it was not Generosity , it was not Humanity , that mov’d them to the Action ; it was from the conscious Burthen of a Load of Sins , and Hope , from the supposed Merits of so good a Work , to be excus ’d Damnation .
“ How grossly are they mistaken in imagining Slavery to be disallow’d by the Alcoran ?
Are not the two Precepts , to quote no more , ‘ Masters , treat your Slaves with kindness ; Slaves , serve your Masters with Cheerfulness and Fidelity , ’ clear Proofs to the contrary ?
Nor can the Plundering of Infidels be in that sacred Book forbidden , since it is well known from it , that God has given the World , and all that it contains , to his faithful Mussulmen , who are to enjoy it of Right as fast as they conquer it .
Let us then hear no more of this detestable Proposition , the Manumission of Christian Slaves , the Adoption of which would , by depreciating our Lands and Houses , and thereby depriving so many good Citizens of their Properties , create universal Discontent , and provoke Insurrections , to the endangering of Government and producing general Confusion .
I have therefore no doubt , but this wise Council will prefer the Comfort and Happiness of a whole Nation of true Believers to the Whim of a few Erika , and dismiss their Petition . ”
The Result was , as Martin tells us , that the Divan came to this Resolution ; “ The Doctrine , that Plundering and Enslaving the Christians is unjust , is at best problematical ; but that it is the Interest of this State to continue the Practice , is clear ; therefore let the Petition be rejected . ”
And it was rejected accordingly .
And since like Motives are apt to produce in the Minds of Men like Opinions and Resolutions , may we not , Mr. Brown , venture to predict , from this Account , that the Petitions to the Parliament of England for abolishing the Slave - Trade , to say nothing of other Legislatures , and the Debates upon them , will have a similar Conclusion ?
I am , Sir , your constant Reader and humble Servant , HISTORICUS .
The following article is the text from John Pilger ’s address to Socialism 2009 in San Francisco , California on 4 July .
Two years ago , at Socialism 2007 in Chicago , I spoke about an “ invisible government , ” a term used by Edward Bernays , one of the founders of modern propaganda .
It was Bernays who , in the 1920s , invented “ public relations ” as a euphemism for propaganda .
Deploying the ideas of his uncle , Sigmund Freud , Bernays campaigned on behalf of the tobacco industry for American women to take up smoking as an act of feminist liberation ; he called cigarettes “ torches of freedom . ”
The invisible government that Bernays had in mind brought together the power of all media — PR , the press , broadcasting , advertising .
It was the power of form : of branding and image - making over substance and truth — and I would like to talk today about this invisible government ’s most recent achievement : the rise of Barack Obama and the silencing of the left .
First , I would like to go back some 40 years to a sultry day in Vietnam .
I was a young war correspondent who had just arrived in a village called Tuylon .
My assignment was to write about a company of US Marines who had been sent to this village to win hearts and minds .
“ My orders ” , said the Marine sergeant , “ are to sell the American Way of Liberty as stated in the Pacification Handbook .
This is designed to win the hearts and minds of folks as stated on page 86 . ”
Page 86 was headed WHAM : Winning Hearts and Minds .
The marine unit was a Combined Action Company which , explained the sergeant , “ means that we attack these folks on Mondays and win their hearts and minds on Tuesdays ” .
He was joking , though not quite .
The sergeant , who did n’t speak Vietnamese , had arrived in the village , stood up in a jeep and said through a bullhorn : “ Come on out everybody , we got rice and candy and toothbrushes to give you ! … ”
There was silence .
“ Now listen , either you gooks come on out , or we ’re going to come right in there and get you ! ”
The people of Tuylon finally came out , and stood in line to receive packets of Uncle Ben ’s Miracle Rice , Hershey bars , party balloons and several thousand toothbrushes .
Three portable , battery - operated , yellow flush lavatories were held back for the arrival of the colonel .
And when the colonel arrived that evening , the district chief was summoned , and the yellow flush lavatories were unveiled .
The colonel cleared his throat and produced a handwritten speech .
“ Mr. District Chief and all you nice people , ” he said , “ what these gifts represent is more than the sum of their parts .
They carry the spirit of America .
Ladies and gentlemen , there ’s no place on earth like America .
It ’s the land where miracles happen .
It ’s a guiding light for me , and for you .
In America , you see , we count ourselves as real lucky having the greatest democracy the world has ever known , and we want you nice people to share in our good fortune . ”
Thomas Jefferson , George Washington , even John Winthrop ’s “ city upon a hill ” got a mention .
All that was missing was the Star Spangled Banner playing in the background .
Of course , the villagers had no idea what the colonel was talking about .
When the Marines clapped , they clapped .
When the colonel waved , the children waved .
As he departed , the colonel shook the sergeant ’s hand and said : “ You ’ve got plenty of hearts and minds here .
Carry on , Sergeant ? ”
“ Yessir . ”
In Vietnam , I witnessed many spectacles like that .
I had grown up in faraway Australia on a steady cinematic diet of John Wayne , Randolph Scott , Walt Disney , the Three Stooges and Ronald Reagan .
The American Way of Liberty they portrayed might well have been lifted from the WHAM handbook .
I learned that the United States had won World War Two on its own and now led the “ free world ” as the “ chosen ” society .
It was only much later when I read Walter Lippmann ’s Public Opinion that I understood something of the power of emotions attached to false ideas and bad history .
Historians call this “ exceptionalism ” — the notion that the United States has a divine right to bring what it calls liberty to the rest of humanity .
Of course , this is a very old refrain ; the French and British created and celebrated their own “ civilizing mission ” while imposing colonial regimes that denied basic civil liberties .
However , the power of the American message is different .
Whereas the Europeans were proud imperialists , Americans are trained to deny their imperialism .
As Mexico was conquered and the Marines sent to rule Nicaragua , American textbooks referred to an “ age of innocence . ”
American motives were well meaning , moral , exceptional , as the colonel said .
There was no ideology , they said ; and this is still the received wisdom .
Indeed , Americanism is an ideology that is unique because its main element is its denial that it is an ideology .
It is both conservative and liberal , both right and left .
All else is heresy .
Barack Obama is the embodiment of this “ ism ” .
Since Obama was elected , leading liberals have talked about America returning to its true status as a “ nation of moral ideals ” — the words of Paul Krugman in the New York Times .
In the San Francisco Chronicle columnist Mark Morford wrote that , “ spiritually advanced people regard the new president as ‘ a Lightworker ’ . . . who can help usher in a new way of being on the planet . ”
Tell that to an Afghan child whose family has been blown away by Obama ’s bombs , or a Pakistani child whose family are among the 700 civilians killed by Obama ’s drones .
Or Tell it to a child in the carnage of Gaza caused by American smart weapons which , disclosed Seymour Hersh , were resupplied to Israel for use in the slaughter “ only after the Obama team let it be known it would not object . ”
The man who stayed silent on Gaza is the man who now condemns Iran .
Obama ’s is the myth that is America ’s last taboo .
His most consistent theme was never change ; it was power .
The United States , he said , “ leads the world in battling immediate evils and promoting the ultimate good . . .
We must lead by building a 21st century military to ensure the security of our people and advance the security of all people . ”
And there is this remarkable statement : “ At moments of great peril in the past century our leaders ensured that America , by deed and by example , led and lifted the world , that a we stood and fought for the freedom sought by billions of people beyond their borders . ”
At the National Archives on May 21 , he said : “ From Europe to the Pacific , we ’ve been the nation that has shut down torture chambers and replaced tyranny with the rule of law . ”
Since 1945 , “ by deed and by example , ” the United States has overthrown fifty governments , including democracies , and crushed some 30 liberation movements , and supported tyrannies and set up torture chambers from Egypt to Guatemala .
Countless men , women and children have been bombed to death .
Bombing is apple pie .
And yet , here is the 44th President of the United States , having stacked his government with warmongers and corporate fraudsters and polluters from the Bush and Clinton eras , teasing us while promising more of the same .
Here is the House of Representatives , controlled by Obama ’s Democrats , voting to approve $ 16 billion for three wars and a coming presidential military budget which , in 2009 , will exceed any year since the end of World War Two , including the spending peaks of the Korean and Vietnam wars .
And here is a peace movement , not all of it but much of it , prepared to look the other way and believe or hope that Obama will restore , as Paul Krugman wrote in the New York Times , the “ nation of moral ideals . ”
Not long ago , I visited the American Museum of History in the celebrated Smithsonian Institute in Washington .
One of the most popular exhibitions was called The Price of Freedom : Americans at War .
It was holiday time and lines of happy people , including many children , shuffled through a Santa ’s grotto of war and conquest , where messages about their nation ’s “ great mission ” were lit up .
These included tributes to the quote “ exceptional Americans [ who ] saved a million lives ” in Vietnam where they were quote “ determined to stop communist expansion . ”
In Iraq , other brave Americans quote “ employed air strikes of unprecedented precision . ”
What was shocking was not so much the revisionism of two of the epic crimes of modern times but the sheer routine scale of omission .
Like all US presidents , Bush and Obama have much in common .
The wars of both presidents , and the wars of Clinton and Reagan , Carter and Ford , Nixon and Kennedy , are justified by the enduring myth of exceptional America — a myth the late Harold Pinter described as “ a brilliant , witty , highly successful act of hypnosis . ”
The clever young man who recently made it to the White House is a very fine hypnotist , partly because it is so extraordinary to see an African - American at the pinnacle of power in the land of slavery .
However , this is the 21st century , and race — together with gender and even class — can be very seductive tools of propaganda .
For what matters , above race and gender , is the class one serves .
George Bush ’s inner circle — from the State Department to the Supreme Court — was perhaps the most multi racial in presidential history .
It was PC par excellence .
Think Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell .
It was also the most reactionary .
To many , Obama ’s very presence in the White House reaffirms the moral nation .
He is a marketing dream .
Like Calvin Klein or Benetton , he is a brand that promises something special — something exciting , almost risqué , as if he might be a radical , as if he might enact change .
He makes people feel good .
He ’s postmodern man with no political baggage .
In his book , Dreams From My Father , Obama refers to the job he took after he graduated from Columbia University in 1983 .
He describes his employer as “ a consulting house to multinational corporations . ”
For some reason , he does not say who his employer was or what he did there .
The employer was Business International Corporation , which has a long history of providing cover for the CIA with covert action , and infiltrating unions and the left .
I know this because it was especially active in my own country , Australia .
Obama does not say what he did at Business International ; and there may be nothing sinister , but it seems worthy of enquiry , and debate , surely , as a clue to whom the man is .
During his brief period in the Senate , Obama voted to continue the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He voted for the Patriot Act .
He refused to support a bill for single - payer health care .
He supported the death penalty .
As a presidential candidate , he received more corporate backing than John McCain .
He promised to close Guantanamo as a priority and has not .
Instead , he has excused the perpetrators of torture , reinstated the infamous military commissions , kept the Bush gulag intact and opposed habeus corpus .
Daniel Ellsberg was right when he said that , under Bush , a military coup had taken place in the United States , giving the Pentagon unprecedented powers .
These powers have been reinforced by the presence of Robert Gates , a Bush family crony and George W. Bush ’s secretary of defense , and by all the Bush Pentagon officials and generals who have kept their jobs under Obama .
In Colombia , Obama is planning to spend $ 46 million on a new military base that will support a regime backed by death squads and further the tragic history of Washington ’s intervention in Latin America .
In a pseudo event staged in Prague , Obama promised a world without nuclear weapons to a global audience mostly unaware that America is building new tactical nuclear weapons designed to blur the distinction between nuclear and conventional war .
Like George Bush , he used the absurdity of Europe threatened by Iran to justify building a missile system aimed at Russia and China .
In a pseudo event at the Annapolis Naval Academy , decked with flags and uniforms , Obama lied that the troops were coming home .
The head of the army , General George Casey , says America will be in Iraq for up to a decade ; other generals say fifteen years .
Units will be relabeled as trainers ; mercenaries will take their place .
That is how the Vietnam War endured past the American “ withdrawal ” .
Chris Hedges , author of Empire of Illusion puts it well .
“ President Obama , ” he wrote , “ does one thing and Brand Obama gets you to believe another .
This is the essence of successful advertising .
You buy or do what the advertiser wants because of how they can make you feel . ”
And so you are kept in “ a perpetual state of childishness . ”
He calls this “ junk politics . ”
The tragedy is that Brand Obama appears to have crippled or absorbed the antiwar movement , the peace movement .
Out of 256 Democrats in Congress , thirty are willing to stand against Obama ’s and Nancy Pelosi ’s war party .
On June 16 , they voted for $ 106 billion for more war .
In Washington , the Out of Iraq Caucus is out of action .
Its members can’t even come up with a form of words of why they are silent .
On March 21 , a demonstration at the Pentagon by the once mighty United for Peace and Justice drew only a few thousand .
The outgoing president of UPJ , Leslie Cagan , says her people are n’t turning up because , “ it ’s enough for many of them that Obama has a plan to end the war and that things are moving in the right direction . ”
And where is the mighty MoveOn these days ?
Where is its campaign against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ?
And what exactly was said when , in February , MoveOn ’s executive director , Jason Ruben , met President Obama ?
Yes , a lot of good people mobilized for Obama .
But what did they demand of him — apart from the amorphous “ change ” ?
That is n’t activism .
Activism does n’t give up .
Activism is not about identity politics .
Activism does n’t wait to be told .
Activism does n’t rely on the opiate of hope .
Woody Allen once said , “ I felt a lot better when I gave up hope . ”
Real activism has little time for identity politics , a distraction that confuses and suckers good people everywhere .
I write for the Italian newspaper Il Manifesto , or rather I used to write for it .
In February , I sent the foreign editor an article that raised questions about Obama as a progressive force .
The article was rejected .
Why ?
I asked .
“ For the moment , ” wrote the editor , “ we prefer to maintain a more ‘ positive ’ approach to the novelty presented by Obama . . . we will take on specific issues . . . but we would not like to say that he will make no difference . ”
In other words , an American president drafted to promote the most rapacious system in history is ordained and depoliticized by the left .
What is remarkable about this state of affairs is that the so - called radical left has never been more aware , more conscious , of the iniquities of power .
The Green Movement , for example , has raised the consciousness of millions of people , so that almost every child knows something about global warming ; and yet there is a resistance within the green movement to the notion of power as a military project .
Similar observations can be made of the gay and feminist movements ; as for the labor movement , is it still breathing ?
One of my favorite quotations is from Milan Kundera : “ The struggle of people against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting . ”
We should never forget that the primary goal of great power is to distract and limit our natural desire for social justice and equity and real democracy .
Long ago , Bernays ’s invisible government of propaganda elevated big business from its unpopular status as a kind of mafia to that of a patriotic driving force .
The American Way of Life began as an advertising slogan .
The modern image of Santa Claus was an invention of Coca Cola .
Today , we are presented with an extraordinary opportunity , thanks to the crash of Wall Street and the revelation , for ordinary people , that the free market has nothing to do with freedom .
The opportunity is to recognize a stirring in America that is unfamiliar to many on the left , but is related to a great popular movement growing all over the world .
In Latin America , less than 20 years ago , there was the usual despair , the usual divisions of poverty and freedom , the usual thugs in uniforms running unspeakable regimes .
There is now a people ’s movement based on the revival of indigenous cultures and languages , and a history of popular and revolutionary struggle less affected by ideological distortions than anywhere else .
The recent , amazing achievements in Bolivia , Ecuador , Venezuela , El Salvador , Argentina , Brazil and Paraguay represent a struggle for community and political rights that is truly historic , with implications for all of us .
These successes are expressed perversely in the overthrow of the government of Honduras , for the smaller the country the greater the threat that the contagion of emancipation will follow .
Across the world , social movements and grassroots organizations have emerged to fight free market dogma .
They have educated governments in the south that food for export is a problem rather than a solution to global poverty .
They have politicized ordinary people to stand up for their rights , as in the Philippines and South Africa .
An authentic globalization is growing as never before , and this is exciting .
Consider the remarkable boycott , disinvestment and sanctions campaign — BDS for short — aimed at Israel , that is sweeping the world .
Israeli ships have been turned away from South Africa and western Australia .
A French company has been forced to abandon plans to built a railway connecting Jerusalem with illegal Israeli settlements .
Israeli sporting bodies find themselves isolated .
Universities have begun to sever ties with Israel , and students are active for the first time in a generation .
Thanks to them , Israel ’s South Africa moment is approaching , for this is , partly , how apartheid was defeated .
In the 1950s , we never expected the great wind of the 1960s to blow .
Feel the breeze today .
In the last eight months millions of angry emails , sent by ordinary Americans , have flooded Washington .
This has not happened before .
People are outraged as their lives are attacked ; they bear no resemblance to the massive mass presented by the media .
Look at the polls that are seldom reported .
More than two thirds of Americans say the government should care for those who cannot care for themselves ; 64 percent would pay higher taxes to guarantee health care for everyone ; 59 percent are favorable towards unions ; 70 percent want nuclear disarmament ; 72 percent want the US completely out of Iraq ; and so on .
For too long , ordinary Americans have been cast in stereotypes that are contemptuous .
That is why the progressive attitudes of ordinary people are seldom reported in the media .
They are not ignorant .
They are subversive .
They are informed .
And they are “ anti-American ” .
I once asked a friend , the great American war correspondent and humanitarian Martha Gellhorn , to explain “ anti-American ” to me .
“ I ’ll tell you what ‘ anti - American ’ is , ” she said .
“ It ’s what governments and their vested interested call those who honor America by objecting to war and the theft of resources and believing in all of humanity .
There are millions of these anti-Americans in the United States .
They are ordinary people who belong to no elite and who judge their government in moral terms , though they would call it common decency .
They are not vain .
They are the people with a wakeful conscience , the best of America ’s citizens .
They can be counted on .
They were in the south with the Civil Rights movement , ending slavery .
They were in the streets , demanding an end to the wars in Asia .
Sure , they disappear from view now and then , but they are like seeds beneath the snow .
I would say they are truly exceptional . ”
A certain populism is once again growing in America and which has a proud , if forgotten past .
In the nineteenth century , an authentic grassroots Americanism was expressed in populism ’s achievements : women ’s suffrage , the campaign for an eight - hour day , graduated income tax and public ownership of railways and communications , and breaking the power of corporate lobbyists .
The American populists were far from perfect ; at times they would keep bad company , but they spoke from the ground up , not from the top down .
They were betrayed by leaders who urged them to compromise and merge with the Democratic Party .
Does that sound familiar ?
What Obama and the bankers and the generals , and the IMF and the CIA and CNN fear is ordinary people coming together and acting together .
It is a fear as old as democracy : a fear that suddenly people convert their anger to action and are guided by the truth .
“ At a time of universal deceit , ” wrote George Orwell , “ telling the truth a revolutionary act . ”

( CNN ) --
As President Obama struggles to regain control of the health care debate , he 's finding himself caught in a game of tug of war with members of his own party .
President Obama finds himself squeezed by party liberals and Blue Dog Democrats in the debate on health care .
The conservative Blue Dog Democrats do n't want a bill with a government - sponsored , public health plan , and liberal Democrats have said they wo n't pass legislation without one .
Despite strong majorities in both chambers of Congress , Democrats have been unable to reach an agreement on the legislation .
And the administration has acknowledged that it will be difficult to pass a bill with bipartisan support .
" The White House needs to take more of a role in trying to broker a deal between the Blue Dogs and party liberals -- in bringing them together and trying to figure some compromise , " said Stu Rothenberg , a political analyst and editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report .
" It 's like a coach who took a ball , threw it in the middle of the court and said , ' OK , go get it . '
And everybody runs there , and they have a huge scrum , and there 's not a lot of progress , " Rothenberg added .
" I think he needs to be more hands - on . ...
Why not start with areas of consensus among all Democrats and then try to move out from there ? "
The president has spent the past week trying to put out fires sparked after his administration appeared to hedge on support for the public option .
At a town hall event last weekend , Obama said , " The public option , whether we have it or we do n't have it , is not the entirety of health care reform . "
Watch as the president takes calls on health care »
Critics said the president was waffling on his original proposals .
The White House insisted its stance has not changed and sent talking points to congressional Democrats trying to ease concern about the public option .
Obama again on Thursday tried to reassure supporters he had n't abandoned the idea , saying the administration thinks that " if we have a public option in there , that can help keep insurers honest , it can provide a benchmark for what an affordable basic plan should look like . "
" This is sort of like the belt and suspenders concept to keep up your pants .
You know , the insurance reforms are the belt .
The public option can be the suspenders , " the president added .
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a clear message Thursday that she 's a lot less flexible on the idea .
" There is no way I can pass a bill in the House of Representatives without a public option , " she told an audience in her home district in San Francisco , California .
Three House panels as well as the Senate Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions have cleared a government - sponsored health insurance option .
But a bipartisan group of six negotiators on the Senate Finance Committee -- the last panel that needs to clear health care legislation before it can be taken up on the Senate floor -- is considering dropping a government - funded public option in favor of nonprofit cooperatives that would negotiate collective policies for members .
If their party can't get the 60 votes needed for the bill to reach the Senate floor , some top Democrats have hinted they may try to short - circuit the traditional legislative process by using an obscure tactic known as reconciliation .
It 's a type of budget maneuver that requires a simple majority -- 51 votes -- to pass .
Such a move would boost the prospects for Senate passage of a public health option .
In the House , however , Obama will need support from some of the more conservative members of his party .
Democrats hold a 40 - seat majority in that chamber , but more than 50 Democratic representatives are members of the Blue Dog Coalition .
Obama said Thursday that reform is a matter of necessity -- and not politics .
Larry Sabato , director of the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics , said he laughs anytime he hears a president say it 's not about politics .
" Let 's get real here , their jobs are on the line .
We would do the same thing if our jobs were on the line .
It 's just human nature , " said Sabato , author of " The Year of Obama : How Barack Obama Won the White House . "
Following the emotionally charged August recess , Obama will have to let Congress " fulminate for a while on both ends , " Sabato said .
" They have to let the dust settle and then come back in September and begin serious negotiations with the two Democratic wings .
And they have a very simple message :
If you do to the Obama administration what your predecessors did to the Clinton administration , we will have a rout in 2010 , " he said .
" Some of you , many of you will lose your seats .
That 's the message , and that 's how they get some health care reform .
It 's obviously not going to be what Obama wanted .
It 's going to be significantly scaled back , but they need something . "
Following the defeat of President Clinton 's health care effort in 1994 , Democrats lost control of Congress for the first time in 40 years .
It took 12 years to get it back .
Rothenberg predicted that Congress will pass some sort of legislation this time around , but said , " I just do n't think it 's going to be nearly as elaborate , all - encompassing as the liberal elements have been hoping for . "
And while there still is some political risk in passing legislation with no Republican support , " I think the risk of not passing anything is so much greater than the risk of passing something in a more partisan way , that it 's not even close , " he said , adding that not passing a bill " is an invitation to a political disaster . "

Former White House speechwriter John L. Perry has courted controversy by suggesting that the U.S. Military , upholding their oath to defend the Constitution against domestic enemies , could stage a bloodless coup to oust President Obama .
In an article originally posted on the Newsmax website , Perry wrote , “ There is a remote , although gaining , possibility America ’s military will intervene as a last resort to resolve the “ Obama problem . ”
Do n’t dismiss it as unrealistic . ”
Despite the fact that Perry was not explicitly advocating such a coup , Newsmax later removed the article to ensure it “ was not misinterpreted ” .
The article outlines how military officers , outraged at Obama ’s “ trampling ” on the Constitution , nationalization of American institutions , rising deficits , unemployment and taxes , could peaceably seize power from the “ radical - left commissars ” of the Obama administration .
“ Military intervention is what Obama ’s exponentially accelerating agenda for “ fundamental change ” toward a Marxist state is inviting upon America .
A coup is not an ideal option , but Obama ’s radical ideal is not acceptable or reversible , ” writes Perry .
It is important to stress that Perry is not a Neo - Con , he worked under the Democratic administrations of Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter .
[ efoods ]
Perry warns that America could be unrecognizable by 2012 , prompting a coup to “ restore and defend the Constitution , ” a prospect that is “ weighing heavily on the intellect and conscience of America ’s military leadership , ” he writes .
Perry says that such a move could be accelerated if Israel were to bomb Iran , causing the Middle East to explode and a massive destabilization of the free world .
Of course , the unlikely staging of a military coup could be just another ruse to implement martial law in the aftermath of what would undoubtedly ensue – mass civil unrest and a potential breakdown of society .
More and more credible analysts are predicting that the United States could collapse in a Soviet - style breakdown within the next few years .
In such a scenario , the vacuum of power created would leave the door open for the imposition of an even greater tyranny than we are witnessing today with Obama ’s big government Socialist agenda .
It is far more likely that a military coup , even if it began as a genuine effort to “ restore the Constitution , ” or “ solve the Obama problem , ” would be hijacked and transformed into an effort to subjugate the entire country under a militarized police state to an even greater extent than it is now .
The more probable scenario is the one that was outlined by Tommy Franks in a 2003 interview with the men ’s lifestyle magazine Cigar Aficionado , where a military form of government would be implemented in the aftermath of a huge terror attack that kills millions .
Franks predicted that another mass casualty terror attack would occur that would cause the “ population to question our own Constitution and to begin to militarize our country in order to avoid a repeat of another mass , casualty - producing event .
Which in fact , then begins to unravel the fabric of our Constitution . ”

Summary : Microsoft ’s agitation of Yahoo ! since February 2008 takes its toll on more Free software - oriented staff
When Yahoo ! became a zombie to Microsoft it was apparent that Free software would suffer as a result .
Yahoo ! is — after all — the home of some Free software projects , systems administrators , and developers .
The founder of Delicious has just gone on the record saying that he regrets selling to Yahoo ! and The Register says that the founder of Hadoop is leaving too .
Yahoo ! is losing the founder of Hadoop , that increasingly popular open source grid platform based on Google ’s proprietary software infrastructure .
There is at least one GNU / Linux distribution which is based on Hadoop and some Free software - based ‘ clouds ’ depend on this project too .
Other prominent losses include Jeremy Zawodny , who is now writing occasionally for Linux Magazine .
Zimbra too felt the wrath of Microsoft due to uncertainty that has been cast onto it .
So , we ’re inclined to believe that Microsoft ’s damage to Yahoo ! is also an attack on Free software .
We are already concerned about VMware buying SpringSource because VMware is headed by former Microsoft employees right now [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] . █

“ When the people find they can vote themselves money , that will herald the end of the republic . ”
– Benjamin Franklin
Fall Of The Republic gives one a sense of a much greater awakening than any previous Alex Jones film .
An appropriate analogy would be to say that Jones ’ previous works , Terrorstorm , Endgame and The Obama Deception are akin to the comprehension extending monoliths in Stanley Kubrick ’s 2001 A Space Odyssey .
Fall Of The Republic , however , is the consciousness expanding stargate that those earlier artifacts point toward .
Indeed , its themes and concerns echo those of the Kubrick classic – the progression of mankind , the sacrifices we must make and the forces we must overcome in forging our future .
The film cannot be classed as a single issue documentary .
It is at once both a commentary on and an expose of the world we live in .
At it ’s core , like our modern society , the film revolves around the global economic system and those who seek to control it .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
For the better part of a century this all encompassing system has operated as a total parasite on the populations of this planet .
It has been carefully aligned to benefit an elite few while degrading the standard of life for everyone else it comes into contact with .
Now it has become more than clear that this is the case , public anger is prominent .
The people want to know who exactly is to blame for the turmoil we ’ve been burdened with , why power hungry oligarchs continue to prosper at the expense of the free world , and what can be done to reverse this course of corruption .
While Michael Moore waves a general finger in the direction of “ Capitalism ” , without ever identifying who that really encompasses , Alex Jones grabs you by the scruff of the neck and and marches you straight into central headquarters of the culprits .
Fall Of
The Republic exposes the vultures of global corporatism whose continued existence depends wholly upon their ability to trigger and manipulate financial meltdown as and when they choose .
This is key , because without a widespread understanding of this , the kingpins of the predatory system will continue to prosper unabated at the expense of everyone else on the planet .
Fall of the Republic exposes the reasons why we have not lived under a free market or benefited from free enterprise for generations , and why this has been so intrinsic in the shift toward a global centralization of power and influence .
Analysis from Max Keiser , G. Edward Griffin , John Perkins , Wayne Madsen and others brings into stark contrast how a consistent continuation of the same financial policy across governments exposes their status as fronts for an evergreen financial cartel that has used America as it ’s engine since the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 .
The latest brand of government in the shape of Barack Obama represents an amplification of the march toward global serfdom , continuing the very same process while falsely labeling it as progress and change .
Fall Of The Republic also explores how popular culture has become a device to both advance this agenda , through social engineering , and to quell those who would resist it with the championing of superficiality .
The film also charts the continuing rise of a police state that operates where such softer approaches cannot reach .
As you will see , an evolution of sorts has taken place whereby the people are now recruited as part of the enforcement grid , to keep each other in line with the system being forged around us .
In the face of this push to plunge the world into a new dark age , the conclusion of Fall Of The Republic offers a glimpse of a time in which the tyranny of such New World Order elitism has been defeated and rejected .
The film emphasizes how we truly are at a nexus point in history , and that we still have the power to forge a future built on the foundations of freedom , equality and progress for all mankind , in spite of the consistent attacks those rights and virtues are being subjected to with every passing second .
The second you finish watching the film you will want to share the insights it provides with others .
Fall Of The Republic feels less an Alex Jones film than a communal experience , something we are witnessing here and now all around us , and something that we must understand together in order to survive with our freedoms intact .

Korgoth is a 22 - minute animated parody of the sword and sorcery genre and follows the exploits of the most feared and physically awesome barbarian the world has ever seen .
When an unsavory ruffian swings an axe into Korgoth 's shoulder , it just makes him angry .
And he 's irritable and bellicose at the best of times .
Korgoth lives in a world of spiteful wizards , overweight inn-keepers , devious and hedonistic thieves and distressed , scantily - clad maidens .
Through brute strength , an absolute adherence to the tenets of stoicism , and a fair amount of sheer luck , Korgoth often finds himself coming out ahead of his medieval antagonists .

NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- Indian election authorities Thursday granted what they called an independent identity to intersex and transsexuals in the country 's voter lists .
Before , members of these groups -- loosely called eunuchs in Indian English -- were referred to as male or female in the voter rolls .
But now , they will have the choice to tick " O " -- for others -- when indicating their gender in voter forms , the Indian election commission said in a statement .
" Enumerators and booth - level officers ( BLOs ) shall be instructed to indicate the sex of eunuchs / transsexuals etc as ' O ' if they so desire , while undertaking any house - to - house enumeration / verification of any application , " a statement from election authorities said .
India , home to more than 1 billion people , has 714 million registered voters .
Intersexual people are seen as a marginalized community in India .
Many end up begging on the streets , becoming prostitutes or earning their livelihood by dancing at celebrations .
In July , an Indian court delivered a landmark ruling legalizing gay sex between consenting partners in the country .
The July verdict meant the law -- Indian penal code section 377 , which had previously criminalized consensual homosexual acts between adults -- was partly struck down but remains in place as far as forced homosexual acts are concerned .
It was not clear whether the ruling -- which was later challenged by an astrologer in India 's highest court -- would eventually lead to legalization of gay marriages in the country .

real estate agent who is fighting the terms of a divorce settlement ordered by a judge in 2006 .
You used to hear about divorced men complaining that their ex-wives were unfairly cutting into their income .
Now , as more women become primary breadwinners , the complaints increasingly come from them .
The number of American men receiving alimony has climbed , from 7,000 in 1998 to 13,000 last year , according to U.S. Census Bureau data
Chiancola 's ex , who declined to comment for this story , is among them .
Thanks in part to the pre-financial crisis real estate boom , Chiancola earned considerably more than her ex-husband , a sometime carpenter and fashion model , during their 19 - year - marriage .
She said her ex did n't hesitate to take advantage of that -- even though her income plummeted after the real estate boom years , and she 's now struggling to make her mortgage payments .
Chiancola said she partly blames Massachusetts ' " outdated " divorce laws for her predicament -- she is a supporter of the group Mass Alimony Reform -- but she 's also plenty outraged at her husband .
" He went for the jugular , believe me , " she said .
Aggressive pursuit of spousal support by men is becoming more common , some divorce lawyers say , as the stigma of asking for alimony fades .
" Early on , men were somewhat embarrassed to ask for alimony because it went across their defined roles in the culture .
That has diminished , " said Marlene Moses , the president - elect of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers , an organization of family law attorneys .
" There 's been a revolution of men and their rights and the vigor with which they pursue legal opportunities for themselves . "
It 's a revolution , experts say , that has been going on for more than 20 years -- actress Joan Collins ' divorce and alimony case made headlines in the 1980s -- but today , it 's still catching some women off guard .
Take Terry , a 56 - year - old Florida healthcare executive , who asked to have her last name witheld because her divorce from her husband is not yet settled .
" He 's a very independent man , a very macho guy , and I was quite surprised that he would ask for alimony , " said Terry .
Alimony Ex-Husband : ' I Helped Her '
Terry said her soon - to - be ex is asking for $ 2,500 per month in alimomy -- and she 's fighting it .
Terry , who earns more than $ 100,000 a year , said she 's not against the principle of women paying alimony to their former spouses .
But in her case , she said , it 's not warranted .
Her husband was laid off from an $ 85,000 per year job several months ago , but " he 's completely capable of earning a living . "
For some men , just as with some women , it 's past experience , not future earning potential , that weighs heavily on their decisions to seek alimony .
One divorced New England man told ABCNews.com that he deserved tens of thousands in alimony payments because he played a key role in his ex-wife 's professional success .
" I helped her out in the background , " said the man , who asked that his name be withheld due to ongoing divorce proceedings .
Without him , he said , " there 's absolutely no way she could have done what she did . "
Despite the increases in men seeking and receiving alimony , advocates warn against linking the trend to equality in the courtroom .
Family court judges still tend to favor women , said Ned Holstein , the founder of Fathers & Families , a group advocating family court reform .
" Family court still gives custody overwhelmingly to mothers , child support overwhelmingly to mothers , and courts still give almony overwhelmingly to mothers and women , " he said .
" The family courts came into existence years ago in order to give things to mothers that mothers needed , " he said .
" The times have changed and the courts have not . "
Recession Brings More Male Alimony ?
Today 's economy may be adding new men to ranks of alimony - seekers .
As traditionally male - dominated industries like finance and construction continue to struggle , more men are finding themselves with lower income or no income at all , forcing a newfound dependence on their wives or , in some cases , ex-wives .
Earlier this year , a British judge ruled that Elena Bowes Marano should pay her ex , real estate tycoon Peter Marano , 5 million pounds ( about $ 8 million ) after his property portfolio dwindled in value -- an order that Elena , originally from a wealthy California family , is fighting .
Such cases notwithstanding , a reversal of traditional gender roles in a divorce does n't necessarily create more acrimony , experts say .
Alexis Martin Neely , a prominent California family lawyer , is an alimony - paying woman content with her divorce settlement .
Supporting her husband , she has said , allows him to spend time with their children .
" I do really like him being available for the kids and their school events and if he can't work and do that , I 'd rather support him to be readily available for them , " she wrote in a blog post .
" He deserves it and so do they . "
Wheel of Stars
You are watching , and listening to , a musical clock made of stars .
To make this , I downloaded public data from Hipparcos , a satellite launched by the European Space Agency in 1989 that accurately measured over a hundred thousand stars .
The data I downloaded contains position , parallax , magnitude , and color information , among other things .
I used this information to plot the brightest stars , and cause them to revolve about Polaris ( the North Star ) very slowly , as the stars appear to do .
Like the night sky , this is a sidereal time clock -- it takes nearly 24 hours for the stars to fully rotate .
You 'll notice some familiar constellations , such as the Big Dipper in there .
As the stars cross zero and 180 degrees , indicated by the center line , the clock plays an individual note , or chime for each star .
The pitch of the chime is based on the star 's BV measurement ( which roughly corresponds to color or temperature ) .
The volume is based on the star 's magnitude , or apparent brightness , and the stereo panning is based on the position on the screen ( use headphones to hear it better ) .
Basically , this is a very literal kind of " music of the spheres , " and is typical of my projects , which often involve circles and music .
This idea for making a music box out of stars was a natural progression from some previous projects of mine , like the Whitney Music Box , and Musical Chess , which you might also enjoy .

Anyway .
When I was a freshman at the University of Science , I took an expository writing course , designed to teach people how to write simple , straightforward essays with a clear premise and supportive , information - laden sentences .
The idea was to strip away all non-essential information , so the premise of one 's essay shone through , leaving the reader 100 % , rock - solidly clear on what point one was making .
While I was taking that course , my classmate Hal Bodley of MLB.com was partying and making out with his girlfriend and cooking up this gem : which gives expository writing , the concept of " the essay , " and the notions of clarity and the logic - supported argument a giant middle finger .

Jeter deserving of AL MVP Award
Premise .
Yankees captain 's campaign more than simply numbers
Immediate obfuscation of premise .
Off to a good start .
If Albert Pujols is a slam - dunk to win the National League Most Valuable Player Award , Derek Jeter is not too far behind to take the American League MVP Award .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Unsupportable jibber - jabber .
Here are Pujols 's stats : 1.000/1.000/4.000/5.000 .
That 's right .
He is batting a thousand , with a thousand OBP ( naturally ) , and every hit has been a home run , and thus his OPS is a perfect 5.000 .
( Why are n't people talking about this more ?
It has to be some kind of record . )
He is the best baseball player in the world .
Sometimes he hits without a bat just to give the other team a chance .
La Russa gave him a day off last week , and he spent it with his family watching " G - Force , " and he still went 3 - 3 .
Congress just enacted a law making it illegal to watch him play without the aid of a radiation blast shield .

Derek Jeter , on the other hand , is an excellent baseball player having a very , very good year .
.331/.398/.469/.867. 17 HR , 101 runs , 192 hits .
At SS , which is obviously quite valuable .
I will not quibble if he wins the MVP , but it should be noted that Joe Mauer is having a much better year , at the only position more valuable than SS .
Mauer is .368/.433/.606/1.039 , with 10 more HR .
That 's a better BA , better OBP , better SLG , and far more HR .
For you VORPies out there ( hey , VORPies ! )
Mauer is blowing Jeter 's doors off , 81.3 to 59.8 .
Therefore , Hal Bodley , Derek Jeter is way , way less of a " slam dunk " for his league 's MVP than Albert Pujols .
Now …make some crazy arguments why I 'm wrong !
Go !
When Jeter passed Lou Gehrig 's record that had stood for more than 70 years over the weekend for most hits by a Yankees player , he sealed the deal .
Not that crazy !
Aaaagghhhhhhh !
My eyes !

Achieving the all - time hit record for a franchise – and I could be wrong here – and pardon me , sincerely , if I am – but I really do not believe I am – but again , if I am , please , please forgive me kind sir , for I am but a humble blogger , and you work for MLB.com , so your expertise in the matter is not to be taken lightly , and I understand that – but in any case , what I was about to say was : achieving the all - time hit record for a franchise is , to the best of my knowledge , not fucking relevant one tiny fucking bit .
Sure , you can argue the honor should go to the Minnesota Twins ' Joe Mauer , or even Jeter 's teammate , Mark Teixeira , but if the Yankees captain is n't MVP , the voting baseball writers should be investigated .
The BBWAA should be investigated .
For giving the MVP .
To someone .
Who is having .
A. Better .
Year .
Sure , you can argue that " Revolver " is a better album then David Lee Roth 's " Eat ‘ Em and Smile , " but David Lee Roth 's " Eat ‘ Em and Smile " should still win the award for best album ever .
I mean , that 's a no -brainer .

When Jeter collected his 2,722nd hit at Yankee Stadium late Friday night , it was another of those cherished moments in baseball history — like the night in 1985 , when Pete Rose passed Ty Cobb 's all - time hits record , or 1995 , when Gehrig 's consecutive games record was shattered by Cal Ripken Jr .
No , sir , it was not .
It was not like that .
Because Pete Rose broke the all - time record for hits .
That 's the most fundamental , salt - of - the - baseball - earth record that exists .
Hits .
He has the most hits .
That 's so , just , rock - solid and American .
And when Ripken showed up that day and went to work , he had been at work every single day for like 13 + years .
No sick days , no injury days , no " I do n't feel like it " days .
And at the time , coming off the strike , what he did really helped the average baseball fan reconnect with the game , I think .
It helped take the edge off the " millionaires fighting billionaires " thing that was legitimately threatening the sport .
Ripken and Rose transcended .

Derek Jeter broke his team record for hits .
I know the team is a famous team , and has had many great players , but can we get a fucking grip ?
Does anyone who 's not a Yankee fan give a shit about Derek Jeter breaking his team record for hits ?
He 's a great player , he 's 35 , he 's very good at baseball , he 's a Hall of Famer .
But you 're trying to tell me that Derek Jeter breaking his team record for hits was as cherished a moment in baseball history as Pete Rose breaking the ALL - TIME RECORD FOR HITS FROM ALL PEOPLE ON ALL TEAMS EVERYWHERE IN HISTORY ?
Advertisement
Oh – wait .
No .
You 're not .
What you 're actually trying to do is way crazier , which is to tell me that the fact that Derek Jeter broke his team record for hits means that he should be the 2009 AL MVP .
The legendary Gehrig , also a Yankees captain , was beloved and respected and for someone with the same admirable qualities to now hold this record is fitting .

Re : MVP Voting
Hey Guys ,
Just wanted to remind you of the guidelines for MVP voting , because there 's been some confusion this year .
It 's really quite simple .
You should cast your vote based on these four criteria :
1 . Is the player beloved ?
2 . Is the player respected ?
3 . Is the player a Yankee ?
4 . Did the player do something that another Yankee – who was also beloved and respected – had once done ?

Any questions , please direct them to Jeannie in my office .
She can send you a type - written sheet with these guidelines , which can be mounted side - by - side with a picture of Derek Jeter pumping his fist and will be suitable for framing .
Cordially ,
Bud Selig
The MVP Award should go to the player whose leadership and value has contributed to his team 's success more than any other individual .
Jeter has been that player for the Yankees as they storm to another AL East title .

Derek Jeter is seventh in OPS .
On his own team .
He is eighth in HR .
He is sixth on his team in doubles .
Sixth !
The guy who hits seventh on the Yankees has an .865 OPS ( same as Jeter ) and is hitting .319 and plays second base .
The guy who hits eighth on the Yankees has 27 home runs .
The Yankees have pinch - hitters who are better than anyone on the A's .
The Yankees ' line - up is looney - tunes .
Also , they have some pitchers who are good .
The Twins , meanwhile , have Joe Mauer and fourteen guys who either are Nick Punto or look and play exactly like Nick Punto .
There may be teammates who have higher batting averages , hit more homers , driven in more runs , but no one has been more valuable to the Yankees this season .

( And for the record , what I think of is George Steinbrenner being banned for life for spying on Dave Winfield , Chuck Knoblauch 's phantom tag on Jose Offerman , and how for some reason when Jeffrey Maier cheated and turned a Derek Jeter fly ball out into a home run , that somehow meant that Derek Jeter = super clutch . )
Years from now , Jeter 's name will be uttered in the same breath .

It 's amazing none reached the 3,000 - hit standard .

Did you guys know that if you tried to reach the moon by stacking nickels on top of each other , it would take more than 4 trillion nickels ?
Is n't that amazing ?
I agree .
So we 're in agreement — let 's give Derek Jeter the 2009 AL MVP .
" For those who say today 's game cannot produce legendary players , I have two words : Derek Jeter , " Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said in a statement after the record fell .
… Who said today 's game cannot produce legendary players ?
" As historic and significant as becoming the Yankees ' all - time hits leader is , the accomplishment is all the more impressive because Derek is one of the finest young men playing the game today . "
That 's a very nice sentiment , Person Who Pretended to be George Steinbrenner and Wrote That .
Well done .
When I read Steinbrenner 's words , I thought back to a day in his Tampa office at nearly a decade ago when he complained about the fact Jeter 's nightlife was a distraction to his on - field play .
Quick reminder : this article is supposed to be about why Derek Jeter is a " slam - dunk " for 2009 AL MVP .
We are off course , now , a little , I think .

The Boss had learned his shortstop had been out late the night before a game at a birthday party .
" Let me put it this way : I think Derek had better pay more attention to the ballgame than he does the women , " Steinbrenner said .
" I love him , but during the season , I want him completely concentrating on the team . "

To seal the relationship not too long after , the Boss and Jeter made a Visa TV commercial that made light of the Jeter 's late - night escapades .
It was hilarious .

Re : MVP Voting
Hey Guys ,
Sorry – huge mistake in the last memo .
Forgot to add – and I know you already know this – that your vote for 2009 AL MVP should also take into account whether the Yankee you are voting for has ever made a fucking VISA commercial .
And it goes without saying that your vote should take into account whether or not Hal Bodley thought the commercial was humorous .

Sorry about cursing in this letter ,
Bud Selig
Jeter , 35 , grew up a Yankees fan and has worn the prestigious pinstripes with pride .
What are we even talking about , at this point ?
Advertisement
Through Sunday 's games , Mauer leads the AL with a .366 batting average .
Jeter is fourth at .332 , with 17 homers , 63 RBIs and 192 hits .
This is just dropped in , to the middle of this argument , with no explanation .
It 's like writing a long , long essay about how Brazil is the largest country in the world , and then casually mentioning , thirty paragraphs in , that Russia is actually way bigger .
For now , though , talk of the MVP Award is far down Jeter 's list of priorities .
The closest he 's come to the honor was in 2006 , when he finished second to Minnesota 's Justin Morneau .
2006 is the year this article should have been written .
Derek Jeter absolutely deserved the MVP in 2006 .
Led the league in VORP .
Morneau was a horrifyingly bad choice – 13th in VORP ( Mauer was 4th ) and was the winner due mostly to things like RBI and maybe Canadianness or something .
2006 = Jeter , easily .
2009 = Mauer .
Although , now that I think about it , has Mauer broken one single career team record in anything ?!
Or done one credit card commercial with Carl Pohlad ?!?!
Advertisement
Gehrig was MVP just once — in 1936 , when he batted .354 with 49 homers , 152 RBIs and 205 hits .
Seriously .
What are we talking about ?
" I 've always had a tough time in my career enjoying things as they happen , because I 'm always trying to look to the next game , " Jeter said .
" It was devastating and a great disappointment not getting to the playoffs last year .
Returning is our main goal now . "
Why put this quote here ?
This has nothing to do with the previous paragraph , and less to do with the next .
Were she to read this , Mrs. Wehrtover would get out her famous red pen and write , " This is fucking nonsense " and set your essay on fire .
Then she would remove the pencil from her hair and take off her glasses and oh my God Mrs.
Wehrtover is a super hottie !!!!
Around the Yankees clubhouse , Jeter is the MVP .

Re : MVP Voting
Hey Guys ,
One last thing .
It goes without saying that you should also take into consideration what the Yankee players think .
Advertisement
Kanye was framed ,
Bud Selig
Manager Joe Girardi wo n't say that , but puts his sentiments this way : " Derek is doing everything for us .
He 's stealing bases , playing good defense and getting on base early in the game .
Advertisement
" The way he gets us started is incredible .
He 's up in the first inning , and it is like he 's saying , ' It 's time to play right now .
Let 's get started .
Let 's not wait three or four innings to go after them . ' "
This is the longest article ever written .
Thank God I do n't have to analyze it for no reason and send it to someone I 've never met so he can publish it on a blog I do n't write for .
I think it 's pretty goddamn obvious that Derek Jeter should be the MVP .
I mean , we 've established that he set the Yankee career record for hits this year , which is traditionally a rubber - stamp for AL MVP .
We 've established that he and his owner once filmed a commercial for a credit card company , which should end the debate right there .
But just to be extra , extra sure Derek Jeter deserves the 2009 AL MVP , can we just real quick check in with Johnny Damon to make sure that Damon can characterize Jeter with one of the most boring and least - descriptive baseball clichés known to man ?
When outfielder Johnny Damon came to the Yankees after playing for the Red Sox , he said , " There 's something about Derek that I found out :
He makes everyone around him play better . "

Well there you go .
That about does it .
Although , there is some question , regarding Jeter 's candidacy for 2009 AL MVP , about whether he wears the pinstripes with the requisite pride both on and off the field .
Jeter is not only a leader when he 's wearing the pinstripes in the clubhouse and on the field , he carries that same persona away from Yankee Stadium .
Man , Bodley – you are covering every conceivable angle of Derek Jeter 's candidacy for 2009 AL MVP .
I mean , I do still have some MVP - related questions in re : whether Jeter takes time for people who approach him , even on dark days .
I can never remember him embarrassing the Yankees .
He seems to always take time for most anyone who approaches him , even on dark days .
Check .
Great work .
And I 'm glad you do nothing at all to explain what the fuck " He seems to always take time for most anyone who approaches him , even on dark days " means .
Because that is definitely a crystal clear sentence , when you are talking about whether someone should be MVP of the AL .
... this is arguably Jeter 's finest year and it will be a shame if MVP voters do n't examine closely his season .
It 's much more than mere numbers .
Advertisement
Amen , brother .
The MVP is about taking time for most anyone who approaches someone , even on dark days .
It 's about VISA ads and being 21.5 runs behind the league leader in VORP and wearing the pinstripes with pride .
It 's about calm eyes , and making people around you better .
Winning the 2009 MVP is about the sum total of all the hits you have gotten for a specific team from 1995 to the present , and whether or not anyone else who has ever played for that team accumulated more hits .
The 2009 AL MVP is about the Yankees , and Lou Gehrig , and Babe Ruth , and things Johnny Damon has " found out . "
It 's about intangibles , dammit .
Intangibles .
He has to be the AL MVP .
I could n't agree more .
" He " is Joe Mauer , right ?
I kind of tuned you out for a while .
I assume you mean Joe Mauer .
Iran 's ambassador to the UN , Mohammad Khazaee , sent a letter of protest to UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moonin which he wrote that " there is no explanation for Israel 's continuing threats against Tehran " .
He was referring to an interview given by former Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh to the Sunday Times in which he said that if Iran were not further sanctioned by this Christmas Israel would attack the country .
Sneh told the paper that if Israel were forced to attack the Islamic Republic on its own it would do so , remarks the Iranian ambassador deemed " irresponsible " .
He said he hoped the UN would take steps against such comments .
" Remarks such as these , stated once in a while by Israeli leaders , are no more than sorry excuses aimed at avoiding supplying answers regarding Israel 's nuclear arsenal and deflecting public awareness from the crimes and terror Israel commits in the region , " he said .
Khazaee once again stressed that his country 's nuclear program was intended for peaceful purposes and said that " the only threat in the region is Israel 's nuclear arsenal , which remains unsupervised to this day " .
What a week !
Bernanke tried to talk the USD up , stating that they will raise interest rates , Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœsometime in the futureÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
All he succeeded in doing was push bond yields higher , while the greenback managed to print yearly lows vs. its major trading partners .
Trichet had similar luck .
Central Bankers are in fact bowing to their own domestic pressures and trying to appease the electoral vote by wanting a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœstrongerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ dollar policy .
Trichet went as far as to concede that the vision of the EUR was never to be used as Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœtheÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ reserve currency .
Record earnings managed to push the Dow through the psychological 10,000 handle , and gold and oil to record highs .
Where to now ?
WhatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s actually making sense ?
The Fed sees tepid growth , unemployment to push through 10 % , record foreclosures and no inflation worries .
The dollar will remain the whipping boy .
Yields will continue to push higher and equities a crap - shoot .
All is still cheap to foreign investors !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 12 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
A plethora of US data yesterday with some mixed results .
Initial jobless claims remain stubbornly high and well above that psychological +500 k print at +514 k .
However , it does remain in a deceiving downward trend , falling - 10 k w/w .
Continuing claims fell below +6 m for the 1st - time in 7 - months ( +5.992 m ) , and with continuing claims remaining buoyant , this headline can only be a temporary blip .
What seems to be bothering analysts most is the divergence between the NFP numbers , which show a decline in employment and the claims headline remaining at lofty heights .
On the flip side and the most discouraging part of yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s report was that the extended benefits ( +471 k vs. +465 k ) and the emergency unemployment compensation ( +3.321 m vs. +3.331 m ) moved higher , w/w .
One can only conclude that job prospects remain scarce and that individualÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s duration without a job is getting longer .
Economists will tell you that the average number of weeks unemployed has now risen to new record level of 26.2 !
Continuing claims last for 26 - weeks before potential workers need to apply for the two emergency programs .
That is approximately + 10.4 m people without a job .
The scary part is that this is the numbers who are eligible for benefits !
More benign was the US inflation report .
It remains close to home and well anchored , harming no - one , not even the Fed .
Both the headline and core were very much inline with expectations ( +0.2 % and +0.2 % , m / m , respectively and - 1.3 % and - 1.5 % , y/y ) .
It seems that excess capacity is keeping pricing power behind the curve across the US economy .
This week some FOMC members have argued that inflation is pointing north , but , the majority believe that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœinflation will remain subdued well into next yearÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s this that will keep the Fed on the sidelines until the middle of 2010 .
It seems that various asset classes are being overly aggressive in pricing in rate hikes any time soon ( Gold and FI ) .
Digging deeper , it was not surprising to see that higher gas prices was the main culprit in trying to lift the headline CPI .
A similar decline in food prices managed to offset energyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s gain .
RealtyTrac Inc. did not bring a smile to many faces yesterday when they announced that US foreclosure filings surged to a new record in the 3rd Q on the back of lenders seizing more properties from delinquent borrowers .
Close to +940 k homes received a notice or were repossessed , that a whopping +23 % increase y/y .
It looks like Banks are becoming bigger and bigger real estate brokers , just like the Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢80 in the UK !
To put it in perspective , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 1 out of every 136 households receiving some sort of legal filing .
And the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœpowers that beÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ continue to tell us that the worst of the housing bubble is over , surely not !
Manufacturing expansion was moderate from the Philly Fed ( +11.5 vs. +14.1 , m /m ) unlike the Empire Index ( +34.6 vs. +18.2 ) .
The sub-categories for the Philly were mixed to soft , with one stand out headline and that was in inventories .
They managed to plummet to - 31.8 this month from a Sept. reading of - 18.1 .
Strong evidence that inventory drawdown continues .
The index measuring the outlook for the next 6 - months fell to 39.8 from 47.8 ( the lowest level in 6 - months ) , while new orders advanced to 6.2 ( the highest level since the beginning of the recession ) .
However , employment continues to contract , but at a slower pace ( - 6.8 vs. - 14.3 ) .
The USD $ is currently higher against the EUR - 0.22 % , CHF - 0.21 % , JPY - 0.62 % and lower against GBP + 0.25 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD - 0.05 % and AUD +0.02 % .
Canadian data yesterday managed to knock the loonie off its highs despite rabid crude prices .
Weaker Canadian manufacturing sales suggest that JulyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s headline was a temporary blimp ( - 2.1 % vs. +5.2 % ) .
The weakness was concentrated in volume terms , which will have a negative impact on real GDP in Aug .
The blip in July could be attributed to the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœcash - for - clunkersÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ program in the US .
This Aug. headline print suggests that the Canadian recovery will be slow and tepid , exactly what the BOC has suggested , impeded by both high inventory levels ( inventory - sales ratio at 1.49 , pre-recession it was 1.3 ) and a strong loonie !
With less than a week away from the next BOC meeting , dealers were better sellers of their own domestic currency believing that the recent rapid rise has come Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœtoo far and too fastÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Option traders continue to bet heavily that the CAD will reach parity by year end .
Currently it stands at 67 % .
For now , look for investors to be better buyers of USD on pull backs and lock in profits .
The AUD managed to print new 14 - month highs in the O/N session after RBA Stevens said that policy makers Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcannot be too timid in raising its benchmark interest rate now that the threat of an economic crisis in the nation has passedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ ( 3.25 % ) .
A stronger business confidence print this year was one of the reasons why Governor Stevens at the RBA remains a firm hawk .
I guess he now will show rapid normalization of interest rates .
What about AUD at parity ?
( 0.9216 )
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 77.54 down - 4 c ) .
Forget $ 75 , how about $ 77 ?
We managed to print new yearly highs yesterday after the weekly EIA report showed that inventory levels for gas unexpectedly declined as refineries idled units for maintenance .
Even the dollar showing signs of life was unable to curtail prices .
Weekly gas inventories plummeted - 5.23 m barrels w/w , and the largest drop in over a year .
Consensus expected a + 1.13 m barrel weekly increase .
With refineries operating at 80.9 % of capacity , the lowest level in 6 - months , gas output declined 10 % , the most in 13 - months .
To put that in prospective , refineries have reduced their output by - 964 k barrels a day to + 8.45 m !
The decline has left inventories at 209.2 m barrels .
On the flip side , inventories of crude rose + 334 k barrels to +337.8 m vs. an estimated weekly increase of +1 m barrels .
Over all the report was very bullish for products .
Weekly fuel imports plummeted - 13 % to +2.53 m barrels a day .
The recent plunge in the value of the greenback has convinced speculators to purchase crude and other commodities as a hedge against inflation .
Dealers continue to speculate that demand will increase amid signs that the global economy is emerging from this recession .
Despite the weekly negative US numbers , global output remains healthy .
Russia increased its production last month and has now surpassed Saudi Arabia as the largest produce .
LetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s see if equities can support these loft commodity prices !
Prudent feelings dictated speculators actions yesterday .
The yellow metal managed to retreat the most in 3 - weeks during yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s session as investors booked profits close to record highs to close out a winning week ( $ 1,049 ) .
The Nikkei closed at 10,257 up +19 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,861 up +30 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 5,253 up +30 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year bonds backed up 4 bp yesterday ( 3.47 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasuries managed to remain under pressure on the back of various FedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s manufacturing reports last month ( see above ) , which came in stronger than expected and provided further evidence that the US economy maybe emerging from its worst slump in over 50 - years .
The long end of the yield curve led the decline and 2Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s / 10 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s have managed to widen the most in 3 - weeks ( 250 ) .
Analysts believe that there is good technical support at 3.50 % the first time around .
However , looking at the big picture , Treasury buybacks are almost over .
MBS buybacks have about $ 250 b to go .
The US Treasury still has to raise $ 1.8t per year ( more pressure on the curve ) .
Despite the USD encroaching on a 14 - month low , analysts foresee 4 % 10 - yr notes before the year - end and 4.5 % by middle of next year !

GlaxoSmithKline says other lots of the vaccine are not affected
GlaxoSmithKline has advised doctors in Canada to stop using a batch of its swine flu vaccine , amid reports of severe side - effects in some patients .
The batch of some 170,000 doses was put on voluntary hold because of a reported higher than usual number of patients having anaphylactic reactions .
This may include breathing problems , raised heart rate and skin rashes .
The pharmaceutical company said it had advised that one lot of the Arepanrix vaccine should not be used .
Reports said one in 20,000 people suffered adverse reactions to the batch .
This is five times the expected number .
None of the patients reportedly suffered long - term ill - effects .
Voluntary hold
In a statement issued on Tuesday , the company said that following discussions with Canadian health authorities , it was advising a batch of the Arepanrix vaccine with the lot number A80CA007A to be put on hold as a precautionary measure .
GSK said it was taking this action " as a result of a higher than expected rate of serious allergic reactions related to this lot number compared to other lots " .
The company said no such reactions had been seen with other lots and that they were unaffected by the voluntary hold .
To date some 15 million doses of Arepanrix have been distributed across Canada and overall the frequency of severe allergic reaction following immunisation was less than one event per 100,000 , GSK 's statement said .
" This rate does not exceed the rates typically reported for other vaccines , " GSK said .
A question came up on the boards .ie programming forum a week or so ago about whether to write apps for the iPhone or the Android platform .
With Suura , we ’ve been looking at what platforms to write clients for ( and which to write for first ) , and it occurs to me that the data on what ’s actually going on and what the hype is pushing are monumentally disparate .
Believe the hype and the competition is all between Android and WebOS .
Thing is , all that noise is ignoring a few details .
First off , both are tiny .
In the telecoms market , even the iPhone is a niche player .
Take mobile internet usage – yes , it ’s growing , and at a rate noone expected , but look at how much of the overall total is made up of phone browsing compared to laptop browsing in these statistics released by Boingo in June this year :
Yes , it ’s rising and I ’d be surprised if it tailed off tomorrow , but it ’s still only a small part of a niche market – do n’t forget that the telecoms market is seeing 50 % global market penetration at the moment and is looking to improve on that .
That ’s one mobile phone ( of any type ) for every two humans on the planet .
Unless you ’re talking clothes or food , odds are you ’ve never even seen a commodity that sells that well , let alone a high - tech one .
So the mobile internet is still quite a small part of the overall picture here .
But even setting that dose of perspective aside , and looking only at the niche of the niche , what ’s the breakdown of devices ?
Again looking at Boingo ’s statistics reveals an interesting story .
Everyone says the iPhone was a gamechanger , but you really have to look at the figures to see how true that is :
And it ’s not just Boingo reporting this , the Q3 data from JiWire tells a similar story :
So the iPhone / iPod Touch has gone from nothing to well over 90 % of the US market in the space of two years .
That ’s phenonomal growth , and nothing ’s even close to touching it right now .
On the global side of things , it ’s not quite so dramatic but that ’s more down to inertia and the size of the market than anything else – even in the last six months there ’s been significant change according to AdMob ’s latest statistics :
Now granted , all of this also means that something that ’s currently nothing could be eating Apple ’s lunch in two years time , but I do n’t think that ’s very likely for two reasons .
Firstly , the iPhone really was something new – it did n’t try to be a phone first but to be a communications device first .
The “ Phone ” in “ iPhone ” is really a misnomer , it ’s nowhere near being as primary a function as the name suggests .
But “ iCom ” was already taken :
Secondly , to compete with the iPhone , you ’re going to have to have an integrated approach – hardware and software design .
That ’s not a trivial problem , it ’s one of the more hinky embedded system problems around at the moment .
Apple are very good at this sort of thing and it takes a fair bit of know - how to be a threat to them .
Being a slightly better iPhone is just not going to be enough to compete , especially given the marketshare the iPhone currently enjoys .
So for the moment ( and the immediately foreseeable future ) , the platform for anyone looking to sell mobile apps is the iPhone , regardless of the hype surrounding Android , WebOS or Moblin .
Personally , however , I think the “ Next Big Thing ” is n’t really being talked about much right now .
It ’s going to be an iCom rather than an iPhone , the looks are going to be important , but more than that it ’s going to need some major backing .
I think myself that the best looking contender out there right now is the Nokia N900 .
Look , everyone thinks Android ’s hot because Google is big .
But Google is n’t big .
Not compared to Nokia .
Nokia has a bad day – Finland ’s GDP takes a hit .
That is what “ big ” means .
And with Nokia dropping the horrible developer experience that S60 development is , and taking on some hefty open source projects like Maemo and Qt to build the N900 , and having an app store ( Ovi ) already running ( even if it ’s a pain in the fundament to use right now ) , they have a real shot at eating Apple ’s lunch .
The only missing piece from the N900 , the thing that would have made it a major threat , would have been the inclusion of GAN hardware in the phone ( if the operators could offload from 3G to Wifi on the fly with GAN , they ’d want the N900 out there with a vengeance ) .
Still though , if you had to seek out the next big thing – I ’d be looking at the Maemo platform very hard indeed .
According to Andrew Ross Sorkin's new book , which is out today , the Treasury department , and Hank Paulson in particular , have some new disclosure issues to discuss next time there is a hearing on matters of the financial crisis .
Sorkin points out that in June 2008 , at a time when Goldman 's Board of Directors was in Moscow for a meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev , then Treasury Secretary Paulson decided to invite the entire BOD to his hotel suite in a meeting that would be " off the record " as it was considered a social event .
Among the events discussed were : economic forecasts , the prospects of banks blowing up ( like Lehman ) , as well as previews of his upcoming speech .
How this occurred in an uncalendarized meeting where there was material disclosure , boggles the mind .
From Sorkin ( via Felix Salmon ) :
When Paulson learned that Goldman ’s board would be in Moscow at the same time as him , he had [ Treasury chief of staff ] Jim Wilkinson organize a meeting with them .
Nothing formal , purely social — for old times ’ sake .
For fuck ’s sake !
Wilkinson thought .
He and Treasury had had enough trouble trying to fend off all the Goldman Sachs conspiracy theories constantly being bandied about in Washington and on Wall Street .
A private meeting with its board ?
In Moscow ?
For the nearly two years that Paulson had been Treasury secretary he had not met privately with the board of any company , except for briefly dropping by a cocktail party that Larry Fink ’s BlackRock was holding for its directors at the Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi in June .
Anxious about the prospect of such a meeting , Wilkinson called to get approval from Treasury ’s general counsel .
Bob Hoyt , who was n’t enamored of the “ optics ” of such a meeting , said that as long as it remained a “ social event , ” it would n’t run afoul of the ethics guidelines .
Still , Wilkinson had told [ Goldman chief of staff John ]
Rogers , “ Let ’s keep this quiet , ” as the two coordinated the details .
They agreed that Goldman ’s directors would join him in his hotel suite following their dinner with Gorbachev .
Paulson would not record the “ social event ” on his official calendar …
“ Come on in , ” a buoyant Paulson said as he greeted everyone , shaking hands and giving bear hugs to some .
For the next hour , Paulson regaled his old friends with stories about his time in Treasury and his prognostications about the economy .
They questioned him about the possibility of another bank blowing up , like Lehman , and he talked about the need for the government to have the power to wind down troubled firms , offering a preview of his upcoming speech .
A few relevant questions should be addressed : i ) how was this meeting considered to be a " social event " if such critical matters as the economy , Dick Fuld 's subsequent implosion , and speech drafts were being discussed behind closed doors ; ii ) what are the guidelines that Wilkinson , or any other Chief of Staff for that matter , use when determining what meeting is considered to be " off the record " ; iii ) this is merely one example of a " behind closed doors " meeting ( it just so happens to have been with Goldman ) - how many other times did the Treasury permit such comparable other meetings in the past , and what was discussed on them ?
One wonders whether a FOIA request for this information would even garner any relevant information as all the occurrences happened off the US Treasury 's record .
Yet , in keeping with the administration 's professed desire for increased transparency there has to be a way to achieve some disclosure of what Hank Paulson , who is already in hot water with regard to his Bank of America involvement , had been doing , especially if it was unilaterally beneficial to his former employer .

Hand Block Printing on textiles refers to the technique by which carved wooden blocks covered with dye are repeatedly pressed along a length of cloth to create patterns .
Though block printing is said to be over 2000 years old , and was first developed in China , the earliest known example is the Diamond Sutra from 868 AD , currently in the British museum .
edit ]
Why should I be aware of this ?
Hand Block
Printing is such an art which can be used for making every design , every piece of cloth unique and different from others , which could never be possible by using automated machinery wherein 100s of metres of fabric would come out in the same design and color .
By promoting block printing on textiles we promote an art which might be taken over by less expensive machine made products .
It provides sustainable livelihood to many local families .
It is skill passed through many generations and should be preserved .
What makes this technique unique is the fact that the design has to be first carved onto the wooden block by hand , and then executed on the fabric .
It is the essence of India and the crafts that make India stand out in the world , one of the numerous arts and crafts that are slowly dyeing and so have to be renewed and brought back to life

All about Block Printing on Textiles
In India , the art of Hand block printing has passed from generation to generation , and has traditionally been done using Natural Dyes .
Various garments like saris , kurtas , shirts , salwar kameez , dupattas , skirts , etc are made using block printing .
In recent times , the export of block printed garments have grown many times over as its demand has increased especially in the western countries because of its durability and distinctive patterns and designs .
edit ] Techniques of Block Printing
Direct Block Printing --
In this technique , the cotton or silk cloth is first bleached .
Then the fabric is dyed , unless a light background is desired .
Thereafter , the fabric is printed using carved blocks ; first the outline blocks , then the ones to fill color .
The famous prints of Bagh ( from Madhya Pradesh ) and Bagru ( from Rajasthan ) are made using this technique .

Resist Printing --
In the resist technique , areas that are to be protected from the dye are covered with a mixture of clay and resin .
The dyed fabric is then washed .
The dye spreads into the protected areas through cracks , producing a rippled effect .
Block prints are then used to create further designs .
Ajrakh Printing of Kutch ( India ) and Sindh ( Pakistan ) and Kalamkari from South India use this technique .

Discharge Printing --
In this technique , the fabric is dyed .
Then , a chemical is used to remove the dye from the portions that are to have designs in different colour .
These portions are then treated , so they may be re-colored .
edit ] Hand Block Printing in India
There is no doubt that factory - printed textiles are often cheaper , and perhaps more colour fast compared to block printed fabrics .
However , block printing represents a craft that provides a sustainable livelihood to rural artisans in the third world .
It reflects human labour and the sensibilities of the craftsman , which no machine made fabric can ever do .
Archeological remains from the Indus Valley civilisation in the 3rd millennium BC include cotton fragments dyed with madder , a dye commonly used for Block Printing even today .
Dye vats , spindles and bronze needles found at sites like Mohenjedaro indicate highly developed fabric work .
Today , Block Printing is practiced in several Indian states .
In Gujarat , hand printing has been practiced and perpetuated by the Paithapur families .
They make intricate blocks , and print their textiles using the mud resist - Printing method .
These prints are called Sodagiri ( trader ) prints .
In Kutch , the popular patterns are black and red designs of birds , animals , and dancing girls .
The saris of Ahmedabad and Baroda have large mango patterns against a red or blue background .
The other well known centers for Block Printing in Gujarat are Bhavnagar , Vasna , Rajkot , Jamnagar , Jetpur and Porbandar .
In Rajasthan , colorful Block Prints of birds , animals , human figures , gods and goddesses are popular .
The important centers for this form of Hand Printing are Jaipur , Bangru , Sanganer , Pali and Barmer .
Barmer is known for its prints of red chillies with blue - black outlines , surrounded by flower - laden trees .
The other famous prints are of horses , camels , peacocks and lions , called Sikar and Shekahawat prints .
In Madhya Pradesh , printed textiles are created by a community of printers called Chheepa ( derived from the Hindi word chhapna meaning printing ) .
The printers of Bagh use vegetable and Natural Dyes , in bright shades of red and black and also occasional indigo .
The blocks are made of intricately stylized motifs , which have evolved over hundred of years .
These prints have a tonal and a three dimensional effect which is impossible to replicate in the screen printing or machine printing process .
edit ] Process of Block Printing
First , the fabric to be printed is washed free of starch and soft bleached .
If dyeing is required ( as in the case of saris where borders or the body is tied and dyed ) it is done before printing .
The fabric is again washed to remove excess dye and dried thoroughly .
The fabric is stretched over the printing table and fastened with small pins .
This is an important stage as there should be a uniform tension in the fabric with no ripples .
The colour pigments to be used are kept in a tray on a wheeled wooden trolley with racks which the printer drags along as he works .
On the lower shelves printing blocks are kept ready .
Under the pigment tray is another tray containing a thick viscous liquid made from pigment binder and glue .
This gives the color tray a soft base which helps to spread color evenly on the wooden block .
The printing starts from left to right .
The color is evened out in the tray with a wedge of wood and the block dipped into the outline color ( usually black or a dark color ) .
When the block is applied to the fabric , it is slammed hard with the fist on the back of the handle so that a good impression may register .
This job is usually done by an expert printer who ensures the effect is continuous and not disjoined .
If it is a multiple color design , the second printer dips his block in color again and prints on top of the outline made by the first block .
The third color if required follows likewise , precisely aligning the block each time .
Skill is necessary for good printing since the colors need to dovetail into the design to make it a composite whole .
The fabric is sun-dried , which is part of the colour - fixing process .
It is rolled in wads of newspapers to prevent the dye from adhering to other layers and steamed in boilers constructed for the purpose .
After steaming , the material is washed thoroughly in large quantities of water and dried in the sun , after which it is finished by ironing out single layers , which fix the color permanently .
edit ] Printing Blocks
Some block - makers believe that many centuries ago , women got tired of their white , unembellished garmnts and began using their bangles dipped in colour to pattern their garments .
The carpenters noticed and started making designs on wood to do the same .
Thus began the tradition of making hand blocks for ptintig on textiles .
Blocks are made of seasoned teak wood by trained craftsmen .
The underside of the block has the design hand carved on it by the block maker .
Each block has a wooden handle and two to three cylindrical holes drilled into the block for free air passage and also to allow release of excess printing paste .
The new blocks are soaked in oil for ten to fifteen days to soften the grains in the timber .
edit ] Research on Bagru Printing
Kalakshetra ’s Craft Education and Research Centre has a Hand Block Printing Unit which produces sarees , dress materials and house hold linen using both natural and chemical dyes .
Research is being carried out here to revive traditional textile patterns and ancient prints and adapt them to modern usage .
edit ] Block Printing on Textiles and the environment
Block Printing on Textiles has a very small carbon footprint .
The printing and colouring process is labour intensive and uses no electricity .
The process uses vegetable dyes which are chemical free .
The material used for block printing is useually handloom or khadi , using no power .

TEHRAN -- The Trade Promotion Organization of Iran ( TPOI ) announced this week that it plans to exclude the U.S. dollar from Iran ’s foreign exchange reserves .
In line with this plan , Iran has informed Japan that it should use the yen instead of dollars to pay for the oil it buys from the Islamic Republic .
In addition , Iran has decided to open a bourse for oil and gas transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar , especially the euro .
Although the opening of the new bourse has been postponed several times , the plan shows the country ’s determination to replace the dollar in its oil and gas transactions .
The TPOI has also announced that since October 2007 Iran has sold 85 percent of its oil exports in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and is determined to sell the remaining 15 percent in other currencies such as the UAE dirham .
During his first term , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ordered that the dollar should be replaced by the euro in the transactions of Iran ’s currency reserve fund .
OTL : The Redemption of Billy Cannon
NGOLA , La. --
The prison dentist walks slowly down the gravel road past the warden 's house .
He is stooped , with a big belly , two white tufts of hair and a bald spot .
He 's got a bulbous nose and a creak in his step .
But look closer .
There are still pieces of the man he used to be .
He moves with a subtle feline grace .
He 's got the deepest blue eyes , familiar somehow , like an old photograph .
They seem to only absorb information , never giving anything away .
He 's alone , carefully making his way from the party to his white Ford truck .
He 's been on display long enough .
AP Photo Billy Cannon in December 1959 .
" I 'm going to play with my horses , " Dr. Billy Cannon says .
Even in his 72nd year , people can't help looking at him .
They see only the broadest strokes : the LSU football hero who fell unimaginably far .
Almost no one is allowed to see deeper .
He does n't like to be inspected -- once he saw me taking notes in a hotel lobby and barked , " Put that damn book up " -- because his life then becomes the property of the observer .
Of course , what he likes has n't mattered for a long time now .
For the past half century , he has existed mostly through the eyes of others , the narrative of his life in their control .
They stare , they whisper , they point .
They wonder what to make of his hard exterior , or the gruff responses he gives to strangers , or the fact that he has spent much of the past two decades in virtual seclusion .
For years , the few people he allowed to come close were left with more questions than answers .
Does he know who he is ?
Does he know what he means ?
Are his days filled with regret ?
Strangers yearn to know him , yet he seems unknowable , to the men who played with him , maybe even to himself .
He gave me more time than he 's ever given a writer before , and for every moment I thought I understood him , there were two more that made me sure I did n't know what he thought about anything .
His own college coach says he did n't really like the younger , more arrogant version of this old man inching down the hill .
Still , people keep trying , like the guy earlier today , at the party before the annual prison rodeo .
He spotted the dentist across the warden 's front yard , began the slow but inevitable dance over , until , finally , they stood just feet apart .
" Are you Billy Cannon ? " he asked .
" I'm what 's left of him , " the dentist said .
Birth of a legend
Recently , I invited the current LSU running back to watch The Punt Return .
No other description is needed , and Charles Scott walks into the Tigers ' team meeting room , ready for the video of Billy Cannon 's 1959 Halloween run .
I ask him if he 's ever seen it before .
" Come on now , " he says .
Of course .
He 's one of a billion to hear or see and marvel at this run in the 50 years since Cannon took that Ole Miss kick 89 yards to win the game and lock up the Heisman Trophy .
The audio still plays on Louisiana radio , the video on television .
Fans paint murals of the play on the sides of RVs .
Once , in the hall of a New York hotel , I heard SEC basketball announcer Joe Dean , Jr. , do the radio play - by - play verbatim .
" The thing became a religious situation , " says Paul Dietzel , Cannon 's college coach .
Billy Cannon 's famous 1959 punt return , courtesy LSU athletics .
The black and white flickers , and Scott sees the familiar beginning : the ball bouncing at the 16 , Cannon ignoring his coach 's rule about catching balls that close to the end zone and fielding it at the 11 , turning upfield .
At the 20 , he meets the first group of tacklers .
He runs through them , legs pumping .
" Wow , " Scott says softly .
Cannon breaks the second tackle , then the third , then the fourth , fifth , sixth .
Scott can't believe how small a crack Cannon needs .
The two running backs met once , a year or so ago .
" I brought a picture of me , " Cannon told him then .
" If you do n't appreciate it , your daddy will . "
" Oh , I appreciate it , " Scott said .
" Trust me . "
Scott saw through the old body and white , thinning hair .
He saw what a lion Cannon must have been , recognized the things that do n't ever leave a star .
" He has swag , " Scott says now .
On the screen in the LSU meeting room , Cannon breaks free , as he always does , running alone down the sideline .
Scott is like generations of Tigers who 've seen The Punt Return and dreamed of becoming legends themselves , too young to realize what something like that costs .
" When you look at a play like that Halloween run , " Scott says , " you get a picture of yourself doing something that people remember forever . "
Once , Cannon was like Scott : young and strong , invincible , sure he could handle being a hero on Saturday night .
After reaching the end zone 50 years ago , he limped toward the sideline , no doubt thinking the hardest part of running that punt back was finished .
The radio announcer said , " Listen to the cheer for Billy Cannon as he comes off the field .
Great All - American . "
The crowd 's roar will make the hair stand up on your arm .
Late in the fourth quarter , Cannon led a goal - line stand and made the game - saving tackle .
Exhausted , he lay down in the tunnel , unable to make it to the locker room .
Finally , he sprawled out on a training table , holding an ice pack to his bruised face .
He gave credit to his blockers , changed into street clothes and left for a double - date with his quarterback , Warren Rabb .
They pulled up to a blue - collar joint on the tough side of Baton Rouge , near where Cannon grew up the son of a janitor , in the shadow of the refineries .
When they walked through the door , the place buzzed with excitement .
The conqueror had arrived .
People came to the table all night , in awe .
Cannon seemed uncomfortable with the attention , Rabb would remember , and did n't really want to talk about the run .
His life was changing in that room , at that table , and there was nothing he could do to stop it .
Folks imagined anyone capable of heroics must be a hero , and he was treated that way .
Eating dinner , with people pushing and crowding just to touch him , did he realize they did n't love him as much as they loved his run ?
Did he realize he was beginning a new journey , one that would take the rest of his life to complete ?

Black - and - white memories
The men who played with Billy Cannon are old now , still answering questions about The Punt Return .
They try their best to tell fascinating stories about those years , but a common thread emerges :
These are n't stories of things they did with Billy , they 're stories of things they watched Billy do .
Mostly , they watched him perform mythic feats of strength .
Once , in a track meet , he ran the 100 - yard dash in 9.4 seconds and threw the shot 54 feet .
He knocked a defender cold with a forearm .
He took a kickoff back at Texas Tech as a sophomore , and when he reached the end zone , only nine seconds had run off the clock .
The play stunned opposing players and mascot alike .
" That damn black horse , " teammate Scooter Purvis says , " he was even looking at Cannon . "
Cannon married as a freshman and lived in married student housing .
His teammates saw him in practice and in meetings , but few felt as if they ever saw inside .
Looking back , they realize they did n't really know him at all .
Even then , he was a mystery .
Dietzel describes him as " aloof " and " not one of the guys . "
They were college boys .
He was a man .
In high school , they all heard , he got arrested for going downtown and beating up local gay men for fun .
They heard whispers he worked for and ran with local union leaders and suspected mafia bosses .
He did n't seem to be controlled by the mundane human emotions and fears that consumed their lives .
Before a game , the story goes , a shaky teammate asked Billy if he was nervous .
Cannon , who made money by selling off an entire section of Tiger Stadium seats , looked up and saw his area full .
He smiled .
No , he said , he was n't nervous a bit .
There are dozens of stories like that , and who knows now whether they are true .
But they all have the same center : Rules did not apply when you could run the ball like Billy Cannon .
He had movie - star looks ; 50 years later , two coeds saw his framed college - aged picture , with that F - You jaw and unknowable eyes , and one gushed , " What a stud ! "
After college , he signed with both the AFL and the NFL , prompting a lawsuit .
He played 11 years in the pros , with Houston , Oakland and Kansas City , then came home to become an orthodontist .
Every kid in Louisiana wanted to have their teeth fixed by Billy Cannon .
The cash rolled in .
But not everything was magical :
He publicly criticized Charles McClendon , the LSU coach , and people imagined him arrogant , though their baseline of comparison was the icon they had constructed in the first place ; Billy was judged against a person he never claimed to be .
Regardless , the boy who grew up poor found himself welcome in all the private clubs , with more money than he'd ever imagined , married to his high school sweetheart , Dot , with five healthy , well - adjusted kids .
In 1983 , he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame .
Everything seemed so easy .
Maybe , his closest friends would think in years to come , too easy .

The All - American football player seemed to have it all -- success on the field , accolades , a beautiful young family .
An epic fall from grace
On July 9 , 1983 , after a lengthy surveillance , the U.S. Secret Service knocked on Dr. Billy Cannon 's door , and suddenly nothing seemed too easy anymore .
AP Photo Cannon , 46 at the time , enters the Federal Correctional Institution in Texarkana , Texas , on Monday , Sept. 12 , 1983 , to begin serving a five - year sentence for counterfeiting .
He had pleaded guilty to charges he masterminded a scheme to print and distribute $ 6 million in counterfeit bills .
The dark news spread all over the state .
Cannon , hero of Halloween night , favorite of children all over Louisiana , had been arrested for counterfeiting .
He and a gang of friends turned amateurish crooks manufactured more than $ 6 million in $ 100 bills .
They 'd passed several hundred thousand into circulation , and Cannon buried the rest of the fake money in Igloo coolers .
It was the seventh largest counterfeiting scheme in U.S. history .
Prosecutors called Cannon the ringleader .
He immediately confessed .
A different Billy Cannon emerged in the months that followed .
People read stories of investments turned sour and of properties auctioned by the sheriff .
They tuned into the news to see him walking through a phalanx of cameramen , his lawyer pushing the aggressive ones aside .
Over and over , people asked why .
Over and over , he declined to answer .
He stared straight ahead , giving away nothing , more of a mystery than ever .
Finally , Cannon stood before the judge to be sentenced .
He got five years .
Cannon left the courthouse via a back door , took off his suit jacket and , wearing a short - sleeve dress shirt , climbed into the backseat of a waiting car .
Only cameras witnessed his exit , none of the usual fans or kids pleading for autographs .
Stories ran about fathers not telling their sons the news .
The state felt betrayed .
Cannon had broken faith with the people , and they broke faith with him in return .
A stadium of fans once stood to see him run down the sideline , but people remember only a single member of the LSU family , longtime sports information director Paul Manasseh , showing up in the courtroom to support him .
The world could n't run from Billy Cannon fast enough .
The College Football Hall of Fame rescinded its honor .
Time Magazine called him " A Bogus Hero . "
His greatest moment -- The Punt Return -- became the source of his humiliation .
They showed it over and over again , not in celebration , but to set up his downfall .
Something strange began happening :
The fans who loved him because of The Punt Return found they could continue to idolize the moment while rejecting the man .
They did n't need Billy Cannon .
They just needed the run .
The feds took him to a minimum - security facility in Texas , and the " CBS Evening News " broadcast his walk from a two - tone Ford van into the prison .
He wore jeans and carried something small under his left arm .
The news cut from the prison to The Punt Return , and the reporter 's closing words sounded like a eulogy : " LSU faithful say they will fix not on this lonely walk but on those joyous autumn runs when they think of him .
This , they say , is the real Billy Cannon .
The one they want to hold in their memory . "
Why ?
Teammates called each other , trying to figure out why .
They 'd never understood the dark places that birthed his success , and now they did not understand his failure .
Did he owe the wrong people money ?
Did his race horses get him in trouble ?
Was he desperate ?
Did he feel above the law ?
Did he just not think it through ?
Cannon never has offered an explanation , except to call himself and his fellow co-conspirators the dumbest criminals ever , which only adds to his mystery .
People wondered if he had an undiagnosed mental illness .
What else made sense ?
AP Photo Nothing was easy anymore for Cannon after the fall .
They all worried about his future .
What would happen to him ?
Would he become so guarded , retreat so far into himself , that he could never come out ?
Two and a half years later , his sentence halved thanks to good behavior , he returned home .
Just about everything he 'd worked for was gone .
Other dentists stopped referring patients .
Some folks in Baton Rouge were gleeful that Cannon had been knocked off his pedestal ; toasts were raised to his demise .
Cannon , friends believe , imagined that everyone was looking at him with disgust .
Somewhere along the line , adoration for The Punt Return had been conflated with adoration of a man , and now it was confusing to everyone .
Cannon seemed to feel people no longer loved him .
Maybe they had never loved him to begin with .
The run kept playing on radio and television , but people acted as if he was n't the man who did it .
He turned inward .
" He almost went into a shell , " Purvis says .
" It hurt him so , so , so deeply that he avoided the public as much as he could . "
Years passed .
Lawsuits piled up .
Cannon owed everyone money , it seemed , and almost none was coming in .
He could n't restart his life .
He spent his days in his office , a reminder of what he'd been , alone , few patients , no staff , no working X - ray machine , out - of - date magazines , rust on the toilet .
Almost a decade after he'd gotten out of jail , a Sporting News article , headlined " An Utter Disaster , " signaled how far he 'd fallen .
Friends were quoted saying hurtful things about him .
He felt betrayed .
One of those quoted , Paul Manasseh , came by to visit .
He discovered Cannon by himself , reading the article .
Cannon found the offending quote -- " It 's a very depressing place .
Billy sits in that office all day long , all by himself .
He had to get an answering machine because of bill collectors .
He never picks up the phone until he knows who it is . " -- then , according to a friend of Cannon 's , asked if Manasseh really said that .
Manasseh acknowledged he had .
Cannon just stared at him .
Manasseh asked whether it meant their friendship was over .
Cannon just stared .
Manasseh -- the one LSU person who'd shown up at Cannon 's sentencing -- left .
The door closed behind him .
They would never speak again .
Down on the farm
The Louisiana State Penitentiary rises out of the fields at the end of the highway , tucked into a bend in the Mississippi River .
It 's been 14 years since Cannon sat in his dental office , alone , stewing over the betrayal , and now he walks through the front gate at Angola and everyone says hello .
When he enters the main building , inmates pepper him with questions about The Punt Return .
It lives on even behind prison walls .
" I saw you on TV when you made that runback and scored that touchdown , " one convict says .
" My film is turning yellow , " Cannon jokes .
" I said , ' Look at old Billy Cannon , ' " the convict says .
" He can run that thing . "
So how did he get here ?
In 1995 , nearly out of options , Cannon managed to get himself hired at Angola .
Warden Burl Cain was n't expecting much .
The dental program was in shambles , with dentists seldom coming to work and prisoners unable to get appointments .
Cain figured it could n't get any worse and that Cannon had something to prove .
Worst - case scenario ?
They had their own Heisman Trophy winner .
Cannon got right to it , firing dentists who would n't work , hiring others who would .
First as a contractor , then as a full - time employee , he scheduled all inmates for appointments , forcing them to decline if they did n't want treatment .
Cain saw all the complaints disappear .
When Billy talked about his work at the prison , you could hear the pride in his voice .
The standard glory - days stories and aw - shucks one - liners disappeared when he discussed the ins and outs of treatment .
He began to sound less like a former legend and more like a hardworking dentist .
" The man cares , " Cain says .
" The inmates love him , and because they love him , he cares more and wo n't dare let 'em down . "
Cain figured if Cannon could do that , he might be able to fix an even bigger problem : the prison 's entire medical system .
Lawsuits from prisoners plagued Cain -- the disorganized units could n't work together so he could n't provide adequate treatment to the prisoners .
" I put him over the whole hospital , " Cain says .
" Look , he 's a leader of men .
He got that whole thing organized like a team .
Here we go .
We got all legal and fixed up , and he went back to the dental office . "
The legend of The Punt Return continued to grow outside Angola , but inside , Cannon found peace , a place to keep the lives of the man and the icon separate .
" He was reclusive , " Cain says .
" It just made sense .
Do n't do interviews .
Do n't talk to anybody .
Stay out of sight , out of mind . "
The man the prisoners call " Legend " bristles at any suggestion that he 's ever not known who he is or that he's had to change , but people close to him say something wonderful happened out here at the end of the road .
For the first time since his arrest , Billy Cannon was a success .
" Once he got that job at Angola , " Purvis says , " he began to feed off that .
When he saw he could get ahold of something and start giving , start coming back , start building back , I think that was the beginning of the resurrection . "
Stepping out of the shadows
Cannon is eating in a Baton Rouge sports bar , just feet from where his Heisman Trophy is on display , when The Punt Return comes on television .
He watches , amused , as patrons stop eating and cheer each broken tackle as if seeing it for the first time , never realizing the man who actually broke those tackles is just a table away .
He can protest all he wants , but there no way anymore to deny the truth he did n't understand 50 years ago in that restaurant out on Airline Highway :
There are two of him .
Mostly , they are strangers , but the man and the icon have a responsibility to each other .
The icon can't stay safely at Angola forever ; he needs to take baby steps back into the world .
The two Billy Cannons , it seems , are beginning to understand each other at long last .
" Where do you buy experience ? " he says .
" You have to live it . "

Just a few years ago , Cannon voluntarily appeared in public , at a banquet for the LSU and Southern University football coaches .
It was the first time he'd been out with Cain , and the warden saw how the reception surprised Billy .
The most powerful people in Louisiana packed the room .
Instead of funny looks or whispers , Cannon found cheering people who loved him .
They probably had always loved him , everywhere except inside his own head .
Certainly , the disgrace lasted longer in Cannon 's imagination than it did for the folks who wanted their hero back .
They did n't need to understand him ; they just needed to see him , for him to see them , so they could remember .
" People in Louisiana were very anxious to forgive Billy Cannon , " Dietzel says , " because it did n't match up with this wonderful thing he did . "
Cannon came out gradually .
He appeared at events where he knew he'd be received well , and each successful appearance led to another .
It was almost as though he was desperate to make up for all that lost time .
He spoke at charity functions .
He signed autographs .
He even gave an interview or two .
As the 50th anniversary of the 1958 national title approached , his phone rang constantly .
Billy Cannon found himself saying yes .
He seemed to be enjoying his fame instead of needing to hide from it .
The people around Cannon noticed .
They saw the rough edges of his gruffness rounded off , his smile quicker to appear , a man growing comfortable with his life -- with all his life .
Nobody understood why this was happening .
Cannon 's openness is as mysterious as his exile .
Ultimately , the whys do n't really matter .
There are things people want to see in their heroes and , finally , as an old man , Cannon seems willing to give them what they want .
He does so with a smile and a disarming story .
It makes them happy and , surprisingly , at least to those around Cannon , makes him happy , too .
" I really like him , " says Dietzel .
" I like him a whole lot more than I did when he was younger .
He 's much more friendly .
He is a lot more humble than he used to be .
I 've been to several signings with him .
He carries on a very pleasant conversation with everyone who comes up .
I can't imagine the Billy Cannon of yesteryear doing that .
He 's just become a more genuine person . "
Close friend Boots Garland saw it two years ago , when members of the 1958 team got together in Natchitoches .
He 's spent as much time around Cannon as anyone not related to him , and he 's able to read his moods , spot the storm clouds rolling in .
Cannon signed all night , and just when he thought he was done , someone showed up with an entire box of stuff .
Garland figured an eruption was coming .
He watched , amazed , as his friend smiled and signed every last thing .
In the car back to the hotel , Garland turned to Cannon and said , " Big boy , you ai n't bad . "
" That 's when it dawned on me how well he 'd adjusted to being Billy Cannon , " Garland says , " and the obligation he had . "
The effort paid off .
Once Cannon opened himself up , so many things came back to him .
Twenty - five years after revoking his membership , in 2008 , the College Football Hall of Fame elected him again .
In late November , he walked onto the field at Tiger Stadium .
His family had told him he was being honored at halftime for his re-induction .
They had lied .
After a short presentation for the Hall of Fame , the public - address man turned everyone 's attention to the southeast corner .
A black drape fell to reveal Cannon 's No. 20 , forever looking out on the field where he made his run .
The rumble started at the top of the upper deck , and by the time it reached the field , the old stadium shook .
The announcer used the same words from so many years ago -- " Billy Cannon Great All - American " -- and the crowd got louder .
The roar would make the hair stand up on your arm .
There was poignancy in the crisp fall air , and redemption and forgiveness , too .
But there was also order :
This was how the story of The Punt Return was supposed to end .
Cannon played his role , and the fans played theirs .
Everyone felt the love in that stadium .
The fans , his friends , his family .
The people stood and screamed and clapped , and down near the end zone , Billy Cannon stared up at them , the mass of blurry colors and noise .
He licked his lips .
He swallowed hard and blinked .
" Somebody told me he had tears in his eyes , " Rabb would say later .
" I tell you what .
I 've never seen tears in Billy Cannon 's eyes . "

A man in full
Two weeks later , Cannon and his family flew to New York for the Hall of Fame celebration .
The Southeastern Conference threw him a party in a fancy Manhattan hotel .
Cannon acted blasé about recognition , but when I arrived at the ballroom early , I found the doors locked and one guy waiting to get in -- Billy Cannon .
" This ain't me , " he insisted , ever a contradiction .
Later , bouncing from party to party , he seemed to revel in his acceptance , in the reclaiming of things he 'd imagined gone forever .
But his daughter Bunnie Cannon , who traveled with him , said they had worried about losing him in the Atlanta airport and was happy to have gotten him to the Big Apple at all .
He 'd considered not coming .
" He likes his family , " Bunnie said .
" It 's peaceful .
All of this , it 's very different . "
At the news conference , with a room full of New York reporters in person and more on the phone , he wiped his forehead and then his hands .
He sweated .
This was the part his family worried about .
What if all anyone cared about was his conviction ?
What if it ruined the entire trip for him ?
Instead , predictably unpredictable , Cannon brought up his past himself .
" You should be happy you did n't have to be elected twice , " he said .
Only a few people laughed , but there was something wonderful about the silence .
The joke fell flat , but only because people did n't get it .
Some did n't remember .
Others did n't care .
They were n't seeing a disgraced legend , just someone who had won the 1959 Heisman Trophy thanks to the most famous punt return in football history .
The schism of the moment and the man was over .
When the news conference was finished , Cannon noticed an Associated Press reporter lingering , the poor guy whose job it was to ask an old man about the worst thing he 'd ever done .
Now , Cannon might be a lot of things , but he 's no dummy .
He knows no news story about him can ever run without something about the counterfeiting .
So instead of hiding from his past , he confronted it .
" The people of Louisiana are quick to love , " Cannon told the AP guy .
" They are also quick to forgive . "
When the reporter asked the question , Cannon said , " I did the crime and I did the time .
I have n't had a speeding ticket since . "
And that was it .
" You ready ? " his wife , Dot , asked .
" I'm ready to eat , " he said .
They walked out of the hotel together , headed to lunch , two generations in tow .
It had n't been easy , but Billy Cannon seemed to have emerged from his ups and downs mostly intact .
" I have n't lost anything , " he says .
" My family loves me . "
It 's all good
He uses the word " beautiful " a lot these days .
He laughs even more .
A few weeks ago , he called Garland .
He wanted to know the height of a goalpost and the thickness of a crossbar .
" Why ? " Garland asked .
AP Photo / Richard Drew Cannon in December 2008 at the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame news conference in New York City .
It seems Cannon was trying to figure out whether he could have dunked a football over it in his prime .
These are the things that take up the spare time of a Louisiana legend .
He hangs out with Dot and plays with his horses and looks forward to the holidays when his home fills up with grandchildren .
" My old daddy had a saying , " he says .
" It 's not how high the peak or how low the valley .
It 's how far across this valley we 're in .
Think about that sometime before you go to bed at night .
It 's not how high or how low .
It 's how far across . "
There is a balance now .
He goes to all sorts of public events .
He makes jokes about his stint in prison ; at a press event not long ago , he looked at the tape recorders and cracked , " The last time I saw those , the FBI was in town . "
He goes to LSU games , with grandchildren in tow , and he loves it when The Punt Return is played on the video board , not to watch himself run but to watch the faces of the little ones , see their eyes widen with each broken tackle , as the stories they 've heard about their granddaddy become real .
He enjoys that time , but he wo n't let it consume him , just as there are parts of himself he will not share with the world .
He 's seen the nature of public adoration , how it 's fickle , how it 's more about moments than men .
He guards the places in his life that might solve the mystery he presents to the world .
More than a year ago , when I asked whether I could come see his horses and his house , he snapped that he did n't want anyone there .
His horses are private .
His home is private .
He knows he's an enigma to many -- " I think I 'm pretty self - aware , " he says -- and he uses that to protect himself .
He cultivates an image of floating above his own legend ; when he let the sports bar display his trophy , he asked the guy picking it up to fib and tell reporters they found it beneath an old oil - cloth in the garage , which he did , which became another chapter in the myth .
There is utility in his persona , value in the way he interacts with the world .
" I 'm a little gruff with people I do n't know and do n't know what their ulterior motive is and do n't know what the want , " he says .
" Or what they want you to do for them .
I 'm a little gruff and defensive .
It works .
Because they will keep their distance . "
His antenna about people -- the thing that got him into so much trouble for much of his adult life -- is more finely tuned now .
" There was times right when I got out of school when everybody was a friend and everybody was a good guy , " he says .
" After a while , you say , they 're not friends and they 're really not good guys .
Now how much did it cost you to make that decision ?
Sometimes more than you want to talk about . "
The Heisman winner in winter
That 's his journey .
He 's a 72 - year - old man sitting in a white rocking chair outside the main gate of Angola .
The sky is huge , the air hot and muggy , just like Halloween 50 years ago .
That night still hangs around him , as if dawn only just took it away .
The legend is his life , the broken tackles , the Tiger Stadium roar , the adoring restaurant , all of it .
Cannon still remembers The Punt Return .
He ran so fast it was a blur .
Run toward your colors and away from theirs .
That 's what he kept telling himself as he headed toward the sideline .
The first time he saw the replay , more than a dozen years after the run , something seemed off .
Then he realized :
He remembers it in color .
His vision of his own life has always held little in common with the people who clamor to know him .
When presented with evidence that he 's changed , he just smiles and insists that he 's always known who he is .
He is man who ran through tackles .
He is a man who survived five heart bypasses and cancer .
He is a man who made millions of dollars of fake money and never really explained why .
He is a man who spent years avoiding the public , then , suddenly , handled it with ease .
He can be surrounded by people , yet remain alone inside his own mind .
He was born a mystery , and he remains one .
He stands up from the rocking chair .
He 's like a puff of smoke when he wants to disappear , just gone , a memory .
He 's headed home to his beloved horses .
He feels safe with them .
He likes to groom them alone , to watch them work their muscles .
Horses can't be known ; they can only be watched with awe .
They do n't have pasts or futures .
They only have the run .
They are at peace at full speed , the world around them a blur .
Sometimes horses win every race and pass gracefully into old age .
Sometimes even the best horses break down .
" I 've been there , done that , " he says .
" I know what it is to be the horse . "
AP Photo Cannon seems to have emerged from the challenges and victories of the past 50 years with his spirit and his legacy intact .

Atom of Atheism
Atheism is a philosophical denial of the existence of God . [ 1 ]
A more active stance affirms the nonexistence of God , and proposes positive belief rather than mere suspension of disbelief .
[ 2 ]
Materialism ( the disbelief in the spiritual realm ) , naturalism , the theory of evolution , and humanism stem inexorably from this world view .
Atheism is a rejection of claims for the existence of God . [ 1 ]
Atheism is derived from the Greek word ἄθεος , " atheos " - " a " meaning no or without and " theos " meaning God .
Atheists at times claim that they are merely " just an atheist about one more god than you are . ”
This is really a shallow understanding of the words atheism and theism and their difference .
The theist makes a positive statement for the existence of God by the proposition that " God exists " and the atheist makes the assertion that " God does not exist " .
A theist is not an atheist in any sense of the term and an atheist is not a theist in any sense of the term . [ 3 ]
The attempt to impart a universality of the word atheist to even theists fails to recognize basic dictionary definitions because the claim of a Christian theist would nullify any atheistic beliefs or claims .
Rational arguments need to be presented by each side to demonstrate that their respective claims can be sustained as a coherent worldview .
“ There is one respect , however , in which the negativity of the atheist 's belief does extend beyond God 's existence .
The atheist 's rejection of belief in God is usually accompanied by a broader rejection of any supernatural or transcendental reality .
For example , an atheist does not usually believe in the existence of immortal souls , life after death , ghosts , or supernatural powers . [ 4 ] ”
History
Ancient
Ancient history of atheism tends to begin with the Hellenistic period ushered in by Alexander the Great , and is of general prominence within the history of atheism .
The epicurean historian of various philosophical schools Philodemus ( 110 to 35 BC ) recognized essentially three schools of thought .
Firstly those who did not know if gods existed ( agnosticism ) , those who explicitly denied gods existing and then the implicit yet still clear denial .
It is this classical time period , as it is labeled , that shows a type of soft atheism .
The sketch during antiquity later drawn out and developed after the middle ages .
Anaxagoras ( ca. 500 –428 b.c. ) settled in the heart of intellectual life in Athens , Greece and actually challenged the divine presupposition the Greeks had about nature .
In other words Anaxagoras challenged the Greek view that the Sun was divine and essentially theorized it was molten metal .
[ 5 ]
It may not sound like much but within the history of atheism it is an astonishing turning point toward atheistic philosophy .
Modern
New Atheism
During the twenty - first century a new type of atheism is being characterized by prominent and popular spokesman , philosophers and scientists alike .
Richard Dawkins , Sam Harris , Daniel Dennett , and Christopher Hitchens , to name a few , are the most vocal .
They often refer to themselves in mocking terms as the four - horsemen of the new atheism .
[ 6 ]
What specifically sets new atheism apart from atheism of antiquity or twentieth century atheism even , is that new atheism is undiplomatic in approach .
The new atheists are very anti-supernatural , and thus anti-religious , considering scientism the only means to knowledge .
As an epistemology scientism is propped up by new atheists to differentiate between knowledge that is just a belief or true belief and what is justified true belief .
It is from this vantage point the new atheists tend to rail against religious and theological language as lacking any substantive meaning because it does not contain meaning that can be empirically verified .
Maintaining a consistently hostile and militant tone within writings and debates against Christianity specifically and theism more generally the obvious metaphysics of new atheism is usually that of strict materialism and naturalism .
In addition , recently there have been a number of attempts by the new atheists to redefine the meaning of atheism in order to shift the burden of proof in relation to the question of the existence of God .
However they may define the burden of proof , philosophically speaking the burden of proof is clear for a successful defense of atheism .
“ Positive atheism in the broad sense is , in turn , disbelief in all gods , with positive atheism in the narrow sense being the disbelief in a theistic God .
For positive atheism in the narrow sense to be successfully defended , two tasks must be accomplished .
First , the reasons for believing in a theistic God must be refuted ; in other words , negative atheism in the narrow sense must be established .
Second , reasons for disbelieving in the theistic God must be given . [ 7 ] ”
Epistemology of Atheism
Atheist critics of Christianity maintain the false basis that faith gives no room for scientific evidence .
What is usually implicit in that line of argument is the assumption that philosophy is not necessary .
Scientific methods shed light into all areas of life with no other avenue of knowledge , like theology or philosophy .
Christians adopt a scientific view of reality as well , however the constant and consistent reliance on only a scientific epistemology , often called scientism , contains very restrictive views of the world and the things that ultimately construct reality .
Philosophies that inform the atheist are taken with a degree of healthy skepticism by the creationist for this very reason .
Scientism only regards the sensory system as authoritative interpreter of the natural world .
There are no such things as the non-physical mind and supernatural that the creationist leaves room for within their worldview .
The overall most dominant epistemology of atheism and evolution regarding scientific propositions , or language meaning , are ;
Contemporary Numbers
The Cambridge Companion to Atheism goes through the scholarship of the statistical analysis regarding by country , the percentage of those who self - describe as atheist , agnostic or nonbeliever .
According to their top 50 list Sweden is at the top with the United States at number 44 .
Roughly 10 % of Americans consider themselves atheist or agnostic .
There also seems to be correlation between the more industrialized , secular and progressive the societies are the more that non-belief is prevalent . [ 8 ]
Atheism and Theism
It should be noted that despite American society being secular and atheistic in theory , 76.5 % of Americans call themselves Christian , thus American public society underrepresents and in many cases completely disenfranchises the implementation of the majority opinion : that there is a God .
In this sense , the 14.1 % of American society which call themselves secularists decide policy , scientific opinion , educational course material , and many other forms of knowledge despite the fact the majority of American society believes in a higher power of some sort .
This is largely due to the widespread secularist dominance of politics . [ 9 ]
Morality
Main Article : Morality
Many studies have been done dealing with the possible hazy understanding of morality that atheists might have . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ]
According to a study done by Barna Group , it found that atheists and agnostics in America were more likely , than theists in America , to look upon the following behaviors as morally acceptable : illegal drug use ; excessive drinking ; sexual relationships outside of marriage ; abortion ; cohabitating with someone of opposite sex outside of marriage ; obscene language ; gambling ; pornography and obscene sexual behavior ; and engaging in homosexuality / bisexuality . [ 13 ]
Since Nihilism and Moral relativism are ideologies that are usually endorsed by atheists , it is not unusual that atheism could in fact lead to an increase in immorality because the concept of moral values will be so diluted , that atheists might justify and rationalize any sin .
Atheism among scientists and laypeople
The scientific community , above any other subgroup of the population , has become overwhelmingly atheistic .
According to a 1998 report in Nature , a survey by Edward Larson found that ,
“ among the top natural scientists , disbelief is greater than ever ; almost total . ”
Interestingly , the biologists in the National Academy of Sciences were found to possess the lowest rate of belief of all the science disciplines , with only 5.5 % believing in God . [ 14 ]
This decline in belief in biologists strongly indicates the nature of the cause , and the ability of the teaching of evolutionary biology to turn people away from a belief in God .
The views of the general population over the last couple of decades remain largely unchanged with regard to creation vs. evolution .
Also the number of people becoming atheists or agnostics in the USA has not changed in the last ten years according to social researchers . [ 15 ]
However , a Gallup poll found a clear trend demonstrating that higher education and belief in evolution as the source of human existence were concurrent .
From these statistics it would appear that higher education , and particularly specialization in the natural sciences , will indoctrinate students into naturalism or an atheistic view of the world . [ 16 ]
Shown here is the percentage in each country which responded that " they believe there is a god " .
Education in these naturalistic philosophies , and the pervasive teaching of evolution is almost certainly the principal influence affecting the rise of atheism in our scientific community .
Evolution may be better called evolutionism as it is considered a religion by many .
Evolution is the champion theory of secular humanism , and a scientific community now totally under the control of an atheistic majority .
The theory of evolution is being used in an attempt to explain the origin and evolution of life on earth without a supernatural creation .
These theories are being taught as fact in science classes today , and such teaching will affect the way people view the world .
If they are left unchallenged , this inundation will cause belief in God as the source of life to diminish , and evolution ultimately will have the power to convince people there is no God .
Atheism and suicide
According to studies taken in 2004 , being religious decreases your chances of suicide , while rejecting religion , or being atheist , increases your risk of suicide . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ]
This is no doubt because atheism , and therefore the denial of all things sacred , can lead to assumptions of ethical nihilism and the ultimate , tragic rejection of life . [ 21 ]
Atheist Ideologies
While atheism could be said to be unorganized prior to the writings of Marx ( despite some previous communists , socialists , and anarchists rejecting God ) , once Marx put pen to paper and essentially developed communism into what it is today , one of the main tenets , among many others , is the rejection of religion : completely , through State control of education and belief and worship .
“ Religion is the opiate of the masses .
( Karl Marx ) ”
Atheism became an organized religion , complete with heroes , semi-gods in the form of revolutionary leaders , practices , and doctrines throughout perhaps almost every Communist nation that ever existed , and Nazi Germany .
Marx did not invent the idea of evolution , but it became an integral part to communist followers , and in the ideas of Hitler 's National Socialism .
An equally integral part to evolutionary theory and Social Darwinism implemented by Hitler and his fascist allies in the Balkans and Italy is the idea of " survival of the fittest " , but this time it was taken to an extreme level .
It fueled the Holocaust and the various genocides implemented by Hitler and his followers from 1932 or 1933 when Dachau opened to 1945 when the camps were liberated by the Allies .
It gave Hitler a world - view of the Ubermensch and the Untermensch ; Superhuman and Subhuman .
The " Subhumans " were marked for destruction or slavery , while the German " Superhumans " became masters of Europe for the short time they had . [ 22 ]
Death rates for atheist ideological nations like the former Nazi Germany , Maoist China , Leninist - Stalinist Russia , Khmer Rouge Cambodia , Vietnam , and North Korea , among others are never going to be fully known , but there is a conservative estimate of over 100 million . [ 23 ]
Nazi German genocide efforts killed tens of millions of Soviet citizens , in addition to millions of Germans , Poles , French , and nationalities throughout occupied Europe ; while the Soviets killed tens of millions of their own citizens .
In China , tens of millions of people were murdered or worked to death , and once the Khmer Rouge were forced out of power in Cambodia , over 25 % of all Cambodians were dead or forever missing . [ 24 ]

He is old enough to be her great - great - grandfather .
But Ahmed Muhamed Dhore , a Somalian who claims he is 112 years old , said he had realised a " dream " by marrying a 17 - year - old bride .
Dhore – who says he was born in 1897 , the year that Queen Victoria celebrated her diamond jubilee – already has 13 children by five wives , but said he would like more with his newest , Safiya Abdulle .
Hundreds of people attended the extraordinary ceremony this week in Guriceel , in the region of Galguduud .
" Today God helped me realise my dream , " Dore said .
He and his new wife , who is almost a century his junior , are from the same village in Somalia , he said , adding that he had waited for her to grow up to propose .
He says his children and two other wives agreed to the marriage , as did Abdulle 's parents .
" I did n't force her , but used my experience to convince her of my love , and then we agreed to marry , " the groom said .
The bride 's family said she was " happy with her new husband " .
Somali adolescent girls are often married off to older men .
Dhore has 114 children and grandchildren .
His oldest son is 80 and three of his wives have died .
This was his first marriage for three quarters of a century .
When it comes to politicized intelligence in the Bush years , the critics may finally have a point .
Perhaps the work of America 's intelligence agencies was manipulated to suit the convenience of a small group of willful officials , intent on getting their way against the better judgment of their colleagues .
Except the intelligence was about Iran , not Iraq , and the manipulators were n't conniving neocons but rather the Administration 's internal critics on the left .
That 's one way to look at last month 's revelation that Iran is building a secret second site to enrich uranium , among other emerging intelligence details .
The Qom site — too small for civilian purposes but ideal for producing weapons - grade uranium — is supervised by Iran 's Revolutionary Guards and was only declared to the International Atomic Energy Agency after Tehran got wind that the nuclear watchdogs knew about it .
But the more telling detail , as a recent White House " guidance paper " acknowledges , is that the U.S. has been " carefully observing and analyzing this facility for several years . "
That timeline is significant , because it was less than two years ago , in December 2007 , that a National Intelligence Estimate on Iran 's nuclear programs asserted with " high confidence " that Tehran had " halted its nuclear weapons program " in the fall of 2003 .
The NIE was a political sensation , seized on by Democrats and Iraq war critics as another case in which the Bush Administration had supposedly politicized intelligence .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called the NIE a " declaration of victory , " and it derailed any hopes for the Bush Administration to garner international support for tougher sanctions on Iran .
WASHINGTON 
In an unusual show of support for allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces , an article in an official military journal argues forcefully for repealing the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” law , which requires homosexuals in the services to keep their sexual orientation secret .
The article , which appears in Joint Force Quarterly and was reviewed before publication by the office of Adm .
Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , says that “ after a careful examination , there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that unit cohesion will be negatively affected if homosexuals serve openly . ”
Although the article , by an Air Force colonel , Om Prakash , carries no weight as a matter of policy , it may well signal a shift in the official winds .
It won the 2009 Secretary of Defense National Security Essay competition .
Colonel Prakash , who researched the issue while a student at the National Defense University , in Washington , and who now works in the Pentagon , concludes that “ it is not time for the administration to re-examine the issue . ”
Instead , he writes , “ it is time for the administration to examine how to implement the repeal of the ban . ”
La gran opereta de la política mexicana terminó su temporada de forma anticlimática hace unos días , pero dejó abierta la caja por donde escapó el fantasma más grande que tenemos , a la vez enterrado bajo la epidermis nacional : el racismo .
El galvanizador fue un humilde hombre llamado Rafael Acosta , que con su nombre de guerra Juanito cautivó el imaginario colectivo .
Acosta fue un instrumento político utilizado y abusado por la izquierda para resolver diferendos internos , pero se convirtió en un monstruo que les devoraba cada día una parte de sí mismos y del electorado .
Lo hicieron candidato subrogado a un cargo de elección popular que una vez que ganó comenzó a amenazar que no entregaría a sus patrocinadores , como habían acordado .
La semana pasada lo persuadieron y acabó el sueño del absurdo político mexicano .
Juanito había entrado por el portón del star system de los medios .
Sin recato , prensa , radio y televisión lo utilizaron como arma efectiva para desahogar las fobias , en buena parte dirigidas contra el líder de la izquierda social , Andrés Manuel López Obrador , quien inventó a Acosta , como un actor político .
Los medios , que en los últimos años han girado ideológicamente del liberalismo al conservadurismo , tuvieron un festín pantagruélico contra López Obrador y la izquierda social , al manipular a Juanito de la misma manera como sus patrocinadores lo habían hecho .
En el camino sucedió un fenómeno llamativo .
La variable política pasó a un segundo término , superada por una persistente y sistemática sobreexposición de Juanito , centrada en las miserias humanas .
Lo primero que emergió fueron los estigmas de clase .
Al ser pobre , humilde y sin preparación , no se le consideró uno de los millones de mexicanos castrados de oportunidades , sino un naco , que es una connotación utilizada en México que descubre racismo económico y discriminación .
Al mismo tiempo , quizás porque al verlo todo el tiempo en los medios se le adjudicó un blindaje metafísico , fue calificado como " imbécil " , con lo que se rompieron los autocontroles que se tienen con personas en sus mismas condiciones sociales , económicas y culturales , que no son celebridades instantáneas .
Si era público , era sujeto de dilapidación a garrote vil .
Además , como no tenía poder ni poderosos detrás , era un objetivo altamente vulnerable .
Juanito tiene el fenotipo general mexicano , bajo de estatura , moreno claro , producto del mestizaje .
Tiene rasgos duros en la cara , pero no es indígena , que son el segmento social más discriminado y repudiado en México .
Pero como no tiene poder ni dinero , nadie guardó las apariencias que se cuidan cuando se trata de políticos , empresarios o figuras públicas que llenan ese perfil físico .
Estos son aceptados por otros grupos sociales , blancos , con dinero y educación - aunque no necesariamente refinados o sofisticados- , que sin embargo , nunca dejan de murmurar a sus espaldas la inferioridad de clase que el solo color de piel les significa .
Con Juanito , medios y actores políticos fueron paternalistas y jugaron con él de manera cruel , ensalzando su ignorancia y mofándose abiertamente de él , en su propia cara .
Ya no había fobias contra nadie .
Todo se volvió personal .
Pocos se percataron del maltrato humano al que estaba sometido , porque como el contexto era político , el carnaval de la humillación no podía inscribirse en otro marco de referencia que no fuera la política .
Cuando se acabó el episodio político , un periodista que se firma bajo el seudónimo de Catón y que tiene sindicada su columna en decenas de periódicos en todo México , escribió : " Luego de ser un hombre popular , pasó a la historia como un pobre diablo " .
Juanito fue un error táctico de políticos , pero rápidamente se convirtió en un fenómeno que traspasó las fronteras públicas y fue burla para conservadores , liberales y anarquistas , que se unieron en la mofa .
Un blog que es rabioso simpatizante de López Obrador , llegó inclusive a plantear en un sondeo la siguiente pregunta : " ¿Cree usted que Rafael Acosta , ' Juanito ' , es apto sicológicamente para gobernar ? " .
Nadie denunció nada .
La sociedad mexicana , mayoritariamente , lo celebró .
Acosta fue el inesperado catalizador racista en la sociedad mexicana .
El tema no es de fácil discusión , pues el racismo no es algo que procesen autocríticamente los mexicanos .
Es un fenómeno con el que no gusta estar asociado , pero es una realidad que sólo porque nos negamos a aceptar , pensamos que no existe .
El racismo en México tiene múltiples caras .
Hay uno económico , donde se han dado casos en el que prohíben la entrada a restaurantes en la ciudad de México , la más liberal en el país , por el hecho de que la persona que busca un servicio se ve humilde y es de tez morena , o donde no se les permite entrar a algunos hoteles por las mismas razones .
Para un pueblo mestizo , es una enorme contradicción , pero ha sido parte viva del paisaje nacional .
Uno de los grandes cantantes que ha tenido México , Pedro Vargas , decía hace tiempo que se iba a dar baños con leche para que cuando entrara a Sanborn 's , una de los establecimientos clásicos mexicanos , no lo discriminaran .
Hay otro vinculado , aunque más identificado como socioeconómico , que es un estigma de clase que llega a ser de un abuso , incluso , irracional y desproporcionado .
Por ejemplo , hace algunos años , el entonces presidente Ernesto Zedillo fue invitado por un poderoso grupo de empresarios a Monterrey , la capital financiera del país , para hablar con ellos mientras sus esposas fungían como anfitrionas de su esposa , una mujer sencilla sin grandes pretenciones .
Sin saber la educación de la primera dama ni los recursos económicos de su famila - ambos con abundancia- , la pasearon por la galería de cuadros en una de sus casas , provocándola , humillándola : " Este es un Picasso , ¿sí sabes quién es Picasso , verdad ? " .
Pero también hay formas más violentas , como el antisemitismo que existe soterrado en la sociedad mexicana .
Hay zonas en la capital que son habitadas mayoritariamente por judíos , donde alquilar o vender una propiedad a alguien fuera de la comunidad es muy difícil .
Hay pintas antisemitas , pocas pero de resurgencia intermitente , y hay hostigamiento y amenazas .
Hace algunos meses , una importante estación de radio fue sometida a presiones porque varios de sus conductores tenían origen judío , llegando a pedir inclusive que se les despidiera .
Las presiones amainaron , pero como sucede con este tipo de racismo , difícilmente se puede decir que cesaron en definitiva .
El fenómeno en México es bastante más complejo , por la variedad de expresiones racistas - directamente vinculadas a la discriminación - .
No hay nadie más afectado que una mujer que sea indígena , pobre y discapacitada ; es la peor vida que podría tener en este país .
Hay también discriminación entre pueblos indígenas , como en el estado indígena por excelencia , Oaxaca , donde los zapotecos - de cuya cultura era Benito Juárez - se sienten superiores a los chontales , o en zonas urbanas , como los potosinos de la capital de San Luis Potosí , se sienten superiores a los residentes en Valles , la segunda urbe en importancia del estado .
La ciudad de México misma , puede hablar en esos términos , la inferior parte del oriente frente a la bonanza del occidente , o la poca preparada población del norte , frente al ilustrado e intelectual sur .
Juanito fue en este sentido , aunque no terminemos de percatarnos , una sacudida a todos los fantasmas racistas mexicanos , que se nos salieron del armario y nos mostró cómo somos , en carne y hueso : un pueblo racista que presume de tolerante .
Ciertamente muy hipócrita .
Y muy mexicano .
Cárteles de la droga extreman crueldad para eliminar a sus enemigos
[ email protected ]
La cruenta guerra por el control territorial que protagonizan las bandas del crimen organizado y la embestida que el gobierno federal encabeza en su contra han provocado hasta ayer 6 mil 18 ejecuciones en este año .
Tan sólo en la última jornada se reportaron 40 homicidios .
De acuerdo con estadísticas diarias de EL UNIVERSAL , el periodo transcurrido entre cada millar de ejecutados es aceleradamente menor .
Los primeros mil muertos del año se cumplieron en 51 días , los 2 mil en 59 y los 3 mil en 58 días .
La cifra de 4 mil muertos se registró en 44 días y bastaron 41 días para sumar el siguiente millar .
Del 11 de septiembre a la fecha , es decir , en los últimos 40 días , se reportaron las últimas mil víctimas relacionadas a la delincuencia organizada .
A partir del 1 de agosto , la incidencia de estos crímenes es de 24 muertos diarios , o bien , uno cada hora .
Sólo en Chihuahua se reportaron ayer 13 ejecuciones , nueve de éstas en Ciudad Juárez , donde según datos de la Procuraduría de Justicia estatal se rebasaron las 2 mil muertes atribuidas a bandas del narcotráfico .
Este año , uno de cada tres homicidios que sucede en el país corresponde a Juárez .
La violencia aquí ha escalado desde 2008 , cuando inició la guerra por el territorio entre el grupo Gente Nueva , de Joaquín Guzmán Loera El Chapo , contra La Línea , de Vicente Carrillo Fuentes , El Viceroy .
En 2009 , Yucatán es el único estado sin muertes atribuidas a los cárteles de la droga .
El año pasado , en esa entidad ocurrieron 16 homicidios ; en un sólo día , el 28 de agosto , fueron localizados 12 hombres decapitados .
Martes negro en Morelos Luego de que la violencia en Morelos ha ido en aumento en el último mes , nueve cuerpos fueron levantados ayer por el Servicio Médico Forense .
Los cadáveres tenían huellas de tortura , golpes y disparos de arma de fuego de grueso calibre ; en siete , sus victimarios dejaron un mensaje firmado por el “ Jefe de Jefes ” , quien se ha adjudicado por lo menos 30 ejecuciones en los últimos cuatro meses .
En este año suman 105 asesinatos con características del narcotráfico , de acuerdo con reportes de la Procuraduría General de Justicia divulgados a través de boletines oficiales .
Los primeros siete cuerpos fueron localizados entre las 8:00 y las 10:00 horas de ayer , en tramos carreteros y parajes que conectan a los municipios de Yautepec y Tlaltizapán , situados al sureste de la entidad .
El octavo cuerpo fue reportado en el municipio de Yecapixtla , al norte de la entidad , atado de manos y pies .
Horas más tarde la Procuraduría estatal reportó el hallazgo de un noveno cuerpo semienterrado en el paraje la Herradura , del municipio de Cuernavaca .
Los enfrentamientos entre bandas del narcotráfico se acentuaron en Morelos a partir de mayo pasado , cuando la Policía Federal y el Ejército catearon una residencia en Cuernavaca para detener a 14 personas presuntamente relacionadas con los Beltrán Leyva .
Comandantes de la Policía Ministerial y elementos preventivos del municipio de Cuernavaca también fueron arrestados y después sucedió lo mismo con el secretario de Seguridad Pública de Morelos , Luis Ángel Cabeza de Vaca , y su homólogo en Cuernavaca , Francisco Sánchez .
Ambos están recluidos en un penal de Matamoros , Tamaulipas , donde siguen un proceso por protección al crimen organizado .
Más homicidios En Matamoros , Tamaulipas , fueron localizados los restos de un vendedor de automóviles usados que presuntamente realizó una denuncia en la Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional ( Sedena ) contra algún integrante del crimen organizado .
El cuerpo fue envuelto con una cartulina con la leyenda : “ Para que sigan llamando ( 816 54 80 ) ‘ denuncia ciudadana ’ ‘ ps : un mundo nos vigila ’ ” .
En otro caso , tres personas fueron encontradas sin vida , amordazadas y esposadas , en un terreno baldío de Isla del Carmen , Campeche .
Según el procurador estatal , Renato Sales Heredia , fueron estranguladas .
Se presume que la causa del triple homicidio se deriva de la venta del narcomenudeo .
En Sinaloa , en un lapso de 12 horas , tres personas fueron ejecutadas , dos en Guanajuato y otras cuatro en Durango .
El pasado fin de semana , un hombre fue asesinado en Puebla y cuatro más en el estado de Tlaxcala .
Violencia sin límites
En 40 días , periodo en que se sumó el último millar de muertos , se desató la crueldad en los métodos para eliminar a sus enemigos , con un aumento de las víctimas colaterales , en especial mujeres y niños que mueren ametrallados junto con sus padres o parientes .
Uno de los casos de víctimas colaterales documentados en Ciudad Juárez , Chihuahua , ocurrió el 1 de octubre , cuando un comando disparó contra los tripulantes de una camioneta Ram 1500 que circulaba frente a un parque del fraccionamiento Paseos de Zaragoza .
En el lugar jugaban Enrique Mares , de 6 años , y su prima Laisa Flores , de 9 años , que fueron alcanzados por las balas .
Al instante falleció la niña y cinco días después el pequeño .
Mientras que en el más reciente caso de crueldad extrema , nueve hombres fueron asesinados y sus cuerpos destrozados al parecer con ayuda de una sierra eléctrica , para después ser introducidos en pedazos en 18 bolsas de plástico , que fueron apiladas dentro de un camión de carga abandonado en el municipio de Tlapehuala , en Tierra Caliente , al noroeste de Guerrero .
Dentro de la camioneta de carga y pegadas a las bolsas se encontraron dos cartulinas con sendos narcomensajes firmados por “ El Jefe de Jefes ” .
From CreationWiki , the encyclopedia of creation science
YouTube is a popular online video sharing site , which boasts the second largest search engine in the world .
[ 1]
YouTube and similar sites provide an easy method of distributing Christian / creationist videos across the globe and have therefore become an important tool in internet evangelism .
In 2006 , Alan Beeber of Campus Crusade for Christ International ( CCCI ) ( one of the world 's largest evangelism organizations ) predicted that internet evangelism will result in more conversions than all other forms of evangelism for CCCI combined . [ 2 ]
Although YouTube is a potential effective witnessing tool , many Christian / creationist users have experienced problems with anti-Christian / Creationists users of the site .
Within this document are included effective strategies and tactics for thwarting the actions of these users , which primarily come from the atheist / evolutionist camp .
Honing your message
The maximum " Content is king " is an important consideration to keep in mind .
Engaging video content causes people to talk to members of the internet community , friends and family so news about your Creation / Christian content spreads .
Creation / Christian apologists have a wealth of internet content you can cite .
Christian apologetic resources :
Video marketing and miscellaneous
You have created your creationist videos .
Now what ?
Now it time to promote your videos .
Below are some helpful resources :
Online resource :
Books :
Also , do n't be afraid to use other social media websites to promote your videos such as Facebook , Twitter , StumbleUpon , blogging , etc .
A good book on this matter is The Social Media Marketing Book .
Affiliating your creationist YouTube channel with a church / Christian organization
Affiliating your YouTube channel with a church or Christian organization has definitely has benefits .
The Christian / creationist YouTube channel ppsimmons is very successful and is run by a Baptist church .
The ppsimmons YouTube channel has over 6,000,000 uploaded views and it has over 8,000 subscribers .
Another example is the pro-creation church the Grace Community Church of San Antonio , TX which has a YouTube channel entitled I'll Be Honest , Will You that has over 11,000 subscribers and their YouTube channel has had over 3,000,000 uploaded views .
Benefits of affiliating your YouTube channel with a Christian organization :
1. YouTube is probably more likely to respond favorably to complaints from a Christian organization YouTube channel as they do not want potential bad publicity .
The bigger the Christian organization you affiliate yourself with , the more leverage you have in terms of potential bad publicity for YouTube .
Also , do n't be afraid to go to the conservative and local press as corporations like YouTube ( which is owned by Google ) try to avoid bad publicity as it negatively effects their corporate profits .
2 . In a church there is bound to be a bigger talent pool .
One person might be good at creating videos while another member of the church might be better at promotion .
3 . You can retain your private identity more readily .
4 . You might get donations and financial support from your church and if you are affiliated with a church or Christian organization , it is easier to get funding from other churches .
5 . If you choose to have a donate button on your YouTube channel or have a donate link in your YouTube channel description , people are going to be more willing to donate to a bona fide Christian ministry rather than to an individual .
In addition , donations to Christian organizations such as churches / ministries are often tax deductible .
If you build up your YouTube channel views , you can become a YouTube partner and put a Paypal donate image on your web channel , but until then you can merely put a donate link in your YouTube channel description .
6 . There are Christian grants available for evangelism .
If you are affiliated with a Christian organization , it is far more likely that you will be able to get a grant for internet evangelism .
One of the best books on writing grants is Everything Grant Writing Book : Create the perfect proposal to raise the funds you need .
At any given time , there are about 200- 300 Christian grants for evangelism .
Your librarian can help you find the grants , but there are organizations which specialize people in helping find grants as well such as Christian grants .
Start now and create more professional looking videos as you go along
Do n't wait until you create professional looking videos before you get started .
There are plenty of YouTube channels with large audiences that do nothing more than have someone talk in front of a camera .
As long as you offer good information and are personable , you can do very well .
However , if you get funding via a Christian organization you can do such things as :
1. Getting video editing equipment -
If you are affiliated with a church or Christian organization , it is easier to obtain video editing equipment .
For under $ 500 or less you can get some very professional equipment so you can remove or add sections to your videos plus do things such as adding pictures / text / audio .
A professional video editor allows you to do effects too like having fade in or fade out your videos .
2. Receiving online video production lessons .
The organization Web Video University offers a convenient and quality video production lessons .
3 . Paying for video website sharing distribution services or software so your videos can reach people though a number of video sharing websites which will be discussed shortly . [ 2 ]
Diversification
Putting all your eggs in one basket is often a mistake .
Solomon wrote about " casting your bread on many waters . "
There are many video sharing websites besides YouTube where you can place your videos .
Some of these video sharing websites specifically cater to Christian or conservative audiences such as Tangle , GodTube , UltimateTube , Pop Modal , QuebeTV and the upcoming Rightnetwork .
The free web traffic tracking services Compete and Alexa will give you a ballpark estimate on how much web traffic these video sharing websites receive although they often underestimate the web traffic .
Video sharing distribution software and services :
Plus , there are video distribution software and services which will spread your videos across 50 or more video sharing websites . [ 3 ]
Below are some 2009 video sharing website statistics that may be of interest to you and the marketshare of YouTube is listed :
“ Videos 1 billion – The total number of videos YouTube serves in one day .
12.2 billion – Videos viewed per month on YouTube in the US ( November 2009 ) .
924 million – Videos viewed per month on Hulu in the US ( November 2009 ) .
182 – The number of online videos the average Internet user watches in a month ( USA ) .
82 % – Percentage of Internet users that view videos online ( USA ) .
39.4 % – YouTube online video market share ( USA ) .
81.9 % – Percentage of embedded videos on blogs that are YouTube vide o [ 3 ] ”
Thwarting naturalists on YouTube
If you start a channel and post creation videos , or anti-evolution videos .
You should know that there are many " trolls " .
A troll is a person who will try to spam your videos , channel or inbox , post offensive comments constantly or who will dislike your video and falsely report it .
While there can be both Christian and non-Christian trolls , the only group that you will probably have to deal with is the non-Christian one .
Certain trolls have irritated and mocked many creationists on YouTube - they have even found ways to bait creationists into breaking the law and then later threaten to sue them .
Despite all of the potential problems that you can have with these types of people , there are many ways to stop them from doing this .
Using a URL redirect to stop false reporting
The popular Christian and pro-creation YouTube channel , Shockofgod ( see also : shockofgod ) , was shut down several times by atheist cyberbullying through false reports .
[ 4 ]
As a result , he developed the tactic of promoting a URL which redirects them to his YouTube channel .
Specifically , he promotes the URL Shockawenow net which redirects people to his website offered by a company which offers free hosting that lists his YouTube channel .
As a result , attempts to disrupt his subscriber base is stopped because his subscribers can quickly find his new YouTube channel through the URL redirect he promotes .
As of December 2014 , the Shockofgod YouTube channel has over 30,000 YouTube subscribers and he has over 25,000,000 uploaded views of his YouTube channel videos .
Mirror YouTube channels
Another tactic to prevent naturalistic YouTube cyberbullying is to create duplicate YouTube channels .
This is allowed by YouTube .
These duplicate channels are often referred to as YouTube " mirror channels " .
Mirror channels will not only stop " trolling " but they will also give increased exposure to your videos .
Because of this , you should probably encourage your fans to create mirror channels of your YouTube channel and to copy your videos and put them on their YouTube channels .
Possible " baiting tactics "
Some trolls will choose a particular creationist video , download it and then edit it .
Sometimes , the changed video will have the purpose of mocking the creationist video or the creationist himself .
Certain people who do this will also try to get the original creator of the video to see the video in order to irritate him .
The person who edited the video may upload this as a video response , or use similar tags so that any search for the video may bring up the spoof of the video .
If you find that one of your videos has been spoofed , you can take several courses of action .
You can ignore it , you can make a video or post a comment explaining rationally and calmly why the spoof is irrational or , if you find the spoof very offensive , you also have the option of blocking the user with the video .
Example of a threat message
6C of the user agreement 6C You also hereby grant each user of the YouTube Website a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions through the Website , and to use , REPRODUCE , DISTRIBUTE , DISPLAY and perform such User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Website and under these Terms of Service .
I have emailed you and explained YouTube user agreement part 6C which means you already have given me permission to copy your videos ( By uploading them to YouTube ) I have explained a false copyright claim by you is against YouTube user agreement and will result in his banning when I file a counterclaim .
Also its perjury ( Criminal offence ) to file a false copyright claim .
Also you are liable for civil and punitive awards against you in court for a false copyright claim .
He should contact a lawyer as the copyright claim form suggests .
I suggest an international copyright specialist , this will cost 500 $ an hour for at least 3 hours to get their opinion .
Failing to get legal advice and take it when youtube have suggested you do it , will not look good for you when it comes to time to decide how much punitive awards are due to your false claim .
Now you have been educated ( this email will be supplied in court ) , your " I did not know " you will use in court will be seen as the Lie it is .
Not that being ignorant of the law is any excuse , as you seem to think it is the case of science .
The gloat :
You think your the first fundy to file copyright claim against me ?
6 others have all their videos are back up on my accounts .
The same will happen with yours :)
These threat messages have been sent to several creationist YouTube channels .
If you receive a message similar to this one , it is best not to respond to avoid trouble .
False DMCAs
Never send a false DMCA or claim copyrights to things you do n't have copyrights on .
When you make a video on YouTube , you are submitting to their agreements , so others are allowed to use your videos - you do not have copyrights unless you purchase them .
Cyberbullies may file false DMCA claims against one of your videos to get it taken down .
If this happens , consider carefully what you do next .
To file a counter claim and assert your rights to the video , you must provide personal contact information :
Your full name , address , etc ...
Cyberbullies have then taken that information and made it public in various youtube venues as further cyberbullying and abuse .
In one such incident , youtuber Nephilimfree had one of his videos ( which contained video footage of only himself ) taken down by youtube upon receiving a DMCA claim against his video .
Nephilimfree consulted with a lawyer , who prompted Nephilimfree to demand the personal contact information of the one filing the DMCA complaint .
Nephilimfree pointed out that the DMCA claim was against himself , not youtube , and thus youtube was required by law to provide the contact information of the one making the DMCA claim .
Youtube complied , providing Nephilimfree with the cyberbully 's contact information .
Thus , the false DMCA claim actually backfired on the cyberbully .
Rob Reed , a California attorney who has a youtube channel ( LiftAloft , experienced cyberbullying and false DMCA claims personally , which prompted him to start the CounterDMCA.com website where he will represent you in your Counter - DMCA claim for $ 1.29 US .
His process allows you to use the address of his legal practice office , thus protecting your personal information as you file your DMCA counter claim .
He has a video explaining his counter DMCA process here : False DMCA craziness getting to you ?
CounterDMCA.com might help
Obtaining copyrights for your works
Obtaining Copyrights for your original works is not as expensive as you might think if you know the right sources .
Having a Copyright for your works means that you can require people who want to use your work to ask permission first .
This also allows you to claim Copyrights at the end of each video that you make and block people who want to edit your original work .
One can obtain inexpensive Copyrights from Legal Zoom .
It costs less than 200 U.S. dollars , so if you are serious about your YouTube ministry and do not want the hassle of dealing with the anti-creationist hate groups on YouTube , then this may be a good idea .
If you do respond
Be careful about what you say .
If you reply , the person who receives the message may post it in an actual video or they may share it online somewhere else ( for example , TheThinking Atheist posts comments that he finds stupid on his Facebook page often ) .
This is done to bait the creationist as well .
Voting Bots
Some trolls will create voting bots , which are accounts that will find as many videos as they can and dislike them .
Many videos , both atheistic and Christian , have had voting bots give them thousands of dislikes .
If you wish to avoid voting bots or you start to get " attacked " by them , you can disable ratings on your videos .
If you create a Christian channel , you will no doubt receive a large amount of negative comments .
Not all the comments you receive will be bad , but you will receive at least some criticism and probably some hate messages .
You should try to take the good comments with the bad .
You may not even personally lead someone to Christ from your YouTube ministry , but always remember , planting good seeds of truth from God may prepare someone to accept Christ , so that their next encounter with someone who evangelizes may be a positive one .
Seeds planted are just as important as the harvest .
Using the block option
Blocking various users who troll or try to constantly annoy you may be another option that could help .
Ultimately , you are the one who should decide whether to block people or not , so this section consists simply of suggestions .
There are advantages and disadvantages to blocking YouTube users and there are many different options .

There is also an issues section on the linked to page where you can find out what you can do about people whom break YouTube rules .
You also have a list of rules so that you can be sure a rule was broken before you go to all the trouble to report it .
Who to block
Who you block or whether you should block anyone at all is completely up to you .
It is advised to block at least certain types of people ( such as ones who make death threats ) , but with that general guideline in mind , there are several things that you can decide to do and there are advantages and disadvantages to each policy .
Some Christian channels block virtually anyone who disagrees with them or posts a counter argument ( I 've seen this before and will add a source later ) .
This is generally not advised , unless you are very tired of answering arguments and criticisms .
If you do this , you will very likely be criticized by skeptics for being close minded .
Other Christian channels will block virtually anyone who causes them any trouble ( for example , shockofgod , thunderbolt94 , nephilimfree ) .
Others will block many people who cause them any trouble , but will also give them another chance ( for example , venomfangx [ 4 ] ) .
Still others will allow video comments for a couple days and then remove them ( for example , PPsimmons ) .
These are all fine policies and will probably get you less criticism than simply blocking everyone who disagrees .
However , you will probably still receive some criticism if you block comments that are n't extremely offensive .
Some Christian channels on the opposite side will allow virtually any comment ( for example , thestinkingatheist and longhornman99001 ) .
Channels who allow the majority of the comments they receive will probably not receive as much criticism and may be accepted more by skeptics ( though there will always be people who will criticize you no matter what ) .
On the other hand , if you allow a lot of comments , you may get worn out and your channels tend to be a little bit more mature due to possible inappropriate content .
So , which users should you block ?
It 's entirely up to you .
If you want to respond to most of the users who post comments and dislike criticism from skeptics , you may want to allow most of the comments .
If you want your channel to be open to users who do n't want to see swear words and you do n't mind criticism from skeptics or you do n't want to attempt to respond to every person who leaves a comment , then you should block users that cause you trouble , because that 's what the block button is for .
Suggested channels to block
Recently , a group has formed with the goal of removing Christians and creationists off YouTube or the internet in general .
These users have multiple accounts and will try to focus on a particular channel , find as much information as they can about it , and then proceed to make fun of videos from that channel .
If you do n't mind criticism or if you would like to try to respond to them rationally , you certainly do not have to block any of these users .
However , if you are starting a new channel on YouTube and you do n't like criticism or do n't want to bother arguing with them , you may want to block some of these users .
Here is a short list of the main members at YouTube who are part of this group :
http://www.evolutionfairytale.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=1991
Arguments for blocking this group
Several YouTubers who have had many problems with atheists on YouTube have presented the following arguments supporting blocking the Atheistic group .
They are as follows :
You may receive criticism for filtering your comments or blocking certain users , but really , blocking someone is just taking away their power to express hateful comments under your video .
They took away the power of the Christian voice in several places ( school , work , government property etc ... ) , it 's time they get a taste of their own medicine .
Besides , can they name anywhere science or evolution is not allowed by law in the U.S. ?
So what they are generally complaining about is losing their total freedom to steamroll over everyone else because of that total freedom .
But yet they have no problem taking that same freedom from everyone else , which makes claims to free thinking , rational , and their defense of freedom of speech an oxymoron statement , and turns them into hypocrites for being so one sided about these claims .
They are not even worth responding to most of the time .
So if they send you a message that is not even friendly , block them .
You owe nothing to people whom you do n't even know , and they do n't know you , but stereotype you for what you believe .
People in this group who try to get Christian channels off YouTube are really just using illogical and fallacious reasoning .
They do n't intend to present a rational argument , their only goal is to use fallacies and mockery to try to eliminate something that they disagree with .
YouTube channels edited without reason
There have been several claims by Christians that their channels have been edited randomly , possibly by an employee of YouTube .
It is unknown at this time whether this is a glitch , someone hacking into various accounts or someone who works for YouTube who edits Christian channels .
It 's a good idea to check periodically to make sure that all your links on your channel work and that none of them have been removed .
VenomFangX
One creationist on YouTube , who is named VenomFangx , has been attacked by many anti-Christians because of his popularity .
This group disagreed with many of his videos and constantly got in fights with him .
After several fights , false accusations , threats , and suspended accounts .
VenomFangx decided to leave after allegedly receiving death threats ( the source of any alleged death threat is unknown ) .
At one point , VenomFangx decided that the mockery had gone far enough , so he closed his account and left YouTube .
The reason for this example is to remind you that if you try to respond to every atheist on YouTube , you will receive lots of criticism .
This is not to suggest that you should necessarily ignore all atheistic arguments ( after all , VenomFangX returned to YouTube after a break [ 5 ] , and his channel is as successful as ever ) , but if you do n't like criticism , you may want to block certain users that will cause you trouble .
Watch out for fake Christian and Creation channels
In the anticreationists attempt to discredit Christians and Creationists , there have been several anticreationists that have put up fake Christian - Creationists channels .
They may try to become friends with other Christian / Creationists YouTube members in hopes of being able to deceive more people ( make their channel look more Christian like ) .
And be a bad example of a Christian channel .
What to look for :
It 's a fairly new channel .
The images used are not Christian .
And maybe pagan religion images .
Their videos ( favorites , or their own ) are not Christian .
Their channel description is not Christian and sounds like it could be new age .
Their link to their homepage is not Christian .
Their friends and subscribers are mainly atheists .

Sample Letter
Dear Mr. Pitchford ,
I 'm writing with regards to the use of DRM in your recent release , Borderlands .
As you 're probably aware , many of your own customers who bought the game in stores were unable to play it for several days due to DRM .
Because of your company 's decision to use DRM , and because of the particularly appalling impact it had on users , I 've decided to give it a one - star review on Amazon.com , and tag it " defectivebydesign " .

The United States Senate possesses the key to address the most critical national security issue that the country presently faces .
Will the Senate act decisively and without delay to protect our vital national interests or will it dither as Iran builds a nuclear bomb and further destabilizes the world ?
When China Strategies LLC first published the China Renewable Energy and Sustainable Development Report in 2007 , we noted with interest one online publication that “ borrowed ” our work : the Iran Daily .
The Iran Daily ’s interest in our reports on China ’s burgeoning renewable energy industry was an early hint of the crucial connection between China ’s energy conundrum and the United States ’ concern about Iran ’s evident aspirations to build a nuclear weapon .
The link between energy sustainability and self - sufficiency in China and the success or failure of the U.S. government in preventing Iran from gaining nuclear weapons ’ capacity is now crystal clear .
With the dramatic announcement by Presidents Obama and Sarkozy and Prime Minister Brown on the morning of the final day of the G20 meetings in Pittsburgh , that Iran was building a secret and previously undeclared nuclear enrichment facility buried deep within a mountain near the holy city of Qum , the hollowness of the two most cited options for a U.S. response to Iran — military action and direct negotiations — was exposed .
If the U.S. is to exercise the only realistic option it currently possesses to divert Iran from its ambition to build nuclear weapons — international sanctions — it must demonstrate to China its commitment to the construction of the world ’s new energy future , a future where Middle Eastern oil is a footnote .
Delivering on that commitment will be the most effective way for the U.S. to enlist China ’s support in neutralizing the threat posed by Iran ’s pursuit of nuclear weapons .
In the long term , building a new energy infrastructure will marginalize Iran and other nations whose oil wealth permits them to flaunt the will of the community of nations .
If the U.S. is able to demonstrate to China that it is truly dedicated to leading the transformation of the new energy economy , China may become less bound by its economic interests in Iran , freeing it to join with the U.S. in confronting Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
So long as China remains skeptical of U.S. commitment to proceed aggressively into a new energy future , however , China will continue to be a lukewarm supporter of sanctions that the U.S. may seek to impose on Iran .
And while the Obama administration has put in place a host of admirable policies that cumulatively make a strong statement about the Administration ’s determination to forge a new energy future , so long as the Senate of the United States fails to pass an effective energy bill , as the House of Representatives did earlier this year , China rightly will continue to question U.S. commitment to renewable energy .
While the U.S. fails to demonstrate its resolve to fashion a future where energy is no longer synonymous with Middle Eastern oil , we should expect a tepid response from China to our entreaties for joint action to impose sanctions on Iran .
There is a great deal of irony in the fact that in order to gain Chinese support in confronting Iran , the U.S. must demonstrate the same degree of fortitude on energy issues that China has already displayed to the world .
As we have shown repeatedly over the last few years through articles on China ’s progress in solar , wind , biofuels , electric vehicles and the smart grid , China is now more proactive than the U.S. in building a new energy infrastructure .
China is moving aggressively right now towards a wide range of alternative sources of energy and the means of delivering the power that China will require to continue its remarkable economic development , free of the impetuousness of international energy markets .
Indeed in recent weeks , citing Western media reports , China has touted itself as being poised to be the “ pacesetter ” in the race to attain sustainability in energy consumption , limit carbon emissions and foster GDP growth .
China is committed to a green leap forward because it understands that the next stage in its economic revolution depends on transforming the country ’s energy generation and distribution infrastructure .
China also fully appreciates that the next great upward movement in economic development worldwide will arise from the wholesale conversion of the world ’s energy infrastructure and that it will continue its impressive growth , while achieving sustainability , precisely through the process of restructuring how it generates and delivers energy .
Some in the West have begun to speak fondly of the effectiveness of China ’s top down , command - style approach to transforming its energy infrastructure .
The United States Senate must show that our vital economic and national security interests can be achieved through the untidy , yet democratic processes that have served us so well throughout our history .
If we cannot demonstrate a commitment to protect our own vital interests by marching decidedly forward towards the new energy future , how can we expect China to stand with us as we try to address the challenges posed by Iran ’s nuclear aspirations ?
The United States Senate must act decisively and without delay .

Homosexuality is punishable by 14 years in jail in Kenya Kenya is to carry out a census of its gay population in an effort to bolster the fight against HIV / Aids - despite homosexuality being against the law .
Nicholas Muraguri , head of Kenya 's Aids prevention programme Nascop , told the BBC it was vital that the government reached out to the gay community .
He said gay people suffered from a lack of information about the disease .
But analysts say many gay people will be afraid to come forward in a country where homosexuality can result in jail .
Mr Muraguri conceded that an accurate count was unlikely .

But he told the BBC's Network Africa programme that getting a clearer idea of the number of gay people would be a huge help with targeted interventions such as provision of condoms .
He said the survey would involve gay men identifying each other , and officials carrying out HIV tests and providing along with information on safe sexual practice .
" Kenyans cannot actually afford to say that the gay community are isolated somewhere in the corner - they are part of our lives , " he said .
" This group must be reached with information and services so they know how to protect themselves from getting infected . "
Census first Analysts say Kenya has made progress in its fight against HIV / Aids - one - in - 10 people had the virus in the late 1990s , a rate that has now fallen to 6 % .
There 's no information here about safety measures
Gay rights activist Peter Njane
Being gay , Christian and Kenyan The BBC's Gladys Njoroge in Nairobi says the census , which will begin in June next year , will be the first of its kind in Africa .
Gay rights activist Peter Njane told the BBC he was optimistic that the survey would play a key role in the fight against HIV .
" Most of the gay community think that having sex with men is safe .
There 's no information here about safety measures , " he said .
But Kenyans are divided over the survey 's impact , with some Nairobi residents saying they did not believe it would help control the spread of Aids .
Gay Kenyans told the BBC they would be willing to be counted - but only if their identities were protected .

Damien Ankrah was part of a gang smuggling drugs into Pembrokeshire A drug dealer who refused to go to the toilet for 16 days to avoid producing the evidence that would convict him has been jailed for 52 months .
Damien Ankrah , 28 , put the drugs in condoms and placed them inside himself , Swansea Crown Court heard .
The judge heard that after police in Pembrokeshire arrested him during a drugs operation , he refused to eat for days to avoid going to the toilet .
Ankrah , from Liverpool , admitted possessing heroin .
David Lindsay , prosecuting , told the court - sitting at Swansea Guildhall - that Ankrah 's stubbornness took up an " inordinate " amount of police time and resources .
Ankrah was arrested in Haverfordwest on 13 July as part of a police operation uncovering new drugs suppliers coming into Pembrokeshire .
Food refusal
He was held in a police station , where he refused food or drink in his cell .
An officer was stationed full time outside his cell door and powers used to extend his detention .
Ankrah eventually began to accept drinks after local magistrates granted police more time to detain him and on 17 July he started to eat again .
On 29 July he went to the toilet and produced five bags of heroin .
The court heard that when Ankrah was arrested he told officers he did not have any drugs on him and said he would co-operate with a strip search .
No drugs were found , even following an examination by a police surgeon .
But Ankrah 's mobile telephone revealed text messages showing he was clearly involved in supplying heroin .
It was rather misguided and it could have been fatal
Judge Peter Heywood Jim Davis , defending , said his client " was a man of some strength and determination " , as his refusal to go to the toilet illustrated .
He added that both Ankrah 's grandmother and mother had been heroin addicts .
Judge Peter Heywood said Ankrah 's willingness to put his life at risk showed his determination to keep the heroin concealed .
" It was rather misguided and it could have been fatal , " he said .
" Had these packages burst he would have found himself at death 's door . "
Ankrah admitted possessing heroin , with a street value of £ 3,200 , with intent to supply .
It was his third offence for drug trafficking .
Clear message Following the case , Det Sgt Richard Lewis of Dyfed Powys Police said : " Drug dealers often go to extreme lengths to hide their drugs from police , even placing them inside their bodies .
" However Dyfed Powys Police are warning that even this does n't mean their drugs will not be discovered .
" Police have lawful powers which enable them to detain a person in custody who is suspected of secreting drugs within their body for as long as is absolutely necessary .
" This legislation has proved invaluable .
It sends a clear message to drug dealers that there really is no place to hide . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - A new nuclear fuel recycling system could cut radioactive waste and remove the possibility of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel being used to make weapons , but it wo n’t come cheap .
Nuclear experts say the proposed Advanced Recycling Center ( ARC ) could help to solve some of the biggest worries as the world looks to build more than 100 nuclear reactors to curb greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring energy supply .
“ It ’s very clever , ” said Tim Stone , KPMG ’s Corporate Finance Partner .
“ The principles have been known for a long time but the overall package is very neat ...
A positive part of this is burning the worst radioactive waste , ” said Stone , who advises the British government on nuclear matters .
The drawbacks of the system by GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy are that the fast reactors involved are very costly and the reprocessing technology involves handling highly radioactive material yet to be proven on industrial scale .
The ARC would include GE Hitachi ’s fourth generation PRISM sodium - cooled fast reactors and an electrometallurgical separation process that would make a new form of fuel from spent fuel rods without separating plutonium .
GE Hitachi says the ARC will cut radioactive waste as it can extract by up to 90 percent of the energy in uranium , instead of the 2 - 3 percent that widely - used light water reactors do .
“ It allows you to think about different designs for long - term waste storage and disposal , ” said Lisa Price , a senior executive of GE Hitachi unit Nuclear Fuel Cycle .
“ As you are able to unlock the energy , you reduce the amount of storage time and disposal time .
And you have much less high - level waste , ” she told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in London .
Experts say it could be of particular interest for countries like the United States , which is home to the world ’s biggest fleet of nuclear reactors but where the government put on hold a plan to build the Yucca Mountain repository .
Price said the ARC would have the additional advantage of not extracting plutonium , which can be used for nuclear weapons .
Current reprocessing methods , deployed in countries like France , Britain or Japan , extract uranium , plutonium and fission products separately from spent fuel rods .
“ Recycling does not need to separate plutonium at all .
So it does not ever come out in a form that could be used for ill gain .
And that ’s a major advantage from a non-proliferation point of view , ” Price said .
COSTS , SAFETY , GOVERNMENT
Experts say there are no customers yet for fourth generation reactors such as GE Hitachi ’s PRISM , but there has been enough experience to prove most of the technology since the 1950s .
The challenge lies in the high costs of building fast reactors , they say , particularly as utilities generally do not include nuclear waste disposal costs in their investment decisions as , in most countries , governments take on the burden .
Companies are therefore less likely to be persuaded by the cost savings on waste storage .
More research and development is required for fabricating new fast reactor fuel from feedstocks that contain highly radioactive fission products .
Any such processes would need very strict safety measures , which would increase costs .
World Nuclear Association ( WNA ) data shows about 50 reactors are under construction , with most belonging to the second generation of reactors and a few -- like GE Hitachi ’s ABWR , Areva ’s EPR , and Toshiba - Westinghouse ’s AP - 1000 -- to the third .
The new fast reactors would belong to a fourth generation .
“ A lot of the technology on which sodium fast reactors are based has already been demonstrated in the past , ” said Tim Abram , professor of nuclear fuel technology at Manchester University in Britain .
“ The big challenge is : can we make it economic ?
Today , the answer is no , so this remains one of the main goals of the Generation IV initiative , ” he said , adding a European study in the 1990s showed fast reactors would cost about 20 percent more than conventional reactors .
But Ian Hore - Lacy of the WNA said there was increasing interest in fast reactors because they could recycle elements that normally became high level waste .
Fuel reprocessing , like GE Hitachi ’s electrometallurgical process , was the area of the technology that was least well proven , Hore - Lacy said .
Abram agreed , saying : “ On a relatively small scale , the electrometallurgical reprocessing technology has been shown to work . ”
“ It ’s conceptually relatively easy to describe .
But because the fuel is very radioactive , all of the fuel manufacturing operations would have to be done in very heavily shielded facilities , and remotely , using robotic manipulation .
Nobody has demonstrated it at industrial scales yet . ”
GE Hitachi says it could develop the technology in 10 - 15 years as it has been working on it since the 1980s , partly funded by the U.S. government .
It would be also economic , particularly if the disposal costs of nuclear waste from other existing technologies are taken into account .
“ If you factor in long term storage , then the economics support recycling , and even reprocessing , ” GE Hitachi ’s Price said .
“ The long term disposal is going to be very expensive . ”
Anthony
Toth is so obsessed with perfectly recreating a vintage Pan Am first - class cabin in his garage that he once traveled to Thailand for — wait for it — original Pan Am branded headphones .
And his obsession goes much deeper than that .

Anthony began his obsession with Pan Am as a child , when he and his parents frequently flew to Europe to visit family .
Pan
Am 's service seems decadent and almost silly today , when Southwest and JetBlue achieve success with a budget mentality , but to Anthony , Pan Am was the epitome of class and style .
Pan
Am was once synonymous with international jet - setting , with upper - deck dining rooms and flight attendants decked out in crisp blue uniforms , high heels and white gloves .
First - class travelers were served out of silver - plated martini pitchers .
A parade of linen - covered food carts made its way down the aisle at dinnertime .

Anthony saved things like the cardboard linings on food trays and recorded his trips with multiple rolls of film and extensive tape recordings of the radio selection on board .
" This consumed my world , " said Tosh .
As an adult , he works for United Airlines , and two years ago bought a home with an oversized garage in which he could build a faithful replica of Pan Am 's first - class cabin .
The project has taken him , in total , 20 years .
Construction required multiple visits out to a spot in Death Valley where airplane carcasses are dumped , but the details of his project are unnervingly precise :
The replica is n't open to the public , but if you visit ( Tosh hosts executive meetings sometimes , appropriately enough ) , you 'll be offered drink service and given a perfectly - crafted souvenir boarding pass designed to match those used by the airline in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s .
He 's got authentic Pan Am swizzle sticks and glasses .
The overhead compartments are original Pan Am construction .
Hell , he 's even got sealed packages of salted almonds ( we have no evidence regarding the taste of 30 - year - old almonds , but they 're probably not for eating anyway ) .

The one concession he 's made to the modern age ?
A flat - screen TV in place of the old - school projection Pan Am used .
Everything else ( save the stewardesses ) is either original Pan Am or a custom - made replica .
He 's hoping to open his obsessive ode to Pan Am as a museum , but he seems perfectly content to just hang out in first class .

A Jordanian man was charged on Sunday with premeditated murder after allegedly stabbing to death his 22 - year - old daughter because she became pregnant outside wedlock , police said .
" The father and his brother took the girl on Saturday to a doctor because she suffered stomach pains , and everybody was surprised to learn that she was six months pregnant , " a police spokesman said .
" On their way home , the father stabbed the girl with a sword 25 times in her stomach , killing her immediately as well as her unborn baby boy . "
The source said the suspect had confessed to the crime , which took place in the Jordan Valley .
" His brother was also charged with premeditated murder , while the victim 's boyfriend is being held in custody for his own protection , " he added .
Generally , the law distinguishes between casual buyers and commercial sellers in tort and criminal law .
For example , product liability for defects does not extend to garage sales and transactions between private individuals .
However , the Consumer Product Safety Commission is warning that the government will now be enforcing rules under the “ Resale Round - up ” program that can result in fines of $ 15 million for that Easy - Bake Oven that you want to unload .
The new program seeks to punish those who sell products containing lead and recalled items , often from China .
In the guidelines below , the government warns casual sellers :
Under the new law , it is now illegal to sell ANY recalled product ( for adults as well as children ) .
If you are in the business of reselling products , you are expected to know the laws , rules and regulations that apply to your business , including whether or not a product you are selling has been recalled for a safety issue .
Before taking a product into inventory or selling it , check the CPSC Web site for dangerous recalled products , including cribs , play yards , strollers , high chairs , toys with magnets , toys that are choking hazards , and other products .
You can search by product type , company name , product description , hazard , country of manufacture and by the month and year in which the recall took place .
It is against the law to sell a recalled product ; check the CPSC Web site or http://www.recalls.gov before selling .
Whether it is a flea market or a garage sale , you can be held for fines of $ 100,000 and up to $ 15 million for related violations for everything from beanbag chairs to Halogen lamps .

A few things have kept Star Trek on my mind lately : my interview on Point of Inquiry with a Star Trek producer on the atheism and humanism in the Star Trek universe created by Gene Roddenberry , the fact that we have been going through the whole Star Trek :
The Next Generation series on DVD at home , and the fact I was immersed in the sci fi geek heaven of Dragon * Con a couple weekends ago , and saw Patrick Stewart , Leonard Nemoy and William Shatner at the event .
( I ’m aiming to blog about that amazing weekend in the days ahead . )
So imagine my surprise to run across an old interview of Shatner , from way back in 1968 , where he speaks openly about his atheism and lack of belief in an afterlife .
If only more pop icons and celebrities would do the same today .
When asked a question about whether he has religious beliefs or believes in an afterlife , he says :
" No . I do n’t .
Emotionally I would like to believe there is a life after death .
Intellectually . . . .
I cannot accept the idea .
. . . as for myself , I have finally come to the conclusion that life is here and now . . . and nothing more . "
( via the Look At His Butt podcast , wherein two geek babes talk about Star Trek , science fiction , books , TV , the Internet , sex toys , and William Shatner ’s butt . )

Original Via Baltica route would have heavily impacted on important sites for biodiversity including the Biebrza marshes , and the Knyszyn and Augustow forests
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Some of Europe 's most important wildlife sites appear to have been saved after an international campaign succeeded in preventing a motorway from being built through an area of ancient forest and marshland .
Dozens of protected species including the lynx , wolf , beaver , aquatic warbler and greater spotted eagle are expected to benefit from the Polish government 's U - turn .
After years of pressure from environmentalists , it has decided to re-route part of a proposed international road corridor linking Helsinki in Finland and Prague in the Czech Republic via Poland , Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
The original route would have heavily impacted on important sites for biodiversity including the Biebrza marshes , and the Knyszyn and Augustow primeval forests .
Campaigners against the scheme also hope the decision to adopt a more environmentally sensitive route for the Via Baltica road will deter other governments in the region from going ahead with a boom in infrastructure building that would threaten some of the most natural landscapes in Europe .
The RSPB called the decision " a major victory that represents a significant step towards the proper implementation of Polish and European environmental laws . "
Adam Wajrak , a Polish environmental journalist and campaigner , said : " For Poland it 's an important decision because it 's the first time they are using [ an independent ] strategic assessment to decide where the roads should be ; up to now it was just the decision of some politicians . "
However opponents also warned that , despite the Polish council of ministers ' announcement , some local authorities wanted to push ahead with the road under a new name , the Via Carpathia .
" With the new route for the Via Baltica corridor settled there is no need to continue with these large scale projects on the old route which will needlessly damage Natura 2000 [ European Union ] protected sites , " said Malgorzata Gorska of OTOP , the Polish Society for the Protection of Birds .
Earlier this year the Polish government previously agreed to re-route a smaller part of the Polish section of the Via Baltica away from the Rospuda valley , believed to be Europe 's last ' pristine ' fen .
In a petition organised by Wajrak , 450 Polish scientists called that project " a destruction catastrophe unparalleled in the civilised world in the last decades " .
The Polish national roads agency , which says new and improved links are vital to boost the economy , especially in remote areas , plans to announce a € 17.7bn scheme this year , of which nearly half will be spent in 2010 .
Andrew Wallace - Hadrill , the recently departed head of the British School at Rome , an archeological institute , said : " People have been trying to find the rotating dining room for a long time .
We do n't have much idea about it except for what Suetonius tells us .
It could have had a revolving floor , or possibly a revolving ceiling .
" If they really have discovered it , that would be exciting . "
Now that he 's finally got Inglourious Basterds out of his system , Quentin Tarantino can set his sights on something new and exciting .
Except not really very new .
Or exciting .
Tarantino , you see , wants to make Kill Bill 3 .
According to an interview on Italian television , Tarantino is keen to have the next Kill Bill instalment in cinemas by 2014 .
That 's worrying not only as a possible indication of creative bankrupcy , but also because such a project does seem remarkably pointless .
Bill is dead .
Bill is unquestionably dead .
In the movies Bill died because of the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart technique .
And in real life Bill ( David Carradine ) died , too , in slightly different circumstances .
Bill is dead , which does seem to make any more Kill Bill films a touch redundant .
So , with the titular character long gone , how could Tarantino possibly go about making a Kill Bill 3 ?
Here – out of a sense of nothing but pure philanthropy – are a few possible scenarios to help him along .
Option # 1 - Bride on the Run. Remember in the first Kill Bill , where Uma Thurman murdered Vivica A Fox 's character in front of her four - year - old daughter ?
The most obvious plotline for Kill Bill 3 would centre on the daughter 's efforts to track down and kill Thurman in retaliation .
She 'd be 15 by 2014 , so that would really tap into the key Hannah Montana demographic .
In fact , why not go even further and make it a musical ?
Everyone could learn valuable life lessons about the importance of friendship and the littlest Jonas brother could play the love interest .
Perfect .
Option # 3 - Baby Bride .
Kill Bill 3 centres around Thurman 's training of her own daughter to become an assassin .
It 'd be just like Leon , only without the unsettling sexual undertones or the horrible Sting song at the end .
Plus , because it 's a Kill Bill movie , the story would be told in an impressive array of styles .
Some of it would be in colour , some in black - and - white , some turned into an anime sequence , some recited by the cast of Button Moon , some from the viewpoint of a tap - dancing one - eyed mouse , that sort of thing .
Option # 3 - Kill other Bills .
Having dealt with Bill , Thurman becomes obsessed with killing other people who share his name .
First on the list is lovely BBC Breakfast host Bill Turnbull , who is finished off after a highly stylised swordfight near Bill 's beehive .
Then she moves onto Bill Gates ( suffocated with his own money ) , Bill O'Reilly ( hacked to death in a needlessly gory threshing machine sequence ) , and will .i.am from the Black Eyed Peas , whose last album she hated enough to overcome slight worries about whether he 's a proper Bill .
The climax comes with Thurman repeatedly headbutting the bronze statue of long - deceased Liverpool manager Bill Shankly outside Anfield 's visitor centre .
Option # 4 - The Death Proof Option .
Kill Bill 3 opens with Thurman setting out to kill Bill , before realising that she 's already killed Bill .
So instead , she spends two and a half hours waffling aimlessly about nothing in an indulgent faux - hip way to the sound of the same tired old surf guitar records that everyone started getting sick of a decade ago .
Something marginally exciting might happen at the end , but nobody notices because they 've fallen asleep or left the cinema .
This is the option most likely to reach fruition .
Last week Tim Geithner dropped multiple F - bombs in a meeting with regulators unenthusiastic about his plan to concentrate oversight of the financial system at the Fed .
Sheila Bair was one of his targets , but today she held her ground .
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee this morning , she had this to say about concentrating regulatory power at the Fed :
… we do not see merit or wisdom in consolidating federal supervision of national and state banking charters into a single regulator for the simple reason that the ability to choose between federal and state regulatory regimes played no significant role in the current crisis .
One of the important causes of the current financial difficulties was the exploitation of the regulatory gaps that existed between banks and the non -bank shadow financial system , and the virtual non-existence of regulation of over - the - counter ( OTC ) derivative contracts .
These gaps permitted lightly regulated or , in some cases , unregulated financial firms to engage in highly risky practices and offer toxic derivatives and other products that eventually infected the financial system …
She hits back at the administration pretty hard :
In light of these significant [ regulatory ] failings , it is difficult to see why so much effort should be expended to create a single regulator when political capital could be better spent on more important and fundamental issues which brought about the current crisis and the economic harm it has done .
She makes great points throughout .
But we ca n’t let Sheila and FDIC off too easy , though .
They ’ve been undercharging for deposit insurance for years , which meant they did n’t have the resources necessary to resolve too - big - to - fail financials when they collapsed last fall .
Instead FDIC was forced to delay the reckoning , offering big banks a federal guarantee for their debts .
But at least Bair recognizes the terrible precedent that has been set , and wants to move decisively to reverse it .
John Dugan over at OCC also questions the wisdom of concentrating too much power at the Fed , though he and Sheila clearly have their disagreements when it comes to the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency .
She ’s a big fan of existing proposals .
He ’s got qualms with it .
Incidentally , I agree with my colleague Matt Goldstein that it ’s good to see Tim Geithner get mad for a change .
A little anger is certainly appropriate .
I also agree with him that Geithner ’s anger seems misdirected .
( CNN ) -- The Michael Jackson song " This Is It , " released Monday , was co-written and recorded in 1983 with singer - songwriter Paul Anka , Anka and the Jackson estate confirmed Monday afternoon .
Interest has been running high in " This Is It " -- the song , the two - disc album and the movie .
Jackson 's estate and Sony Music Entertainment did not realize this history when they picked the song out of boxes of tapes in their archives , leading to a big surprise Monday when Anka called them , Anka said .
Jackson , who became busy with the success of his " Thriller " album , never finished the duet recording that was intended for Anka 's " Walk a Fine Line " album , Anka said .
Latin hip - hop singer Safire recorded and released the song in 1990 -- under the title " I Never Heard , " Anka said .
" Somebody just innocently found this tape and did not know somebody recorded it with him , " Anka said .
Estate spokesman James Bates acknowledged to CNN that the " song was written with the legendary Paul Anka . "
" We picked the song because the lyrics were appropriate given the name Michael gave his tour , " Bates said .
It was just a coincidence that the song 's first words were the same as Jackson 's last planned tour , Anka said .
Monday 's release of the lilting love song was part of the promotion for the Sony movie " Michael Jackson 's This Is It , " which comes out in two weeks .
Anka said it was " an honest mistake " that the estate 's special administrators quickly resolved Monday .
" They realized the mistake , " Anka said " They apologized and they 've given me rightfully what I own .
It 's 50 - 50 , right down the middle . "
Rob Stringer , chairman of Sony 's Columbia / Epic Label Group , was quoted in The New York Times on Sunday as saying he did not know the origins of the song .
Anka , who is heard playing piano on the song , said producers did a beautiful job of completing it .
Backing vocals from Jackson 's brothers and orchestration were added to the spare voice and piano track recorded 26 years ago in Anka 's studio .
The original version , with just Jackson and Anka , will be included in the two - disc soundtrack , along with the orchestral version , Sony said .
The orchestral version will play at the close of the film , which will feature Jackson 's career highlights and last rehearsals , Sony said .
The CD will be released on October 27 , coincidental with the debut of the movie , Sony said .
" Disc one features the original album masters of some of Michael 's biggest hits such as ' Billie Jean , ' ' Smooth Criminal , ' ' Human Nature , ' and ' Thriller ' arranged in the same sequence as they appear in the film , " Sony said .
The second disc includes " early demo versions " of Jackson classics " She 's Out Of My Life , " " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " and " Beat It , " Sony said .
" This disc also features a recently discovered spoken word poem from Michael Jackson entitled ' Planet Earth , " the company said .
The just - released song got widespread airplay on radio shows across the United States Monday , according to Nielsen BDS , a company that tracks music airplay .
It the 21st most - played song on the 1,300 stations monitored by Nielsen , with at least 680 " spins " by mid-afternoon , the company said .
All About Michael Jackson
For starters I ’ll mention that I ’m not sure from whence these photos originate , but when I saw them over on Russian casemod site Modding .
Ru , I had to post them .
From the looks of these pics , it looks like a tiny little family has moved into this warm and cozy computer living room and set up their home .
The PC Living Room ( or is that Living Room PC ) is furnished tiny little dollhouse furniture , including a sofa , a comfy chair , and even a little lamp that plugs into one of the PC ’s accessory power circuits .
I love the little details like the gumball machine , a bottle of Coke and the New York Times paper sitting on one of the chairs .
All they need is a couple of mini arcade games , and they ’d be all set .
And is that a box of Cracker Jacks sitting on the side table ?
That reminds me – what the hell is the deal with the prizes in Cracker Jacks these days ?
Who the hell thinks a 2 cent piece of paper with some folding die cuts is a “ prize ” ?
Not me .
I mean really , once they eliminated the choking hazard , it was all downhill for me .
Anyway , I digress …
Thankfully , they decided to leave the side off the computer so the PC ’s tiny occupants wo n’t overheat or suffocate .
That would be a real mess to clean up .
( P.S. If any of you guys know who originally shot these photos , I ’d be happy to give credit where credit is due . )

The dangerous practice of ' widow cleansing ' is starting to come out into the open
Healthy conversation : a group of men discuss the taboo of widow cleansing and ( left ) former cleanser Esban Ochanga .
Photo : Frederic Courbet
The men sitting in the shade of a large thorn tree on the outskirts of Kano - Angola village , 10 miles inland from the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya ’s Nyanza province , are in buoyant spirits today .
There is bravado , there are lewd jokes , but there are also long periods of silence .
One man in particular commands attention .
As soon as he begins to talk , the rest of the group listen deferentially .
Esban Ochanga is tall and slender with a far - away look in his eyes .
He has called the men together to talk about the practice of widow cleansing , whereby Luo women , after the death of their spouse , are pressurized into having unprotected sex ; ostensibly to allow their husband ’s spirit to roam free in the afterlife .
It is a tradition rarely spoken about in public .
‘ I knew my brother had died and they told me it was AIDS , but I thought a Luo could not die because of that virus , ’ says Ochanga .
‘ So I cleansed his widow and I contracted HIV .
That is what killed my first wife . ’
With the spiralling rates of HIV , men have become reluctant to inherit or cleanse widows .
About 15 per cent of the population in Nyanza have HIV ; 63 per cent live below the poverty line .
In Kano - Angola , two - thirds of people who have tested for HIV have turned out positive .
Advert
Increasingly , ‘ male cleansers for hire ’ – who go from village to village to perform the service – are being brought in .
Ochanga tells the group that a cleanser operating in Kano - Angola is even having sex with recently deceased women , at the behest of their families .
None of the men look surprised .
‘ The commercial part of widow cleansing , I also did , ’ admits Ochanga to the group .
‘ It was for the money and it seemed easy . ’
Though most of the men gathered are HIV positive , Ochanga is the only one to have come out openly to his wives and community , not only about his status but also about his work as a cleanser .
Working as a volunteer peer educator with the Movement of Men Against AIDS in Kenya , a charity which encourages men to play a more prominent role in Africa ’s response to HIV , Ochanga and other members of the community are supporting people to have HIV tests and to use condoms .
Ochanga says he takes antiretroviral drugs ( ARVs ) and practises safer sex with all his wives .
Two are HIV positive , the other is negative .
Mother - to - child HIV transmission rates are dropping and Ochanga says that – as a result of discussion groups like this – attitudes are beginning to change .
‘ How much were you paid to cleanse ? ’ asks a man in his thirties , laughing nervously .
‘ The price of a cow .
Just one night and you ’ve got a cow , ’ replies Ochanga , shrugging his shoulders .
‘ My grandfather did it , my father did it , so I was not afraid of doing it .
But the sons of this village will cease to do it . ’

PETERBOROUGH , in the English Midlands , is a red - brick town , best known as the midway point on the line between King 's Cross and York .
But from the bottom of Kingfisher Lake , just outside it , urban toil seems far away .
There , all is most delightful silt and slime .
A push of your probing nose sends up puffs and clouds of fine mud through the water .
A riff of bubbles rises , silvery , towards the surface .
The green reeds quiver , and sunlight ripples down almost to the depths where you are lurking , plump and still .
Such was mostly the life , and such was the address , of Benson , England 's most famous fish .
Her actual place of birth , as a wriggling , transparent fry prey to every frog , pike and heron , was never known .
But at ten , when she was stocked in Kingfisher , she was already a bruiser .
And there , among the willow - shaded banks , she grew .
And grew .
At her peak weight , in 2006 , she was 64lb 2 oz ( 29kg ) , and was almost circular , like a puffed - up plaice .
Bigger carp have been seen in Thailand and in France ; but she still amounted to a lot of gefilte fish .
In her glory days she reminded some of Marilyn Monroe , others of Raquel Welch .
She was lither than either as she cruised through the water - weed , a lazy twist of gold .
Her gleaming scales , said one fan , were as perfect as if they had been painted on .
Some wag had named her after a small black hole in her dorsal fin which looked , to him , like a cigarette burn .
It was as beautiful and distinctive as a mole on an 18th - century belle .
Her lips were full , sultry or sulking , her expression unblinking ; she seldom smiled .
Yet the reeds held fond memories of her friend Hedges , her companion in slinky swimming until she , or he , was carried away in 1998 by the waters of the River Nene .
Abandoned , she ate more .
She devoured everything .
Worms , plankton , crayfish , lily roots , disappeared down her toothed , capacious throat .
She was a one - fish Hoover , motoring through the food - packed sludge and through rich layers of sedimentary smells .
But she was offered daintier and more exotic fare .
Cubes of cheese , scraps of luncheon meat , bread crusts , Peperami , dog biscuits and tutti-frutti balls all came down invitingly through the water .
She sampled most of them .
Of course , she was not fool enough to think they came from heaven .
Carp are cunning , a very fox of the river , as Izaak Walton said .
She could see the lines , and at the end of them the trembling shadows of Bert , or Mike , or Stan , spending an idle Sunday away from the wife with a brolly and a can of beer .
Often she continued to lurk , roiling the mud to conceal herself and basking in her own scaled beauty , as carp will .
On hot days she would rise to the surface , glowing and tantalising , with a lily - leaf shading her like a parasol .
She played hard - to - get , or the One That Got Away , nudging the line before drifting down towards the dark serene .
But then , just for the hell of it , she would take the bait .
The first hookings hurt like hell , the whole weight of her body tearing her tongue like a razor blade .
But over the years she got used to it , and her leathery mouth would seize the bait as a prize .
Hauled to the limelight , she was admirably unphased .
This was , after all , the homage beauty was owed .
She would submit to the scales and then pose for the photographer , unmoving , holding her breath .
She had her picture taken with Tony , owner of her lake , who confessed to the Wall Street Journal that he had “ quite a rapport ” with her ; with Ray , who caught her at two in the morning , disturbing her beauty sleep ; with Matt , of the shy smile and the woolly hat ; with bearded Kyle , for whom she looked especially dark and pouting ; and with Steve , who ungallantly told Peterborough Today that she felt like “ a sack of potatoes ” and was “ available to everyone ” .
She was not , but at least 50 others held her , or gripped her , for a moment or so .
Uncomplainingly , she nestled in their arms before she was lowered to her element again .
These men had a knowledgeable air about them .
They might have been a secret society , meeting at odd hours in hidden nooks around the lake .
Each had his spot for anoracked meditation .
When they spoke , it was of wagglers and clips , spods and backbiters , size 14s and number 8 elastic .
Dates and weights were bandied about , an arcane code .
For a while , Benson imbibed the philosophy of a gaudier and more complex sphere , heard the tinny music of their radios and stared into the dazzle of the day .
There was much that she herself might have imparted , of the mystery of reflected and inverted things .
But her anglers needed to get home to the football and their tea .
The fatal nut
Greed probably undid her in the end .
She was said to have taken a bait of uncooked tiger nuts , which swelled inside her until she floated upwards .
Telltale empty paper bags were found on the bank of the river .
Or she may have been pregnant , with 300,000 eggs causing complications , or stressed after so much catching and releasing , those constant brushes with extinction .
On the line between life and death , at Kingfisher Lake , she breathed the fatal air and did not sink again .
And there she lay , like Wisdom drawn up from the deep : as golden , and as quiet .
IL CASO
Due processi « scongelati » .
Ma senza rischi
Prescrizione decisiva .
Su Mills si riparte da capo con altri giudici , ridotte le imputazioni sui diritti tv
MILANO — E adesso cosa ri­schia in concreto Silvio Berlusco­ni nei due processi milanesi ( Mills e diritti tv Mediaset ) « scongelati » dall ’ incostituziona­lità della legge Alfano ?
Niente , nel breve - medio termine .
E po­co anche nel lungo termine .
Per­ché la prescrizione limerà le asperità di entrambi ben prima del loro approdo in Cassazione .
E soprattutto perché la legge Al­fano ha comunque già ottenuto lo scopo per il quale fu approva­ta velocemente : liberare subito Berlusconi dai giudici che un an­no fa erano ad un passo dal giu­dicarlo come poi hanno fatto con il diretto coimputato Mills condannato a 4 anni e mezzo , e in prospettiva assicurare al pre­mier l’azzeramento di questo « suo » processo , destinato per forza a ricominciare da capo da­vanti a nuovi giudici .
Il processo Mills
Il 4 ottobre 2008 , infatti , nel sottoporre alla Consulta la legge Alfano , i giudici Gandus - Dori­go - Caccialanza avevano dovuto stralciare il processo a Berlusco­ni , e proseguire per il solo coim­putato Mills la fase finale del di­battimento ( ormai a un passo da requisitoria e arringhe ) .
Il 17 febbraio 2009 avevano pronun­ciato la sentenza di condanna di cui proprio domani inizierà l’ap­pello , fissato in fretta perché il reato si prescrive verso febbra­io- marzo 2010 .
Ma in questo modo i tre giudici , nel ritenere l'avvocato inglese corrotto nel­l ’interesse di Berlusconi per dire il falso sui conti esteri Fininvest , hanno già espresso un convinci­mento sulla medesima corruzio­ne imputata al premier nello schema corrotto - corruttore : e per legge sono perciò diventati tecnicamente « incompatibili » a poter giudicare il coimputato Berlusconi , ora che il suo proces­so ripartirebbe a causa della boc­ciatura della legge Alfano da par­te della Corte Costituzionale .
I vecchi giudici dovranno dunque fissare una udienza nel­la quale spogliarsi del processo , che passerà a tre nuovi giudici della stessa sezione ma non rico­mincerà dal punto quasi finale in cui era : davanti ai nuovi giudi­ci , infatti , tutte le testimonianze ( 22 ) e le rogatorie all ’estero ( 9 ) e le prove sinora assunte in qua­si 2 anni di processo varranno soltanto a patto che la difesa del premier presti consenso alla lo­ro utilizzabilità .
Ma siccome è improbabile che Berlusconi ri­nunci al diritto di vedere le pro­ve formarsi davanti ai nuovi giu­dici ( « principio di immediatez­za » ) , il processo dovrà per forza ricominciare da capo .
E l’azzera­mento del processo cancellerà le realistiche chance che qualun­que verdetto faccia in tempo ad arrivare in Cassazione prima che la prescrizione , accorciata dalla legge ex Cirielli , scocchi en­tro un anno e mezzo anche nel più generoso dei calcoli ( termi­ni normali più recupero del tem­po d’attesa della Consulta sulla legge Alfano ) .
Diritti tv Mediaset
Macchinosa sarà anche la rimes­sa in moto del processo « diritti tv Mediaset » , che dal 2007 , con­testa a Berlusconi e 7 coimputa­ti d'aver « mascherato la forma­zione di ingenti fondi neri » , dirottati dalle casse aziendali a « conti esteri gestiti da suoi fi­duciari » , con la compravendita di diritti tv « gonfiata » da fittizi negoziati tra agenti e società in apparenza estranei al gruppo ma di fatto riconducibili a Berlu­sconi .
Già al momento dello stop - Al­fano , il dibattimento era molto « dimagrito » : la prescrizione ave­va ingoiato quasi tutte le imputa­zioni che all ’inizio assumevano appro­priazioni indebite per 276 milioni di dollari e fro­di fiscali per 120 miliardi di lire « fino al 1999 » .
Nelle ulti­me udienze pm e difese batta­gliavano sulla legittimità delle contestazioni suppletive del pm che , spostando la frontiera della superstite frode fiscale al 2003 , provava ad « allungare » la vita del processo al 2012 , approdo possibile forse per un verdetto di primo grado ma improbabile per un esito in Cassazione ; e sul­la correttezza del continuo river­samento nel processo di atti pro­venienti da un’altra indagine ( stessa materia ma anni succes­sivi ) , che presto vedrà i pm chie­dere un altro rinvio a giudizio di Berlusconi per appropriazione indebita .
E poi il processo Mediaset .
Poco prima della legge Alfano , il presidente del collegio , Edoar­do D’Avossa , era passato al tri­bunale di La Spezia , e per prose­guire il processo milanese ave­va avuto dal Csm un anno di « applicazione » .
Quando però la legge Alfano ha sospeso il pro­cesso , D’Avossa ha chiesto al Csm di sospendere anche l’ap­plicazione , altrimenti consuma­ta invano .
Ora dovrà essere ri­pristinata dal Csm , ma è chiaro sin d’ora che il processo Media­set , quando riuscirà a ripartire , non potrà viaggiare più veloce di una udienza alla settimana , e non tanto per la spola Mila­no - La Spezia del presidente , quanto perché dovrà rispettare le « targhe alterne » : e cioè spar­tirsi , con il calendario del pro­cesso Mills , le uniche giornate ( luned ì e venerdì , forse sabato mattina ) nelle quali evitare i possibili « legittimi impedimen­ti » parlamentari degli avvoca­ti- parlamentari di Berlusconi , Ghedini e Longo .
At elite Olympic level the picture still looks healthy and it was curious back in March that a haul of nine medals at the World Championships in Poland – from a squad minus Wiggins , Hoy and Rebecca Romero – was considered in many quarters as disappointing .
Wrong .
In a post -Olympic season with an experimental team it was fine , very much on track .

Paris Peace Treaty Text
Paris Peace Treaty
( PEACE TREATY of 1783 )
Text Version
In the name of the most holy and undivided Trinity .
It having pleased the Divine Providence to dispose the hearts of the most serene and most potent Prince George the Third , by the grace of God , king of Great Britain , France , and Ireland , defender of the faith , duke of Brunswick and Lunebourg , arch - treasurer and prince elector of the Holy Roman Empire etc. , and of the United States of America , to forget all past misunderstandings and differences that have unhappily interrupted the good correspondence and friendship which they mutually wish to restore , and to establish such a beneficial and satisfactory intercourse , between the two countries upon the ground of reciprocal advantages and mutual convenience as may promote and secure to both perpetual peace and harmony ; and having for this desirable end already laid the foundation of peace and reconciliation by the Provisional Articles signed at Paris on the 30th of November 1782 , by the commissioners empowered on each part , which articles were agreed to be inserted in and constitute the Treaty of Peace proposed to be concluded between the Crown of Great Britain and the said United States , but which treaty was not to be concluded until terms of peace should be agreed upon between Great Britain and France and his Britannic Majesty should be ready to conclude such treaty accordingly ; and the treaty between Great Britain and France having since been concluded , his Britannic Majesty and the United States of America , in order to carry into full effect the Provisional Articles above mentioned , according to the tenor thereof , have constituted and appointed , that is to say his Britannic Majesty on his part , David Hartley , Esqr. , member of the Parliament of Great Britain , and the said United States on their part , John Adams , Esqr. , late a commissioner of the United States of America at the court of Versailles , late delegate in Congress from the state of Massachusetts , and chief justice of the said state , and minister plenipotentiary of the said United States to their high mightinesses the States General of the United Netherlands ; Benjamin Franklin , Esqr. , late delegate in Congress from the state of Pennsylvania , president of the convention of the said state , and minister plenipotentiary from the United States of America at the court of Versailles ; John Jay , Esqr. , late president of Congress and chief justice of the state of New York , and minister plenipotentiary from the said United States at the court of Madrid ; to be plenipotentiaries for the concluding and signing the present definitive treaty ; who after having reciprocally communicated their respective full powers have agreed upon and confirmed the following articles .

Listen to a top economist in the Obama administration describe Paul A. Volcker , the former Federal Reserve chairman who endorsed Mr. Obama early in his election campaign and who stood by his side during the financial crisis .
“ The guy ’s a giant , he ’s a genius , he is a great human being , ” said Austan D. Goolsbee , counselor to Mr. Obama since their Chicago days .
“ Whenever he has advice , the administration is very interested . ”
Well , not lately .
The aging Mr. Volcker ( he is 82 ) has some advice , deeply felt .
He has been offering it in speeches and Congressional testimony , and repeating it to those around the president , most of them young enough to be his children .
He wants the nation ’s banks to be prohibited from owning and trading risky securities , the very practice that got the biggest ones into deep trouble in 2008 .
And the administration is saying no , it will not separate commercial banking from investment operations .
Via Raw Story , news that police use of this weapon is even closer - and more portable , so use will be widespread .
I was writing about this in 2006 .
And no , it 's more than " burning sensations " - when they did the tests , they banned metal buttons and zippers because they caused burns , and they also banned contact lenses because they could become fused to the eyeballs .
What brave Congress member will introduce legislation to stop this ?

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter maneuvered into its 50 - km mapping orbit on September 15 , which enables it to take a closer look at the Moon than any previous orbiter .
This also allows for comparing previous images taken by LRO when it was at its higher orbit .
Here ’s the Apollo 17 landing site : just look at what is all visible , especially in the image below !
These images have more than two times better resolution than the previously acquired images .
At the time of this recent pass , the Sun was high in the sky ( 28° incidence angle ) helping to bring out subtle differences in surface brightness .
The descent stage of the lunar module Challenger is now clearly visible , at 50 - cm per pixel ( angular resolution ) the descent stage deck is eight pixels across ( four meters ) , and the legs are also now distinguishable .
The descent stage served as the launch pad for the ascent stage as it blasted off for a rendezvous with the command module America on December 14 , 1972 .
Also visible is the ALSEP , the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments , which for Apollo 17 included 1 ) Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment ( geophones ) , 2 ) Lunar Atmospheric Composition Experiment ( LACE ) to measure the composition of the Moon ’s extremely tenuous surface bound exosphere , 3 ) Lunar Ejecta and Meteorites ( LEAM ) experiment , 4 ) central station , 5 ) Heat Flow Experiment , 6 ) all powered by a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator ( RTG ) .
Below is how it looked from the surface , taken by the Apollo astronauts .

Former US Vice President Dick Cheney accused the White House of dithering over the strategy for the war in Afghanistan and urged President Barack Obama to " do what it takes to win " .
" Make no mistake .
Signals of indecision out of Washington hurt our allies and embolden our adversaries , " Mr Cheney said while accepting an award from a conservative national security group , the Centre for Security Policy .
Mr Cheney disputed remarks by White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel that the Bush administration had been adrift concerning the war in Afghanistan and that the Obama administration had to start from the beginning to develop a strategy for the eight - year - old war .
On the contrary , Mr Cheney said , the Bush administration undertook its own review of the war before leaving office and presented its findings to Mr Obama 's transition team .
" They asked us not to announce our findings publicly , and we agreed , giving them the benefit of our work and the benefit of the doubt , " Mr Cheney said .
The strategy Mr Obama announced in March bore a " striking resemblance " to what the Bush administration review had found , the vice president said .
Mr Emanuel told CNN on Sunday that the decision regarding what to do in Afghanistan is more complex than whether to send more troops .
The US commander there , General Stanley McChrystal , has reportedly asked for as many as 40,000 additional troops to combat the Taliban insurgency and al Qaida fighters .
" When you go through all the analysis , it 's clear that basically we had a war for eight years that was going on , that 's adrift , that we 're beginning at scratch , and just from the starting point , after eight years , " Mr Emanuel said .
Mr Cheney said the Obama administration seems to be pulling back and blaming others for its own failure to implement the strategy it had embraced earlier in the year .
" The White House must stop dithering while America 's armed forces are in danger , " the former vice president said .
" It 's time for President Obama to do what it takes to win a war he has repeatedly and rightly called a war of necessity . "
Mr Cheney criticised Mr Obama 's decision to drop plans begun in the Bush administration for missile defence interceptors in Poland and a radar site in the Czech Republic , calling the move " a strategic blunder and a breach of good faith " .
The administration said it will instead pursue a higher - tech system that is also more cost - effective .
" Our Polish and Czech friends are entitled to wonder how strategic plans and promises years in the making could be dissolved just like that with apparently little if any consultation , " he said .
" President Obama 's cancellation of America 's agreements with the Polish and Czech governments is a serious blow to the hopes and aspirations of millions of Europeans . "
Mr Cheney said those who try to placate Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and accede to his wishes will get nothing in return but trouble .

As if you needed another reason to despise the family of “ Balloon Boy ” — which is looking at criminal charges thanks to their attempt at infamy — but this music video from the fame - seekers shows off how mom and dad taught their three sons what it means to be men .
Namely , that you ca n’t be “ pussified . ”
Yes , this family has their own music video from their Wife Swap days .
And yes , it ’s filled with the F - word in a Buju Banton - style call for muder .
Queerty reader Jonathan told us he heard the three boys using the word in the video .
So we took a listen , and might have heard the word used around the 2:40 mark , but that ’s definitely them saying “ faggot ” at around 2:52 — as they reenact a gay bashing murder scene .

Enlightened Chinese farmer branches out by growing pears shaped like baby Buddha
Hang time : Baby - shaped pears will soon be coming to a supermarket near you
For Britain 's struggling fruit farmers , things could be about to go even more pear - shaped ...
A Chinese farmer has invented baby - shaped pears - and he is planning to export his novel idea over here .
Plucky farmer Gao Xianzhang has created 10,000 of the mini marvels this season and he plans to take the fruits of his labour to the UK and Europe .
Britain could soon see the arrival of the pears , which are shaped like mini buddhas .
If the idea catches on , sales of the mini pears could hit the profits of British farmers who are already struggling to fend off sales of cheaper foreign produce in recession - hit Britain .
Gao spent six years perfecting the intricate baby - shaped pears , carefully crafting each one which grows inside an individual mould .
Despite their hefty cost of £ 5 each , locals in his home village of Hexia , in Hebia , northern China , have reportedly been snapping them up .
' People seem to think they are cute or lucky and will buy them as soon as they 're off the tree , ' Gao explained .
Luckily for Gao , he should have few problems getting his quirky shaped fruits past EU officials .
In July , wonky shaped fruit and vegetables such as curvy cucumbers and knobbly carrots returned to supermarket shelves after EU rules restricting the size and shape of 36 types of fruit and vegetables
For the last 20 years , EU - wide marketing standards have encouraged the sale of finest - looking produce for sale in shops .
Sleeping giants : baby - shaped pears could be all the rage in Britain

More than 4 1/2 hours after a deer was first spotted outside Union Station , police tranquilized , Tasered and safely captured the intrepid animal .
Police cruisers blocked off a small greenspace at the corner of Chestnut and Edward Sts. , where the deer was hiding in the shadow of a multi-storey commercial building .
After a Toronto Zoo veterinarian fired the tranquilizer dart , the deer jumped up , startled by officers carrying large nets , and leapt over police tape onto Chestnut St .
There , officers Tasered the animal and pinned it with a net before lifting it into the back of an Animal Services vehicle .
Immediately after the capture , dozens of onlookers who had gathered , disappeared .
The animal has since been released in a conservation in the city 's east end , but no one knows where it came from .
The animal will be watched over by veterinarians and then likely given to the Toronto Zoo , police said .
Still , no one knows where it came from .
" Obviously , it made its way from Rouge Valley , Humber Valley , " said Supt .
Hugh Ferguson .
" How ?
God only knows ... GO Train , maybe . "
Half a dozen cruisers , a handful of police officers , the Emergency Task force and a lot of police tape had been guarding the frightened deer in the city 's downtown core for much of the morning .
The animal was huddled under some shrubs in the shadow of 123 Edward St. , near the Toronto Coach Terminal at Bay and Dundas Sts .
The animal was huddled under some shrubs in the shadow of 123 Edward St. , near the Greyhound bus station at Bay and Dundas Sts .
The deer – believed to be a doe – appeared agitated as a group of about 40 people gathered to gawk .
Many stopped to snap pictures of the animal before police shooed them away .
The deer does not appear to be injured .
Police held off tranquillizing the animal for much of the morning , waiting for protective fencing or netting to capture it .
" He 's going to become enraged .
It 's going to take 5 - 10 minutes for him to be put under ( once he 's tranquilized ) , " said Sgt. Winston Bennett .
The deer could travel upwards of a mile within that time frame , he added .
" The last thing the police want to do is spook the already agitated animal . "
Public safety is the number one priority , he said .
" It 's sort of sad , there used to be a lot of green spaces around , " said Dr. Irving Feldman , an optometrist in the building , who was heading into work when he saw the commotion .
" But it should n't be here , it 's really dangerous for them .
Police should take it away and put it in a park where it belongs . "
The intersection of Edward and Chestnut Sts. was cordoned off .
Chestnut was closed from Edward to Dundas , and Edward St. was closed from Centre Ave. to Elizabeth St .
According to a Greyhound employee , buses departing from Toronto Bus Depot , just steps away from the deer , were being re-routed around Edward St .

Mike Gavros is an electrician working on a building steps away from where the deer was resting .
He and several co-workers stood around looking .
" I 've been working in the downtown core for 20 years , I 've never seen a deer .
The weirdest thing I 've seen is an opossum . "
Gavros , who is also a recreational deer hunter , said it 's very rare to see a doe during the day because they are often resting and hiding .
I spoke with Anderson earlier this month to ask him about becoming an author ; meeting ( and later parting ways with ) Ken Olsen ; how they raised money for the start - up ; what he views as the Achilles ' heel that undermined DEC ; and a surprising project he was involved with that you likely have appreciated on a summer afternoon .
Harlan Anderson just turned 80 this month .
With Ken Olsen , he started Digital Equipment Corp. , which was one of the pillars of the Route 128 era here in Massachusetts , and at one point was the second - biggest technology company in the world .
Next month , his memoirs are out : Learn , Earn & Return : My Life as a Computer Pioneer .
Anderson met Olsen working at MIT 's Lincoln Labs in the 1950s , just as that military R&D group was being formed .
" He was my first boss , " Anderson says .
The duo wound up working together on the TX - 2 , an early transistor - based computer .
" [ Olsen ] had a lot of charisma , and a practical sense of how to go about things , " Anderson says .
" He did n't seem like an academic who wanted to stay in the ivory tower forever . "
Olsen and Anderson left MIT in 1957 to start a company that would design new computers that took advantage of the shift from vacuum tubes to transistors .
After they sought funding from defense contractor General Dynamics and were rejected , Anderson writes :
We continued to consider other sources of financing and next made a visit to the Small Business Administration office in Boston - naïvely thinking that one went in , made a proposal , and they just gave you money .
That was not the way it worked , of course .
However , they were very helpful in introducing us to the concept of venture capital , which was neither well - known nor widespread at the time .
In fact , as far as we knew , there were only three organizations engaging in this type of financing at the time , not counting individual wealthy angels like Laurence Rockefeller : American Research and Development Corporation ( ARD ) in Boston and two other firms in New York .
We learned that in order to present a business plan to possible sources of financing we needed to provide pro forma financial statements , which contained projected profit and loss , balance sheet and cash flow .
We knew nothing about any of this .
We were truly naïve in the business world , but we were eager and willing to learn .
So we spent many more lunch hours at the Lexington Public Library pouring over Standard & Poors and Moodys investment reference books to see what this kind of accounting information looked like for industrial corporations .
When Digital first took money from American Research & Development , Anderson writes that ARD invested $ 70,000 for seventy percent of the company .
" This deal seems ridiculous and unfair by today 's standards ; however , we never contacted an alternative source of capital , " Anderson writes .
" We were very naïve and there was very little venture capital money available then .
We accepted the offer without any negotiation . "
( In the photo is Anderson , sitting in front of Digital 's PDP - 6 computer , with Georges Doriot , the founder of ARD . )
I told Anderson that I 'd recently been out to the mill complex in Maynard where Digital was long headquartered , and that it was still full of interesting companies .
" We paid 40 cents a square foot -- annually , " he recalled .
" And that included heat , parking , utilities , and watchman service at night .
We thought we had one heck of a deal .
That was cheap , even for those days . "
In the book , Anderson discusses his split with Olsen -- a bit of history I 'd never really understood .
MIT professor Jay Forrester was on DEC 's board , and was perenially concerned that DEC was growing too fast .
Anderson tended to agree .
" We had good engineers , but they'd get overcommitted , and then the boom would be lowered on them , " he told me .
He met privately with Forrester , and shared information with him that Olsen had tried to withhold .
" That was the end for me .
[ Olsen ] viewed it as disloyalty , and he did n't want any criticism from anybody . "
Anderson was pushed out of Digital in 1966 , and Forrester left the board that same year .
( In the photo , Olsen is at left , pictured with Digital 's PDP - 1 computer .
The two fellows are unidentified . )
" It was the greatest disappointment of my life that the falling - out occurred , " Anderson said .
He writes :
I thought we had started a Hewlett Packard - type company with strong and lasting relationships between the founders , but instead I became a forgotten co-founder not unlike Briton Hadden , the co-founder with Henry Luce of Time .
( Unfortunately , Olsen has never written a memoir of his own , and I was n't able to get in touch with him to seek his responses to the material in Anderson 's book . )
In fact , Anderson later went on to become the first - ever science advisor for Time Inc. ; serve on the board of Boston - based publisher International Data Group ; and to make venture capital investments of his own .
At its peak , DEC employed an incredible 140,000 people worldwide .
Olsen was replaced as its leader in 1992 , and in the late 1990s , many Digital businesses were sold off , culminating in the sale of the company to Compaq in 1998 .
Part of Digital 's decline , Anderson says , may have been the company 's reluctance to embrace common industry standards as they emerged .
" Digital was still hung up with the idea that everything had to be their own proprietary technology , whether it was software or chips . "
But he views Digital 's lasting achievement as " bringing the cost of high - performance computers down in the price range where they could be used for lots of things that had been uneconomical before . "
In the book , he elaborates :
In addition to creating the first interactive computer game , time - shared use of computers and the very first computer editing program , the PDP - 1s brilliant first customers pioneered other new applications for inexpensive computers such as the first automatic switching of telecommunication lines , pattern recognition of physics particles , artificial intelligence , and other equally remarkable applications .
For them , its possibilities were endless .
Some have called American Research & Development 's investment in DEC the " first home run " for the venture capital industry .
" Was it the success of the company , or the outlandish deal they got ? "
Anderson asked rhetorically .
" I think it was both . "
And if you 've ever been to Tanglewood , the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra , and picnicked on the lawn , you owe a debt to Anderson , who is a life trustee of the BSO .
He was the leading advocate for putting up video screens on the outside of the shed , " so that people on the lawn would be able to actually see the musicians . "
Thanks , Harlan .
Learn , Earn & Return is out next month .
I 'm hoping that Anderson , who now lives in Connecticut , will make it to Boston for at least one book event .
Do you have any memories of DEC , Olsen , or Anderson ?
Do post them , if you would ...
And let me end with one last great picture from DEC 's past : the board of directors .
Jay Forrester is third from the left .
Bill Congleton from ARD is to his right .
Harlan Anderson is one to the right .
At the head of the table is Ken Olsen .
And to Olsen 's right is Dorothy Rowe .
I 'd not heard of her before , but she was a senior vice president at ARD , Digital 's first treasurer , and perhaps the first female VC .
The Obama administration has clung for so long to the Bush administration ’s expansive claims of national security and executive power that it is in danger of turning President George W. Bush ’s cover -up of abuses committed in the name of fighting terrorism into President Barack Obama ’s cover-up .
We have had recent reminders of this dismaying retreat from Mr. Obama ’s passionate campaign promises to make a break with Mr. Bush ’s abuses of power , a shift that denies justice to the victims of wayward government policies and shields officials from accountability .
In Britain earlier this month , a two - judge High Court panel rejected arguments made first by the Bush team and now by the Obama team and decided to make public seven redacted paragraphs in American intelligence documents relating to torture allegations by a former prisoner at Guantánamo Bay .
The prisoner , Binyam Mohamed , an Ethiopian - born British national , says he was tortured in Pakistan , Morocco and at a C.I.A. - run prison outside Kabul before being transferred to Guantánamo .
He was freed in February .
To block the release of those paragraphs , the Bush administration threatened to cut its intelligence - sharing with Britain , an inappropriate threat that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton repeated .
But the court concluded that the actual risk of harm to intelligence - sharing was minimal , given the close relationship between the two countries .
The court also found a “ compelling public interest ” in disclosure , and said that nothing in the disputed seven paragraphs  a summary of evidence relating to the involvement of the British security services in Mr. Mohamed ’s ordeal  had anything to do with “ secret intelligence . ”
If you want to understand C++ template metaprogramming ( TMP ) you have to know functional programming .
Seriously .
I want you to think of TMP as maximally obfuscated ( subset of ) Haskell , and I ’ll illustrate this point by point .
If you do n’t know Haskell , do n’t worry , I ’ll explain the syntax as I go .
The nice thing about single - paradigm languages like Haskell is that they have very simple syntax ( think of Lisp that does everything with just a bunch of parentheses ) .
I will start the Haskell - C++TMP mapping with basics , like functions and recursion , but I ’ll try to cover a lot more , including higher - order functions , pattern matching , list comprehension ( did you know it was expressible in C++? ) , and more .
Keep in mind that my Haskell examples are runtime functions operating on runtime data whereas their C++ TMP equivalents are compile - time templates operating mostly on types .
Operation on types are essential in providing correct and efficient implementations of parametrized classes and functions .
By necessity the examples are simple , but the same mapping may be applied to much more complex templates from the C++ Standard Library and Boost .
As a bonus , I ’ll also explain the hot new thing , variadic templates .
Functional Approach to Functions
How do you implement useful functions if you do n’t have mutable variables , if statements , or loops ?
To a C++ programmer that might seem like an impossible task .
But that ’s the reality of C++ compile - time language that forms the basis of TMP .
Functional programming to the rescue !
As a warm - up , let ’s see how Haskell implements a simple function , the factorial :
fact 0 = 1 fact n = n * fact ( n - 1 )
The first line states that the factorial of zero is one .
The second line defines factorial for a non-zero argument , n ( strictly speaking it only works for positive non-zero arguments ) .
It does it using recursion : factorial of n is equal to n times the factorial of n - 1 .
The recursion stops when n is equal to zero , in which case the first definition kicks in .
Notice that the definition of the function fact is split into two sub-definitions .
So when you call :
fact 4
the first definition is looked up first and , if it does n’t match the argument ( which it does n’t ) , the second one comes into play .
This is the simplest case of pattern matching : 4 does n’t match the “ pattern ” 0 , but it matches the pattern n .
Here ’s almost exactly the same code expressed in C++ TMP :
template < int n> struct fact { static const int value = n * fact <n - 1 > :: value ; } ; template <> struct fact < 0 > { // specialization for n = 0 static const int value = 1 ; } ;
You might notice how the horrible syntax of C++ TMP obscures the simplicity and elegance of this code .
But once you are equipped with the C++/ Haskell decoder ring , things become a lot clearer .
Let ’s analyze this code .
Just like in Haskell , there are two definitions of fact , except that their order is inverted .
This is because C++ requires template specialization to follow the template ’s general definition ( or declaration , as we ’ll see later ) .
The pattern matching of arguments in C++ does not follow the order of declarations but rather is based on “ best match ” .
If you instantiate the template with argument zero :
cout << " Factorial of 0 = " << fact <0>:: value << endl ;
the second pattern , fact < 0 > , is a better fit .
Otherwise the first one , < int n > , is used .
Notice also the weird syntax for “ function call ”
fact <n>:: value
and for the “ return statement ”
static const int value = n * fact <n - 1>:: value ;
This all makes sense if you look at templates as definitions of parameterized types , which was their initial purpose in C ++.
In that interpretation , we are defining a struct called fact , parameterized by an integer n , whose sole member is a static const integer called value .
Moreover , this template is specialized for the case of n equal zero .
Now I want you to forget about what I just said and put on the glasses which make the C++ code look like the corresponding Haskell code .
Here ’s another example –this time of a predicate ( a function returning a Boolean ) :
is_zero 0 = True is_zero x = False
Let ’s spice it up a little for C++ and define a predicate on types rather than integers .
The following compile - time function returns true only when the type T is a pointer :
template < class T> struct is
Ptr { static const bool value = false ; } ; template < class U > struct is Ptr<U*> { static const bool value = true ; } ;
This time the actual argument to is Ptr is first matched to the more specialized pattern , U * and , if it fails , the general pattern is used .
We can add yet another specialization , which will pattern - match a const pointer :
template < class U > struct is Ptr<U * const > { static const bool value = true ; } ;
These types of type predicates may be , for instance , used to select more flexible and efficient implementations of parameterized containers .
Think of the differences between a vector of values vs. a vector of pointers .
Lists
The basic data structure in functional languages is the list .
Haskell ’s lists are introduced using square brackets .
For instance , a list of three numbers , 1 , 2 , 3 , looks like :
[ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
List processing in functional languages follows the standard pattern : a list is split into head and tail , an operation is performed on the head , and the tail is processed using recursion .
The splitting is done by pattern matching : the Haskell pattern being ( head : tail ) ( to be precise , the colon in parentheses represents the cons operation –the creation of a list by prepending an element to an existing list ) .
Here ’s a simple function , count , that calculates the length of a list :
count [ ] = 0 count ( head : tail ) = 1 + count tail
The first pattern , [ ] , matches an empty list ; the second a non-empty one .
Notice that a function call in Haskell does n’t use parentheses around arguments , so count tail is interpreted as a call to count with the argument tail .
Before C++0x , TMP was severely crippled by the lack of a list primitive .
People used separate definitions for a list of zero , one , two , etc. , elements , and even used special macros to define them .
This is no longer true in C++0x , thanks to variadic templates and template parameter packs .
Here ’s our Haskel count translated into C++ TMP :
// Just a declaration template < class ... list > struct count ; template <> struct count <> { static const int value = 0 ; } ; template < class head , class ... tail > struct count < head , tail ...> { static const int value = 1 + count < tail ...>:: value ; } ;
First we have a declaration ( not a definition ) of the template count that takes a variable number of type parameters ( the keyword class or typename introduces a type parameter ) .
They are packed into a template parameter pack , list .
Once this general declaration is visible , specializations may follow in any order .
I arranged them to follow the Haskell example .
The first one matches the empty list and returns zero .
The second one uses the pattern , < head , tail … > .
This pattern will match any non-empty list and split it into the head and the ( possibly empty ) tail .
To “ call ” a variadic template , you initiate it with an arbitrary number of arguments and retrieve its member , value , e.g. ,
int n = count < int , char , long >:: value ; // returns 3
A few words about variadic templates : A variadic template introduces a template parameter pack using the notation class … pack ( or int… ipack , etc … ) .
The only thing you may do with a pack is to expand it and pass to another variadic template .
The expansion is done by following the name of the pack with three dots , as in tail … .
You ’ll see more examples later .
Variadic templates have many applications such as type - safe printf , tuples ( objects that store an arbitrary number of differently typed arguments ) , variants , and many more .
Higher - Order Functions and Closures
The real power of functional programming comes from treating functions as first class citizens .
It means that you may pass functions to other functions and return functions from functions .
Functions operating on functions are called higher - order functions .
Surprisingly , it seems like compile - time C++ has better support for higher - order functions than run-time C++.
Let ’s start with a Haskell example .
I want to define a function that takes two predicate functions and returns another predicate function that combines the two using logical OR .
Here it is in Haskell :
or_combinator f1 f2 = λ x -> ( f1 x ) || ( f2 x )
The or_combinator returns an anonymous function ( the famous “ lambda ” ) that takes one argument , x , calls both f1 and f2 with it , and returns the logical OR of the two results .
The return value of or_combinator is this freshly constructed function .
I can then call this function with an arbitrary argument .
For instance , here I ’m checking if 2 is either zero or one ( guess what , it is n’t ! ) :
( or_combinator is_zero is_one ) 2
I put the parentheses around the function and its arguments for readability , although they are not strictly necessary .
2 is the argument to the function returned by or_combinator .
The lambda that ’s returned from or_combinator is actually a closure .
It “ captures ” the two arguments , f1 and f2 passed to or_combinator .
They may be used long after the call to or_combinator has returned .
It might take some getting used to it before you are comfortable with functions taking functions and returning functions , but it ’s much easier to learn this stuff in Haskell than in the obfuscated C++.
Indeed , here ’s an almost direct translation of this example :
template < template < class > class f1 , template < class > class f2 > struct or_combinator { template < class T > struct lambda { static const bool value = f1 < T > :: value || f2 < T > :: value ; } ; } ;
Since in the metalanguage a function is represented by a template , the template or_combinator takes two such templates as arguments .
It “ calls ” these templates using the standard syntax f< T >:: value .
Actually , the or_combinator does n’t call these functions .
Instead it defines a new template , which I call lambda , that takes the argument T and calls those functions .
This template acts like a closure–it captures the two templates that are the arguments to or_combinator .
Here ’s how you may use the or_combinator to combine two tests , is Ptr and isConst and apply the result to the type const int :
std::cout << " or_combinator<isPtr , isConst>::lambda<const int>::value = " << or_combinator < isPtr , isConst>::lambda<const int>::value << std::endl ;
Such logical combinators are essential for predicate composability .
Higher - Order Functions Operating on Lists
Once you combine higher - order functions with lists you have a powerful functional language at your disposal .
Higher - order functions operating on lists look very much like algorithms .
Let me show you some classic examples .
Here ’s the function ( or algorithm ) , all , that returns true if and only if all elements of a list satisfy a given predicate .
all pred [ ] =
True all pred ( head : tail ) = ( pred head ) && ( all pred tail )
By now you should be familiar with all the techniques I used here , like pattern matching or list recursion .
Here ’s the same code obfuscated by the C++ syntax :
template < template < class > class predicate , class ... list > struct all ; template < template < class > class predicate > struct all < predicate > { static const bool value = true ; } ; template < template < class > class predicate , class head , class ... tail > struct all < predicate , head , tail ...> { static const bool value = predicate < head > :: value && all < predicate , tail ...>:: value ; } ;
Except for the initial declaration required by C++ there is a one - to - one paradigm match between the two implementations .
Another useful algorithm , a veritable workhorse of functional programming , is “ fold right ” ( together with it ’s dual partner , “ fold left ” ) .
It folds a list while accumulating the results ( that ’s why in runtime C++ this algorithm is called “ accumulate ” ) .
Here ’s the Haskell implementation :
foldr f init [ ] = init foldr f init ( head : tail ) = f head ( foldr f init tail )
Function f , which is the first argument to foldr , takes two arguments , the current element of the list and the accumulated value .
Its purpose is to process the element and incorporate the result in the accumulator .
The new accumulated value is then returned .
It is totally up to the client to decide what kind of processing to perform , how it is accumulated , and what kind of value is used .
The second argument , init , is the initial value for the accumulator .
Here ’s how it works :
The result of foldr is generated by acting with f on the head of the list and whatever has been accumulated by processing the tail of the list .
The algorithm recurses until the tail is empty , in which case it returns the initial value .
At runtime this type of algorithm would make N recursive calls before starting to pop the stack and accumulate the results .
For instance , foldr may be used to sum the elements of a list ( so_far is the accumulator , which is initialized to zero ) :
add_it elem so_far = elem + so_far sum_it lst = foldr add_it 0 lst
The accumulator function is add_it .
If , instead , I wanted to calculate the product of all elements , I ’d use a function mult_it and the starting value of one .
You get the idea .
Here ’s the same algorithm in C++ TMP :
template < template < class , int > class , int , class ...> struct fold_right ; template < template < class , int > class f , int init > struct fold_right <f , init > { static const int value = init ; } ; template < template < class , int > class f , int init , class head , class ... tail > struct fold_right <f , init , head , tail ...> { static const int value = f<head , fold_right <f , init , tail ...>:: value >:: value ; } ;
Once you understand the Haskell version , this complex code suddenly becomes transparent ( if it does n’t , try squinting 😉 ) .
Lists of Numbers
Let ’s now switch to integers for a moment .
Haskell defines a function sum that adds all elements of a list :
sum [ ] = 0 sum ( head : tail ) = head + ( sum tail )
We can do the same in C++ TMP ( in five times as many lines of code ) :
template < int ...> struct sum ; template <> struct sum <> { static const int value = 0 ; } ; template < int i , int ... tail > struct sum<i , tail ...> { static const int value = i + sum<tail ...>:: value ; } ;
List Comprehension
Haskell has one more trick up its sleeve for operating on lists without explicit recursion .
It ’s called list comprehension .
It ’s a way of defining new lists based on existing lists .
The nomenclature and notation are borrowed from Set Theory , where you often encounter definitions such as : S is a set of elements , where …
Let ’s look at a simple Haskell example :
[x * x | x <- [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] ]
This is a set ( list ) of elements x * x , where x is from the list [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] .
Remember our recursive definition of count ?
Using list comprehension it ’s reduced to a one - liner :
count lst = sum [ 1 | x <- lst ]
Here , we create a list of ones , one for each element of the list .
Our result is the sum of those ones .
To make this definition more amenable to translation into C++ , let ’s define an auxiliary function one that , for any argument x , returns 1 .
one x = 1
Here ’s the modified definition of count :
count lst = sum [ one x | x <- lst ]
Now we are ready to convert this code to C++ TMP :
template < class T> struct one { static const int value = 1 ; } ; template < class ... lst > struct count { static const int value = sum < one < lst > :: value ...>:: value ; } ;
Here our list is stored in a template parameter pack , lst .
If we wanted to expand this pack , we ’d use the notation lst … , but that ’s not what ’s happening here .
The ellipsis appears after the pattern containing the pack :
one < lst > :: value ...
Compare this with the equivalent Haskell :
[ one x | x <- lst ]
In C++ , when the ellipsis follows a pattern that contains a pack , it ’s not the pack that ’s expanded , but the whole pattern is repeated for each element of the pack .
Here , if our list were < int , char , void * > , the pattern would be expanded to :
< one < int > :: value , one < char > :: value , one < void *>:: value >
The subsequent call to sum would be made with those arguments .
Notice that a different positioning of the ellipsis would result in a completely different expansion .
This pattern :
one < lst ...>:: value
would result in the call to one with the list of types , which would be an error .
Here ’s another example of pattern expansion : a function that counts the number of pointers in a list of types :
template < class ... lst > struct countPtrs { static const int value = sum < is Ptr < lst >:: value ...>:: value ; } ;
In this case the pattern is :
is Ptr<lst >:: value ...
and it expands into a list of Booleans .
( I ’m taking advantage of the fact that false is zero and true is one , when converted to integers . )
You may find a more complex practical example in the Gregor , Järvi , and Powell paper ( see bibliography ) .
Continuations
List comprehension can be used to define some very useful higher - order functions .
One of such functions is map , which takes a list and applies a unary function to each element , resulting in a new list .
You might be familiar with the runtime implementation of this algorithm in C++ STL under the name of transform .
This is what map looks like in Haskell :
map f lst = [f x | x <- lst ]
Here , f is the unary function and lst is the input list .
You have to admire the terseness and elegance of this notation .
The first impulse would be to translate it into C++ TMP as :
template < template < class > class f , class ... lst > struct map { typedef f<lst >... type ; } ;
This is surprisingly terse too .
The problem is that it does n’t compile .
As far as I know there is no way for a template to “ return ” a variable list of elements .
In my opinion , this is a major language design flaw , but that ’s just me .
There are several workarounds , none of them too exciting .
One is to define a separate entity called a typelist along the lines of :
template struct typelist < hd , tl ...> { typedef hd head ; typedef typelist < tl ...> tail ; } ;
( As a matter of fact I have implemented typelists and related algorithms both in C++ and D. )
Another approach is to use continuations .
Template parameter packs cannot be returned , but they can be passed to variadic templates ( after expansion ) .
So how about defining an algorithm like map to take one additional function that would consume the list that is the result of mapping ?
Such a function is often called a continuation , since it continues the calculation where normally one would return the result .
First , let ’s do it in Haskell :
map_cont cont f lst = cont [f x | x <- lst ]
The function map_cont is just like map except that it takes a continuation , cont , and applies it to the result of mapping .
We can test it by defining yet another implementation of count :
count_cont lst = map_cont sum one lst
The continuation here is the function sum that will be applied to the list produced by acting with function one on the list lst .
Since this is quite a handful , let me rewrite it in a more familiar notation of runtime C++:
int map_cont ( int ( * cont ) ( list ) , int ( *f ) ( int ) , list lst ) { list tmp ; for ( auto it = lst.begin ( ) ; it != lst.end( ) ; ++it ) tmp.push_front( f( * it ) ) ; return cont ( tmp ) ; }
Now for the same thing in compile - time C++:
template < template < class ...> class cont , template < class > class f , class ... lst > struct map_cont { static const int value = cont < typename f<lst > :: type ...>:: value ; } ;
It ’s a one - to - one mapping of Haskell code–and it has very little in common with the iterative runtime C++ implementation .
Also notice how loose the typing is in the TMP version as compared with the runtime version .
The continuation is declared as a variadic template taking types , function f is declared as taking a type , and the list is a variadic list of types .
Nothing is said about return types , except for the constraints that f returns a type ( because cont consumes a list of types ) and cont returns an int .
Actually , this last constraint can be relaxed if we turn integers into types–a standard trick ( hack ? ) in TMP :
template < int n> struct
Int { static const int value = n ; } ;
Loose typing–or “ kinding , ” as it is called for types of types–is an essential part of compile - time programming .
In fact the popularity of the above trick shows that C++ kinding might be already too strong .
The D Digression
I ’m grateful to Andrei Alexandrescu for reviewing this post .
Since he objected to the sentence , “ I ’m disappointed that the D programming language followed the same path as C++ rather than lead the way , ” I feel compelled to support my view with at least one example .
Consider various implementations of all .
In Haskell , beside the terse and elegant version I showed before :
all pred [ ] =
True all pred ( head : tail ) = ( pred head ) && ( all pred tail )
there is also a slightly more verbose one :
all pred list = if null list then True else pred ( head list ) && all pred ( tail list )
which translates better into D . The D version ( taken from its standard library , Phobos ) is not as short as Haskell ’s , but follows the same functional paradigm :
template allSatisfy ( alias F , T... ) { static if ( T.length == 1 ) { alias F ! ( T [ 0 ] ) allSatisfy ; } else { enum bool allSatisfy = F ! ( T [ 0 ] ) && allSatisfy !( F , T [ 1 .. $ ] ) ; } }
It definitely beats C++ , there ’s no doubt about it .
There are some oddities about it though .
Notice that the type tuple , T… gets the standard list treatment , but the split into the head and tail follows the array / slice notation .
The head is T [ 0 ] and the tail is an array slice , T [ 1.. $ ] .
Instead of using value for the return value , D uses the “ eponymous hack , ” as I call it .
The template “ returns ” the value using its own name .
It ’s a hack because it breaks down if you want to define the equivalent of “ local variable ” inside a template .
For instance , the following code does n’t compile :
template allSatisfy ( alias F , T... ) { static if ( T.length == 1 ) { alias F ! ( T [ 0 ] ) allSatisfy ; } else { private enum bool tailResult = allSatisfy !( F , T [ 1.. $ ] ) ; enum bool allSatisfy = F ! ( T[ 0 ] ) && tailResult ; } }
This breaks one of the fundamental property of any language : decomposability .
You want to be able to decompose your calculation into smaller chunks and then combine them together .
Of course , you may still use decomposition if you do n’t use the eponymous hack and just call your return value value .
But that means modifying all the calling sites .
By the way , this is how decomposition works in Haskell :
all2 pred [ ] =
True ; all2 pred ( head : tail ) = ( pred head ) && tailResult where tailResult = all2 pred tail
Anyway , the important point is that there is no reason to force functional programming paradigm at compile - time .
The following hypothetical syntax would be much easier for programmers who are used to imperative programming :
template allSatisfy ( alias Pred , T... ) { foreach ( t ; T ) if (! Pred !(t ) ) return false ; return true ; }
In fact it ’s much closer to the parameterized runtime function proposed by Andrei :
bool all ( alias pred , Range ) ( Range r ) { foreach ( e ; r ) if ( ! pred(e ) ) return false ; return true ; }
This is why I ’m disappointed that the D programming language followed the same path as C++ rather than lead the way .
Conclusions
I have argued that some familiarity with Haskell may be really helpful in understanding and designing templates in C ++.
You might ask why C++ chose such horrible syntax to do compile - time functional programming .
Well , it did n’t .
The ability to do compile - time calculations in C++ was discovered rather than built into the language .
It was a very fruitful discovery , as the subsequent developments , especially the implementation of the Boost MPL , have shown .
However , once the functional paradigm and its weird syntax took root in C++ TMP , it stayed there forever .
I ’m aware of only one effort to rationalize C++ TMP by Daveed Vandevoorde in Reflective Metaprogramming in C ++.
I have tested all code in this blog using the Hugs interpreter for Haskell and the GNU C++ compiler v. 4.4.1 with the special switch - std=c ++0 x .
The names I used in the blog might conflict with the standard definitions .
For instance , Hugs defines its own map and foldr .
If you want to learn more about template metaprogramming , I recommend two books :

The reference I used for variadic templates was the paper by Douglas Gregor , Jaakko Järvi , and Gary Powell

Jokes Advice for tourists
Advice for tourists
The Brits have peculiar words for many things .
Money is referred to as " goolies " in slang , so you should for instance say " I 'd love to come to the pub but I have n't got any goolies . "
" Quid " is the modern word for what was once called a " shilling " - the equivalent of seventeen cents American .
If you are fond of someone , you should tell him he is a " great tosser " - he will be touched .
The English are a notoriously tactile , demonstrative people , and if you want to fit in you should hold hands with your acquaintances and tossers when you walk down the street .
Habits
Ever since their Tory government wholeheartedly embraced full union with Europe , the Brits have been attempting to adopt certain continental customs , such as the large midday meal followed by a two or three hour siesta , which they call a " wank . "
As this is still a fairly new practice in Britain , it is not uncommon for people to oversleep ( alarm clocks , alas , do not work there due to the magnetic pull from Greenwich ) .
If you are late for supper , simply apologise and explain that you were having a wank - everyone will understand and forgive you .
Universities
University archives and manuscript collections are still governed by quaint mediaeval rules retained out of respect for tradition ; hence patrons are expected to bring to the reading rooms their own ink-pots and a small knife for sharpening their quills .
Observing these customs will signal to the librarians that you are " in the know " - one of the inner circles , as it were , for the rules are unwritten and not posted anywhere in the library .
Likewise , it is customary to kiss the librarian on both cheeks when he / she brings a manuscript you 've requested , a practice dating back to the reign of Henry VI .
One of the most delightful ways to spend an afternoon in Oxford or Cambridge is gliding gently down the river in one of their flat - bottomed boats , which you propel using a long pole .
This is known as " cottaging " .
Many of the boats ( called " yer - i- nals " ) are privately owned by the colleges , but there are some places that rent them to the public by the hour .
Just tell a professor or policeman that you are interested in doing some cottaging and would like to know where the public yerinals are .
The poles must be treated with vegetable oil to protect them from the water , so it 's a good idea to buy a can of Mazola and have it on you when you ask directions to the yerinals .
That way people will know you are an experienced cottager .
Food
British cuisine enjoys a well deserved reputation as the most sublime gastronomic pleasure available to man .
Thanks to today 's robust dollar , the American traveller can easily afford to dine out several times a week ( rest assured that a British meal is worth interrupting your afternoon wank for ) .
Few foreigners are aware that there are several grades of meat in the UK .
The best cuts of meat , like the best bottles of gin , bear Her Majesty 's seal , called the British Stamp of Excellence ( BSE ) .
When you go to a fine restaurant , tell your waiter you want BSE beef and wo n't settle for anything less .
If he balks at your request , custom dictates that you jerk your head imperiously back and forth while rolling your eyes to show him who is boss .
Once the waiter realizes you are a person of discriminating taste , he may offer to let you peruse the restaurant 's list of exquisite British wines .
If he does not , you should order one anyway .
The best wine grapes grow on the steep , chalky hillsides of Yorkshire and East Anglia - try an Ely ' 84 or Ripon ' 88 for a rare treat indeed .
When the bill for your meal comes it will show a suggested amount .
Pay whatever you think is fair , unless you plan to dine there again , in which case you should simply walk out ; the restaurant host will understand that he should run a tab for you .
Transportation
Public taxis are subsidized by the Her Majesty 's Government .
A taxi ride in London costs two pounds , no matter how far you travel .
If a taxi driver tries to overcharge you , you should yell " I think not , you charlatan ! " , then grab the nearest policeman ( bobby ) and have the driver disciplined .
It is rarely necessary to take a taxi , though , since bus drivers are required to make detours at patrons ' requests .
Just board any bus , pay your fare of thruppence ( the heavy gold - colored coins are " pence " ) , and state your destination clearly to the driver , e.g. : " Please take me to the British Library . "
A driver will frequently try to have a bit of harmless fun by pretending he does n't go to your requested destination .
Ignore him , as he is only teasing the American tourist ( little does he know you 're not so ignorant ! ) .
For those travelling on a shoestring budget , the London Tube may be the most economical way to get about , especially if you are a woman .
Chivalry is alive and well in Britain , and ladies still travel for free on the Tube .
Simply take some tokens from the baskets at the base of the escalators or on the platforms ; you will find one near any of the state - sponsored Tube musicians .
Once on the platform , though , beware !
Approaching trains sometimes disturb the large Gappe bats that roost in the tunnels .
The Gappes were smuggled into London in the early 19th century by French saboteurs and have proved impossible to exterminate .
The announcement " Mind the Gappe ! " is a signal that you should grab your hair and look towards the ceiling .
Very few people have ever been killed by Gappes , though , and they are considered only a minor drawback to an otherwise excellent means of transportation .
One final note : for preferential treatment when you arrive at Heathrow airport , announce that you are a member of Shin Fane ( an international Jewish peace organization - the " shin " stands for " shalom " ) .
As savvy travellers know , this little white lie will assure you priority treatment as you make your way through customs .

Talk on “ Loop Fusion in Haskell ”
I gave a talk about loop fusion in Haskell today at FP - Syd , the Sydney Functional Programming group .
It covered stream fusion and fusion for distributed types which are two of the optimisations that make Data Parallel Haskell fast .
T
his weekend , Comcast , after fixing one inexplicable problem with my home 's on - demand service over the phone , sent a service tech out to look at the TiVo in my living room .
He spent a lot of time on the phone with someone who I 'm pretty sure was a Comcast tech but may have been a friend or family member , mumbled a lot , and walked in and out of the house without explaining what he was doing .
Eventually , he left without fixing the problem , saying only that Comcast would call to schedule a further appointment with an " elite " tech by the end of day , and that I should be prepared for the possibility that it might just be that my TiVo , at just a year and a half old , is too old for their most recent upgrade .
Needless to say , Comcast has yet to call to schedule that next appointment .
Why do I bring this up ?
Because Comcast is a key player in the debate over net neutrality , and it 's important for those of us who 're skeptical of mandated neutrality to be open about the failures in the ISP market .
The broadband market has advanced with remarkable speed in the U.S. — just a decade ago , it was rare to have broadband in homes ; now it 's common — but is not some sort of high - speed utopia .
On the other hand , when neutrality advocates like Jeffrey Rosen treat Comcast as some sort of monopolist , they 're wildly exaggerating the problem :
This problem is especially acute in the United States because of our lack of competition among broadband companies in most markets .
In many towns , Comcast ( or its regional equivalent ) is the only plausible supplier of broadband .
It 's probably true that there are a handful of rural localities in the U.S. where Comcast is effectively the only option .
But FCC data shows that 98 percent of zip codes have at least two broadband providers and 88 percent of zip codes have four or more broadband providers .
Competition is n't perfect , but it 's a lot stronger than people think .
Rosen is worried that Comcast , as a monopolist , might start , say , charging for access to Facebook , or blocking Verizon 's websites .
But even if you agree that Comcast is a monopolist , why try to fix the problem through regulation when it might be resolved through competition ?
Franchise reform , which would make it far easier for broadband providers to enter new markets , would go a long way to doing that .
In Texas , reform has already led to significant improvements , provoking consumer reactions like the following : " The company that had a monopoly had lousy services until competition came , and then they improved their services . "
Imagine that !
Rosen also takes issue with Comcast 's throttling of Bittorrent file - sharing software :
Two years ago , Comcast , America 's second - largest high - speed Internet provider , blocked BitTorrent , a popular peer - to - peer file - sharing application that could be used to distribute ( among many other things ) high - definition TV video that would compete with Comcast 's video services .
The obstruction was discovered by an amateur singer who wanted to share public domain performances of barbershop quartets with his fellow aficionados .
After initially denying that it was blocking BitTorrent , Comcast , which was literally denying access to the King James Bible , claimed that it was n't blocking the file - sharing application , but merely delaying it to conserve bandwidth as part of " reasonable network management . "
The Comcast case is a model for the free - speech battles of the future , where Internet and wireless providers may want to favor certain content providers over others in order to maximize profits at the expense of consumer choice .
This is , indeed , a problem .
But it 's a problem has a lot less to do with net neutrality and lot more with honest business practices .
It 's one thing for Comcast to limit usage of certain application — it 's quite another for them to deny doing so .
But again , neutrality does n't seem like much of a solution .
The fix is to make sure that Comcast clearly discloses the limits of the service it offers — not force into a predetermined network management scheme .
Rosen also doles out silly bits like this :
You might think that a decision to block the King James Bible would violate the First Amendment , or at least raise important constitutional concerns .
But , if Comcast , a private company , is blocking a particular technology , rather than discriminating against particular speakers , there 's no state action and no obvious peg for a First Amendment lawsuit .
Well , no , you would n't think that , and the only reason to bring this up at all is to cast Comcast in an ominous light .
Just as Wal - Mart can throw out a guy who walks in wearing a sandwich board with the words FUCK GOD scrawled on it , network owners can limit or decline to service certain applications .
That 's how private property works .
Indeed , the biggest neutrality controversy going right now is whether or not wireless data providers — the folks who provide mobile Internet to your iPhone or Blackberry — will be subject to neutrality regulations .
In particular , there 's been uproar over Apple 's decision to block the Google Voice application from its iPhone app store .
But again , the Wal - Mart analogy applies .
Just as it would be unreasonable to force Wal - Mart to carry every brand or type of good that someone submits , it 's unreasonable to expect the same from the Apple store .
I 'd even agree with Jerry Brito that selectivity can be a good thing , as it suggests carefulness and diligence .
So I 'm with neutrality advocates when they complain about crappy ISPs like Comcast , and I 'm happy to require Comcast to fully disclose its network management practices , as they now seem to do .
But net neutrality , I think , is hardly the best way to resolve these issues ; as others have said before , it 's a solution in search of a problem .
I wrote about the new FCC chairman 's latest bid to expand net neutrality here , and predicted that neutrality advocates were preparing to go after wireless networks here .
Update : Julian Sanchez takes me to task for using sketchy FCC data about broadband competition , which he says is seriously misleading .
I actually think the presence of half - decent 3G could help keep faster ISPs honest , at least in some cases , but fair enough .
Even still , I do n't think we ought to set policy under the assumption that Internet service is an essentially monopolistic business .
Instead , we ought to look for ways to free up markets to increase competition .
And , as Sanchez says , we ought to be cautious about how regulations might affect future circumstances : " With 4G rollouts on the horizon , we may actually get adequate broadband competition in the near - to - medium term , and might want to be wary about rushing into regulatory solutions that not only assume the status quo , but could plausibly help entrench it . "
As the Canadian dollar soars toward parity with the U.S. greenback , Canadian retailers are bracing for a possible consumer backlash against the widening price gap between Canadian and U.S. goods .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper echoed the Bank of Canada 's concerns a rising dollar " poses a risk " to Canada 's economic recovery .
And Canadian exporters , who ship more than three - quarters of their goods south of the border , are worried less competitive prices will mean lost sales and jobs .
Cross - border travellers will welcome the news .
Canadians took 18.9 million overnight trips to the U.S. in 2008 , spending $ 12 billion .
An estimated 7,000 Canadian " snowbirds " who spend up to half the year there will find their dollars go further .
The Canadian dollar closed up nearly three - quarters of a cent at 96.48 cents U.S. Tuesday on rising prices for oil and other commodities , a strong employment report for September , and worries about the U.S. deficit .
The loonie 's rapid rise in recent days , up 5 per cent in the past week and 26 per cent since early March , has forecasters predicting it could reach parity sooner than expected .
" We could easily reach parity by the end of the week , " said John Curran , a Toronto - based senior vice - president at Canadian Forex Ltd. , an online foreign - exchange dealer .
Derek Holt , Scotia Capital 's vice - president of economics , said it " could happen ( by the ) middle of next week . "
While that 's good news for consumers if it helps drive down retail prices , it can be bad for Canada 's manufacturers and exporters .
For every one per cent rise in the value of the dollar , Canada 's economy can lose up to $ 2 billion in exports and 25,000 jobs , according to the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters .
" We 're telling members coming out of the recession , business as usual is no longer an option .
You 'd better be willing and capable of competing at par going forward , " said spokesman Jeff Brownlee .
Canadian retailers say they 're watching closely for any signs of a consumer revolt like the one that took place two years ago when the loonie soared above the greenback .
At the time , angry consumers demanded Canadian stores lower their prices to more closely match those in the U.S. , especially on books and magazines , which published both prices on the covers .
" Retailers in Canada understand they are serving customers without borders , " said Mark Beazley , spokesman for the Retail Council of Canada .
" With fierce competition in Canada , across the border and online , retailers know that they will have to work harder than ever to remain competitive as the loonie rises against the U.S. dollar . "
Consumers are unlikely to see price cuts any time soon , as cost savings can take three to nine months to flow through to the retail level , he said .
" That being said , Canadian retailers are sensitive to the needs of their customers and will ultimately make pricing changes based on their demands . "
Goods in Canadian stores are now 13 per cent more expensive on average than in the U.S. , up from 7 per cent last summer , says Doug Porter , deputy chief economist with BMO Capital Markets .
" This big run -up is coming at a very sensitive time as we head into the key shopping season of the year .
Unfortunately , this is going to put renewed pressure on domestic retailers , " Porter said .
" We could start to see cross - border shopping start to pick up again .
It had almost whittled away to nothing by last summer , partly because of the hassles of crossing the border , needing a passport and so on . "

So far , there are few signs cross - border shopping is picking up .
Despite reports of long lineups at some Canada - U.S. bridges over the Thanksgiving weekend , traffic remained down by about 10 per cent compared to last year , bridge operators at Niagara and Windsor said Tuesday .
That 's roughly where it has been all year .
But consumers can comparison shop on the Internet , Porter noted .
In Vancouver Tuesday , Harper said the Bank of Canada governor has expressed concern about the rapidly rising dollar and he deferred to his judgment on the effects of the loonie 's rise .
" We note that Canada 's economy is relatively stronger than virtually any of the G7 economies and stronger than most in the world .
Obviously , some of these factors will have something to do with the rise of the Canadian dollar , " he said .
" The value of the Canadian dollar is a risk to recovery .
It 's not a risk to choking off the recovery but if it rises too rapidly it does have an effect . "

Matthew Hoh , a Senior Civilian Official in Afghanistan , Resigns Over U.S. Strategy Matthew Hoh , a former marine , says Afghanistan is not worth U.S. lives .
Oct. 27 , 2009  --
A key U.S. official in Afghanistan has resigned in protest over U.S. policy in the war - torn region , as the Obama administration deliberates its future strategy there .
Matthew Hoh , a political officer in the foreign service and a senior civilian officer in Zabul , Afghanistan , wrote a four - page letter to Ambassador Nancy Powell , director general of the foreign service at the State Department , to express his " doubts and reservations about our current strategy and planned future strategy , " as first reported by the Washington Post today .
Today ,
Hoh told reporters he submitted his letter of resignation on Sept. 10 because he does n't agree with the U.S. mission in the country .
Afghanistan , Hoh said , is in stark contrast to Iraq , especially when it comes to security .
" I feel that our strategies in Afghanistan are not pursing goals that are worthy of sacrificing our young men and women or spending the billions we 're doing there , " Hoh said .
" I believe that the people we are fighting there are fighting us because we are occupying them -- not for any ideological reasons , not because of any links to al Qaeda , not because of any fundamental hatred toward the West .
The only reason they 're fighting us is because we are occupying them . "
Hoh spent six years in Iraq , where he served as a Marine Corps captain and then worked as a civilian for the Department of Defense .
The 36 - year - old told reporters he wants people to know that stabilizing the Afghan government does n't equate to defeating al Qaeda .
" If that 's our goal , to defeat al Qaeda , we need to change our strategy because , you know it 's the proverbial swatting of the fly with a sledgehammer , all you do is basically exhaust yourself and you put holes in your walls and your floors , and you do n't do anything to the fly , " he said .
" We are still fighting them the way we would have fought in the 50's , 60's , 70's , 80's , 90's , and we need to change .
We need to evolve to actually fight this threat so that we can affect it . "
The U.S. ambassador in Afghanistan , Karl W. Eikenberry , and Richard Holbrooke , the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan , apparently tried to talk Hoh out of resigning .
The latter even offered him a job but Hoh declined , according to the Post .
The State Department said today that senior officials spoke to Hoh and heard him out , but that they believe the Obama administration 's strategy is on the right track .
" We take his point of view very seriously .
But we continue to believe that we are on track to achieving the goal that the president has set before us , " State Department spokesman Ian Kelly told reporters .
Asked how Hoh 's resignation stacked up against those of career officials who resigned over the conflicts in Bosnia and Iraq , Kelly replied , " Without minimizing the obvious passion and depth of feeling of Mr. Hoh , in terms of his perception of the mission in Afghanistan , yeah , I would draw a distinction between his situation and somebody who had been in the Foreign Service and had a stake in the Foreign Service for 20 years or more . "
Matthew Hoh Resigns Over War in Afghanistan
Hoh 's resignation comes as a blow to the Obama administration , which has yet to decide whether it will send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan , as the lead commander on the ground , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , has requested .
Speaking at the Naval Base in Jacksonville , Fla. , Monday , President Barack Obama stressed the importance of the issue and explained why , despite some criticism , he 's taking his time to decide .
" I will never rush the solemn decision of sending you into harm 's way , " the president told servicemen and women .
" I wo n't risk your lives unless it is absolutely necessary .
And , if it is necessary , we will back you up to the hilt .
Because you deserve the strategy , the clear mission , the defined goals and the equipment and support you need to get the job done . "
The president also acknowledged the challenges that lie ahead in the region .
Fourteen Americans died Monday in three helicopter crashes , with one involved in anti-drug operations , making it the deadliest day for U.S. casualties in Afghanistan in four years .
On Tuesday , eight U.S. service members working with NATO security forces were killed and several people were injured in attacks in southern Afghanistan .
Obama will meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Friday to discuss Afghanistan and Pakistan , and the White House would only say today that the president is " in the process of evaluating where we are . "
Spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president had seen
Hoh 's story but had not read his letter of resignation .
Administration officials will likely pay close attention to Hoh 's letter , in which he says that even if the United States increased its commitment to the region , it would take years -- if not decades and generations -- and billions of dollars to achieve success .
He also argues that the U.S. military presence contributes to the legitimacy of the insurgency , led by ethnic Pashtuns .
" To put simply , I fail to see the value or the worth in the continued U.S. casualties or expenditures of resources in support of the Afghan government in what is , truly , a 35 - year - old civil war , " the former Marine wrote in the emotional letter .
Hoh told reporters the benefits of engagement in Afghanistan does n't outweigh the costs because there are so many threats on different levels .
" There are so many local groups , it 's infinite , " he said .
" We are enmeshed in a civil war … stabilizing the government does nothing to defeat al Qaeda . "
Hoh 's message is one that may reverberate with troops on the ground .
Many of them have told ABC News they do not believe they are in greater danger than during the Bush administration , but that morale is an issue and they want Obama to make a decision quickly .
The president will wait until after the run-off presidential election in Afghanistan Nov. 7 , some analysts said .
An ABC News / Washington
Post poll released last week showed that 31 percent of Americans believe Obama has a clear plan for dealing with the situation in Afghanistan , while 63 percent think he does not .
And Americans ' view of the war in Afghanistan may not be very far off from that of Hoh's .
Nearly half of Americans surveyed , 47 percent , said the war has not been worth fighting , and 49 percent say more troops should not be deployed to Afghanistan .
Sen. John Kerry , D - Mass. , who is credited with giving Afghanistan 's President Hamid Karzai the push to accept a run-off election , said Monday that the U.S. mission should be more narrow and modest rather than the far - reaching , counter - insurgency strategy McChrystal has suggested .
" The nature of our commitment has to evolve away from U.S. military - dominated effort toward support for Afghan institutions and Afghan answers , " Kerry said in the speech at the Council on Foreign Relations .
" We need to ask ourselves at every turn , will what we do , will this help the Afghan people take responsibility for their country ?
And if the answer is ' no , ' we probably should n't be doing it . "

Okay , it may not be possible to crash - proof your computer .
However , there are steps you can take to protect the data on your hard drive from being lost , in the event of a crash .
Computers .
At the risk of sounding cliché , it sometimes feels like we can’t live with them , but ca n’t live without them .
Of course , in today ’s world , they are necessary tools for personal and business purposes .
I do n’t pretend to be an expert on computers ; I just use them a lot and have done so for a long time .
Here are ten things I do to keep my machine in good working condition .
I hope you find these tips useful as well .
Back Up Important Documents
Almost everything gets saved on your computer ’s hard disk drive .
And with modern hard drives being as large as they are , it ’s tempting to just leave everything on there .
But the problem is that hard drives fail or “ crash . ”
I ’ve heard it said that all hard drives will eventually fail .
Given the number of hard drives I ’ve seen fail , I am inclined to believe it .
Coincidentally , as I ’m writing this , I am actually chatting online with a friend , whose hard drive just crashed , taking out everything he had .
If your hard drive fails , it could destroy everything you ’ve got on your hard drive – family photos , tax information , personal letters , or anything else that you had saved .
If you use your machine for business , a hard drive failure could wipe out contacts , invoices , accounting records , and all your business records .
There are companies that specialize in data recovery from failed disk drives , but depending on the severity of the drive failure , recovery might not be possible .
As well , those companies charge dearly for the important service they render .
There is an easy way to protect yourself : back up everything you do n’t want to lose .
To back up is simply to save the same file twice ( or even more ) , to another location or drive .
The good news is that it has never been easier to back up .
Years ago , to back up required clumsy tapes or numerous floppy disks .
Presently , there are new , inexpensive options , including memory sticks ; small portable hard drives ; and recordable CDs and DVDs .
I usually work from different computers ( home and work ) , and so I like to take my files with me on a portable hard drive .
I save my files directly to the portable drive , rather than the hard drives built into my computers .
Then , every so often ( but not often enough ) I simply copy all those files to my hard drive at home .
Ideally , you should back up once a day , but if that ’s not realistic , at least once a week .
When in Doubt , Reboot
Sometimes , the computer or something attached to it just stops working properly , for no apparent reason .
For example , one minute the printer may work , but the next minute , you get a strange error message , or the printer just does n’t do anything .
Windows is made up of a large number of programs that are all talking to each other and to the computer .
Every so often , they clash .
Or one just stops working , and refuses to straighten itself out .
Fortunately , most of the time when your computer starts behaving strangely , there is an easy answer : reboot the machine .
That is , turn it off and then turn it on .
That cleans out the memory of the machine , and starts everything running afresh .
Before rebooting , make sure you ’ve saved any file you ’re working on .
Next , be sure to use the START menu when turning the machine off ; if you just interrupt the power , or reset the machine using a reset button on the console itself , and then you risk interrupting the machine while it ’s in the middle of doing something , leaving fragments of code on the hard drive that should not be there .
Only use the reset button or the power button if the machine has frozen up so that it becomes impossible to get to the START menu .
Use a Surge - Protected Power Bar
Nothing ruins computer equipment like a spike or surge in the power supply .
Parts burn out , and if you ’re especially unlucky , a fire can start .
Surges also can come through the phone lines , if you ’re still using a telephone modem for Internet access .
Surges can happen without warning , although they are more likely to happen during a lightning storm .
To protect your machine , purchase a surge - protected power bar , and plug your equipment into that .
Those bars usually have a light on to show that they are protecting your machine .
If the light goes off , that means it ’s time for a new power bar .
It ’s not a bad idea to replace the bar every few years in any event .
To be on the extra - safe side , you may want to invest in a power bar that has a built - in battery .
That way , if there is a blackout while you are computing , you ’ll get a few minutes to save your files and shut the computer down the proper way , through the START menu .
Make Sure that Cords are Tight
A computer will have a variety of cords and cables attached to its back .
It gets power through one , and talks to the Internet and the rest of your computer equipment through the others .
Sometimes , a computer will freeze up unexpectedly if one of these cables comes loose .
If you ’re having unexplained computer problems , make sure that all the cable is nice and tight .
Use Antivirus Software
Viruses are programs that install themselves on your machine .
Some viruses just display a message on a certain date .
Others can be designed to destroy all your data .
Sadly , some people seem to have nothing better to do with their time than make these pernicious bits of code .
There are trained professionals whose job in life is to come up with cures for these viruses or , even better , programs that stop your computer from being infected .
An antivirus program can see that a virus is about to launch , block it from launching , and seal it away safely on your hard drive , where you can delete it before it causes harm .
Antivirus programs will scan programs you run , your hard drive , and incoming and outgoing Email for viruses .
Two of the more well - known commercial antivirus programs are Norton ( www.nortons.com) and McAfee ( www.mcafee.com).
Both will do a fine job of protecting your system .
After buying the main program ( which gets updated every year ) , you then subscribe to an update service .
The first year is usually included with the purchase price .
It is important to ensure that your antivirus software is updating itself regularly – often several times a week .
As new viruses come out , new updates are released to improve your antivirus program to be able to handle the new viruses .
There is a down - side to most commercial antivirus software - they tends to use a lot of system resources .
If you ’ve got a reasonably recent machine ( three or less years old ) , then there is no need to worry .
However , if you have an older machine ( mine is over five years ) , commercial antivirus software can cause your system to slow down , depending on what it ’s trying to do .
Another option is to use a program like AVG ( free.grisoft.com ) .
The AVG antivirus software is free for personal , non-commercial use .
It also uses up little in the way of system resources , so it ’s very good for an older machine .
Use a Firewall
A firewall is simply a program that blocks unauthorized access to your machine from the Internet .
Some hackers have nothing better to do with their time than try to find unprotected machines and “ listen ” to the data on those machines .
Windows XP has a built - in firewall that should be activated .
Norton and McAfee also make firewalls , although if you have an older machine without Windows XP , you may want to try Zone Alarm , which has the added benefit of being free for personal use .
Scan for Spyware
Spyware is a general term for a large number of programs that set themselves up on your machine and then broadcast information from your machine to specific locations .
Spyware can be used to “ harvest ” data , such as your favourite kinds of web sites , or any other kind of information you can imagine .
Spyware can also gum up your machine , so that it ’s busy transmitting this data instead of doing your work .
Some Spyware comes bundled with other programs ; many file - sharing programs came bundled with spyware .
Sometimes , commercial software comes with spyware .
Even some “ cookies ” , or bits of code that land on your hard drive when you visit certain sites , are a form of spyware .
There is no practical way to prevent your machine from picking up spyware .
The solution is to run a good spyware cleaning program .
One good , free program is Ad - Aware .
Another good , free program is PestPatrol .
These are easy to download and install , and are frequently updated to seek out and destroy new spyware .
Use a Spam Filter
Spam is unwanted Email that just keeps on coming .
A vast amount of Email – possibly the majority of Email sent over the Internet at this point – is spam .
Once it starts hitting your inbox , it ’s virtually impossible to prevent it from coming , bringing with it news of male enhancement drugs , weight loss pills , discounted drugs , stock tips , and some messages that simply make no sense whatsoever .
It ’s futile to block the Email addresses from which the spam appears to originate ; spam is sophisticated enough to originate on one machine while appearing to come from somewhere entirely different , usually from an Email address that does n’t even exist .
Usually , the same fake sending Email address is not used twice .
There are commercial programs that will help your Email filter out spam .
Some Email providers , such as Shaw , have good built - in spam filters which , when activated for free , can stop spam from reaching your inbox , or can at least flag suspected spam in the subject line .
If you set up a separate mailbox in Outlook or Outlook Express for Junk Email , you can create a message rule so that , every time a flagged Email comes through , it is moved automatically to the Junk Email folder .
You can then review your suspected spam just in case a legitimate Email was wrongly flagged ( it does happen ) .
Spam is usually generated by automatic programs on unsuspecting computer owners ’ machines .
These owners did not use a virus protector or firewall .
NEVER respond to spam , even to say to stop sending it ( some spam has a place to click to do the same thing ) .
All that a response does is confirm to the spam - sending program that your Email address is a real one , a viable target that can be spammed and sold to other spammers .
The more you respond , the worse the problem will get .
Some spam messages also appear to be legitimate , even scary ; one common scam has messages which really look like they were sent from Ebay or certain financial institutions ; these insist that if you do n’t go to a particular web - site and enter personal information , your accounts will be suspended or worse .
These messages can be scary because they look real , and have been made to appear to come from the genuine Email address of those organizations .
Never respond .
Never click on the links in any unsolicited Email .
Above all , NEVER give out financial or personal information over the Internet in response to an unsolicited Email .
Even more important : never , ever open an attachment to an unsolicited Email , unless you are satisfied that it is legitimate .
What may look to be a picture can turn out to be a pernicious bit of code that knocks out your virus protector and infects your machine .
On a somewhat lighter note , do n’t take spam personally .
One female friend of mine found it a bit offensive that she got many weight loss spam Emails , but as I observed , she was also getting a fair number of male enhancement ads .
The spammers do n’t know who you are .
Defragment Your Hard Drive
When a file is saved on your hard drive , it ’s often saved in pieces that are scattered all over the hard drive .
The computer knows where everything is , but the more you use the machine , the worse the scattering ( fragmenting ) becomes .
This has been a problem with PC - based machines for as long as there have been hard drives .
In extreme cases of fragmentation , the computer can slow down as it struggles to find all the pieces of whatever file it ’s looking for .
Eventually , the computer can fail .
Doing a full defragmentation every six months or so should keep your machine running smoothly .
Windows has a built - in defragmentation program ( under Start , Programs , Accessories ) .
You may have to leave your machine on overnight as it defragments , especially if you ’ve never done it before .
Know When To Get Help
Never panic .
However , there are some things that go wrong with computers that require the skill of a professional repair person .
If your machine makes a sound you never heard before , especially a clunk and a persistent grinding sound , it could be that your hard drive is failing or has failed .
Get help .
Your hard drive may have failed or may be in the process of failing .
If you turn on your machine and it tells you that “ Drive C is not bootable ” , that can also be an indication that your hard drive has failed .
In other words , your machine no longer knows what to do with itself when it ’s turned on .
Get help if this happens , as well .
It is hard to know when your machine has been infected by a virus .
Sometimes , hackers will make your machine display messages ( like “ Ha ha ” ) or display graphics or cartoons that you ’ve never seen before .
Sometimes data will vanish .
If your machine really starts to act up , and rebooting does n’t help , you may have a virus .
If a virus gets past your virus scanning software and infects your machine , it is difficult to remove it fully and properly .
Consult a professional if you suspect your machine to be infected .
If you are particularly unlucky , an electrical short in your machine can cause it to catch fire , or at least to smoke .
If that happens , unplug the machine .
Get help .
*** I hope these tips also help you in keeping your computer running smoothly , so that it can perform its most important function : helping you be more productive .
Firefighters have contained a blaze that has burnt about 12 per cent of the world heritage - listed Fraser Island in the past fortnight .
The fire has burnt about 20,000 hectares on the southern end of the island , in south - east Queensland , and at one stage threatened Dilli Village .
Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service regional manager Rob Allan says about 40 firefighters have been battling the blaze .
" Day and night really it 's been fairly full on trying to contain this quite large fire , " he said .
" It is contained .
Still a fair bit of smoke around but no flame any more but it 's very fickle weather , very volatile conditions , so we 're watching it pretty closely . "
" Damage is a sort of interesting word because wildfire is quite good ecologically provided it does n't get too intense and burn too hot .
" I mean ... it 's clear there are some places have burned very hot indeed and that can be damaging to obviously flora and fauna but by and large does n't look too bad . "
Fire bans extended
Meanwhile , fire bans have been extended in Queensland 's northern and central regions .
Queensland Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts says high to severe fire conditions have spread to 11 new local government areas .
" Conditions have eased in the south - east part of the state and indeed the southern part of the state , " he said .
" However , the fire service is expecting ... high to severe conditions to continue in the north and central areas until next Monday the 12th of October . "
Areas affected include Banana , Gladstone , Rockhampton , Central Highlands , Woorabinda , Isaac and Mackay .
The ban also affects Hinchinbrook , Townsville , Whitsunday , Burdekin , Charters Towers , Flinders and Richmond .

The highest court in the United Kingdom has been formally opened , with the swearing in of its 11 justices in a ceremony in London .
The Supreme Court , housed at Middlesex Guildhall , replaces the Law Lords as the last court of appeal in all matters other than criminal cases in Scotland .
The court is independent of Parliament and will hear the most important cases .
Lord Phillips , President of the Supreme Court , said the change in form was important for judicial openness .
The judicial function of the House of Lords , whose powers had evolved over centuries , ended with the swearing in of Lord Phillips .
The justices wore black robes threaded with gold , replacing the full - bottomed wigs , robes and breeches of the lords .
The £ 59 m Supreme Court has opened six years after it was first announced .
Its first members were - until last month - the Law Lords who would have otherwise heard the same cases in the House of Lords .
But the constitutional change that led to the Supreme Court 's creation means that Parliament 's lawmakers and the judges charged with overseeing legislation have been separated .
I would hope that the court is still sitting in 100 years ' time and that when people look back at this step that they see it as a very significant step in the constitution of this country
Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers
A peek inside the court Profiles : UK Supreme Justices Q&A : UK Supreme Court Send us your comments Scotland 's supreme criminal court remains the High Court of Justiciary .
The swearing - in saw Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers become the first President of the Court .
He was joined by 10 other colleagues in taking an oath of allegiance to uphold the law .
A final 12th member of the court will be appointed at a later date .
Lord Phillips said : " This is the last step in the separation of powers in this country .
We have come to it fairly gently and gradually , but we have come to the point where the judges are completely separated from the legislature and executive .
" The change is one of transparency .
It 's going to be very much easier for the public to come to our hearings .
" I would hope that the court is still sitting in 100 years ' time and that when people look back at this step that they see it as a very significant step in the constitution of this country . "
While only the Law Lords ' judgements were televised from Parliament , all of the Supreme Court 's hearings will be open to the public .
Its building , in Parliament Square , Westminster , includes a public cafe and education facilities .
For the first time , television cameras have been fitted into the courtrooms meaning that many hearings will be available to broadcasters .
Supreme Court : Independent of Parliament The Supreme Court sits for the first time later on Thursday to deal with a relatively minor issue relating to legal costs .
Its first major appeal hearing follows next week in a case concerning terrorist suspects whose assets have been frozen .
Although the actual business and workings of the justices will be essentially the same as those of the Law Lords , it will be watched closely to see if the move across Parliament Square will affect the way its decides cases .
One group of influential solicitors and barristers is launching a blog to monitor the Supreme Court 's decision - making .
But others have criticised the change , arguing that it is largely a cosmetic exercise .

With Hallowe 'en approaching , we should remember that the horror landscape used to be more than just zombies , vampires and shirtless werewolves .
Whatever happened to that onetime horror movie staple , the Mummy ?
Will we ever see its ' bandaged like again ?
Advertisement
With a horror heritage that includes a Bram Stoker novel ( The Jewel of Seven Stars , released just six years after Dracula ) and a string of Bela Lugosi movies , the good ol '
Mummy should be up there with all the other horror classics getting Twilighted and revamped for the CW generation .
So why are we in a Mummy recession ?
Here 're some potential problems for the bandaged ones :
The Comedy Aspect
Whether it 's the admittedly - silly name , the visual of a slow - moving figure wrapped entirely in bandages or too many appearances in Scooby Doo ( See above ) , it 's kind of hard to take Mummies seriously as any kind of threat recently .
Nowadays , you 're as likely to see a Mummy as comedic McGuffin in Eureka ( or , yes , subject of a Scooby Doo direct - to - DVD movie ) as anything that 's really going to try and spook you .
Seeing Mummies as sources for comedy is n't anything new , of course -
- but somewhere along the line , that 's all they became .
For Mummies to live again , someone would have to come along and treat them with the fear and respect they deserve .

The Mummy Trilogy
... And that person would n't be Stephen Sommers .
Do n't misunderstand ; as sub-Indiana Jones wannabes with the focus firmly on kid-friendly adventure and giving John Hannah a chance to overact at every opportunity , the three Mummy movies are actually pretty good ( Well , the first one , at least ) .
But as movies that make Mummies something to be spoken of in the same breath as vampires or werewolves ...?
Not exactly the greatest .
Part of the problem with these movies is , in my opinion , we knew too much about the Mummy ; by nature of its story , the Mummy ceased to be an unknowable , unstoppable threat but was , instead , a flawed human who just happened to have been resurrected millennia later with supernatural powers .
Considering this trilogy has shaped the mainstream perception of the Mummy as much as anything else since its release , it 's frustrating that this route was taken instead of the producers ' original idea to let Clive Barker create a low - budget modern day movie about a cultist looking to reanimate an army of Mummies ...
Zombies
There 's no way around it : Zombies have completely stolen Mummies ' thunder ... and their whole schtick .
Just look at the evidence : Undead ?
Check .
Slow lumbering around ?
Check .
Killing people ?
Check .
Zombies are naked Mummies , except they 're wearing clothes .
It 's not hard to see why zombies have come into ascendance while the popularity of the Mummy has declined :
They offer all of the threat without any of the baggage ; they can be contemporary , of any nationality , and do n't have a particularly defined look .
But is the overly - populated Zombie Bandwagon really enough to derail the Mummy Train permanently ?
If nothing else , I 'm surprised that someone has n't tried to get a bigscale Mummy movie made by pretending that it's a historic take on the zombie idea ( Hollywood producers :
You can send my fee care of io9.com , thank you very much ) .

Do n't think I do n't get it ; Mummies seem silly and old - fashioned ( literally , considering that whole Ancient Egypt thing ) in a world where Vampire Diaries and Twilight show their horror peers to be filled with pouting teenagers who listen to Muse all the time .
But all it would take is one well - made project from someone who really cares about the concept to put the Mummy back where it belongs , as a Horror Icon worth more than toilet - papered Hallowe 'en costumes .
Anyone got Guillermo del Toro 's phone number ... and a way to clear his schedule for the next couple of years ?
For sure the owner of this highly modded Russian car would light his way up the Russian roads with so much additional stuff installed on the vehicle .

Iran ’s Enemy Is Not America ’s Friend
On Oct. 18 , a suicide bomber in southeastern Iran killed at least 42 people and wounded scores of others in a lethal attack on senior commanders of Iran ’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) .
The Shiite IRGC does n’t make an especially sympathetic victim — it has quashed dissent in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and is now helping spearhead an autocracy there .
The group taking credit for the attack , Jundallah ( God ’s Soldiers ) , also known as the People ’s Resistance Movement of Iran , is a Sunni organization .
It seeks full rights for Baluch tribesfolk specifically and Sunni Muslims generally either within a majority Shiite Iran or as a separate state .
Hence it battles the Shiite clerics , secular autocrats , military , and paramilitary forces who rule Iran with an iron fist , styling itself a coalition of freedom fighters .
But that does not make Iran ’s Sunni insurgents the good guys , not by a long shot .
Their tactics are reminiscent of Hezbollah , Sri Lanka ’s Tamil Tigers , al Qaeda , and the Taliban plus its local allies in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
In fact , they derive inspiration and knowledge from that wider network of terrorist organizations .
Jundallah emerged in 2003 , spawned by the Baluchi Autonomist Movement of the 1980s and 1990s .
The movement ’s militants attempted to assassinate President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005 at Zabol along Iran ’s eastern border with Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Three months later , the group killed civilians at nearby Tasuki just before the Iranian New Year .
The group took responsibility for fatal car bomb attacks on the IRGC at Zahedan and Saravan in 2007 , 2008 , and earlier this year .
The Jundallah also has attacked Shiite mosques and kidnapped civilians .
The Iranian government has retaliated by executing captured militants .
Pishin , the area of the latest attack , like Zabol , Zahedan , Saravan , and other hot spots of Sunni rebellion in Iran , lies along the poorly defined borderland that is a stronghold of armed Baluch tribes — many with ethnic and ideological links to the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban .
Those tribes have traditionally been hostile to all three states and desirous of their own territory .
Pakistan ’s military has confronted rebellious Baluch tribesmen since that country ’s independence in 1947 .
A deadly mix of narcotics , weapons , petroleum , and luxury goods flows through the region .
Income from that illicit trade has funded separatist militants , religious fundamentalists , and international terrorists for the past three decades .
The Iranian government has charged that the United States , Britain , and even Pakistan are linked to Sunni militant activities within its borders as part of ongoing attempts at regime change .
Although accepting Pakistan ’s official condemnation of Jundallah - planned attacks , Iran ’s leadership claims the group ’s leaders enjoy safe haven in Pakistan and insists that Pakistan cooperate in arresting and extraditing them to Iran for trial .
The Iranian charges are not made up from whole cloth , but they are probably still not true .
There has long been talk of funding coming to the rebels from the Saudis — with U.S. knowledge — as part of tensions between Sunni Arabs and Shiite Iranians stretching as far back as the Arab conquest of Iran in the seventh century to more recent competition for dominance in the Persian Gulf , Afghanistan , and Lebanon .
Sources of those claims allegedly include Jundallah ’s top leadership .
Moreover , public and private reports indicate that officials in the George W. Bush administration at the very least strongly considered the idea themselves .
Both Iranian and Pakistani officials and citizens think that Saudi funding for Baluch rebels in Iran had tacit U.S. consent at that time .
Hard - liners against Iran in Washington still raise the option as a means of destabilizing Iran ’s antagonistic regime .
Indeed , the Barack Obama administration might be tempted to use direct or indirect funding as a means of surrogate warfare to further pressure Iran ’s government .
Violent anti-Iranian Sunni groups like Jundallah have not been placed on the U.S. State Department ’s terrorism list .
And the Obama administration might feel that it ’s already being punished for the perception that it ’s funding the rebels and may as well try to reap some of the rewards .
But this would be shortsighted .
The basic problem with any strategy to destabilize Iran via Sunni tribal rebellions is that Baluch nationalism spans three countries — not just Iran , but also Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Supporting a pan-Baluchistan movement would only worsen societal instability and national fragmentation in West Asia and South Asia .
Militant groups , especially ones linked to ethnic and religious notions , have brought little but trouble to the world .
It is important to recall the obvious : The United States and its partners once supported the Taliban materially because they were battling the Soviets and Russians .
The United States should n’t repeat the mistake , fooling itself that Sunni Baluch nationalists will be better disposed toward the West just because they are now fighting a common foe in the Iranian government .
Yes , there might be the temptation to exert pressure , via internal strife , on Ahmadinejad ’s autocratic regime for eliciting nuclear and international compromises .
But Iran ’s Sunni insurgency is n’t just bad news for the IRCG — it ’s also bad news for the Middle East , Asia , and the United States .
Ultimately , therefore , whether or not the Iranian regime ’s charges of foreign interference are accurate , no country should welcome or aid an insurgency in eastern Iran .
NGOs for terrorism really are harder to subdue than nation - states supporting such activities .

Technology correspondent , BBC News
By 1971 the fledgling internet had spanned the US .
It has often been said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step .
For the internet , that first step was more of a stumble .
At 2100 , on 29 October 1969 , engineers 400 miles apart at the University of California in Los Angeles ( UCLA ) and Stanford Research Institute ( SRI ) prepared to send data between the first nodes of what was then known as Arpanet .
It got the name because it was commissioned by the US Department of Defense 's Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Arpa ) .
The fledgling network was to be tested by Charley Kline attempting to remotely log in to a Scientific Data Systems computer that resided at SRI .
Kline typed an " L " and then asked his colleague Bill Duvall at SRI via a telephone headset if the letter had arrived .
It had .
Kline typed an " O " .
Duvall said that arrived too .
Kline typed a " G " .
Duvall could only report that the system had crashed .
They got it working again by 22:30 and everything went fine .
After that first misstep , the network almost never put a foot wrong .
The rest has made history .
Big changes Watching remotely in Washington 40 years ago was Dr Larry Roberts , the MIT scientist who worked out the fundamental technical specifications of the Arpanet .
The engineers who built the hardware that made Arpanet work , did so to his design .
But , he told BBC News , the initial reaction to setting up Arpanet was anything but positive .
" They thought it was a horrible idea , " he said .
The Interface Message Processors ( IMPs ) helped to shuttle data around the Arpanet Bob Taylor , head of Arpa 's Information Processing Techniques Office , wanted Arpanet built to end the crazy situation of every institution he funded demanding ever more computer power and duplicating research on those machines .
" At the time computers were completely incompatible and moving data was a huge chore , " he said .
The resistance came about because those institutions wanted to keep control of their computer resources .
But , said Dr Roberts , they soon saw that hooking up to Arpanet meant a huge increase in the potential computer power they had at their disposal .
" They quickly learned that there was a tremendous gain for them , " said Dr Roberts .
It also fulfilled Bob Taylor 's goal of cutting spending on computers .
Back in those days , long before the utility of the net was demonstrated , Dr Roberts and his colleagues had an inkling that remarkable things would happen once such a network were built .
" We knew that if we could connect all the data we were collecting that would change the face of research and development and business , " he said .
Dividing data
The Arpanet became the internet in the 1970s but the change was largely cosmetic .
The fundamental technological idea that made it work , known as packet switching , was demonstrated on that October evening .
The motivation for developing packet switching also had a financial element .
Computer networks were in used prior to the creation of Arpanet but not many people used them .
" The cost was enormous because we were doing it so inefficiently , " said Dr Roberts .
" We knew we needed something to share that rather than have it as a dedicated session . "
The inspiration for packet switching partly came from the Post Office Analysis by Dr Roberts showed that only one fifteenth of the capacity of a telephone line used to remotely connect to a mainframe was used .
Far better , he reasoned , was to find a way to divide up that capacity among many computers .
Dr Roberts was not alone in building a network using these principles .
Packet switching got its name thanks to late British scientist Donald Davies who was creating a network that used this technique at the National Physical Laboratory ( NPL ) .
Not only did it make it easier , and cheaper , to use telephone lines it helped speed up the passing of data .
" If you have packets arriving in little pieces you can very quickly sort them , " said Roger Scantlebury , one of Dr Davies ' colleagues .
" But if you have a huge message you have to wait for that to finish before anything else can happen . "
Rather than just theorise , Dr Davies and his colleagues put their work into action .
" When we first started we were just going to build something to show it would work , but fairly quickly Donald realised that in order for it to have any impact it needed to be a proper working system , and we actually built the network which went live at the start of 1970 , " he said .
We sent a message , an email essentially , to a senior Russian colleague at Novosibirsk Institute .
Andrey ... how is the weather ?
Ten minutes later the printer fired up with the reply .
Email in 1971
Michael Hockney , Canada
Your early memories of the net He told the BBC News : " When we first put the network together at NPL , we were n't constrained by telephone wires , so we built high capacity links and everyone had 1.5 megabytes , which at the time everyone said was crazy . "
From those first two nodes , Arpanet quickly grew and by December of 1969 it had four nodes .
By 1972 it had 37 and then started the process of connecting up networks to each other and the internet , a network of networks , came into being .
Dr Roberts has spent his professional life involved in networks and is not done yet .
He is currently driving a Darpa research project to get the net ready for the next 40 years .
The work is concentrating on ways to improve security , enshrine fairness so no - one can hog capacity and guarantee quality of connection to support exquisitely time sensitive applications such as remote surgery .
There 's no doubt that the net 's first step was the start of a giant leap .

This post is the first of two that will analyze the recent Globe and Mail series on women in Kandahar , Afghanistan .
While the series included segments in print and broadcast media , my focus here is on the multimedia online section , accessible through the Globe and Mail ‘s website .
Today ’s post will be an overview of some of the introductory aspects of the series ; next week , I will focus more on the content and the discussions with actual Afghan women .
When I first saw the Globe and Mail ’s series called “ Behind the Veil , ” about women in Kandahar , two thoughts popped into my head at the same time :
I should probably cover this for Muslimah Media Watch .
“ Behind the Veil ” ?
Seriously ???
Ugh .
I am veiled - out .
I ca n’t go near a series with a title like that .
Obviously , thought # 1 won out , but not without some time devoted to the mind - boggling frustration factor of thought # 2 .
They could not have come up with a more clichéd title if they had tried , and there is absolutely no excuse for such a lack of creativity at such a big newspaper .
To illustrate just how overdone this title is , a Google search of “ behind the veil ” ( in quotes ) gives about 569,000 results , including articles and books on women in Iran , “ Western ” journalists ’ encounters with “ women in conservative Islamic societies ” , representations of Muslim women in Indian writings , an Australian woman ’s experiences as a nurse in Saudi Arabia , prostitution in Iran , HIV / AIDS in Muslim countries , and even a BBC report from 2001 that also focused on Afghan women .
The point is , it ’s been done , ad nauseam , especially ( but not exclusively ) with regards to Muslim women , and “ behind the veil ” as a name is just plain lazy .
Maybe that sounds harsh , but my frustration comes from having seen titles like this time and time again , and the implication that the only reason to pay attention to Muslim women is in order to de-veil them .
In addition to the lack of creativity is the message that this title sends , particularly to Afghan women : “ The veil is the only thing that comes to mind when we think of you .
It takes us a whole lot of effort to consider that , behind the clothing you wear , there might actually be real people worth talking to . ”
I could maybe–maybe–understand this title if it referred to the existing media constructions of the veil ( in the sense of “ behind the one - dimensional portrait of Afghan women that we usually discuss ” ) , and the fact that Afghan women are so often talked about in the context of what they wear , but my impression from the rest of the series is that it aims to look beyond the “ veil ” itself , and not necessarily beyond the meaning that has been attributed to the veil .
One more initial reaction : if you go to the main website for the project , the image there is of a woman who appears to be wearing a black shawl or chador of some kind , that has been lifted off her face ; underneath , her head and face are covered , with the exception of her eyes ( pictured above ) .
This made me giggle , because it suggests an answer to the age - old question of “ what is behind the veil ? ” that I had n’t even considered : maybe what we would find behind the veil is–get this –another veil .
And who knows how many veils she ’s hiding behind that one …
( Yes , I realize that in this particular case , I am definitely reading too much into it . )
Listening to the journalist ’s introduction , available in video form from the series ’ website , and reading the foreign editor ’s note explaining the rationale behind the series , I was struck by just how formulaic it all sounded .
Afghan women are to be pitied , and Afghan men and / or culture are at the root of all of their problems .
Oppression can be measured by how many layers of clothing women wear .
Not that there are n’t problems for Afghan women , but the lack of complexity anywhere in the introduction surprised me .
Did the Globe and Mail really put so many resources into reproducing something that would be created with exactly the same perspective as pretty much every other portrayal of Afghan women that we ’ve seen in Western media for almost the past decade ?
I do n’t know why I had expected something more creative or critical , but I have to say I was disappointed ( this is still talking specifically about the angle from which the project was conducted ; I have more to say about the actual content of the series , which I ’ll talk about in detail next week . )
For example , the foreign editor , Stephen Northfield , starts his article with :
The road that led to the Behind the Veil project began one morning in late March , when word leaked out of a international conference in the Hague that Afghan President Hamid Karzai – our ally in the bloody and costly effort to bring peace to that war - savaged land – had endorsed a law that , among other things , allowed some men to demand sex from their wives .
We were skeptical at the initial reports .
Could this really be true ?
The answer turned out to be yes , and the response – a mix of anger and disappointment around the world – spoke volumes about the powerful and often conflicting emotions many of us have about the nation - building exercise in Afghanistan .
Should we have been shocked that such a law could have emerged from an ancient , paternalistic culture that neither embraced nor endorsed Western notions of gender equality ?
Probably not .
But , realistic or not , we hoped for better .
Aside from the somewhat baffling suggestion that notions of gender equality are only ever Western ( and that the “ West ” actually has gender equality or non-paternalistic cultures ) , this article reproduces a lot of the same assumptions that came out after the law was endorsed .
It suggests that “ we ” ( I assume he means “ Canadians , ” although the undefined collective pronoun is rather presumptuous ; see here for another discussion on the use of “ we ” in this context ) were only ever in Afghanistan to liberate its women , and that the creation of this law is the fault only of the new Afghan government , a betrayal to the supposedly benevolent efforts of the invading and occupying military presence .
As I argued when the law was first publicized ,
[ Articles in Canadian media about the law ] seem to assume that the situation of Afghan women is the primary reason that the Canadian forces are there , and that it is entirely the Afghan government ’s fault that things are not as rosy as they should be .
No one seems to remember that Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan are there as part of the “ war on terror , ” and that women ’s rights have been , at best , a side issue , and at worst , an issue raised only to drum up support for the mission .
The mere presence of Canadian forces in Afghanistan , surprisingly enough , is not going to magically result in improved conditions for Afghan women .
From the beginning of the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan , there have been various instances of leaders in some parts of the country being supported by the allied forces in their efforts to get rid of the Taliban , with little attention given to their own misogynistic policies ( see here for one example . )
I was also uncomfortable with Northfield ’s description of Afghan women as “ a silent , shadowy presence , hidden behind veils and mud walls , almost absent from the narrative of the conflict . ”
It reeks of Orientalist stereotypes , and of a narrow - minded view of the “ conflict ” ( itself an interestingly de-politicized term . )
Women may have been absent from certain narratives , but certainly not all ; and although Afghan women have certainly been silenced in many cases , the suggestion that they are primarily “ silent ” and “ shadowy ” dehumanizes them and overlooks the many ways in which Afghan women are resisting all of the oppressions that they are facing ( in ways that may or may not fit into traditional definitions of “ resistance . ” )
The main journalist for the project , Jessica Leeder , introduces her work through a video clip .
She explains that , because of cultural norms in Kandahar that prevent women from speaking to male journalists , “ the stories of what it ’s like to be a woman in this almost pre-historic slice of Afghan society have largely gone untold . ”
Aside from having issues with the term “ pre-historic , ” I also would have liked a bit more self - reflexivity here ; the stories have “ gone untold ” to whom ?
The lack of precision here suggests that the telling of the stories only matters when they are being told to outsiders ( since , presumably , Afghan women probably talk to each other every so often . )
In the two - minute clip , Afghan women are described as being held back by their burqas ( of course ) and by not being allowed to drive cars .
While neither of these is insignificant by any means , they both play into stereotypical representations of “ conservative Muslim societies , ” and at times seem to reflect more about the Western / non - Afghan / non - Muslim journalist ’s projections about what is important , rather than what the women themselves identify as their major issues .
Leeder does , however , also raise some important points about the increasing insecurity in the country , describing , for example , a female politician who was recently assassinated , and the fear of her colleagues to speak to any media , even when they had been happy to do so only months before .
The one last introductory part that I ’ll discuss , and that I did appreciate , was the methodology section .
It definitely helps to have an article that explicitly lays out how the project was conducted , acknowledging the ethical issues that were considered , as well as some of the limitations of the research :
Through a trusted contact we hired a local , female translator and interviewer and trained her on a basic video camera .
The goal was to have her conduct on - camera interviews – without a Globe reporter present – with 10 “ average ” women in Kandahar representing diverse ages , educational backgrounds and home life situations .
Those interviews would be supplemented by other in - person and telephone interviews conducted by a Globe reporter .
Each video subject was informed about the multimedia project and given the choice to use an assumed name and / or have their face blurred in photographs .
Only one asked that we do this .
All were asked the same basic slate of questions written by the Globe to highlight everything from their religious beliefs to thoughts on politics , women ’s rights and the future of Afghanistan .
The interviewer was asked to posit follow - up questions in situations that merited them .
However , she is not a trained journalist , and it ’s fair to say her instinct for when to do this evolved over the course of the month in which our interviews were done .
It is partly for this reason that the raw interviews range in length from about five minutes to 20 .
Another critical factor is the discrepancy in education levels .
Some women were simply not literate enough to understand and answer all of our questions .
While not without its own problems , this methodology article reflects a level of transparency and responsibility that I would love to see in more large - scale media projects of this kind .
I know I ’m probably going to be criticized for being overly nitpicky with this post , but I ’m just so tired of seeing the same things getting written over and over about Afghan women , and I ’m frustrated that the people involved in this project did n’t give more critical thought to how to frame the issues that it covers .
Next week ’s post will cover the actual content of the series , with a focus on the segments where Afghan women speak for themselves , segments that are far more nuanced and interesting than the eye - rolling cliches of the project ’s title and introduction .
The National Review interviews the bailout - lovin ' , wife - dumpin ' Catholic convert , reminding us all in the process just how irritating , hyperbolic , and just plain wrong Gingrich was back when he mattered :
Gingrich says he has major concerns about American culture , and " the degree to which it is becoming an anti-religious culture . " [… ]
" The modern Left is essentially proto - totalitarian , " says Gingrich .
President Obama , he says , is " an authentic representative of the intelligentsia .
I think he likes Reveille for Radicals for a reason ; he likes William Ayers for a reason .
He did n't notice 20 years of sermons for a reason . "
But is Obama that different from liberals like George McGovern ?
" Oh , yeah , " says Gingrich .
" My sense is with McGovern , unequivocally , that he was a man from a different world .
McGovern was a man who had grown up in pre-World War II America .
And he grew up in South Dakota .
Obama really grew up in the world of the modern American intelligentsia — he is a person of the Left .
The minute you accept that , you understand almost everything . "
Obama , Gingrich adds , " is a radical in the sense that the victory of those values would mean the end of American civilization as we know it . " [… ]
" I think the centrality of the Eucharist in the Catholic experience , and the degree to which you 're directly infused with Christ , gives me a much higher appreciation of the cost of a totalitarian state on an everyday basis , " he says . [… ]
Looking to Afghanistan , Gingrich says , " the real underlying challenge is that this is a much bigger problem than people understand .
You can pull out of Afghanistan , and then what ?
You want to pull out of Pakistan ?
Fine .
And then what ?
We pulled out of Somalia , and now we have pirates .
You think these guys are going away ?
Or , do you think that this will become a bigger problem ?
It 's like dealing with Iran .
The last few weeks have been worse than Chamberlain .
This is Baldwin in 1935 , just willfully blind because he did n't want to tell the British people the truth because it would offend them . "
A while back I bought a screen cleaning kit from Staples .
I forget what I paid but I would guess it was about $ 20 .
It came with a small spray bottle of a screen cleaning solution and an interesting device that had a brush on one end and on the other end you could attach one of the many microfibre clothes it came with .
The kit worked great , but eventually I ran out of cleaner and forgot about it .
Recently , after discovering it buried in my laptop bag , I went into Staples to get a replacement bottle .
For a small spray bottle containing only a few ounces of screen cleaner they were asking $ 12.99 .
For a slightly larger bottle they wanted $ 19.99 .
I scoffed at this , knowing that the liquid inside was worth only pennies and had not expected to pay more than $ 5 for a bottle .
So I left empty handed .
I knew there had to be some way to make my own screen cleaner .
I also knew , like many others , that you should never use Windex or lens cleaner on an LCD screen as it would eat at the finish .
It turns out that the recipe for making your own screen cleaner is quite simple and the ingredients are quite cheap .
All you need is :
1 Part Distilled Water
1 Part Isopropyl Alcohol ( 70 % )
Make sure you mix the solution in a well ventilated area , as isopropyl alcohol evaporates very quickly and its fumes are not only toxic but flammable .
Also be sure to use distilled water and not mineral water or tap water as they contain dissolved minerals which will result in streaks on your LCD .
After mixing your solution , pour it into an empty spray bottle .
An empty lens cleaner bottle works well and is small enough to fit in a laptop bag .
When applying the solution to your monitor make sure you power it off first .
Also never spray it directly on to the screen , rather spray it onto your cloth and then rub it on to the screen .
Make sure to use a soft , clean cloth , and not a paper towel or tissue as they can scratch the screen or leave fluff on it .
After cleaning the monitor , wait a few moments for it to dry before turning it back on .
Real estate brokers say that Colorado ’s medical - marijuana law has sparked a land rush , as entrepreneurs lured by a growing number of licensed users search for properties for growing or selling pot .
In a down real estate market , landlords who might otherwise wait for more conventional tenants are snapping at the opportunity presented by medical - marijuana dispensaries , said Darrin Revious , a broker with Shames Makovsky Realty .
“ I am working a couple of these deals right now , ” he said .
“ It is absolutely crazy how many of these deals are in the market .
I ca n’t believe it . ”
Since voters approved Amendment 20 in 2000 allowing the use of medical marijuana to treat eight specific conditions , the number of people legally allowed to buy the herb has steadily climbed .
In 2007 , 1,955 people held medical marijuana cards ; the following year , there were 4,720 people on the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment ’s Medical Marijuana Registry .
The number has grown to about 13,000 , health department spokesman Mark Salley said .
On an average day , the department receives 400 requests for medical - marijuana cards , and some days applications are as high as 600 , Salley said .
Revious said he receives at least one request per day from brokers representing people seeking property suitable for grow operations or dispensaries , where medical pot is sold to card - carrying patients .
Over the past three or four months , he said , demand for the properties has soared .
“ I need ( 5,000 square feet in ) LoDo , or there about . . . retail , ” says one e-mail he received from a broker .
“ Wellness center — yes , medical marijuana .
A group expanding out of California — a real one . ”
Warren Edson , an attorney who handles medical - marijuana cases and advises people trying to set up cannabis collectives and cooperatives , said he believes the rise in demand is related to the increasing number of patients approved to buy the drug .
“ My share of stoners ”
Many people became more aware that pot was legal for those with medical conditions this summer , when the state Board of Health rejected a move to cap at five the number of people a medical - marijuana caregiver can supply , he added .
“ It was publicity , ” Edson said .
“ It meant the average Joe was seeing it discussed on the news , and saying maybe I should go to my doctor about this ; it is n’t just for crazy people . ”
Six months ago , Edson said , many of those seeking the cards were terribly sick , or were “ hippies ” looking to get high .
“ Now we are seeing a greater cross section of individuals . ”
Laurel Alterman opened AlterMeds at the Colony Square Shopping Center in Louisville earlier this month , just before the City Council approved a moratorium on new dispensaries .
Alterman abandoned her real estate business , which has done poorly recently , to open the dispensary .
“ When the Board of Health expanded the roll of caregivers this summer , the opportunity to open became very attractive , and my son was working in a dispensary in Denver and knew the business , ” she said .
“ I just jumped off a building without a parachute . ”
Paul Tamburello , a broker ’s associate with Distinctive Properties , said he gets three calls a week from business people who want to lease a building he owns at West 32nd Avenue and Zuni Street to use as a dispensary .
“ Some are really legitimate businesspeople , but I certainly run into my share of stoners , ” he said .
There are four dispensaries within a mile of the building , he said .
“ There certainly seems to be a plethora of dispensaries trying to open .
I call it the new gold rush .
A lot of these guys are seeing dollar signs .
I do n’t know how lucrative it will be if the velocity of growth continues on the path it is on . ”
Alterman said she expects to earn twice as much as she made annually in real estate by selling medical marijuana .
One businessman said he has been approached a number of times by people who wanted to rent space for a dispensary in his Colfax Avenue business .
He refused .
“ We do n’t rent space , ” said the man , who asked that his name and business not be published because marijuana has negative connotations for many .
Some Californians who wanted to open a dispensary in the area asked him what he thought his building is worth .
When he said it was appraised at $ 850,000 they offered $ 750,000 in cash at closing .
Tighter regulations loom
Concern over the mushrooming number of dispensaries is growing , and some cities and towns are studying regulations to limit them , while others have passed outright bans .
State Sen. Chris Romer , D - Denver , plans to introduce a bill next year that would clarify regulations involving pot-using patients .
Alterman said she would n’t object to some regulation in the industry that could make the shops operate more like licensed pharmacies .
And she sees a need for properly zoning the establishments .
Tight security measures are necessary to operate the shops and grow operations , which are natural targets for thieves , she said .
“ Zoning laws are important , ” she said .
“ This is a business that is inappropriate for a residential area because , yes , it is dangerous . ”

At 2:33 p.m. in New York City ’s East Harlem , four short yellow school buses pull to a stop in front of Reece School , a private elementary school for special needs children .
The bus drivers pop their doors open and idle , engines running , while they await their young passengers .
As the students trickle out of the school , a clipboard - wielding teacher checks their names off her list and guides them to their buses .
On the older buses , the engines rumble as the children climb aboard .
At 2:40 p.m. , the first bus is full and off it goes , down the hill , merging with traffic on Madison Avenue .
The second bus inches forward and stops .
Six more round the corner onto 104th Street , all with engines running .
By 2:45 p.m. , all the students are heading home .
Between dismissal and departure , the diesel engines idled for 12 minutes , spewing exhaust into the air in front of the school .
Idling longer than one minute in a school zone is illegal in New York City for all vehicles , but the laws are rarely enforced .
Before dismissal , around the corner on Madison Avenue , a produce delivery truck idled for several minutes , double - parked — all while a traffic enforcement cop stood two cars down .
Idling buses , cars and trucks may not seem like a big deal , but in New York City they spew out as much pollution as nine million diesel trucks driving from the Bronx to Staten Island , according to the Environmental Defense Fund .
That ’s roughly 130,000 tons of carbon dioxide , 940 tons of nitrogen oxide , 24 tons of soot particles , and 6,400 tons of carbon monoxide each year .
Vehicles running on diesel fuel release fine particulate matter and elemental carbon — also known as black carbon .
In studies around the world , particulates have been linked to deaths from respiratory disease and heart attacks .
Diesel exhaust also contains several carcinogens and other toxic substances .
For school children , health experts say diesel exhaust presents a serious health concern — especially to asthmatics — because it can trigger asthma attacks .
In New York City , the asthma hospitalization rate is almost twice the national average , and neighborhoods in Northern Manhattan , including East Harlem , have among the highest rates of pediatric asthma hospitalization and mortality in the city .
Asthma is the most common cause of hospitalization for children under 14 years old , and in New York City ’s worst neighborhoods , an estimated 1 in 4 school children have asthma , according to the Asthma Free School Zone , a New York based non-profit group .
In May , scientists in New York reported that school zones ’ concentrations of black carbon — a predictor of diesel pollution — are related to idling of buses and trucks at the end of the school day .
“ If you find ways to either curb bus emissions or curtail bus idling , and cut traffic in general , children ’s exposure to black carbon should be reduced , ” said Jennifer Richmond - Bryant , lead author of the study .
She was an assistant professor at Hunter College in New York at the time of the study , but is now with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
The Asthma Free School Zone was also involved with the study .
Because of the health threat to children , California in 2003 banned idling of school buses .
Under the state law , California school bus drivers must turn off their engines when they arrive and restart them no earlier than 30 seconds before departing .
At least 17 other states also have state or local rules that limit idling , some for all vehicles and others for just buses .
In most cities , kids ’ exposure is greatest while they are actually inside the bus .
According to one study in Los Angeles , people are exposed to 40 times more exhaust while riding in a bus than they are while waiting at the bus stop .
But in New York City , pollution at bus stops is unusually high because of urban street canyons -- tall buildings and narrow streets that trap pollution at the street level .
Particulates at ground level can be up to 175 percent higher than on the rooftops , depending on which direction the wind is blowing .
In the new study , air quality was monitored over 16 days at the end of the school day .
Monitoring devices were positioned near the Reece School , which is also near two other East Harlem schools .
Minute - by - minute readings were taken of particulate matter and black carbon and the results were compared to background pollution , according to the study , which was published in the journal Science of the Total Environment .
The researchers found that fine particulates were higher than black carbon , but changes in concentration were not related to traffic , suggesting that the street canyon was trapping the particles .
Black carbon concentrations , however , were significantly related to idling and passing diesel vehicles .
Because background data on black carbon have never been recorded , researchers are unable to say whether it is significantly higher during the dismissal period .
The findings have prompted several environmental and community groups to start developing policies and educational programs to manage traffic , improve air quality , and reduce absenteeism related to asthma attacks .
When the Asthma Free School Zone was founded , director Rebecca Kalin took on the idling problem by targeting the worst offenders .
“ The most egregious example was yellow school buses , and nobody seemed to be paying attention at all , ” said Kalin .
After a phone call in 2004 to then Attorney General Eliot Spitzer , a representative from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ’s office met with Kalin the next day , and within eight months , the city sued the largest school bus companies , forcing the school bus operators to train drivers to limit idling .
In April , the maximum idling time in a school zone was reduced from three minutes ( the maximum time elsewhere in the city ) to one minute .
The law , however , is difficult to monitor and rarely enforced .
A spokesperson for the New York City Department of Education said there is little that schools can do to make sure bus drivers comply because buses are privately operated and enforcement is the police department ’s job .
“ I ’m really concerned about the city situation , but it ’s improving all the time , ” Kalin said .
There ’s a loop - hole in the law that exempts private schools and does n’t require them to post no idling signs , she said .
The New York Department of Environmental Conservation granted traffic enforcement officers the authority to ticket school buses that violate idling laws in an effort to encourage bus companies to retrofit their buses .
The fines begin at $ 220 , and reach $ 2,000 for repeat offenders .
Isabelle Silverman , an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund , said it makes sense to allow these officers to ticket idlers since “ they are out there walking the streets , breathing in the pollution . ”
“ We want them to fix the problem , not to just have to pay , ” said Anhthu Hoang , General Counsel for West Harlem Environmental Action , Inc. , a community environmental justice group .
“ We want them to lower their emissions . ”
California ’s Air Resources
Board also has no information on whether its ban on idling school buses is being enforced .
Federal regulations , however , are starting to clean up diesel vehicles , including school buses .
In 2007 , the EPA required better emission controls on new diesel truck and bus engines , such as soot filters and cleaner fuel .
Under the new EPA standards , a school bus made in 2008 will produce 90 percent less soot than a bus made in 2006 .
The retirement age for buses was also reduced from 19 to 16 years , so as the bus fleet turns over , the buses will become cleaner .
Some buses will even be fitted with systems that are capable of monitoring idling times .
Bloomberg launched a “ Turn It Off ! ” campaign with ads on radio , bus stops and billboards , encouraging drivers to stop idling in the city .
Advocacy groups are encouraged by the attention in recent years , and are hopeful that the momentum from new laws will lead to greater awareness .
But the problem is far from solved , as seen by the continued idling of buses and cars as schools leave school each day .
Cars are not a significant source of pollution near the schools , probably because gasoline contributes less black carbon and particulate matter than diesel fuel , the New York City study found .
However , the Environmental Defense Fund and the Asthma Free School Zone are targeting all vehicles with their anti-idling campaign .
“ It all adds up .
It ’s all unhealthy , ” Silverman said .
“ It ’s right at the curbside , at stroller level , and it ’s totally unnecessary .
Turning it off is a win - win for everybody . ”
Nord Stream Gets Go-Ahead Denmark Approves Russian Baltic Pipeline
The Danish Energy Agency approved Russia 's controversial Nord Stream pipeline across the Baltic Sea on Tuesday .
The line will deliver Russian natural gas to Western Europe but has drawn massive criticism from Eastern European countries who fear Moscow will use it as a political weapon .
That 's My Billboard !
No , It 's Mine !
No , Mine !
Waa !
Waa !
Pity the poor wild posting .
It 's under attack by New York - based Public Art Campaign .
Specifically , the group is targeting NPA , a company which maintains a collection of specific wild posting locations .
Public Art Campaign representatives Sunday were seen around Manhattan with buckets of white paint covering NPA wild posting boards .
According to Gothamist , less that an hour after the boards were whitewashed and non-commercial art applied , NPA had reclaimed the boards are reposted them with commercial messaging .
It 's like two kids fighting over a toy ( Mine ! Mine !
Mine ! ) until it breaks .
Which then leads to a dueling temper tantrum of epic proportion .
According to the New York Times , five people were arrested in association with the standoff .
How do you make money from Linux in the cloud ?
One potential route could be to open a store .
As part of its upcoming Karmic Koala release , Ubuntu Linux is set to integrate a number of new cloud technologies .
One of the efforts will include a cloud software appliance store to help expedite setup and deployment of private clouds .
At the core of Ubuntu's Karmic Koala cloud technologies is something called the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud ( UEC ) which made its initial Ubuntu debut in the Jaunty Jackalope release in April .
Full enterprise support services followed several months later .
In the Karmic release , UEC is being more tightly integrated into the server as well as being enabled with a UEC store for applications .
The move advances Ubuntu 's cloud strategy and could potentially bring in partners and cash to the Linux vendor .
" We 've added an appliance store and what that does is as a first cut , is after you 've installed UEC on your servers , you think about what do you want to put on your cloud ? "
Steve George , director of support and services at Ubuntu 's commercial sponsor Canonical told InternetNews.com .
" So what we want to do here is to provide images of Ubuntu into an easily accessible location so you can download and inject those appliances into your cloud immediately and potentially take third party software or other free software and develop appliances that can be used in a UEC cloud . "
George added that right now the official name of the effort is the UEC store and the long term direction will evolve over the next number of Ubuntu releases .
The basic idea is to enable Ubuntu cloud users to be able to get their application cloud up and running as quickly and as easily as possible .
The store idea is also a way for Ubuntu to ensure that the quality and security of cloud applications follows Ubuntu 's security and maintenance policies .
While the UEC store has the potential to be a revenue generating engine for Canonical , that 's not the focus for the Karmic release .
" At the moment this is not really a Canonical go to market strategy , it 's an Ubuntu technology and this is our first approach to it , " George said .
" One the things we like to do is to take a new technology like UEC and make sure we 've got it ready before we take it to partners . "
Partners , competition and private cloud computing
George commented that Canonical has in fact already had some conversations with potential partners about the UEC store , and he expect to have more conversations in the coming months .
In its quest for cloud partners , Canonical will come up against rival Linux distribution , Red Hat .
In July , Red Hat announced its own partner cloud certification effort with Amazon as one of the key participants .
Red Hat 's certification effort is primarily about helping enterprises deploy their application with cloud provider partners .
Ubuntu at this stage is focusing on a different direction .
" The core thing for us with UEC is the vision that corporate IT managers want cloud computing for is its agility and elasticity , but at the moment many of them can't use a public infrastructure like Amazon , " George said .
" So UEC is completely focused on the idea of private cloud computing . "
The Ubuntu Karmic Koala server release is currently scheduled for October 29th .
Talk on “ Generics in Data Parallel Haskell ”
Here are the slides for my talk on the use of generics in the implementation of Data Parallel Haskell at the SAPLING meeting yesterday .
This is where Instant Generics come from .
The absolute # 1 pain in the neck Twitter nuisance for me these days are the hordes of Twitter auto direct messages I receive after following someone .
It has practically made Twitter DM a useless tool for me .
If anyone actually sends me a legitimate DM , it ’s lost in a sea of spammy auto DMs encouraging me to check out ‘ insert product / service / website here ’ .
I understand that it is impossible to manage a large following by personally welcoming each person that follows you , and it ’s not my expectation that anyone would do this .
I rarely do unless there are unique circumstances such as someone I ’ve stumbled across that has much in common with me .
But let ’s be honest here , people and businesses are using Twitter auto DM to pimp something , which I get .
This sort of thing has been done for years on a variety of different mediums .
What makes it so frustrating , is that Twitter has not released features that allow it ’s users to combat this .
Much like an email spam filter , there needs to be ways to block these auto DMs .
I know recently SocialToo has launched some options to help , but it ’s certainly not as useful as a Twitter supported feature could be .
I ’m certainly not the only advocate for seeing this trend go away .
Sites like StopAutoDM.com are springing up to help buck the trend .
There ’s also some useful chatter on the subject on a recent TechCrunch article .
Some of you might say , “ Just unfollow those that auto DM , you have the power to filter it out ” .
Yes , this is true , but just because someone is utilizing auto DM , does n’t necessarily mean that person or or organization has nothing valuable to offer .
Often times people just do n’t realize that some of the tactics they use are not an ideal way of communicating .
While I disapprove of the tactic , I do n’t automatically categorize the user as spam .
In some cases , yes , in many , not necessarily .
I ’m not implying that auto DM tactics should not be available to those who wish to use it .
I ’m all for businesses , organizations , and people having the freedom and ability to evangelize their products and services in ways that make sense for their business .
What I ’m saying is that as an end user , I should have access to tools that allow me to control whether I see those messages or not .
Yes , Twitter is a free service , but it ’s not like they are making money through these tactics to keep the service afloat .
I can tolerate some small , targeted advertising in exchange for using a tremendous tool like Twitter , but we ’ve certainly reached a point where we need some tools to better manage Twitter .
I ca n’t imagine that the click through rates to links in Twitter auto DMs are that high , let alone conversion rates , but it would certainly be interesting to see .
I have n’t found any studies on the subject , but Mashable posted some interesting finds on overall click through rates for Tweeting as a whole here .
If the CTR on tweet links is roughly around 1.5 % or so , it ’s got to be much lower on auto DMs .
So , if you utilize Twitter auto DMs , I ’d be interested to hear your take .
Why do you use it , and what are the results ?
And if you knew that your audience hated them , would you stop ?
- video encodings still in process -
By the way the water is scalding hot .
Real nice ....

Recently by Ron Paul : Bombs and Bribes
Listen to Ron Paul .
Click the play button below .
This past week there has been a lot of discussion and debate on the continuing war in Afghanistan .
Lasting twice as long as World War II and with no end in sight , the war in Afghanistan has been one of the longest conflicts in which our country has ever been involved .
The situation has only gotten worse with recent escalations .
A Foreign Policy of Fr... Paul , Ron Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 8.85 ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
The current debate is focused entirely on the question of troop levels .
How many more troops should be sent over in order to pursue the war ?
The administration has already approved an additional 21,000 American service men and women to be deployed by November , which will increase our troop levels to 68,000 .
Will another 40,000 do the job ?
Or should we eventually build up the levels to 100,000 in addition to that ?
Why not 500,000 — just to be safe ?
And how will public support be brought back around to supporting this war again when 58 percent are now against it ?
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
I get quite annoyed at this very narrow line of questioning .
I have other questions .
We overthrew the Taliban government in 2001 with less than 10,000 American troops .
Why does it now seem that the more troops we send , the worse things get ?
If the Soviets bankrupted themselves in Afghanistan with troop levels of 100,000 and were eventually forced to leave in humiliating defeat , why are we determined to follow their example ?
Most importantly , what is there to be gained from all this ?
We ’ve invested billions of dollars and thousands of precious lives — for what ?
The truth is it is no coincidence that the more troops we send the worse things get .
Things are getting worse precisely because we are sending more troops and escalating the violence .
We are hoping that good leadership wins out in Afghanistan , but the pool of potential honest leaders from which to draw have been fleeing the violence , leaving a tremendous power vacuum behind .
War does not quell bad leaders .
It creates them .
And the more war we visit on this country , the more bad leaders we will inadvertently create .
Another thing that war does is create anger with its indiscriminate violence and injustice .
How many innocent civilians have been harmed from clumsy bombings and mistakes that end up costing lives ?
People die from simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time in a war zone , but the killers never face consequences .
Imagine the resentment and anger survivors must feel when a family member is killed and nothing is done about it .
When there are no other jobs available because all the businesses have fled , what else is there to do , but join ranks with the resistance where there is a paycheck and also an opportunity for revenge ?
This is no justification for our enemies over there , but we have to accept that when we push people , they will push back .
The real question is why are we there at all ?
What do our efforts now have to do with the original authorization of the use of force ?
We are no longer dealing with anything or anyone involved in the attacks of 9/11 .
At this point we are only strengthening the resolve and the ranks of our enemies .
We have nothing left to win .
We are only there to save face , and in the end we will not even be able to do that .

Enlarge By Suzy Parker , USA TODAY PILING ON AGAINST SUGAR PILING ON AGAINST SUGAR Need a reason to cut back on sugar ?
Think of your heart , suggests the American Heart Association .
In a recent report , the group said : • High sugar intake is linked to obesity , high blood pressure and other risk factors for heart attack and stroke .
• Most people should consume no more than 6 to 9 teaspoons of added sugar each day ( including sugars in processed foods ) .
• The average American consumes 22 teaspoons of added sugar a day .

When one of pediatrician Jim Sears ' kids asks for a soda or other sweet treat , he sometimes asks them a question : " Is this a good time to be suppressing your immune system ? "
Sears , who is co-host of The Doctors TV show and a contributor to the popular AskDrSears parenting website , is a firm believer in a widespread idea :
A big dose of sugar can immediately suppress your immune system and make you more vulnerable to colds , flu and other infections .
So , at a time when people are especially keen to protect themselves from H1N1 , or swine flu , it 's worth asking : Is it true ?
Can a few spoonfuls of sugar really help make you sick ?
SWINE FLU CENTRAL :
What you need to know about H1N1 : Map of U.S. cases , latest news H1N1 : Vaccine arrives , and scramble begins Q&A : H1N1 and seasonal flu : Vaccine answers Denver nutrition therapist Kate Pfeiffer has no doubt .
" Limiting sugar should be the first line of defense against infectious disease , " she says .
She wrote a column for Examiner.com titled : " Worried about the Swine Flu ? Avoid Sugar ! "
In it she cites a 1973 study , published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
The same study is cited at AskDrSears.com and on many alternative - medicine sites .
In the study , researchers at Loma Linda University gave volunteers 100 grams of sugar ( 20 teaspoons , roughly the amount in a liter of soda ) .
The researchers then drew blood from the volunteers and mixed in some bacteria .
They found that infection - fighting white blood cells from people who had just gorged on sugar gobbled up many fewer bacteria than those who had just fasted or eaten an unsweetened starch .
But that 's not evidence that would convince most doctors , says Aaron Glatt , an infectious - disease specialist who is president and chief executive officer of New Island Hospital in Bethpage , N.Y .
Glatt says he has heard of the sugar theory , but as far as he knows , there are no studies showing people who eat a lot of sugar actually get more cases of colds and flu .
He says : " There are numerous other reasons people should be concerned about sugar intake , " including the prevention and control of obesity and diabetes .
But , he says , " there 's no reason not to drink a glass of soda just because someone next to you is sniffling . "
More emphasis on a balanced diet Robert Frenck , professor of pediatrics at Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center and a spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics , agrees : " I have not found any ( studies ) that show sugar changes your resistance to infection . "
Christine Gerbstadt , a registered dietitian and physician who is a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association , combed through hundreds of studies and came to the same conclusion .
She even found a recent study that suggested a sugar surge might boost immunity — at least in mice forced to run on treadmills and fed various diets .
But it 's unlikely any one food is the key to a strong or weak immune system , she says .
Instead , she says , " we can optimize the building blocks for immune system by eating a healthy , balanced diet . "
Sears says he agrees wholeheartedly that overall nutrition is more important than any one substance .
But he still says there 's something about a sugar overdose that makes people vulnerable .
He says he expects to see some evidence soon — when his office fills up with sick kids after Halloween .

Capitalism is in need of a good Reformation …
“ Wait a minute … ”
Those were allegedly the final words of Pope Alexander VI back in August of 1503 .
I was thinking of fat , old , syphilitic , corrupt , murdering , adulterous Alexander just this morning .
This particular Pope , known before his papacy as Rodrigo Borgia , who had so many mistresses he makes modern America ’s politicians and talk show hosts look chaste by comparison , is also distinguished by the fact that he was the father of , among many others , Cesare and the notorious Lucrezia Borgia .
( To give you a taste for the man , upon becoming Pope he annulled his daughter ’s previous marriage so he could marry her off in a lavish Vatican ceremony to a relative of one of the cardinals who supported his papacy even as rumors circled of her incestuous relationship with one of her brothers .
And the Heene family thought they had what it takes to make a good reality show … )
I thought of old Rodrigo as I flipped through a pile of clippings that I had set aside during the past couple of days .
I started collecting the stories last week .
The first were clippings about the record round of financial community bonuses in the U.S. and in the U.K .
Then , as all this was happening , was Goldman Sachs ’ CEO Lloyd Blankfein ’s FT op - ed calling for financial reform .
As I mentioned before I found the juxtaposition uncomfortably calculated .
A couple days later , there was the story announcing that former Goldman Sachs ’ VP Adam Storch was being named Chief Operating Officer of the “ new and improved ” SEC enforcement division .
I have no doubt that Mr. Storch is an excellent fellow and a perfect choice … other than the fact that he worked at Goldman .
Does anyone think about the optics of these things ?
Or more than the optics , do they ever consider just how genuinely inappropriate such a hiring might be ?
Of course , that ’s a rhetorical question .
Some people do think about it .
Just not people doing the hiring in the administration .
Hence the articles in my pile of clips about the big bonuses that senior advisors to Tim Geithner got from big Wall Street houses prior to signing up to help devise the plans to “ fix ” Wall Street .
I know some of these guys very well , consider them friends , consider them eminently qualified to be doing their jobs … and yet , something gnaws at me about all this , an insensitivity on the part of the people who were putting together the administration team about what was really at stake in the financial crisis .
It seems they felt the issue was more fixing the immediate problem than it was fixing the enduring problems in a system that once again has Wall Street executives lighting cigars with hundred dollar bills while unemployment hits record levels ( see Mort Zuckerman ’s strong piece on this in today ’s FT ) and home foreclosure are forcing former homeowners to live on the streets as never before .
In any event it seems like they were really stopping to ask whether something big had changed … or needed to .
Paul Krugman gets it , has all along and has written about it again in today ’s Times .
Frank Rich , in yesterday ’s Times wrote a column capturing some of the anger that people feel about the power of Goldman and the other big banks and the utter unwillingness of Washington to do anything other than offer the occasional talk show tsk- tsk in response to the current return to profligacy ( or the return of big lenders like Citi and Bank of America to losses after a momentary , bailout induced spate of profits ) .
Meanwhile , John Harwood in the Times writes about Larry Summers ’ wise silence on sensitive economic questions while failing to go further and ask why it was that this week ’s tsk- tsking assignments went to Rahm Emanuel , David Axelrod , and Valerie Jarrett — successors in function to the troika that once ran Ronald Reagan ’s White House ( James Baker , Michael Deaver and Ed Meese ) .
On the one hand the question is interesting because it leads one to other questions , like why the folks from the president ’s morning economic briefing who are being most prominently rolled out are not actually the ones who are the economic professionals ?
Could it be that the administration political brain trust feels the economic team has lost too much credibility by their minimalist , go - slow approach to reform ?
I think that would be a miscalculation because the future effectiveness of Geithner and Summers will depend on their being seen as the architects of substantially ( and accelerating ) reforms .
( Of course another question raised by the appearance of the Big Three on the Sunday shows is whether or not the administration really is being some so Office - of - the - President centric that it is all head and no arms and legs , kind of like one of those big - brained creatures from outer space or our future that we were led to believe would evolve from societies that did n’t require physical exercise .
The critique , provided to me this weekend by a prominent diplomat who has lived in Washington a long time , is that the administration has no trouble coming up with ideas or giving speeches but it has yet to put an effective implementation apparatus in place .
It is kind of the Marvin the Martian model of governance . )
That particular aside aside , the pile of clippings grew this morning with the Wall Street Journal noting in its particularly “ fair and balanced ” way that the criticism of Wall Street from Emanuel and Axelrod was more tempered than in the recent past , suggesting that at least as far as the newspaper of record of the financial community was concerned , the White House was n’t too het up about all these fat pay checks .
Apparently swine flu worries us but an epidemic of swinishness does not .
At least the Journal seems to hope so .
And so , reflecting on all these clips , I started thinking to myself , is it capitalism ?
Could Michael
Moore be right ?
( That seems so unlikely … )
It ’s troubling to me , a dyed - in - the - wool practicing capitalist .
And I ’ll have to admit I am still a long way from coming to a good answer about just how we have gone wrong and what needs to be done to fix a system that is producing greater inequality than ever and that is so apparently corrupt that even those from whom you expect big reform have either been co-opted or , alternatively , are simply reluctant to toss these particular money changers out of our particular temple ( the small “ d ” democratic one ) .
But my first instincts are what brought me back to good old Pope Rodrigo the Base and Repulsive .
Because it strikes me that the issue is n’t capitalism per se .
Because 21st Century Wall Street is to capitalism as Pope Alexander VI was to the teachings of Jesus Christ .
There was a connection but it was remote and observed more in the breach than in the honoring of the essentially good underlying ideas .
And that ’s where I take some comfort .
It ’s not that we need a new economic ideology .
We ’re just in dire need of a Reformation .
( Although I for one could do without some of the wars , inquisitions , and public executions of the last one . )

More Americans Than Brits Die In Intensive Care Units
When Americans are near the end of life hospitals try to keep them alive past the point their bodies can do it .
Does anyone think this is a good idea ?
Patients who die in the hospital in the United States are almost five times as likely to have spent part of their last hospital stay in the ICU than patients in England .
What 's more , over the age of 85 , ICU usage among terminal patients is eight times higher in the U.S. than in England , according to new research from Columbia University that compared the two countries ' use of intensive care services during final hospitalizations .
" Evaluating the use of intensive care services is particularly important because it is costly , resource intensive , and often traumatic for patients and families , especially for those at the end of life " said Hannah Wunsch , M.D. , M.Sc. , assistant professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine , of Columbia University , lead author of the study .
" We found far greater use of intensive care services in the United States during terminal hospitalizations , especially among medical patients and the elderly . "
I support the use of ICU equipment when someone has suffered a severe trauma or even a heart attack where they have some prospect of recovery .
But if you are going to die then what 's the point ?
Suppose ICU technology keeps advancing and people can be kept alive on machines while , say , cancer ravages their brains , bones , etc .
Is n't it torture to keep people alive under those circumstances ?
I 've been close enough to someone who was dying that I 've sat across from a hospice nurse who explained to me such things as , for example , if the person had a heart attack then attempts to revive would likely break ribs ( the ribs were full of cancer ) and that this would just make them live longer with even more pain .
There was a conscious decision by all concerned to avoid the hospital .
I wonder how many people get taken to the hospital to die in an ICU after a few extra horrible weeks of life because there 's no family members available to talk it out with doctors and hospice people in advance .
Seattle , Washington ( CNN ) --
When Amanda Knox 's parents head to Italy for closing arguments in their daughter 's murder trial they 'll be carrying a present they hope desperately she can use soon : a plane ticket home .
In that purchase lies one family 's entire hope .
Curt Knox and Edda Mellas say their daughter is nothing like the person they 've seen depicted before and during her trial .
They grimace at the description prosecutors have used in court : that Amanda Knox was a resentful American so angry with her British roommate Meredith Kercher that she exacted revenge during a twisted sex misadventure at their home two years ago .
Prosecutors say Knox directed then - boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito and another man infatuated with her , Rudy Guede , to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher 's throat .
" She is totally nonviolent , almost a passive person , " Mellas told CNN in a joint interview with her former husband .
So passive was Knox , the parents said , that she could n't even continue a kickboxing class because she felt it was too violent .
She was so caring , they said , that she would make her friends stop a car to let a spider out rather than kill it .
Knox was an easy child to raise in Seattle , Washington , along with her younger sisters Deanna and Ashley , her parents said .
She took to soccer early on but hit the books as hard as she played .
It was on the field that she earned the nickname Foxy Knoxy , though they say it was rarely used and taken out of context when Kercher was found killed to portray their daughter as a sex - hungry party animal .
" It was totally associated to soccer and how she prepared herself as a defender , waiting to take on a striker going down , " Curt Knox said .
" So how people read this nickname is totally wrong . "
Eventually , though a star player at college , Knox gave up the sport to focus on her education .
She knew she wanted to study in Italy and would n't be able to leave the team to go abroad .
Her mother said she threw herself into jobs to help the family save for the trip , working as a soccer coach , a barista and in a gallery .
They recall a young woman far different from the wild party girl depicted by prosecutors , one they said found more enjoyment in going to a coffee house and reading a book than going out to a club .
They say she met her former boyfriend and co-accused Sollecito at a classical concert .
Yes , they concede , Knox , now 22 , and Sollecito say they were smoking marijuana and having sex at his home the night Kercher was killed , but that was as wild as it got .
They reject the idea of revenge as a motive for Knox to kill Kercher .
Mellas said her daughter e-mailed and called to tell her about her new roommate regularly .
Knox told her they got along great and spent time together , going to libraries and a chocolate festival .
What has happened in Perugia , Italy , is unfathomable to them .
On November 2 , 2007 , at 4 a.m. in Seattle , Mellas was awakened by the phone .
" Amanda called [ and said ] ' I hate to wake you up , but something 's not right here , I think someone 's been in my house , ' " Mellas recalled .
The door to the home she shared with Kercher had been ajar when she came home that morning , and when Knox got out of a quick shower , she noticed drops of blood .
Kercher 's door was locked , and Knox could n't reach her , she told her mother , adding that Sollecito was calling the police .
Later , when officers broke down the door to Kercher 's room , Mellas said her daughter struggled to understand what was going on , hanging on the few words of Italian she understood at the time .
" They were screaming ' A foot , a foot , ' that 's what they could see , " Mellas recalled Amanda Knox saying .
When she learned Kercher was dead in the room , a hysterical Knox called her mother , Mellas remembered .
" We were constantly on the phone , " she said .
" She was tired , scared , there was a murderer out running around and she was afraid to be alone . "
On the day Knox was arrested , Mellas was flying to Italy to be with her daughter , to comfort her and help her find a new place to live since her home was still a crime scene .
But Mellas ' plane was diverted to Switzerland , where she switched on her phone and learned that Knox had been charged with murder .
" I felt physically ill , I went to the bathroom to throw up .
I was stuck [ in Switzerland ] for five hours , " Mellas recalled , beginning to cry .
By the time she reached Italy and was allowed to see her daughter , Mellas had already heard news reports that Knox had confessed .
She was flabbergasted and confused .

" It was horrible .
We cried most of the time , " Mellas recalled of the first meeting .
" But we held each other and it all made sense .
She told me what happened in the interrogation , how they asked her to imagine the possibilities .
She talked about being hit , screamed at , threatened ; it was the most horrible thing she had ever been through in her entire life . "
But even with the way Knox has been treated and portrayed , her parents know they are the lucky parents in this case .
" As parents , the Kercher family received the worst phone call they could get , " Curt Knox said , adding he believes Kercher has gotten lost in the sensational coverage .
" At least our daughter called us . "
After the arrest , Mellas was sure there was a mix - up or problems with translation that would soon be cleared up .
But they were n't .
When Guede was later arrested in Germany , police said he had been speaking to a friend on a Skype call monitored by police and had been talking about being at Kercher 's house .
Mellas and Curt Knox were sure again that everything would be fixed .
During the conversation , despite saying that he knew who Amanda Knox was , he never indicated she was at the home the night of the murder .
But after being jailed , his story changed , and he pointed the finger at Knox and her then - boyfriend , Sollecito .
Her family said they 've tried to shield Knox from knowing how high - profile the case has gotten and how people are talking about her , discussing what she wears to court and what kind of person she is .
But she does know she may be going to jail for a very long time .
During closing arguments , prosecutors asked for her to be sentenced to life in prison , shocking her family who had expected a demand for 30 years .

Still , at occasional prison visits , Curt Knox and Mellas try to give Knox a light at the end of the tunnel .
" We have to try and put on a face that it is going to work out , " Mellas said , beginning to cry .
" We keep telling her it 's taking way longer than expected but she will get out of there .
They will not put an innocent 20 - year - old in jail , they just can't . "
They take solace and hold onto the moments the court allows Knox to share with her parents after the trial has recessed each day .
" They allowed us to go into the back room and say goodbye and hug her , tell her we love her , " Curt Knox said choking up .
" Just those few seconds are worth a lot . "
It can be extremely addictive , and it is fatal if you overdose on it .
Do n't worry though , one pill is completely harmless .
Just as long as you do n't do it again .
And it will take away your appetite and sleep .
You might want to ask your dad what the hell he 's doing with prescription drugs for ADHD though ( they 're mostly used for treating kids , I doubt he has it )

アルゴリズムの概要 画像のアスペクト比を変え るretargeting （構図変換）、不要な部分を削除し埋め合わせる画像補完、画像の一部を掴んで自由に再配置するreshuffling（画像再配置）などの画像処理においては、インタラクションが不可欠である。しかし、対象の構造を保ったまま画像の変形を行うことは計算量が大きく、高速な処理が難しいという課題があった。
ボトルネックとなっていたのは、画像内から最も類似した画像パッチ（小さな画像片）を発見する近隣探索処理である。ある部分を補完するには、類似した他の部分から画像パッチを引っ張ってきて埋める処理を行うが、PatchMatchアルゴリズムではこの検索を高速に行うことができる。自然画像は局所的に類似領域が近接する性質があり、この性質を上手く使えば、検索空間を小さくすることができるのである。
その検索は3段階のフェイズで行われる。画像Aと画像Bがあり、画像A中のパッチに近似したパッチを画像Bから発見する場合を考える。 初期化 ( Initialization ) ：まず各パッチは対応するパッチをランダムに与えられる（赤・青・緑）。
伝搬 ( Propagation ) ：青いパッチは、上方の緑、左方の赤の近傍をチェックし、適合度がより高まるか確認する。
検索 ( Search ) ：赤の方が適合度が高い場合、その近傍に青に対応する領域がある事が期待されるので、近傍を検索し適合度が高い点を見つける。
このようにして自然画像の特性を利用して、連鎖的に適合度の高い点を見つけることができる。

Frostburg , Md. — THREE hours by bike from Cumberland , Md. , on the Great Allegheny Passage , I rode into the mouth of the abandoned Borden Tunnel near here , where freight trains once rumbled , hauling coke , steel and coal .
The air was black as engine oil .
In the middle of the tunnel , darkness swallowed my pedals and handlebars .
My wheels wobbled on crushed limestone , but I could n’t see them anymore .
My friend David Howard was pedaling far in front of me and loving every minute of it .
“ I ca n’t see a thing , ” he said gleefully .
“ It feels like an out - of - body experience . ”
But I was so unnerved that my bike spun out of control and I nearly slammed into the wall .
As I discovered on a three - day trip this year , the passage , which travels 132 miles from McKeesport , Pa. , to Cumberland , Md. , is part industrial history lesson , part nature excursion and part fun house , with thrilling and spooky moments : barely lighted corridors through mountainsides , whitecaps on rivers a hundred feet below and the lonely sound of a freight - train whistle .
Word is getting out that the trail is a world - class biking destination .
Linda Boxx , president of the Allegheny Trail Alliance , a coalition of seven organizations that oversee the project , said 10,000 to 15,000 people rode a long - distance trip along it last year .
The trail was built at the cost of $ 65 million after the rail tracks were abandoned in 1975 .

The days of the cardboard polling booth , the worn - out pencil and the ballot paper are numbered , according to Queensland 's Electoral Commissioner .
David Kerslake believes universal online voting is an inevitable initiative on the democratic horizon and argues that first cab off the rank should be voters with disabilities at the next state election .
Could long queues for polling booths soon be relegated to history ?
" With the necessary changes to the Electoral Act I would be confident that we could develop a system to provide internet and telephone voting options for people with disabilities - if not for the next state election then certainly for the election after that , " he said .
Mr Kerslake , who submitted his report on the 2009 state election to State Parliament last week , said online voting for the whole community was now a matter of " when " not " if " .
In a helicopter above the city on Friday , Stephen Wiltshire of London looked down at the streets and sprawl of New York .
He flew for 20 minutes .
Since then , working only from the memory of that sight , he has been sketching and drawing a mighty panorama of the city , rendering the city ’s 305 square miles along an arc of paper that is 19 feet long .
He is working publicly in a gallery at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn .
' I always memorize by helicopter , ' he said on Tuesday , pausing from detailing the corners of a street on the Brooklyn side of the Williamsburg Bridge .
Mr. Wiltshire sees and draws .
It is how he connects .
Until age 5 , he had never uttered a word .
One day , his kindergarten class at a school for autistic children in London went on a field trip .
When they came back , he spoke .
“ He said , ' Paper , ' - his sister , Annette Wiltshire , said .
' The teacher asked him to say it again .
He said it .
Then they asked him to say something else , and he said , ' Pen .
'
With pen and paper in hand , he drew what he had seen that day .
In time , a clever teacher taught him the alphabet by associating each letter with a place he had drawn ' a ' for Albert Hall , ' b ' for Buckingham Palace , and so on .
What did he use for 'z ' ?
Mr. Wiltshire looked puzzled .' Z ' that 's the same as zed , ' his sister interjected , pronouncing the letter the British way . ' Zed , ' Mr. Wiltshire said .
' That was the zoo .
' Now 35 , he has already drawn eight major cities after flyovers .
He has his own website and gallery .
By unpacking in exquisite detail the riches that he absorbs in a glimpse , Mr. Wiltshire has built a bridge to the world that had once been cut off to him .
The family was more concerned in those days with finding a school where he could learn to read and write .
Later , they wanted him to master the London subways , to cope with diversions or delays that might interrupt his fixed routines .
After the school entered his artwork in competitions , his talents began to get attention : he was featured in a BBC program , ' Fragments of Genius . '.
' The Early Show ' on CBS brought him to New York for his current project .
'That he has a gift makes no sense at all to Stephen , ' Ms. Wiltshire said .
' He knows that he draws very well , but he picks that up from other people he sees the warmth on their faces , they tell him how much they like his work , and that makes him very happy .
He loves the attention .
' The elements of New York that he had captured in the first four days included most of Manhattan , the Hudson shoreline of New Jersey , the George Washington and Verrazano - Narrows Bridges , Ellis Island , the bridges to Queens and Brooklyn .
' Section by section , ' he explained .
Ms. Wiltshire elaborated .
' He cuts the drawing into segments , then fills each one in , ' she said .
' We will all see the same thing , but we focus on what is of special interest .
For Stephen , it 's like a sponge where he absorbs everything but he does n't squeeze out the rest .
'He occasionally does a portraits of himself or of his sister , Mr. Wiltshire said .
But most of the images he creates are of structures , given life by his hand and eye .
As he worked on Tuesday afternoon , he often turned to glance at the people watching .
He gave a panoramic smile .

Eric Ruder reports from Washington on the National Equality March - - and the birth of a new civil rights movement for LGBT people in the U.S .
YOUNG AND old , gay and straight , people from across the country descended on Washington , D.C. , to demand full equality for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) people on October 11 .
They came by plane , train , bus and automobile -- from Albuquerque , N.M. , from Burlington , Vt. , from Chicago , from Texas , from Florida , from California and from a thousand points in between .
People started gathering in the morning at McPherson Square , buzzing with nervous anticipation about just how many would mobilize for the first national march for LGBT rights in a decade and a half .
By the time the march stepped off at noon , everyone knew that the crowd was large , but it did not become clear just how large until the front of the march headed west and then snaked back past the White House -- with tens of thousands still waiting in and around the square to start moving !
In all , some 200,000 people formed a river of humanity that flooded the blocks around the White House and the Capitol , filling the streets with rainbow flags , handmade signs and a festival - like atmosphere .
The turnout exceeded even the wildest expectations of march organizers .
Marching for LGBT rights at the National Equality March ( Eric Ruder | SW )
" I think that there are generations of younger activists and straight allies who over the last 15 years have been awakening to the need for them to speak out about LGBT equality , and so this march came at the right time , " said Urvashi Vaid , an LGBT activist and author .
It tapped into that energy .
A lot of people I 've met said that this is their first march on Washington , so I think that 's important .
Marches are about mobilizing the base , and the base of LGBT rights needs to go back around the country and work at the local level .
Each time we have had a national march like this , we have had an upsurge in grassroots activism at home .
" I think the turnout reflects a shift of attitude in the community itself , " said David McElhatton , a member of the march steering committee from San Francisco .
He added :
For a long time , we have relied on massive non-profits and lobbying organizations that are very much out of touch with the needs of this community and who this community is .
We are a vastly diverse group of people , and this was an entirely grassroots effort .
It began with a call for anyone in the country to organize to get out here .
My organization in San Francisco , One Struggle , One Fight , raised money for HIV - positive activists and transgender activists to get out here .
This march was spearheaded by people , not by corporations or overpowering organizations .
No one was shut out of this march .
Every possible effort was made to keep this march inclusive and diverse as the community itself to make sure that no one was shut out , to make sure that there was trans inclusion , and trans figures , which was very important to me personally .

PEOPLE OF all sorts came out for the march .
Alongside the many first - time marchers were veteran activists , families with children , groups of friends , veteran and active - duty troops , students from campus organizations , members of labor unions , immigrant rights activists , and people of every race , creed and color .
Together they stood , united around one simple message -- full equality for LGBT people in all matters governed by civil law .
Hundreds of students representing a new generation of LGBT activists carried the lead banner of the march , bursting with energy as they marched through the streets .
" Get up , get down , there 's a civil rights movement in this town ! " was one of the favorite chants that these students belted with all their might .
As one student from the University of Cincinnati who traveled to Washington , D.C. , for the march said :
We are here to demonstrate that this movement is strong .
There are countless people involved in the movement that are willing to come down here and demonstrate , support and fight for our rights .
We need to get our message across .
We need to repeal " do n't ask , do n't tell " [ DADT ] and the so - called Defense of Marriage Act [ DOMA ] .
We must enact the Employment Non-Discrimination Act [ ENDA ] .
" I think , given the economy , the most important demand is having rights in our workplace , " said Bridie Jurasevich , a student from Indiana .
" I think when it comes to parenting rights and equal adoption rights , marriage equality is crucial .
I just do n't understand why I do n't have this right .
I pay taxes .
I work .
I should have the same rights as everyone else . "
Frank Naso , one of the thousands who was participating for the first time in a big march , explained that it was his frustration with the pace of change that made him decide to come to Washington from New York City :
I started to get more politically active after realizing that Obama was not going to be able to deliver on some of the things he promised .
It made me realize that it 's not really the person but the system that needs to be changed .
That was the moment for me that made me feel like that I had to get up and do something .
This march makes me think of all the people who are n't here , that I 've lost , that would be here .
I feel like I 'm here for them , too .
So many of my friends died of AIDS in the early '90s .
We went through so much in the ' 90s - - not being able to visit friends in the hospital , not being considered family .
I feel like I am marching for them .
ONE OF the many topics that marchers discussed as they made their way through the streets was the speech delivered by Barack Obama at a fundraiser for the Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) the night before .
HRC promotes itself as the largest LGBT organization in the country , but many in the LGBT community were disappointed by HRC 's decision not to put its full weight behind the march , or even help to publicize it broadly .
Obama 's speech expressed his support for the full legislative agenda of the new LGBT movement , including the repeal of DADT and DOMA and the passage of ENDA .
But he did n't say anything about a timeline for achieving these goals .
There was a spectrum of opinion about the speech and what this means for the nascent LGBT movement .
" I thought it was a strong speech , " said Vaid .
She added :
I thought it was unequivocally in support .
He did n't set a timetable , which people are criticizing , and I think we should keep the pressure on the administration .
But they are clearly our friends , and he is clearly committed in a way that would be very hard not to follow through on .
I think people should turn their disappointment toward Congress and to governors and state legislatures .
People should turn their disappointment into political organizing back home to create the new majority that we 're going to need to sustain social justice in this country .
But for Katie Rodriguez , a Princeton student originally from San Antonio , Texas , Obama and the Democrats in Congress are playing political football with LGBT rights .
" We need to become more visible to the country , " said Rodriguez .
" And to Obama , we can not be silent .
We want equality .
Congress has other priorities right now , and I feel like Obama is a really smooth talker .
Maybe this march will help pressure him .
It 's good for him to see that we are not going to tolerate this .
People are getting more active . "
Related to the question of Obama 's posture toward LGBT demands is the stance of the rest of the Democrats in positions of power - - both in government and in the party -- and it 's clear that many continue to counsel " patience . "
Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , for example , predicted that Obama would succeed at repealing DADT at some point in the future .
" I think he will and he can , but it has to be done in the right way , which is to get a buy - in from the military , which I think is now possible , " Levin said .
But it 's disappointing when a Democratic " ally " is more cautious than such figures as retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey .
" There 's no question that it 's time to change the policy , " said McCaffrey .
" The key to it is n't buy - in from the military ; it 's for Congress to change the law .
They ought to do so , and I 'm confident that the military will move ahead on it . "
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) , the first openly gay member of Congress , was even more hostile , denouncing the marchers for not putting more energy into lobbying .
" The only thing they 're going to be putting pressure on is the grass , " said Frank .
For this reason , one of the more popular chants , especially among students , was " Barney Frank , fuck you ! "
Another issue , played up by the media in the days leading up to the march , was the " rift " in the movement between those who advocate a state - by - state approach to winning LGBT rights and those who favor a national strategy to demand full equality at the federal level .
" I hope we do n't wake up the day after Election Day and realize we could have won Maine if only so many resources were n't put toward the march , " Lynne Bowman , executive director of Equality Ohio , told the New York Times in the days leading up to the march .
Cleve Jones , who was a close collaborator of the late Harvey Milk and is one of the march organizers , addressed this debate at a press conference just before the march :
A year ago today , no one was talking about a national strategy to win federal equality , but now we are .
People need to look back to 1963 , when the great heroes of the historic civil rights movement were having exactly the same conversation that we are having today .
It was bitter and divisive and complicated , and it did not lend itself well to simple sound - bite rhetoric .
But the great heroes of that struggle came to the decision that while they were certainly going to continue fighting in places with names like Selma and Birmingham and Montgomery , they would have to set their sights on Washington , D.C.
When we look back on the extraordinary bitterness and division in this country at that time , what happened was that white America came to understand the appalling brutality of segregation .
The day before yesterday , I saw a couple pushing a baby stroller down the street , and they asked me , " Did we see you on Chris Matthews ? "
And I said yes .
They said , " We are a straight family from New Jersey , and we heard what you said and we went and packed and got in a car so that we could march with you today . "
There is a sea change happening in this country , and it is very similar to the civil rights movement , and I want to be conscious about not drawing too many parallels between the LGBT and the African American experience , but as far as strategy , the civil rights movement was spot on .
Of course , people are confused and concerned and also , let 's be frank , deeply invested -- and I use that word deliberately -- in pursuing this strategy .
In private , some will tell you that they have a 10 - 10 - 10 strategy .
Not many people hear this , but what they want is , before we go federal , get 10 states to approve marriage through a vote of the people ( which has never happened ) , 10 states to get marriage through court action , and get 10 states to get it through legislative action .
So they want 30 states to approve marriage equality before going to Congress , meanwhile how many states have passed state constitutional bans against marriage ?
32 .
So when you ask them privately how long will that take ?
They say 20 years , 25 years , 30 years .
That 's unacceptable .
RUSSELL REISH , who is 71 , and Albert Masse , who is 82 , have been together for more than three decades -- and they could n't agree more with Jones .
Masse carried a sign that read , " Together for 38 years and still waiting for the right to marry ! "
Explained Reish :
We were here in Washington back in 1987 and again in 1993 , and we have seen much progress from the fifties and sixties when we were out and growing up gay .
But we still need the right to marry and all these other rights .
Albert is sick and he does n't have too long , but I will not have any benefits as his partner .
So that 's what we want to see .
But we are so happy to see all the young people here who are going to carry on our work .
Reish 's sign explained that police had attacked the bar he was in in 1965 and left him bruised and bloodied .
" I was in a local gay bar in Los Angeles called Mansfield House , " said Reish .
" It was just a boring gay neighborhood bar .
But the cops came in full uniform and dragged all the patrons out , and I was selected to be beaten up instead of taken to jail , for which I was grateful .
Thank god that does n't happen any more .
" We live in Georgia , and we 've raised two daughters .
They 're actually my nieces but we raised them from the time they were 7 and 9 years old .
And we 're still their parents . "
" And now we have three grandchildren , " added Masse .
" The oldest girl moved to Georgia , so we followed so we could watch our grandson grow up , " Reish continued .
" We 're probably the only two gay people in the county we live in Georgia . "
Asked by a younger activist what a national , rather than a state - by - state , strategy would mean for the LGBT community of Georgia , Reish did n't hesitate for a moment : " If we waited for the state of Georgia to do anything , you will be dead !
It has to be done on a national , federal level .
There is no other way .
With Obama here and a Democratic - controlled Congress , I do n't see why we can't get it done . "
As marchers arrived at the Capitol , they pressed forward to hear speeches by a long list of activist leaders , political figures and celebrities , including march organizers Cleve Jones , David Mixner , Sherry Wolf and others ; gay rights activist Urvashi Vaid ; veteran civil rights leader Julian Bond ; Sex and the City 's Cynthia Nixon ; pop singer Lady Gaga ; spoken word poet and political activist Staceyann Chin ; labor leader Stuart Applebaum ; and many others .
Speakers addressed the broad range of issues facing LGBT people , including an end to the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , passage of ENDA and repeal of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act , which was signed by Bill Clinton and defined marriage as between a man and a woman .
Sherry Wolf , a march organizer and author of the recently released Sexuality and Socialism , summarized the sentiments of many who spoke :
The iTREN - 2030 project is all the more important because the resulting model set and integrated scenario will be used by the European Commission ( DG - Tren ) in preparing the white paper on transport policies due for 2010 .
After discussion with the European Parliament and approval by the council of Minister , the European Union will as a result have set out its new course for the future of transport in the period up to 2020 .
In this post I describe the iTREN - 2030 project and the different models , covering the POLES global energy supply and demand model in more detail , highlight the conclusions of the present integrated scenario , and give my reflection on the workshop commenting on some areas of improvement to augment the potential of the models .
On 21 October the final workshop was held in Brussels ( Belgium ) of the integrated transport and energy baseline until 2030 ( iTREN - 2030 ) modeling project .
At the workshop a final scenario was presented that incorporated likely transport and energy policies , and the effects on European transport of a continued global plateau in oil production up to 2030 .
The integrated scenario was generated by four energy and transport models that have been linked in iTREN - 2030 to increase the forecasting power of the transport policies of the European Commission .
The iTREN - 2030 project
The integrated transport and energy baseline until 2030 ( iTREN - 2030 ) project ran for 30 months starting May 2007 and ending October 2009 .
Funded by the 6th framework program of the European Commission the project aimed to extend the forecasting and assessment capabilities of TRANS - Tools , which is the EU transport network analysis model .
Including the potential to include new policy issues .
With the end goal of giving the European Commission the possibility to create coherent baselines wherein technology , transport , energy , environment and economic developments until 2030 are integrated .
The project was carried out by a consortium of seven institutes among which ISI ( Germany ) , NEA ( Netherlands ) , TRT ( Italy ) , TML ( Belgium ) , IWW ( Germany ) , IPTS ( SPAIN ) , TNO ( Netherlands ) .
In more detail the project entailed linking and improving four different models that already existed , thereby enabling a more integrated modeling exercise on transport and energy .
The advantage of linking these models is the creation of a much more detailed outlook .
Each model covers its own area ( transport network , energy supply , passenger flows , emissions etc. ) in much more details than the others do .
By linking them many more variables and feedbacks within the system can be taken into account .
The four models are
- TRANS - Tools ( PDF Description ) , the model mainly used by the European Commission which gives an overview of the European Transport Network covering passengers and freight and inter modal transport .
- TREMOVE ( PDF Description ) , a model that assesses the effects of different transport and environmental policies on the emissions of the transport sector in EU - 27 .
- POLES , ( PDF Description ) , a model that simulates long term energy supply and demand developments for different regions of the entire world including sources such as fossil fuels and renewable energy soures as well as energy types such as heat and liquid fuels .
- ASTRA , ( PDF Description ) , a system dynamics model that incorporates technology , employment and energy policy to analyse long - term consequences of European transport policies within the EU - 27 plus Norway and Switzerland .
An overview of the four models and how they were linked is given in figure 1 below .

Limits to understanding : transparency and accessibility of the models
To understand a scenario we need information on which assumptions , formulas and data have been used in its derivation .
In the best case detailed documentation is made available alongside a copy of the model itself .
Although all the models are accessible to the European Commission and the consortium , some of them are proprietary in case of iTREN - 2030 .
TREMOVE and TRANS - tools can be downloaded at no cost on the internet , but ASTRA and POLES are not available .
This creates boundaries in comparing the outcome of these models with other studies .
As a consequence most questions at the final workshop were related to understanding what the consortium did on many specific input levels such as how a ' breakthrough ' in electric cars had been implemented in the model .
The need for transparency was also brought up by the consortium as a recommendation by participants of previous workshops , and by participants in the final workshop .
Some effort was made by the iTREN - 2030 partners to increase input by organizing two additional workshops were participants were given the possibility to recommend input on specific terrains .
One of the outcomes of these additional workshops was the addition of economic crisis effects in the integrated scenario presented at the final workshop .
The POLES Energy Model
Since the Oil Drum is a blog about Energy and our future , and the POLES model covers the energy aspects of this modeling project , I highlight its core as far as information is available .
POLES was developed by the French research institute IIEPE - EPE together with French energy consultancy Enerdata and the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies of the European Commission ( IPTS ) .
It has seen several iterations and was used in the World Energy Technology 2050 outlook by the European Commission and the 2007 World Energy Council Policy Scenarios ( PDF ) .
The Poles model divides the world in 47 zones .
A total of 32 of these zones represent individual countries including the G7 countries , the European Union countries and BRIC countries .
The other countries are modeled as 18 homogeneous regions .
For example all of Africa except the northern countries are modeled as the region SSAF
Figure 2 - POLES country and region coverage , Source : iTREN - 2030 POLES documentation
The model employs a ' backward ' calculation from final energy demand to primary energy supply .
Starting with estimating final energy demand in different sectors including different Industries ( Steel , Chemical , Non-Metallic , other ) , Transport Modes ( Road , Rail , Air , Other ) , and RAS ( Residential , Service , Agriculture ) .
Separate calculations are made for 12 non -fossil energy technologies and 12 power generation technologies .
In the next step diffusion of new & renewable energy technologies is modeled and generation of these sources subtracted from final energy demand resulting in ' net final energy demand ' , subsequently electricity transformation in fossil fuel power plants is ' undone ' resulting in the needed primary fossil fuels to supply the remaining total fossil ) energy demand .
Imports and exports are incorporated to simulate trade flows of fossil fuels .

Oil and gas production is simulated by a discovery and reserve modeled using United States Geological Service ( USGS ) data from the World Petroleum Assessment 2000 .
Specifically :
- First the model estimates the cumulative amount of oil discovered as a function of the Ultimate Recoverable Resources ( revision of USGS numbers with discoveries and production ) .
Incorporating a recovery ratio that increases over time also depending on the price of the resource .
In the World Energy Technology Outlook 2050 upon which iTREN - 2030 was based the recovery rate for oil increased from 35 % today to 50 % in 2050 .
- Secondly remaining reserves are calculated as being equal to the difference between cumulative discoveries and cumulative production .
Using Rt+1 = Rt + DISt - Pt ( where R = reserves , DIS = discoveries , P = production , subscript t = year of account ) .
- Thirdly , the model calculates production for non-OPEC based on a Reserves - to - Production ratio decreasing over time and the calculated remaining reserves , and for OPEC based on the oil needed to balance the oil market ( OPEC total oil production = total oil demand - Non-OPEC total oil production ) .
The world oil price in the model is for the short - term based on the rate of capacity utilization in the OPEC gulf , and in the medium and long - term on the world R/P ratio ( including unconventional oil ) .
Unconventional oil comes into play at a certain price when it is deemed competitive versus conventional oil .
The price of gas is calculated in three different regional markets ( US , Europe and ? ) depending on demand , domestic production and supply capacity in each individual market .
The main driver in gas price determination is the variation in the Reserve - to - Production ratio in each market .

An overview of the Integrated Scenario
In the iTREN - 2030 an integrated scenario was made to show the effect of linking the various models .
It was explicitly mentioned by the consortium that it was not the goal of the project to create the best scenario possible .
This was a sub- objective from the main objective of linking and improving the models themselves .
Nevertheless it was an interesting scenario worthwhile to show to The Oil Drum readers .
The approach taken in the integrated scenario was to to incorporate likely future policies , with as policy drivers three factors influencing transport markets , namely climate policy , fossil fuel scarcity and new technologies .
Also a fast recovery scenario for the economic crisis was included where GDP growth would continue to normal by 2012 .
With respect to fossil fuel scarcity the project leader , Dr. Wolfgang Schade from the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems - and Innovation Research ( ISI ) , presented two scenarios , one from the World Energy Outlook 2006 of the International Energy Agency , and the other from the Energy Watch Group from 2007 .
He made the remark that supply constraints due to aging wells require +3 % of additional capacity per year while new discoveries have been limited .
This figure is almost certainly too low given that three sources have independently from each other concluded that annual average declines are around 4.5 % ( CERA 2007 , IEA 2008 , Hook et al. 2009 ) .
Given the wide divergence of opinions over the issue of oil scarcity it must have been difficult for the consortium to decide upon which oil production scenario to take .
In the iTREN - 2030 project a choice was made to keep oil production at a plateau from 2005 until 2030 , neither declining nor increasing .
Shown in figure 5 below .
Figure 5 - iTREN - 2030 slide on fossil fuel scarcity driver , Source : iTREN - 2030 final workshop presentation
As to new technologies the project focused on five developments : 1 ) Biofuels , 2 ) fuel efficiency , 3 ) available alternative technologies including hybrid vehicles , compressed natural gas vehicles ( CNG ) and LPG powered vehicles , 4 ) Battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles , 5 ) New transport means including electric bikes , electric scooters , and segways .
These developments were based on changes seen today that will accelerate .
Many European policies were incorporated .
For Transport these included transport pricing for trucks on interurban networks after 2020 , charging cars on interurban networks after 2025 , city tolls for peak pricing after 2025 , harmonization of fuel taxes , inclusion of air transport in the EU - ETS , liberalization of the railway system , CO2 regulation for cars ( 130 gCO2 / km in 2015 , 105 gCO2 / km in 2020 ) , CO2 regulation for light duty vehicles ( 170 gCO2 / km in 2015 , 150 gCO2 / km in 2020 ) , battery electric support leading to electric cars entering the market of city cars after 2012 , and electric light duty vehicles for urban delivery after 2015 , enforced implementation of CNG fueling stations , effective car labeling , regulation to use HDV low resistance tyres .
Also all large scale European infrastructure road and rail projects were included by using TRANS - tools .
For Energy the policies included , 20 % greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 20 % in 2020 against 1990 , 20 % renewable energy in the final energy mix until 2020 ( including 10 % biofuels ) , the measures in the energy efficiency action plan of the European Commission and the deployment of demo- power plants for Carbon Capture Sequestration .
Results of the Integrated Scenario
Population and GDP developments in the integrated scenario were first shown in the workshop .
Population and labour force developments , show a relatively stable population up to 2030 and a decline in the labor force by 5 % from 2010 to 2030 due to demographics as the number of retired people increases by 32 % , shown in figure 6 .
Figure 6 - iTREN - 2030 slide on population and labour force in the integrated scenario , Source : iTREN - 2030 final workshop presentation
As to GDP , assumptions were inserted that the current economic crisis will be V - shaped and that a fast recovery will occur .
In the integrated scenario the European Union is back to a constant growth pattern from 2012 to 2030 .
Growing at an average annual rate of 1.5 % in EU - 27 , shown in figure 7 .
The total effect as modeled here is a 6.3 % loss in GDP in 2010 versus a situation with continued growth from 2005 onwards , and a loss of 3.8 % in 2030 versus a no crisis scenario .
Figure 7 - iTREN - 2030 slide on GDP developments in the integrated scenario , Source : iTREN - 2030 final workshop presentation
Although maritime and air developments were also shown I focus here on road transport as most changes occurred in road transport in the integrated scenario .
The development of car fleets looked very promising under the assumptions used .
Due to the assumption that oil production remains stable until 2030 , oil price in the scenario rose to 90 euro per barrel and remained around that level until 2030 .
Combined with a stable GDP development this resulted in smooth technological developments .
A large increase in the efficiency of cars ( both diesel , gasoline as well as new technologies ) .
This made it possible for the car fleet to grow while oil usage declined .
An overall decline in oil consumption in transport ( mainly due to less oil usage in car transport ) of 0.1 % was noted .
The car fleet grows to 260 million in 2030 from around 205 million in 2005 as motorization takes off in Eastern Europe .
The growth was filled in by new technologies , however , and my guess is although this was not shown , displacement of oil usage from Western to Eastern Europe .
In total the integrated scenario shows a growth to 35 million compressed natural gas cars in 2030 , a take - off of electric cars to 25 million in 2030 , and the introduction of hydrogen vehicles by 2025 .
Also 3 million pure bio-ethanol cars would be on the road in 2030 The total number of Diesel and Gasoline cars declined from 200 million in 2008 to 190 million in 2030 .
And these cars ( purple and purplish blue in figure 8 ) also run up to a certain percentage of biofuels .
Light Duty Vehicles benefit also from high oil prices by increasing efficiency , and the take - off of electric vans and light trucks by 2018 resulting in 2 million of these vehicles by 2030 .
In total oil driven light duty vehicles increase from 20 million in 2008 to 21 million in 2030 .
Figure 8 - iTREN - 2030 slide on car and light vehicle developments in the integrated scenario , Source : iTREN - 2030 final workshop presentation
If these changes occur in the road sector it will lead to a significant decline in CO2 emissions in the overall European transport sector as shown in figure 9 .
Despite increases in total freight kilometers by 33.9 % or 1700 to 2450 billion tonne kilometer from 2010 to 2030 , and an increase by 25.7 % or 4400 to 5500 billion passenger kilometers from 2010 to 2030 in cars .
According to the iTREN - 2030 team the European Union is steering towards a trend - shift in emissions against a ' business as usual ' reference scenario shown in the light purple bar on top in figure 9 .

Conclusions from the iTREN - 2030 team
The iTREN - 2030 team concluded the workshop with several interesting conclusions here reproduced from the presentations :
About CO2 emissions :
- In the integrated scenario total CO2 emissions from transport decrease due to declining emissions from road transport .
- Rail CO2 emissions continue to increase but at a lower growth rate , and only Air transport CO2 emissions continue at relatively the same pace of growth .
About economic growth :
- Economic growth is expected to be lower than in the past ( less than 2 % versus more than 2 % before the economic crisis ) ,
- In a fast recovery scenario around 4 years is needed to achieve the pre-crisis economic level .
- The impact of the economic crisis provides additional time to solve problems and foster the break - in - trends .
- Dr. Wolfgang
Schade the project leader however put his doubts at whether this is such a realistic scenario by saying " This assumes that the financial crisis is solved - is it solved permanently ?
There are signs that we are building up the next bubble . "
About vehicle fleets :
- Savings achieved by increasing fuel efficiency of passenger cars compensates expenditures for road charges .
- Average CO2 emissions of the EU - 27 fleet until 2030 indicate that measure of the integrated scenario are not sufficient as only a level of 140 gram of CO2 per kilometer is reached in 2030 ( versus a policy goal of 105 g cO2 per kilometer in 2020 .
- Despite breakthroughs of battery technology , the potential of electric cars for long distances is supposed to be limited .
- Motorisation in EU - 12 ( Eastern Europe ) reaches the EU - 15 ( Western Europe ) level in 2030 .
Reflecting on transparency and modeling limitations
I conclude with some personal reflections on the final workshop and the models .
It was great to see many people from the European Commission ( DG - TREN ) and knowledgeable stakeholders being closely involved and openly reflecting on the process at the final workshop .
This type of approach , where models are constructed to aid policy makers , and policy makers and knowledgeable parties are involved in the process , is in my opinion a necessity to deal with the complex problems that we face .
I can only hope that such an approach will be more embedded in political decision making at the national level of my country , the Netherlands .
I do think that more room needs to be given in these type of workshops to limitations and uncertainties .
As in the end I did leave the workshop with a feeling that the modeling exercise did not properly addressed this .
Although the purpose of iTREN - 2030 was not to create the best possible scenario but to integrate the four models and show the possibilities of a scenario with likely policies , the integrated scenario did show the limitations that are inherent in the current model setup .
These can not be solved by simply altering some variables of the models , hence it is relevant in light of the main goal of iTREN - 2030 .
Specifically I here mention three areas of importance that from my point of view need to be addressed in the future .
1 ) POLES the energy supply part of iTREN - 2030 models energy supply from a neo-classical economic point of view .
Higher prices resulting in more reserves and a gradual shift from conventional to unconventional production .
Looking purely at reserves from a price perspective ignoring energy costs of production , and ignoring production flows constraints due to physical ( water , materials , labour force ) or political ( lack of market access , oil production cap policies in OPEC countries ) limitations .
The iTREN - 2030 project team wisely has steered around this limitation by imposing a scenario where oil production does not increase up to 2030 .
However this is only a partial solution .
Better supply modeling can be done by either creating a new model , or augmenting the power of POLES to forecast supply by integrating physical and political production factors , oil & gas industry cycles , and energy costs of production ( Energy Return on Energy Invested ) .
Also I think more feedback needs to be created in the POLES model although based on the limited information available on POLES this may be an incorrect perception .
2 ) Macro-economic effects of high oil prices appear to be incorporated in a limited fashion given that GDP growth continues in a smooth fashion until 2030 after the fast economic crisis recovery .
We know from several studies conducted independently that the United States economy is not able to bear oil prices much above 80 to 100 dollars per barrel .
At a global oil price of 90 euro 's per barrel until 2030 , or around 140 dollars per barrel , as endogenously determined in iTREN - 2030 , it becomes extremely unlikely that the global economy can continue to grow in a smooth pattern , and hence that the European Union economy continues to grow smoothly at around 2 % per year .
At the least a more shock like pattern will occur as the United States economy gets hammered by these high prices and this effect ripples through the global economy .
From my perception this effect will continue until a different country / economic bloc is able to replace the role of the United States in the world economy or until the rules / system of the economic game have changed significantly .
3 ) A more fundamental macro-economic question lies in the world situation on the relationship between our debt based economies and limits to energy production growth .
When assuming a limit to oil production growth to 2030 in the Integrated Scenario , will economies still be able to service the global debt bubble ?
Estimated by Hannes Kunz of IIER to be around 345 % of global GDP ( chart ) .
According to his needed estimates needed GDP growth in the world economy is 6.9 % to be able to create an average real return on investments of 2 % .
Under an oil constrained future scenario debt will become too big of a burden and the world economy will have to inflate or deflate .
Certainly smooth GDP growth is out of the question if the debt bubble bursts .
Finally , I wish the European Commission the best of wisdom in creating the white paper on transport .
An area that is of huge importance in my perception of an oil scarce world .

01:03 pm - The Atman Does Exist
The Atman is not a sense of identity .
It is not the ego .
It is not composed of thoughts .
The Atman is what we really are .
We have to use these words to speak , but in reality the Atman is not a person or an identity .
The Atman is a drop of the ocean of God , it is consciousness itself .
Just as many things appear on the surface of the mirror , without the mirror changing or becoming involved , so too the various lives of beings reflect in the clarity of the Atman .
What lives and dies is not the true Self , it is just a series of dreams .
The false self is an identity , an ego , a collaboration of thoughts .
The true self is not an identity , it is not composed of thoughts or ego .
Do not get confused with the word " self " .
The Atman is simply pure consciousness .
Just as many different movies are played on a cinema screen , without the screen itself being changed , so the Atman abides forever in its deathless state .
Just as the ocean and a drop of the ocean are not separate , so too Brahma and Atman are not separate .
Without the deathless , creative force of Brahma , the next moment could not come into being .
Buddha 's view on cause and effect is impossible .
In Buddha 's view , there is nothing that continues from one moment to the next .
The first moment of an apple must cease , to give rise to the second moment of an apple .
Since there is change , the first moment of the apple cannot remain .
This is Buddha 's view and it is the truth .
The problem arises here : if the first moment of the apple has ceased before the next moment arises , from where does the second moment of apple arise , since the first moment of apple has already ceased ?
If we believe the Buddha , we cannot say that the second moment of apple arose from consciousness , because the first moment of consciousness that perceived the first moment of apple has also ceased .
Absolutely everything that existed in that first moment has ceased , according to Buddha , so from where does everything in the second moment arise ?
Since everything has ceased , from where can everything arise again ?
So you see , this view of Buddha 's is ridiculous .
I have just proven the Buddha wrong !
AHA !
In reality , the knowing , the consciousness , the Atman , does not cease from moment to moment , but abides forever .
But " forever " is a misleading concept .
" Time " is just a creation of the thinking mind .
In reality there is only now .
So the Atman is not really abiding forever , it is just abiding here and now , which is all there is .
We are often taught that God created the world at the beginning of time , but our understanding of this is not correct .
God continues to create everything right now , because time is not real .
There is only now , so that is when God creates existence .
Right now is the beginning , middle , and end of time .
Of course , from the point of view of object coming and going , we can measure change and call it time , but from the point of view of the Atman , there is no change , so there is no time .
It is timeless .
Perhaps now you are angry and ready to defend your Buddhist views , but please reflect on this poem first by Rumi , which itself can trigger the enlightenment process :
My Soul is from Elsewhere
All day I think about it ,
then at night I say it .
Where did I come from , and
What am I supposed to be doing ?
My soul is from elsewhere ,
I ’m sure of that ,
and I intend to end up there .
This drunkenness began in some other tavern .
When I get back around to that place ,
I will be completely sober .
I ’m like a bird from another continent ,
sitting in this aviary .
The day is coming when I fly off ,
but who is it now in my ear ,
who hears my voice ?
Who says words with my mouth ?
Who looks out with my eyes ?
Rumi

Gun Case Could Broaden Legal Basis for Wide Range of Rights
Created : October 02 , 2009 16:38 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Supreme Court ( WDCpix )
In announcing on Wednesday that it would review a case that asks whether individuals have a fundamental right to bear arms under the U.S. Constitution , the Supreme Court did more than just step into a heated debate over gun control .
Although McDonald v. City of Chicago is on its face about Chicago ’s ban on handguns , legal experts say it also raises a far broader question of constitutional interpretation that bears on how and whether the Constitution protects a wide range of rights from state infringement .
A finding that the Second Amendment protects individuals ’ right to own a gun could therefore have the unexpected outcome of also providing more solid ground for recognition of the right to abortion , to sexual privacy , to gay marriage , and to a wide variety of other rights that conservative justices on the court and “ originalist ” constitutional scholars have long opposed .
The issue in the Chicago case , as defined in the petition to the court , is “ [ w ] hether the Second Amendment is incorporated into the Due Process Clause or the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment so as to be applicable to the States , thereby invalidating ordinances prohibiting possession of handguns in the home . ”
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
The court ’s decision to take the case and consider whether the Second Amendment might be “ incorporated ” – applicable to the states – by the “ privileges or immunities clause ” of the Fourteenth Amendment suggests that the court is open to reconsidering a long line of cases dating back to 1873 that read that clause narrowly and thereby restricted the ability of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect fundamental rights .
Although the Supreme Court has acknowledged many rights under the Fourteenth Amendment since then , it has done so based on the more tenuous argument that they ’re protected by the more limited “ due process ” clause , which says that the State shall not “ deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ” .
Lawyers and judges have at times resorted to complicated legal gymnastics to make the argument that a newly - recognized right falls under “ substantive due process . ”
That argument has left those rights vulnerable to an increasingly aggressive attack by conservatives who claim judges are engaging in “ judicial activism ” by recognizing rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution .
The “ privileges and immunities clause ” , which states that “ No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ” has the potential to be read much more broadly .
The Privileges or Immunities Clause “ was written to forbid state and local governments from trampling on the substantive fundamental rights of all Americans , thus securing the ‘ unalienable rights ’ to which the Declaration referred , ” argues David Gans , Director of the Constitutional Accountability Center ’s Human Rights , Civil Rights & Citizenship Program in a post at Balkinization .
Scholars from across the political spectrum appear to agree with him , and many joined in a brief submitted to the court in this case urging the justices to reverse the court ’s longstanding precedent .
In a “ friend - of - the - court ” brief drafted by the Constitutional Accountability Center , six constitutional law professors urged the Supreme Court to review the Chicago case and restore the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment , as protecting all “ privileges and immunities ” not enumerated in the Constitution .
“ In discussing the fundamental rights of citizenship , the framers regularly included a long list of fundamental rights – such as the right of access to the courts , the right to freedom of movement , the right to bodily integrity , and the right to have a family and direct the upbringing of one ’s children – that have no obvious textual basis in the Bill of Rights , ” says the brief .
“ These were core rights of personal liberty and personal security that belong to ‘ citizens of all free governments ; ’ it did not matter that they were not enumerated elsewhere in the Constitution . ”
The libertarian Cato Institute and Institute for Justice similarly wrote in an amicus brief to the court : “ the issue of the Second Amendment ’s ‘ incorporation ’ implicates not only the right to keep and bear arms – important enough by itself – but the larger debate over the origin , nature , and extent of all our natural rights and how the Constitution protects them . ”
While the language of the privileges and immunities clause seems clear , shortly after its adoption , in 1873 , in a set of cases known as the Slaughterhouse Cases ( affirming Louisiana ’s right to regulate slaughterhouses ) , the Supreme Court narrowly read the Fourteenth Amendment to protect only “ privileges or immunities ” conferred by federal citizenship , not by state citizenship .
It specifically did not limit the state ’s police powers , the court ruled .
The effect of that ruling was to gut the “ privileges or immunities ” clause , scholars have argued , and it ’s led to serious questions and confusion over when and how states can regulate rights that are thought to be fundamental but are neither specifically conferred by the federal government nor mentioned in the constitution — often called “ unenumerated ” rights .
Whether the constitution protects such unenumerated rights remains one of the most hotly - debated matters of constitutional interpretation , and has sharply divided the conservative and liberal wings on the court .
Justice Antonin Scalia , for example , has long criticized the notion that rights such as the right to an abortion or to privacy deserves protection by the U.S. Constitution .
Although the Supreme Court has recognized some of these rights , based on its interpretation of the “ due process clause ” of the 14th Amendment , those cases have been increasingly attacked by the conservative members of the court , and by conservative scholars , as not being grounded in the original text of the Constitution .
“ You have this assault on Roe [ v. Wade ] from the Right , claims of judicial activism from the right , saying judges should n’t be doing this , ” explained Doug Kendall , President of the Constitutional Accountability Center .
“ There ’s been an aggressive assault on the entire idea that there is incorporation and that judges should have a role in protecting liberties , ” said Kendall , who organized the law professors ’ submission of their amicus brief .
“ That ’s fueled the conservative rise over the last 30 years in the courts . ”
In response , “ there ’s been a flowering of scholarship that goes back to the original debates and makes an overwhelming , compelling case for the proposition that the privileges or immunities clause was intended to protect a robust set of human and civil rights . ”
Constitutional scholars ranging from Akhil Reed Amar , a liberal law professor at Yale Law School , to Randy Barnett , a conservative libertarian at Georgetown University Law School , have argued in books and articles that the “ privileges or immunities clause ” means what it says – that the states cannot infringe on a broad range of unenumerated civil rights of citizens .
As the constitutional law professors write in their brief to the Supreme Court , “ the Slaughterhouse cases read the Privileges or Immunities clause so narrowly as to essentially read it out of the Amendment , ” but as Amar wrote in a 2001 Yale Law Review article the brief cites : “ [ v ] irtually no serious modern scholar – left , right and center – thinks that this is a plausible reading of the Amendment . ”
Of course , if the court does decide to breathe new life into the privileges or immunities clause , it will ignite a new debate about what those rights are .
But their defenders argue those rights are vast .
The Ninth Amendment specifically says that “ [t ] he enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . ”
The privileges and immunities clause of the 14th Amendment , the constitutional scholars argue in their brief , “ is the textual hook in the Fourteenth Amendment for protection of unenumerated fundamental rights , as well those substantive fundamental rights articulated in the Bill of Rights , including the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms . ”
The law professors quote the 1866 report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction , which interpreted the Privileges or Immunities Clause to “ afford broad protections to substantive liberty , encompassing all ‘ fundamental ’ rights enjoyed by ‘ citizens of all free Governments ’ : ‘ protection by the government , the enjoyment of life and liberty , with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind , and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety , subject nevertheless to such restraints as the Government may justly prescribe for the general good of the whole . ’“
Because the Fourteenth Amendment was focused on giving newly freed slaves the rights of citizens , says Kendall , it focused on protecting “ the rights of heart and home .
Your ability to control your family , your children ’s education , reproductive choice and sexual intimacy . ”
Not that everyone agrees with that view .
A group of legal historians , for instance , filed a brief with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the McDonald case arguing that Congress ’s intent in passing the Fourteenth Amendment was unclear .
But until now , the Supreme Court has never agreed to hear a case that directly raised this issue .
Even if the court wants to find that the Second Amendment ’s right to bear arms applies to the states , it might still sidestep the broader issue raised by this case and avoid overturning more than a hundred years ’ worth of precedent .
Liberals have invoked the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to argue for other fundamental rights , and the court could find the right to bear arms is similarly protected by the due process clause , rather than by the privileges and immunities clause .
But even that would be a victory of sort for progressives , Kendall said .
“ It would force Justice Scalia to utilize substantive due process ” — an idea he has long criticized in the context of abortion and other controversial rights – “ to achieve the results he wants in the guns case , ” said Kendall .
“ As long as the court finds incorporation ” — that the Bill of Rights applies against the states — “ it will provide a basis for undercutting Justice Scalia ’s argument against it . ”
For some conservatives , then , winning the right to carry a gun could turn out to by a Pyrrhic victory .

predatory bait - and - switch merchants .
They 're also litigious bullies .

Ben Stein ’s paymasters Adaptive Marketing , the owners of freescore.com , are n’t just predatory bait - and - switch merchants .
They ’re also litigious bullies .
An anonymous blogger , going by the name “ flâneur de fraude ” , added a lot of corporate information to my Ben Stein post , mostly about Adaptive Marketing ’s owner , Vertrue Inc .
It was interesting stuff , and I linked to it , and that seemed to be the end of that .
Certainly no one at Adaptive or Vertrue ever tried to get in touch with me or with Flâneur .
Then , out of the blue , Adaptive filed a lawsuit in Connecticut , of all places , saying that the allegation that they were running a predatory bait - and - switch campaign was actionable on the the grounds of “ defamation , trade libel , and tortious interference with contractual relations and business expectancies ” .
I ’ve uploaded a copy of the suit here .
There ’s lots of stuff around it , but the complaint itself is only three pages long , and does n’t even allege that anything Flâneur wrote was false .
The really weird thing about the lawsuit , however , was the defendant : not Reuters , not Flâneur , but Yahoo .
The suit was n’t a libel suit at all , you see : it was just a way of trying to get Flâneur ’s real name out of Yahoo .
( She uses an email address at yahoo.com . )
When Yahoo did n’t turn up to the court hearing 2,576 miles away from its headquarters , the Connecticut Superior Court found in favor of Adaptive , and said that Yahoo would have to turn up in court on September 21 , presumptively to reveal Flâneur ’s identity .
At that point , Flâneur sprung into action , and got the Public Citizen Litigation Group involved .
They have now filed a monster 43 - page brief with the Connecticut court , and after reading it one has difficulty imagining that any judge will compel Yahoo to unmask Flâneur .
Public Citizen ’s press release is here , and the headline sums it up : the blogger who criticized freescore.com , it says , has the right to remain anonymous .
Adaptive has never complained to Flâneur , to me , or to anybody else , as far as I can tell , about any of our characterizations of their business .
They never asked for any of our blog entries to be updated or edited , and they were conspicuous by their absence during the brouhaha over Ben Stein .
If they had any problem with the blog entries , that was the time to say so — not now , when the whole episode is already half - forgotten .
Instead , knowing that Flâneur values her anonymity , they decided to try to unmask her in Connecticut court .
I hope and trust that now , with the intervention of Public Citizen , they will fail miserably .
This could hardly be a better time for this to be making the rounds again on the eve of the marriage equality vote in Maine .
During hearings on gay marriage last April , Philip Spooner , an 86 - year - old D - Day veteran gave the following testimony :
“ The woman at my polling place asked me do I believe in equality for gay and lesbian people .
I was pretty surprised to be asked a question like that .
It made no sense to me .
Finally I asked her : what do you think I fought for in Omaha Beach ? ”

A Florida man was released from custody on Thursday after spending 26 years in prison for a rape and murder his lawyer says he did n't commit .
Anthony Caravella was ordered released after a private laboratory test revealed someone else 's DNA at the crime scene .
Although it was once considered a rare and remarkable event , a growing number of defendants are being ordered freed from prison as DNA tests continue to uncover evidence of false confessions , shoddy police work , and questionable prosecution tactics .
Mr. Caravella 's release on Thursday is conditional , pending further investigation .
If the release order becomes permanent he will be the 243rd person freed by DNA evidence nationwide , the 11th in Florida , and the fourth in Broward County .
Seth Miller , executive director of the Innocence Project of Florida , says despite the proven success of such efforts it is becoming increasingly difficult for defense lawyers to pursue DNA testing .
" Across the state of Florida the state is opposing DNA testing more often on the front end , rather than taking a wait and see approach , " Mr. Miller says .
" Nobody likes to admit they are wrong , " he says .
Prosecutors in the Caravella case have cooperated with defense lawyers in an apparent effort to uncover the truth .
Mr. Caravella was 15 years old in 1983 when detectives questioned him in connection with the murder of Ada Jankowski in nearby Miramar , Fla .
Caravella has an IQ of 67 and is considered mentally retarded .
His lawyer , Chief Assistant Public Defender Diane Cuddihy , said in a court motion that Caravella was threatened , beaten , pushed , and slapped by police .
He gave police four taped statements and one oral statement .
He eventually confessed to the rape and murder and was sentenced to life in prison .
Ms. Cuddihy said the confession was based on improper coercive interrogations that produced unreliable and false admissions by her client .
She said detectives asked leading questions .
She said even with leading questions , Caravella was unable to give verifying details of the murder and rape that matched crime scene evidence known to the detectives .
The public defender hired a private laboratory to re-test DNA evidence gathered in the case .
The results showed someone other than Caravella raped Ms. Jankowski during the murder - rape .
In addition , Cuddihy accused police and prosecutors of withholding a key piece of evidence from defense lawyers during Caravella 's trial .
The lawyer said the state failed to turn over to defense lawyers an audio tape of a phone conversation between a police detective in the Jankowski case and a man who said he had killed Jankowski with Caravella .
" The audio tape , although delivered and received by the state attorney , was never disclosed to the defendant or his counsel , " Cuddihy says in a court filing .
" The newly discovered DNA evidence proves that the defendant did not commit the sexual battery and murder , " she writes .
" The hidden audio - tape further undermines the reliability of the verdict . "
Miller notes that false confessions contributed to a wrongful conviction in about 25 percent of cases where DNA evidence resulted in a defendant 's release .
Frequently such confessions result from a combination of coercive interrogation tactics used against a person with mental retardation , he says .

One of the anatomical features that sets humans apart from other living primates is the shape of our pelvis .
The shift from a quadrupedal aboreal lifestyle to habitually walking on two legs requires a substantial reconfiguration of the hip region .
The 4.4 million year old Ardipithecus ramidus fossil remains give us a glimpse of what the one of the earliest members of the hominin lineage looked like .
While the feet of Ar. ramidus show that it was still adapted to life in the trees , the pelvis shows significant adaptations to walking upright on two legs .
The gluteus maximus , which is a relatively minor muscle in quadrupeds has been reconfigured into the largest muscle in humans , in order to stabilize the pelvis and trunk in an upright position .
The derived nature of the ilium of Ar. ramidus suggests that the enlargement of the gluteal maximus had already begun .
The craniocaudal height of the pelvis is also reduced , which would have lowered the relatively long trunk 's centre of mass .
This would have allowed for more stable bipedal locomotion .
However , the ischium is quite primitive compared to the ilia , likely to accommodate the large hindlimb musculature required for tree climbing .
The two best preserved australopithicine pelves , AL 288 - 1 and Sts 14 , both have short ischia , like those seen in modern humans .
The preserved portion of the ischial ramus in Ar. ramidus is significantly larger than that found in any of the Australopithecines .
A long ischium creates a greater moment arm suggesting that Ar. ramidus had relatively powerful hamstrings , a trait that is common in tree - dwelling primates .
The configuration of the ARA - VP - 6/500 pelvis suggests that lower lumbars were probably posteriorly positioned , allowing for lordosis of the spine .
A reduction in iliac height would have further facilitated lordosis .
Lordosis positions the spine to a more forward position , so that it directly overlies the hips during erect posture .
Lower spinal lordosis would have allowed the full extension of the hips and knee during extended bipedal locomotion .
Ar. ramidus was quite capable of bipedal locomotion , as attested to by the morphology of its pelvis and foot .
However , its large thigh muscles and its prehensile big toe show that it was still very much adapted to arboreal life .
Ar. ramidus shares arboreal adaptations that were probably present in the human - chimp last common ancestor , as well as bipedal adaptations that are so characteristic of hominins .
Ar. ramidus appears to have been an arboreal ape with bipedal adaptations , rather than a biped with arboreal adaptations .
It is not until almost half - a- million years later , with the arrival of Australopithecus afarensis , that we find a truly habitual bipedal hominin .
Mills ' Constant
Mills ' theorem states that there exists a real constant such that is prime for all positive integers ( Mills 1947 ) .
While for each value of , there are uncountably many possible values of such that is prime for all positive integers ( Caldwell and Cheng 2005 ) , it is possible to define Mills ' constant as the least such that
is prime for all positive integers , giving a value of
( OEIS A051021 ) .
is therefore given by the next prime after , and the values of are known as Mills ' primes ( Caldwell and Cheng 2005 ) .
Caldwell and Cheng ( 2005 ) computed more than 6850 digits of assuming the truth of the Riemann hypothesis .
Proof of primality of the 13 Mills prime in Jul. 2013 means that approximately digits are now known .

I was watching an episode of Star Trek : Next Generation the other day .
" Deja Q " involved an omniscient alien that had been kicked out of the Q Continuum , a guild for the all - powerful beings of his race .
The Continuum was punishing Q for being naughty , and his punishment was to be confined to a physical body for a period of time .
Q chose to take the form of a human being on the Enterprise .
He had gone from an all - powerful and immortal entity to a puny human .
He needed to be consoled .
An obliging crew member took Q to 10 - Forward , a crew lounge .
At the bar the crew member told Q that he could have anything he desired .
Q , being new to his human form , pimples , desires and all , asked , " How do I know what to desire ? "
That got me to thinking about one of my favourite videos .
I think it was on America 's Funniest Home Videos ( aging self now ) .
In it a small boy unwrapped a large present with great gusto .
He ripped the decorative paper off revealing plain cardboard beneath , then stepped back and yelled , " A box !
A box ! "
He jumped up and down joyously in response to this amazing gift .
Like Q , he did n't know what to desire .
Witnesses to the child 's open - minded reaction would chuckle , then gently ( or not so gently ) , show the child that he is suppose to desire the object IN the box , not the box itself .
Indeed , the box will quickly be shuffled out of the living room and into the recycling , its destiny fulfilled .
The video was only a few seconds long , so it did not show the boy 's reaction afterward .
But I could just picture him clutching some unimaginative , garishly coloured plastic toy while his time machine , castle turret , go cart , and tollbooth disguised as a cardboard box was carried off to the garbage .
He is learning what to desire .
We are trained what to desire by our culture and its agents , including parents and friends .
In addition to such forces , and perhaps dwarfing such forces , is the global advertising business .
It spends about half a trillion dollars a year training you in what to desire .
By comparison , total global government spending on education is about 2 trillion dollars
That $ 500 000 000 000 advertising budget is spent to train us to desire what is most profitable .
Such desires will not include clean air and water .
Or love , generosity , cooperation , independence , self - reliance , or " do it yourself " .
Then we have to add in money spent on public relations .
The Public Relations Society of America reports : I am questioning what I desire , and why I desire it .
I am questioning who gains from the fulfillment of my desires .
I want to find value in the box , rather than the expensive , shiny , soon - to - be - ignored bauble inside .
Let 's climb into that cardboard box and use our imaginations to whisk us off to the world that we desire , rather than some slick , fake world that someone is trying to sell us .

The attorney general was under intense pressure tonight to order a wider series of police investigations into British complicity in torture after one of the world 's leading human rights organisations said there was clear evidence of the UK government 's involvement in the torture of its own citizens .
After an investigation spanning more than a year , Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) today condemned Britain 's role in the torture of terror suspects detained in Pakistan as cruel , counter - productive and in clear breach of international law .
Critically , a report published today by HRW – entitled Cruel Britannia : British Complicity in the Torture and Ill - treatment of Terror Suspects – draws upon corroborative evidence received from the Pakistani torturers themselves .
Researchers at the New York - based NGO spoke to Pakistani intelligence agents directly involved in the torture who say their British counterparts knew they were mistreating British terrorism suspects .
These agents said British officials were " breathing down their necks for information " while they were torturing a medical student from London , and that British intelligence officers were " grateful " they were " using all means possible " to extract information from a man from Luton being beaten , whipped , deprived of sleep and threatened with an electric drill .
" UK complicity is clear , " the report says , adding that it had put the government in a " legally , morally and politically invidious position " .
The attorney general , Lady Scotland , has already asked Scotland Yard to investigate two alleged cases of British complicity in torture , one involving Binyam Mohamed , a British resident tortured in Pakistan and Morocco , and a second involving an unnamed MI6 officer and an alleged victim not identified .
William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , said it was vital that Scotland be asked to examine all cases where there is credible evidence of British complicity .
" We believe that any credible allegations of UK complicity in torture should be referred to the attorney general to establish whether police investigation is necessary , " he said .
" The prime minister made a commitment to do just that .
It is up to the government now to say what it will do in light of the allegations contained in the report . "
The former shadow home secretary David Davis said the report was " astonishing " , in that it " destroys the last remnants of any defence the government might have " .
He called on the government to hold an independent judicial inquiry .
HRW added to the growing number of calls for an inquiry into Britain 's role in the torture .
Among those issuing demands are parliament 's joint committee on human rights , the Liberal Democrats , Amnesty International , and the former director of public prosecutions Sir Ken Macdonald .
Lord Carlile , the government 's independent reviewer of counterterrorism legislation , Lord Guthrie , a former chief of defence staff , and Lord King of Bridgwater , a former Conservative defence and Northern Ireland secretary , have also called for an inquiry .
HRW pointed out todaythat the government may have little choice but to investigate British complicity , not only because a failure to do so is threatening to undermine its core values , but because it is a requirement of international law .
" The convention against torture requires states to reinforce the prohibition against torture through legislative , administrative , judicial and other measures , " the report says .
Privately the Conservatives are aware that they may inherit this problem if they win the next election .
Asked todaywhether the government 's repeated insistence that it does not condone , encourage or solicit torture was any longer credible , a Foreign Office spokesperson replied with the prepared statement : " There is no truth in the more serious suggestion that it is our policy to collude in , solicit , or even directly participate in abuses of prisoners . "
Human Rights
Watch had not suggested any direct British participation in torture .
The Guardian reported this year that an official government policy , devised to govern British intelligence officers while interrogating people held overseas , resulted in people being tortured , and that Tony Blair , when prime minister , was aware of the existence of this policy .
The Guardian has repeatedly asked Blair about any role he played in approving the policy , whether he knew that it led to people being tortured , whether he personally authorised interrogations that took place in Guantánamo and Afghanistan as well as Pakistan , and whether he made any effort to change the policy .
Blair 's spokesman responded by saying : " It is completely untrue that Mr Blair has ever authorised the use of torture .
He is opposed to it in all circumstances .
Neither has he ever been complicit in the use of torture . "
When the Guardian pointed out to Blair that it had not suggested that he had authorised the use of torture – as opposed to asking him whether he had authorised a policy that led to people being tortured – and that his spokesman had not answered the questions that were asked , his spokesman replied : " Tony Blair does not condone torture , has never authorised it nor colluded in it .
He continues to think our security services have done and continue to do a crucial and very good job . "

Nick Holland ( nick@ ) has submitted a mail to the misc@ mailinglist to point out that sales of the OpenBSD CD sets have been dropping rapidly this release .
This note is a worthwhile read so please go get a cup of your favourite drink and dedicate a minute to reading this - it is important .

What makes OpenBSD unique ?
Everyone 's got their own list , but here 's mine : * Good work is unacceptable , great work is expected .
* Quality is the # 1 goal , it takes a back seat to NOTHING else .
* Freedom for the users to use OpenBSD without question and without lawyers having to be involved , again without compromise .
* Strong leadership .
Not a " core team " , or an elected committee that blows in the wind of public opinion , but one person who sets direction and policy for the project .
You may not always agree with Theo , but you never wonder where he stands on an issue , or what direction the project will go .
* Commitment to doing it right in one way , not twenty different ways ( " pick one , maybe you get lucky " ) .
* Refusal to accept the damned " all programs have bugs " chant as an excuse for making crap *
No fear of retaining things that work , and trashing things that are broke or inferior to newer ( or older ! ) alternatives .
* The " Just Works " philosophy .
Please read on for the rest of Nick 's mail :
But ... a project like OpenBSD does n't just run on volunteer effort , it takes real money .
Hardware , infrastructure , Internet services , and if you are going to have ONE PERSON in charge , you need to keep them focused on the project , not " in their spare time " , and give them the money to live in reasonable comfort .
I just had a talk with Theo , and he shared some numbers with me .
There 's a digit missing from the current CD pre-orders from where we were hoping to be now .
There 's a trailing zero missing from what we 'd really like to have .
Long ago , while waiting for customers to hand me money , my first boss told me , " The hardest thing to do , but the most important , is to ask for the sale " .
I 've never been very good at that , but here it is ...
People , it is time to get your browsers over to http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html and start running some money into the project .
Do you use OpenBSD for fun ?

Do you use OpenBSD for work ?
Contribute .
Does OpenBSD allow you to worry about the problem you are trying to solve rather rather than the tools ?
Contribute .
Do you wish your employer used the OpenBSD quality standard in your work ?

Does your employer use OpenBSD ?
Ask them to contribute ( after you do , of course ) .
Do you bundle OpenBSD or subprojects like OpenSSH into your product ?
Contribute big !
( you wo n't , you rarely do , but hey , I 'll ask anyway )
Do you find yourself wondering why so few take computer software quality seriously ?
Contribute !
CDs are our favorite way to get contributions .
The price is well within what the average person can easily pay for , they are a lot more educational than a month of cable TV ( and maybe even more fun ) .
Sure , the CD itself is not something everyone needs anymore , but it is about much more than the data recorded on it .
It is the mark of being an active OpenBSD supporter , and it provides a nice , neat count of " this many people care " .
Do n't get me wrong ,
Theo likes big cash contributions , too , but ( ok , my life flashes before my eyes every time I try to put words in Theo 's mouth ) while a $ 10000 donation from BIGCORP Inc. , is nice , it is probably more satisfying to see two hundred $ 50 contributions from private people and small businesses who appreciate and put a value not only the work OpenBSD does , but the KIND of work , the " Quality and Freedom Second to NOTHING " philosophy .
Do n't wait and hope for a big company to speak for you , speak your thanks directly for the work and effort that goes into OpenBSD by buying a CD set .
I 'm going to answer a question that comes up periodically : " What about T - shirts and mugs and ...? "
Well , those are profit points , too , but CDs are dirt cheap to make , they store easily , and one size fits all .
T - shirts have a higher manufacturing cost , take up more space , and must be stocked in multiple sizes , all of which must be kept accessible .
Certainly , buy a t - shirt , buy a mug , poster , whatever .. but buy a CD set , too .
Thanks to those that contribute money and buy CDs .
Thanks to the OpenBSD team , I can't tell you what an honor it is to work ( in my small way ) with some of the worlds best programmers and software DESIGNERS .
Thanks to Theo de Raadt for the years of showing that it IS possible to hold one 's ideals up high and proud , never compromise them , and never give in , in spite of the pressures from those that will trade their ideals for a little temporary " expediency " .
And thanks to you for reading my rant .
Nick .
Undeadly urges you to do what you can to help OpenBSD .
Get a CD set , tell your friend to buy a t - shirt or make your company donate to OpenBSD .
Be creative !
If you managed to make your company or organization donate a large sum , please write a comment and tell the rest of us how you did it .
OTTAWA–A political fundraiser for Natural Resources Minister Lisa Raitt was coordinated out of the office of the president of the Toronto Port Authority , a federal agency Raitt once headed , the Toronto Star has learned .
Critics say it is just further proof the port authority has been supplanted by Tory faithful and has become little more than a partisan arm of the Conservative government , but a port authority official says it was all a simple transgression .
Janet MacDonald , executive assistant to acting port authority president and CEO Alan Paul and who also served Raitt when she held the job , sent out invitations on port authority email inviting people to attend the Sept. 24 , $ 250 - a- head fundraiser at a downtown Toronto restaurant .
" Hope you are well .
Would you please let me know if you plan on donating / purchasing ticket so I can keep tally and inform organizer of event , " MacDonald said in the invitation .
MacDonald refused to talk to the Star .
An attachment to the email asked interested supporters to RSVP registered lobbyist Michael McSweeney , vice - president industry affairs of the Cement Association of Canada .
It included the association 's fax number and McSweeney 's personal email .
" I would like to pretend I am surprised , but the Toronto Port Authority 's accountability and credibility and ethics have been a constant problem , " said Toronto City Councillor Adam Vaughan .
" That they would get involved in this kind of partisan politics ... is completely consistent with the atrocious record they have with corporate governance and accountability , " he said .
The controversial fundraiser came to the attention of Liberal MP Paul Szabo , chair of the parliamentary ethics committee , who felt obliged to let Paul know the port authority was on thin ice .
" It would appear that using the resources of a federal authority to promote and support a political party or an MP is not only inappropriate but likely contrary to your rules guiding employee conduct , not to mention the potential for contraventions of the Canada Elections Act , " the Mississauga South MP said in a Sept. 22 email .
In a return email the following day , Paul said the port authority took the matter " seriously " and it " should not have occurred . "
" The email was not sent on behalf of the Toronto Port Authority and was not an authorized use of the Toronto Port Authority system .
The TPA 's Information Technology Policy states that unauthorized use is prohibited , " Paul said in the email , a copy of which he also sent the Star .
Paul told Szabo all employees were reminded of the policy , but he refused to answer questions from the Star about when he first learned of MacDonald 's emails , or if any disciplinary action was taken against the veteran employee .
Szabo said later " it was the blatant use of the resources of a federal authority . "
" There is no doubt in my mind this was a targeted event that was going to utilize the database of the port authority .
...
It is so improper that it is not even debatable use of information , " he said , adding he 's still considering having the matter referred to federal ethics commissioner Mary Dawson .
Transport Minister John Baird said he was assured by the arm 's - length agency that it would n't happen again .
Raitt , who was named to cabinet in January , has been involved in controversy before .
She privately criticized the parliamentary skills of Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and called the shortage of medical isotopes a " sexy " issue .
Raitt said through a spokesperson she was too busy to be interviewed .
" The minister has been advised that the error was an isolated occurrence and has received assurances that such incidents will not occur in the future , " said an email from Raitt 's office .
New Democrat MP Olivia Chow ( Trinity - Spadina ) said it is difficult to believe it wo n't happen again when this " rogue agency " has been stacked with Conservative " cronies . "
" I believe the entire board should be fired and the Toronto Port Authority should be given back to the citizens of Toronto ... because the Conservatives see the port authority as a trough for them where they can either flex their political muscles or fundraise , " Chow said .

If she can successfully demonstrate her skills in this controlled experiment at the South Point Hotel Casino and Spa , she 'll receive $ 1 million .
A broad - shouldered security guard walks toward the stage , carrying a large manila envelope sealed with duct tape .
Across from Sonne on the stage is a magician named Banachek .
Back in 1980 , he tricked scientists at Washington University in St. Louis into believing he had supernatural powers — and then admitted he had performed an elaborate hoax .
Today , Banachek is administering Sonne 's test .
The guard hands the envelope to Banachek .
Inside are a ten - sided die and 40 envelopes that each contains a playing card .
Sonne rolls the die .
It stops on three .
Sonne now must find the envelope containing the three of hearts , plus two other cards .
If she can do it , the $ 1 million is hers .
Sonne glances at the audience and then back at the envelopes spread before her .
With her right hand , she dangles a crystal amulet over the table .
For four minutes , the room is motionless .
Sonne 's charm sways like a pendulum over the envelopes .
No one speaks — nobody wants to be her excuse if she later says she was distracted .
At the end of the first row , with a bald head and a beard as long and white as Darwin's , 81 - year - old James Randi watches closely , his bushy eyebrows cocked .
His foundation , the Fort Lauderdale - based James Randi Educational Foundation , has placed the million bucks on the line .
For more than 60 years , " the Amazing Randi " has performed magic , debunked psychics , and discussed the perils of all things paranormal .
He has debunked more than 100 psychics and faith healers in a quest to rid the world of hucksters .
It has also made him the subject of scorn among purveyors of the paranormal , true believers who say Randi has made himself rich , pulling in nearly $ 200,000 a year from his foundation , at the expense of others ' careers .
Now , however , Randi 's work might be in jeopardy .
His foundation has been hemorrhaging money , and Randi , who has spent his career challenging the notion of an afterlife , now faces his own mortality .
He has intestinal cancer and might not have long to live .
Randi has been a commanding presence for four decades , but it 's unclear who could fill his role as the face of the skeptic community .
But Randi still has loyal followers who revere him like a religious leader .
Many of them come to Las Vegas every year for his conference , the Amazing Meeting .
This past July , the weekend of critical thinking culminated in Sonne 's dowsing demonstration — the first public attempt at the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge .
When Sonne indicates she has found the three of hearts , Banachek writes " 3 " on the sealed envelope .
Sonne rolls the die twice more and then searches for a seven and an ace .
For the final card , the awkward silence lasts nearly five tedious minutes before Sonne chooses the envelope farthest to the left .
After nearly 20 minutes , it 's time to see how she fared .
Banachek asks her to cut open the envelope marked " 3 . "
She does , and Banachek peeks inside .
----------
The James Randi Foundation put together its first skeptics ' conference in 2003 .
That first year in Fort Lauderdale , the event drew only 150 attendees .
In the years since , it has grown to become the largest gathering of critical thinkers , doubters , heretics , and nonbelievers in the world .
More than 1,100 conferees paid about $ 300 each for admission this year .
They come to hear some of the most famous voices in critical thinking — Adam Savage , cohost of the Discovery Channel 's MythBusters ; Bill Prady , co-creator of CBS's The Big Bang Theory — and to discuss Randi 's favorite topic , skeptical inquiry , a discipline devoted to debunking psychics , faith healers , con artists , and ghost whisperers through the holy miracle of old - fashioned science .
The Amazing Meeting attendees are mostly white men with glasses , facial hair , and a healthy appreciation of physics and Monty Python .
They come from as far away as Australia and Japan .
There are college students , bloggers , and rambunctious computer scientists .
In the halls of the conference , they banter about the psychological phenomenon known as " the ideomotor effect , " the pseudoscience behind the instant sommelier ( a contraption that supposedly can age wine to perfection in 30 minutes ) , and — a favorite conversation topic — getting wasted at the hotel bar .
The highlight of the weekend for most of the skeptics here is the chance to meet the man dubbed " The King of Debunking . "
Randi is a five - and - a - half - foot - tall command performance , with his characteristic white beard , brow , and penchant for zingers .
Each morning of the conference , Randi is brought into the main lecture hall in a wheelchair .
A slow - moving pack of swooning disciples gathers around him .
Pictures are taken .
Hands are shaken .
A girl asks him to sign her straitjacket .
A booth sells little James Randi dolls with glasses , bushy white beards , and tiny handcuffs .
Some conferees come with questions they 've been dying to ask for years ( " Mr. Randi , when you flew in upside down over Japan , did you have any plan in the event of an auto - rotation ditch ? " ) .
But most want to give thanks to the man who got them sober to the ways of the world : " Hi , I saw you speak in Toronto , and you changed my life . "
" You let me know it was OK to question my own beliefs . "
Magician Penn Jillette and his usually quiet partner , Teller , have known Randi for nearly 35 years .
" Make no mistake , " Teller says .
" Randi is the reason everybody 's here . "
Regulars at the Amazing Meeting , Penn and Teller often cite Randi during their nightly show at the Rio and on their Showtime show Bullshit !
" He means everything to us , " Penn says .
" It 's hard to think of something he does n't influence that we do .
There certainly would n't be a Penn & Teller as it is now if not for Randi . "
Penn puts Randi in the same category as innovators such as Bob Dylan and Pablo Picasso — people who moved the world through their life 's work .
Penn first visited Randi's house in New Jersey in 1975 , and it gave him an idea of how he wanted to live his life : " The door opened the wrong way , and there were talking birds and Alice Cooper heads , " he says .
" It was , for me , the first sense that you could be artistically crazy and flamboyant and still grounded in reality . "
Randi's debunking work over the past 40 years has earned him fame , powerful friendships , a MacArthur Foundation " genius " grant , and a spot on Esquire 's 1997 list of the Best 100 People in the World .
Hard - core skeptics see their work as a moral imperative .
Randi points to the millions of dollars wasted every year on astrology or phony faith healers and psychics who profit from people in pain .
" Someone who lies to strangers for money is just as amoral as someone who robs a 7 - Eleven , " Penn tells the audience at one point .
The emotional tolls of charlatanism are as real as the financial ones :
In 2003 , on the Montel Williams Show , psychic Sylvia Browne — who charges upward of $ 700 for personal sessions — told the parents of missing 11 - year - old Shawn Hornbeck that their son " is no longer with us " and that his body would be found in " a wooded area . "
The news devastated his family , until four years later , when Shawn was discovered alive , living in an apartment with his kidnapper .
Randi has confronted Browne on several talk shows .
On Larry King Live in 2001 , she agreed to take his challenge , but he is still waiting for her to show up .
Randi was n't the first to dream up financial rewards for people who could prove their paranormal skills .
Harry Houdini offered $ 10,000 of his own money in 1923 to any psychic who could show that his or her gifts were genuine .
The master magician said he felt compelled to draw a distinction between entertainers and criminally minded grifters preying upon a gullible public .
" It takes a flimflammer to catch a flimflammer , " Houdini would say .
Nobody passed his challenge .
Following Houdini's model , Randi began offering his own money in 1964 for proof of supernatural powers .
First the reward was $ 1,000 and then $ 10,000 .
One of Randi 's friends , Internet pioneer Rick Adams , put up $ 1 million in 1996 .
The fact that nobody has won the challenge in 40 years does n't stop a regular stream of applicants : a woman who claimed to cry tears of glass , the man who said he could detect buried water with two bent coat hangers , the lady who could supposedly make strangers urinate using only the power of her mind .
" I never claim they do n't have these powers , " Randi says .
" I just say there is no evidence to support these claims .
I say , ' If it 's so , I 'll give you a million dollars . '
That 's a pretty big carrot . "
It 's unclear how long the foundation would survive or who would carry on the challenge if Randi can't beat his cancer .
The first morning of the conference , Randi , looking more slouched and frail than most of his fans have seen him , rises slowly from his wheelchair and walks up the steps of the stage .
He tells the crowd of dedicated faces peering back at him about his coming chemotherapy .
Two weeks earlier , doctors had removed a Ping - Pong - ball - size tumor from his intestines .
" We 'll fight it , " he says .
" And we 'll beat this .
We still have a lot of work to do . "
He reassures the audience , but many men and women can't fight back tears .
Randi's voice is scratchy and strained from the tubes down his throat during the surgery .
Hangover from the anesthesia has caused occasional blurry spots in his otherwise remarkable memory .
The procedure has left him weak and begrudgingly confined most of the time to a wheelchair .
" It 's not a matter of pride , " he explains .
" It 's a matter of the impression you make on people .
You want to appear to be empowered .
It 's the show business in me . "
----------
When Randi was 15 , he heard of a preacher in his hometown of Toronto who claimed he could read minds .
Randi had been reading every book he could find about magic and illusions , so he believed he could figure out what trick the preacher was using on his flock .
One Sunday morning , Randi watched the preacher use a classic " one ahead " scam .
The preacher used information obtained ahead of time to trick the crowd into believing he could read minds .
Randi took the stage as he imagined his hero Harry Houdini might have done and preached to the congregation about being duped , explaining the trick the preacher had used .
He was immediately run out of the church .
Dissidence would become a regular reaction to Randi , who was born Randall James Hamilton Zwinge in 1928 .
He describes himself as a quick learner but a bit of a rabble - rouser — he was once kicked out of his Sunday school class for heresy .
When he was 12 , he stumbled into a matinee performance by famed magician Harry Blackstone Sr. , who made a lady float in the air just feet from the stunned boy .
" That got me , " Randi says .
" That grabbed me , and it never let go .
It 's still got a hold of my head right now . "
A year after the church incident , Randi was in a bicycle accident that left him in a full - body cast for 13 months .
Randi figured that even confined to the cast , he could still perform at nightclubs as a mentalist .
" In those days , they were paying me 70 bucks a week , " he says .
" Now that was a lot of Canadian dollars , I can tell you . "
He decided he would make it clear at the end of every show that he was simply using illusions .
But he was disturbed when audience members would insist he had paranormal powers — ironically ignoring the only bit of truth he'd spat out all night .
People seemed to want to believe in the supernatural .
Before he graduated high school , Randi left town with the carnival , performing as " Prince Ibis . "
At age 22 , he pulled off a highly publicized escape from a Quebec City jail cell , a trick Houdini used to perform .
A local newspaper dubbed him " L'etonnant Randi , " the Amazing Randi , " with an i at the end , " he says , " like Houdini . "
For three decades , Randi toured the world by train , plane , and ship , headlining marquees from the Deep South to the Far East .
He was bound in straitjackets , dangled over waterfalls , buried alive , handcuffed , and locked in an oversize milk jug .
But Randi could never shake the need to educate the naive .
Working at nightclubs in East Asia , he learned new con-man techniques , and when he returned , he had a bug for debunking .
In the '60s , he hosted a radio show in New York in which he would , among other things , argue with astrologers ( " complete woo -woo , " he says ) and confront chiropractors ( " three chiropractors , three completely different diagnoses " ) .
The height of his fame came when Johnny Carson invited him to the Tonight Show .
Carson had him back 37 times , and the two became good friends .
" Johnny was a very skilled magician , very accomplished , " Randi says .
Living in northern New Jersey , Randi befriended other great American thinkers , such as astronomer Carl Sagan and science fiction writer Isaac Asimov .
Randi and Asimov would sing Gilbert and Sullivan tunes deep into the night .
" He had such a wonderful voice , " Randi remembers .
Randi and Sagan would discuss their shared love of astronomy .
Sagan helped name a comet after Randi .
Randi even played himself on an episode of Happy Days — he levitates Mrs. Cunningham , and in the final shot of the episode , Randi steals Fonzi 's patented " Ehhh . "
At one point , Randi toured with Alice Cooper , cutting the rock god's head off with a trick guillotine at the end of every show .
In the '70s , America developed a new fascination with all things paranormal — crystals , tarot cards , astrology parties .
Randi found the trends disturbing , and he was particularly irked by a young Israeli named Uri Geller , who said he could bend spoons with his mind and read the thoughts of total strangers .
He appeared on countless television shows and was featured in magazines in dozens of languages .
The degree to which people took Geller seriously bothered Randi .
Reputable scientists from several labs studied " the Geller effect , " how brainwaves affect pliable metal .
Those scientists no longer discuss the experiments .
Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island , former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , invited Geller to the floor of Congress to send positive brain waves to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 .
The senator and the psychic later claimed at least partial success .
Randi tried to spread the message that Geller 's techniques were simple charlatan tricks , old Israeli shtick masked by a trustworthy voice and a warm smile .
Randi performed Geller 's tricks himself for Barbara Walters .
He arranged for Johnny Carson 's staff to foil Geller on the Tonight Show .
" I 'm just feeling very weak tonight , " Geller explained to Carson when he could n't perform anything supernatural .
In 1975 , Randi published his first book : The Magic of Uri Geller , later retitled The Truth About Uri Geller .
A series of lawsuits and countersuits between Randi and Geller ensued .
Geller won a suit against Randi in a Japanese court , claiming Randi had defamed him , but the judge awarded Geller 500,000 yen , or just $ 2,000 .
Randi boasts he has " never paid a dime " to anyone who has sued him .
" Randi is my best unpaid publicist , " Geller now says in a phone call from his home in London .
" If I had to get a calculator and see how much a high - priced Madison Avenue entertainment publicist would cost , I 'd have to say that I got around $ 10 million worth of free publicity from skeptics . "
Geller speaks with an old - world show - business charisma not unlike Randi's .
Under other circumstances , the two might have even become friends , but to Randi , Geller has crossed an ethical line — he never came clean about his tricks .
Geller does n't see it that way .
" Without the skeptics , I would n't be Uri Geller , " he says .
" They made me .
They created me .
They kept the aura , the legend , the mystery , the mysticism around Uri Geller .
I owe them bouquets of flowers for keeping my career alive .
If they wanted to finish me off over three decades ago , all they had to do is not talk about me .
They should have shut up . "
Randi , of course , has offered to test Geller , to give him $ 1 million if he can prove his claims .
But Geller always declines , saying anything that would quiet skeptics — and by extension make him less controversial — would hurt his career .
" If someone wants to stay in the business of being a psychic , " he says , " they should simply ignore the skeptics . "
----------
Enticed by the warm weather , Randi moved to Florida in 1985 , two years before he became a U.S. citizen .
He wanted an organization of his own from which he could launch his lengthy investigations of paranormal claims .
He established the nonprofit James Randi Educational Foundation out of a split - level white Fort Lauderdale building with Spanish tile , stained glass over the entrance , and peacocks frolicking in the yard .
Images of flying pigs hang on the walls next to old posters , magazine clips , and a letter from Johnny Carson ( it accompanied a $ 100,000 donation ) .
In the " Isaac Asimov Library " are shelves of books about all things paranormal , from phrenology to faith healing , and a portrait of the writer friend for whom the room is named .
The truth is , Randi 's obsessions with incredulity and prestidigitation flowered from the same seed .
He has always delighted in watching the stunned faces of audiences as he makes them believe — perhaps only for a moment — they 've witnessed something impossible .
At lunch , for instance , he makes the saltshaker vanish under a napkin , and when his tablemates finish applauding , he says , " Yes , yes , great dinner entertainment , horrible table manners .
Now , has anyone seen the salt ? "
He gets the same giddy satisfaction making the careers of psychics disappear .
But even before the cancer diagnosis , Randi had faced recent challenges .
Like many nonprofits , the James Randi Educational Foundation has taken a severe financial hit over the past year .
The foundation is funded through sales of books and DVDs , grants , conferences , donations from wealthy friends , and Randi 's speaking engagements , which command as much as $ 30,000 .
According to tax records , Randi 's organization lost nearly a quarter of its $ 2 million overall worth last year .
( The $ 1 million for the challenge is held in a separate , Goldman Sachs account . )
Randi takes an annual salary of about $ 200,000 , which he justifies by saying it's in line with what he was making as an entertainer and has n't been adjusted much in the 13 years since the foundation was started .
Critics of Randi — and he admits there are hundreds who write to him every month — call him the charlatan .
" Mr. Randi , admit you 're a fraud , that your offer 's a fraud , " demanded Greg Price , a Minnesota man who claimed he could dowse , in a video he sent to Randi .
" Your foundation should be disbanded immediately ! "
In the 40 years Randi has been putting up money to test paranormal ability , nobody has made it past the initial testing stage .
The vast majority of failed or debunked applicants complain Randi surreptitiously affects the outcome in his favor .
He has been accused of both having paranormal powers and violating the showbiz brotherhood by trying to expose a lack of paranormal powers in others .
He has also been accused of having inappropriate relationships with his apprentices .
The accusation went public on an episode of Oprah in which Randi was asked to debunk psychics .
One of the psychics accused him of improper relationships with young boys .
Randi denies the allegations .
" She was referring , of course , to my apprentices , " Randi says .
" I 've had many fantastic apprentices over the years . "
Those closest to Randi are fiercely loyal .
His longtime companion , Jose Alvarez , met Randi 20 years ago , not long after Alvarez was involved in a cult .
" Randi showed me that reality — the real world — has a very special kind of beauty , " says Jose , now 41 years old .
The other frequent criticism of Randi is that he 's just wrong .
Like many of the psychics Randi encounters , Geller says reality is composed of paranormal events every day , though science can't yet understand or quantify them .
Geller contends that everyone , Randi included , has some psychic powers .
" It 's simply not developed in everyone , " Geller says .
" We all have a sixth sense , because we are animals .
It 's a part of our chromosome buildup .
It 's a part of our DNA .
There are too many synchronicities in your life to ignore it as coincidence . "
The critical - thinking movement is all about examining explanations to the paranormal from multiple angles , questioning the accepted reasoning .
That 's also why the movement is made up mostly of atheists .
" Religion is the biggest scam of them all , " Randi says .
" You go into the voting booth and you 're going to depend on a spirit in the sky , some old guy with a beard , a jealous , vindictive , very - uncertain - of - himself , provocative , angry god ?
No , I do n't think that should be your driving force . "
Says Geller : " Most people are believers .
Most people are religious .
Most people want to believe there 's a creator .
Most people want to believe in spirituality .
Most people want to believe there is something out there .
Seven billion people can't be wrong .
Whether you call it a god or Buddha or religion , there is some kind of spirituality out there .
The skeptics are a tiny , tiny minority .
They 're insignificant .
They are molecular nothings . "
To illustrate how easily spiritual leaders can garner followers , Randi and Alvarez , a visual artist , perpetuated a hoax on Australian national television in 1988 .
Alvarez pretended his body was inhabited by " Carlos , " a 1,500 - year - old fortuneteller .
Within days , Alvarez had thousands of followers .
" It was just so easy , " Alvarez says .
" It 's sad and remarkable . "
During most of the Amazing Meeting in July , Alvarez pushes Randi's wheelchair around the expansive Las Vegas resort .
Some days , Randi feels great .
Some days , he can't lift the phone to his ear .
Doctors have put his five - year prognosis at 50 - 50 .
Medical science , though , is the one thing this old skeptic actually has faith in .
Two weeks after the conference , Randi will begin a regular routine of chemotherapy .
He will lose the soft white hair around his head ; his bushy , expressive eyebrows ; and the beard he has n't shaved in more than 25 years .
" That 's fine , " he says .
" Growing hair is something I 'm good at . "
Still , the cancer has n't changed his views on death : " One day , I 'm gonna die .
That 's all there is to it , " he says matter - of - factly .
" Hey , it 's too bad , but I 've got to make room .
I 'm using a lot of oxygen and such — I think it 's good use of oxygen myself , but of course I 'm a little prejudiced on the matter . "
Up in his hotel room at the conference , he 's asked about whether nearing death will make him recant his lifelong atheism .
" I 've been wrong about things in the past , " he says , " but not anything this big . "
It 's the skeptics ' willingness to say " I do n't know " that makes them a mostly libertarian bunch .
" We do n't trust anything or anyone , " a science teacher from Texas explains , " least of all the government . "
Dr. Yaron Brook , president of the think tank Ayn Rand Institute in Irvine , California , says Randi has been a prominent promoter of reason and scientific method .
" Part of his legacy will be the resurgence in atheism and all the debunking he 's done , but one of his greatest achievements has been the reassertion of one objective truth , " Brook says .
" So many of those influenced by him just want to debunk for the sake of debunking , but Randi is better .
He is a defender of the truth . "
When Randi does go over to the great big nothing , it 's unclear what will become of his foundation or the million - dollar challenge .
The foundation 's board of directors recently installed astronomer Plait as president of the foundation .
But Randi is the face of the organization , and he knows that fundraising and organizing conferences could suffer if he 's not there to put his name on the place .
Things are still bright , though .
The second morning of the conference , two skeptics get married onstage .
The bride , Rebecca Watson of Boston , and the groom , Sid Rodriguez of London , met in Las Vegas at the Amazing Meeting three years ago .
MythBusters ' Adam Savage is the ring bearer .
After the wedding cake is cut , in front of about 1,000 of the most dedicated atheists on Earth , the lucky couple takes to the floor for the first dance — to a cover of the Beach Boys ' hit " God Only Knows . "
Everyone in the room giggles at the ironic refrain .
For the last two lines , the lyrics are changed to " Randi only knows what I 'd be without you ... "
----------
Back in the dark banquet hall , everyone is ready for the results of Connie Sonne 's dowsing test .
" This has to be a three , " Banachek reminds the room .
He flexes the envelope and pours out the playing card .
Sonne takes a deep breath .
" Connie , that is a two .
You 've failed . "
To be thorough , Banachek asks Sonne to cut open the other two envelopes she chose .
Both are wrong .
Then she cuts open the remaining envelopes to prove all the cards are present .
By the time she 's finished , the patient audience has grown restless .
Although she failed today , she asserts she has psychic powers .
" I just know , " she repeats .
Then she says the voices she hears have simply chosen another time to unveil her skills to the world .
" They have n't allowed it today .
But you wait .
You remember me .
You will see . "
Outside the banquet room , Randi feigns relief , giving his brow an exaggerated , sarcastic wipe .
" Thank God the money is safe ! "
He says that when people lose the challenge , they all react the same way : " Without fail , they always have an excuse for why they could n't do what they claimed they could . "
Sure enough , once Sonne returns to Denmark , she claims Banachek used sleight of hand to move the cards and protect the money .
After the test , most conferees head to the airport or begin long road trips home .
A handful of skeptics lingers at the bar .
" The TAM parties are something of a legend , " a tall , pale , bearded conferee from Seattle confesses after his third vodka , amid a string of Simpsons quotes .
( Asked for his name , he spits out two that end up not being his . )
" Skeptics understand the chemistry of inebriation .
And we 're good people to have deep , meaningful conversations with .
All the people here are based in reality .
That 's really refreshing . "
To punctuate his sentiments , he stands up : " Who wants another round ? "
Although the future is up in the air for the Amazing Randi , what keeps him going are the men and women who approach him every day with stories of their skeptical conversions .
" That means I 've changed someone 's life , " he says .
" I get emotional .
I say to myself : ' Damn !
That 's why I 'm in business . '
The people here , they 're going to follow me .
The movement 's going to go on . "
Randi jokes that after he passes , his fans need not bother with grandiose gestures such as establishing a museum of magic or burying him in an elaborate tomb .
He has something more Amazing in mind .
" I want to be cremated , " he says with his signature dry , knowing charm .
" And I want my ashes blown in Uri Geller 's eyes . "
THE STEPFATHER of reigning MotoGP World Champion Valentino Rossi is believed to have committed suicide .
ANSA news agency has reported that Mauro Tecchi , 52 , was found dead in his house with what Police believe were self - inflicted gunshot wounds .
Tecchi married Rossi's mother , Stefania Palma , in 2007 .
Disturbing news for Rossi , who qualified in second spot for this weekend 's Australian Moto GP race from Phillip Island .
Have you ever wondered what a ghost sounds like ?
Engineer Vic
Tandy may already know .
In the early 1980s , Tandy was working in a laboratory designing medical equipment .
Word began to spread among the staff that the labs might be haunted , something Tandy put down to the constant wheeze of life - support machines operating in the building .
One evening he was working on his own in the lab when he began to feel distinctly uncomfortable , breaking into a cold sweat as the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end .
He was convinced that he was being watched .
Then , out of the corner of his eye , Tandy noticed an ominous grey shape drifting slowly into view , but when he turned around to face it , it was gone .
Terrified , he went straight home .
The next day Tandy , a keen fencer , noticed that a foil blade clamped in a vice was vibrating up and down very fast .
He found that the vibrations were caused by a standing sound wave that was bouncing between the end walls of the laboratory and reached a peak of intensity in the centre of the room .
He calculated that the frequency of the standing wave was about 19hz ( cycles per second ) and soon discovered that it was produced by a newly installed extractor fan .
When the fan was turned off , the sound wave disappeared .
The key here is frequency : 19hz is in the range known as infrasound , below the range of human hearing , which begins at 20hz .
Tandy learned that low frequencies in this region can affect humans and animals in several ways , causing discomfort , dizziness , blurred vision ( by vibrating your eyeballs ) , hyperventilation and fear , possibly leading to panic attacks .
A more recent investigation took place in an allegedly haunted 14th - century pub cellar in Coventry , where people have reported terrifying experiences for many years , including seeing a spectral grey lady .
Here Tandy also uncovered a 19 hz standing wave , adding further evidential weight to his theory .
In an interesting parallel , researchers have recorded that , prior to an attack , a tiger 's roar contains frequencies of about 18hz , which might disorientate and paralyse their intended victim .
Is this the sound of fear itself ?
Ever since it was first recognized by American doctors in 1981 , the origin of the virus that causes AIDS -- a disease that has killed as many as 16 million people and infected another 36 million worldwide -- has been one of the great mysteries of science .
A host of wild theories have been proposed on how the virus came into being : that the KGB , with information obtained from the Nazis , created the virus in the early stages of the Cold War as part of a biological warfare program ; or that the disease was created as part of a secret government project to eliminate certain " undesirable " parts of the American population .
Most scientists have discarded those ideas and now believe that the disease derives from a simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) that has long existed and is found in chimpanzees .
How the virus jumped from chimps to humans is debatable .
After nearly a decade of research , investigative journalist Edward Hooper , a former official of the United Nations , has written The River : A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS , a book that may provide some answers .
Evidence uncovered through interviews and literary searches suggests that the AIDS virus was not the byproduct of a communist plot or a form of divine punishment , but that it may be the result of a contaminated experimental polio vaccine program conducted in Africa in the late 1950s .
The vaccine in question was developed by Hilary Koprowski and Stanley Plotkin , a pair of scientists from the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia , the country 's first independent medical research center .
At the time , the institute was one of several organizations competing to develop an effective attenuated polio vaccine that could be dispensed quickly to protect people from catching the disease .
Exactly how many people were given the Wistar vaccine is not known .
An article published in the journal BioScience puts the number of recipients at 325,000.1
Other sources place the number much higher .
As many as a million people in what are now Rwanda , Burundi and Congo may have received the vaccine between 1957 and 1960.2,5
The earliest documented HIV infection of a human has been traced to a male victim who was living in Kinshasa , in what was than called the Belgian Congo in 1959 .
A study published in Nature in 1998 authenticated the victim and suggested that the virus " may have evolved from a single introduction into the African population in a time frame not long before 1959 . "
Although the researchers could not find an explanation for the wide - scale spread of AIDS , they also suggested that " the role of large - scale vaccination campaigns ... should be carefully examined " as a possible cause .

Kinshasa , the country 's largest city , is considered one of the birthplaces of the AIDS epidemic , and was one of the first places the experimental polio vaccine was tested .
Of 90 of the first reported cases of HIV and AIDS acquired in specific towns in Africa through 1981 , 76 came from the same towns where the experimental vaccine was given or within 100 miles of them .
2
At the heart of the debate is the argument over what type of monkey cells were used to produce the vaccine .
In an interview with Reuters in November 1999 , Koprowski , a former director at Wistar , insisted that neither chimpanzee nor African green monkey tissue ( both of which are capable of supporting SIV ) were used in the process .
The vaccine , he asserts , was made with tissues from Asian rhesus monkeys , whose kidney cells do not support SIV .
" This book has only preconceptions , " said Koprowski , now a professor at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia .
" There are no facts . "
4
" The idea is a house of cards built on circumstantial evidence , " added Plotkin , who developed the modern rubella vaccine while employed at the institute .
4
While there are no hard facts to dispute Koprowski and Plotkin 's statements , there is also little evidence to back them up .
An independent committee formed by the Wistar Institute in 1992 was unable to determine if chimpanzee tissue was used during the vaccine trials .
Records kept during that time appear incomplete or spotty at best , omitting certain details or test results .
Former workers interviewed by Hooper have given conflicting accounts about which types of monkey tissues were used .
Circumstantial evidence gleaned by Hooper also shows that chimpanzees may have been used in the vaccine 's processing .
A number of eyewitnesses have claimed that chimps were experimented upon by the Wistar group .
It is known that a large colony of chimpanzees were caught and used for research at a station along the Lindi River in central Congo , one of the initial sites for the vaccination program .
It is also known that 11 of the earliest reported cases of AIDS and HIV infection in the Congo occurred within 200 miles of the vaccination sites situated along the Lindi .
Because of their extremely close relation to human DNA , chimpanzee tissues have long been considered an ideal culture medium for growing viruses .
If infected chimp tissues were used , the theory goes , it might have found its way into one or more batches of the experimental polio vaccine used in the Congo and the neighboring countries of Burundi and Rwanda .
Since the vaccine was delivered orally , the virus could have passed through a sore , ulcer or bleeding gum in a patient 's mouth and entered the bloodstream .
From that point , the virus could be transmitted through sexual or blood - to - blood contact and later evolved into the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
While Hooper 's theory would require a number of unlikely coincidences to occur , the unknowing transmission of a simian virus into a human host has happened before .
In the 1950s and 1960s , millions of Americans were accidentally infected with a monkey virus called SV - 40 as part of their polio vaccinations .
Fortunately , the SV - 40 virus has no effect on humans .
Other incidents have met with more disastrous results .
Since 1930 , more than two dozen monkey handlers in the United States have died after being bitten by monkeys infected with herpes B , which has no effect on its natural host but is invariably fatal when delivered to humans .
And in 1967 , several laboratory workers in Germany died from the Marburg virus after it was imported into that country via African green monkeys .
2
Like herpes B , Marburg is relatively harmless for monkeys but lethal in humans .
While Hooper 's research may have provided the missing link scientists have been seeking for decades , the concept that AIDS is the result of a botched vaccine program is nothing new .
The debate over the safety of Koprowski's vaccine began almost as soon as it was introduced in the late 1950s .
At the time , the Wistar Institute was competing with several organizations and health centers to devise an oral alternative to the injectable polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk .
One of Wistar 's chief rivals was based at Cincinnati Children 's Hospital and was led by the legendary scientist and physician Albert Sabin .
Both groups had worked independently of each other and developed their own sets of oral polio vaccines .
For each team , the stakes , scientifically and financially , were quite high .
In the late 1950s , the federal government had yet to decide which vaccine to approve ; such approval in the U.S. would most certainly be adopted by the rest of the world , and the creator of the vaccine would be revered .
In 1959 , at the First International Conference on Live Poliovirus Vaccines , Dr. Sabin made an amazing claim that would shake the foundations of virology .
5
He alleged that at least one batch of Koprowski's vaccine had been contaminated with an unidentified simian virus , one that had nothing to do with polio virus but which , like polio , was cytopathic .
Since the unknown virus killed cells when introduced into monkey kidney tissue cultures , the inference by Sabin was that such a virus might cause similar damage when introduced into human beings .
Swedish virologist Dr. Sven Gard , who had been on sabbatical at the Wistar Institute for several months before the start of the conference , spoke up in defense of the Koprowski vaccine .
Dr. Gard said that he had tested the vaccine in Sweden and the United States for the presence of unknown viruses and had found nothing , seemingly putting the issue to rest .
5
Sabin 's oral polio vaccine eventually won out and was approved for use in 1963 , while Koprowski 's version was discontinued in April 1960 .
Does It Really Matter ?
It has been more than 200 years since a British doctor named Edward Jenner devised the idea of vaccination , inoculating an eight - year old boy with cowpox to protect him against a related but much deadlier illness : smallpox .
Since that time , new procedures and advances in science and medicine have helped make vaccines safer and more effective , saving thousands ( if not millions ) of lives in the process .
But it has also become evident that some vaccines may be more dangerous than the conditions they are designed to prevent , and that financial interests sometimes take precedence over patient safety .
In the past year , valid concerns have been raised about vaccines used to treat a variety of diseases , from rotavirus and hepatitis B to anthrax and Lyme disease .
In 1998 alone , the nation 's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System received more than 11,000 complaints from concerned doctors , parents and patients .
Even now , pharmaceutical companies are attempting to get AIDS vaccines tested and into widespread use in Africa in Asia - just as the scientists of a few decades raced to find a vaccine to eradicate polio - and therein lies a potentially terrible irony .
As Michael Woods , a science editor for the Toledo Blade , said : " Are modern scientists taking due precautions , or , like their 1950s - era colleagues , are they unknowingly putting their faith in Lady Luck ? "

Sunday ’s twin suicide bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 155 people and wounded 500 others may have had help from within Iraq ’s security apparatus , MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow reported Monday .
“ This was a really well coordinated attack on an area in Baghdad that ’s supposed to be well protected , ” Maddow told viewers .
“ In order to reach their targets , the bombers driving these truck bombs had to pass through several checkpoints that were guarded by security forces and those security forces were supposed to be using hand - held devices designed to detect explosives . ”

Maddow quoted a comment from Brian Katulis , a Middle East expert at the Center for American Progress , who wrote , “ You do n’t want to do this kind of attack without having someone on the inside .
It implies infiltration of the government .
If there is an objective , it ’s to send a message to whoever is in power that not everyone recognizes them as being in charge . ”
A group called the Islamic State of Iraq , which reportedly includes Al Qaeda in Iraq , has claimed responsibility for the bombing , though , as the Washington Post notes , the authenticity of that claim has not been verified .
As Maddow noted , the Iraqi government says it has arrested at least 75 people in connection with the bombings .
This is not the first time questions have arisen about the possibility of government infiltration by insurgents .
In August , Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Sebari said he suspected infiltration in a blast that killed nearly 100 people .
“ According to our information , there has even been collaboration between security officers and the murderers and killers , ” said Zebari .
In April of 2007 , a bomb attack against the Iraq parliament that killed eight people , including two members of parliament , was suspected to have involved insurgent sympathizers within Iraq ’s security forces .
The attack “ reflects the fact that perhaps there are some people within the Iraqi security forces who have been infiltrated by insurgents and terrorist organizations , ” then - Australian Defense Minister Brendan Nelson said .

Today 's column will be about homosexuality so I must issue a warning that some readers will find some of its contents immoral , unnatural and downright disgusting .
I know I do .
What , for example , could be more immoral , unnatural and downright disgusting than this statement ?
" Sexual relations outside marriage constituted a violation of bodily integrity , and homosexuality did so in a particularly grave manner as being against the order of nature and a perversion of the biological function of the sexual organs . . . it was important that the state should do all in its power to discourage the spread of homosexuality and in particular should not appear by the laws to condone sexual practices calculated to undermine the institutions of marriage and the family . "
That choice piece of hate speech was issued from one Rory O'Hanlon SC in 1980 .
At the time Mr O'Hanlon was representing the State as it defended the legal ban on homosexuality being challenged in the High Court by David Norris .
He was not giving his own personal opinion , he was giving that of the State .
Or , in other words , us .
This was being said in the name of the people of Ireland .
Justice Herbert McWilliam ruled against Norris , telling him " it is reasonably clear that current Christian morality in this country does not approve of buggery , or of any sexual activity between persons of the same sex . "
This was the country that Donal óg Cusack was born into .
Justice McWilliam did say that " there was no foundation for any of the common beliefs that male homosexuals were mentally unbalanced , effeminate , vicious , unreliable , less intelligent or more likely to assault or seduce children , or young people , than were heterosexual males " .
Very good of him .
Though presumably anyone who had laboured under the delusion that homosexuals were , for example , less intelligent , had lived in blissful ignorance of the work of Oscar Wilde , Francis Bacon , Benjamin Britten , Ian McKellen , WH Auden , Marcel Proust , Tennessee Williams , EM Forster , John Gielgud and Truman Capote , among very many others .
David Norris fought on .
In 1988 the European Court of Human Rights found that the Irish ban on homosexuality infringed the rights of gay people .
The Irish government had no option but to repeal the ban , though it took five years to do so .
On the day the bill legalising homosexuality was passed in the Dail , a Fine Gael TD from Louth named Brendan McGahon said : " I believe homosexuality to be an abnormality , some type of psycho-sexual problem that has defied explanation over the years .
I do not believe that the Irish people desire this normalisation of what is clearly an abnormality . . . while they deserve our compassion homosexuals do not deserve our tolerance . . . such people have a persecution complex because they know they are different from the masses of normal society .
They endure inner torment . "
In a slightly less florid manner , some other politicians got in on the act back then .
Three of them went on to hold ministerial rank .
" I do not often find myself in agreement with my constituency colleague Deputy McGahon but on this occasion I am , " said our current Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern .
" The problem is that this Bill will be seen as sending a message that society regards buggery as a natural , healthy and acceptable act but I disagree totally with that .
It would be irresponsible to send such a message to our young people at a time when AIDS is such a prevalent disease , " said future Minister of State and Taoiseach 's brother Noel Ahern .
" I ask the house to pause and think whether the decriminalisation of homosexuality is the duty of the house or whether it would in fact adversely affect future generations . . . if the argument is accepted that homosexuality is not morally wrong is there still a basis for a law to protect youth from corruption , " said future national laughing stock John Limo O'Donoghue .
These were our representatives .
We voted for them .
This was the country in which Donal óg Cusack grew up .
And that is why nobody should underestimate the bravery it took for the Cork goalkeeper to publicly come out as a gay man in his autobiography or what a huge step forward this represents for Irish sport .
We should also understand what a huge challenge it is to the bigotry and prejudice which remain against gay people in this society .
Perhaps there are people reading this column and thinking , ' Why is there such a big deal being made about it ?
Why do gays have to go on about their sexuality so much ? '
But it 's not gay people who make an issue of homosexuality , it 's straight people .
Most straight men have , for example , been in a pub with a woman and , suddenly overcome by affection , leaned across and kissed her .
If a gay man did this with his partner , he'd be regarded as looking for trouble in most of the country 's pubs .
There 's even a chance he 'd suffer physical violence .
Do gay couples walk arm - in - arm down our main streets with the same unselfconsciousness and freedom as straight couples do ?
They do n't because straight people would n't stand for it .
In most towns every pub is a Straight Bar .
This is the country Donal óg Cusack lives in .
The work of people like David Norris has made Ireland a better place for gay people .
But it 's far from ideal .
Two years ago Brian Lenihan , then Minister for Justice , told a meeting of the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network that they could forget about gay marriage .
" Gay marriage would require constitutional change and in my view a referendum on this issue would be divisive and unsuccessful and , furthermore , would jeopardise the progress we have made over the last 15 years . "
You can read a lot into that simple sentence .
Brian Lenihan thinks a referendum would be ' unsuccessful ' .
Why would it be ?
After all , it 's no business of any straight person whether gay people want to get married .
Well , is it ?
Yet apparently our leaders think they 'd band together to deny them this right .
The clue is in the word ' divisive . '
Lenihan knows
the bigots would come out of the woodwork were such a referendum held .
And instead of doing the brave thing and facing them down , the government have n't the stomach for that fight .
Ponder that bit about jeopardising the progress we have made over the last 15 years .
Brian Lenihan was warning GLEN not to make the straights angry or they might take away what they so grudgingly granted in the first place .
In other words he 's behaving as though gay rights are a gift dependent on the good mood of the majority , rather than something which should be granted as a matter of course .
This is the country in which one of our leading hurlers decided to unapologetically declare himself a homosexual man .
He asked for no one 's permission and he expressed no regret .
This , he said , is who I am and if you 've got a problem , that says more about you than it does about me .
We needed to hear this .
Donal óg's coming out coincided with the burial of Stephen Gately .
There was a lot of hypocritical guff surrounding the presence of the former Boyzone singer 's ' husband ' at the funeral .
We were told it showed how much we 'd moved on , how much we 'd ' matured as a nation ' that Andrew Cowles was ' accepted ' at the funeral .
But Stephen Gately 's ' husband ' was n't his ' husband ' , he was his civil partner .
They could n't have got married in this country because the government feel this would n't be ' accepted ' .
I expect similar self - congratulatory nonsense to be written about Donal óg .
But we do n't deserve any plaudits because he came out .
It does n't show that we 've ' matured as a nation ' .
It shows that he 's a mature individual .
It is a credit to him , not to us .
Were we to put in place legislation that meant Donal óg Cusack might one day be able to legally marry , then we could start clapping ourselves on the back .
I 'm sure there are people who feel the Cork keeper should have kept quiet about his sexuality .
But that kind of silence has obtained for too many years .
It 's not too long since a well - known gay Irish public figure , who never left the closet , died and the papers were full of stuff about how he'd never met the right woman , he was n't the marrying kind etc , etc .
In fact they went a bit OTT with this kind of stuff , as if this was in some way the most suitable posthumous tribute to the man .
But we 're always better off with the truth .
And , above anything else , Donal óg Cusack has made us face up to the truth .
It was not just a coming out , it was an honest coming out .
There was no dissembling , no kowtowing to the straight prejudice which demands that gay men present themselves as sexless creatures .
Instead he said that , like many a healthy young straight Irishman , he 'd spent plenty of time trawling the pubs in the hope of a ride .
And he did n't apologise for it .
What Donal óg Cusack did at the weekend is important , too , because it challenges some of the myths peddled by the homophobic pressure groups Brian Lenihan and his cabinet colleagues run scared of .
They tell us that homosexuality is ' a lifestyle choice ' and that people can be ' influenced ' towards it .
The implication is that people become gay for the same trend - setting reasons that they might develop a passion for performance art or avant - garde cinema or that they are suborned into the culture by listening to one too many George Michael albums , watching one too many episodes of Queer As Folk .
Well , Donal óg Cusack grew up as a GAA - loving teenager in a small East Cork village .
It is doubtful that gay culture played a big part in his teenage years , doubtful too that a young man whose big ambition was to play hurling for Cork thought , " Do you know what ?
I 'll become gay because that looks like a cool thing to do " .
As he says , he knew he was different .
He did n't make a sham marriage , he did n't go on for the priesthood , he did n't emigrate or do any of the other things which gay men once felt they had to do to stop the rumours and the sly questions of , " no sign of you to get married then ? "
Sometimes we kid ourselves that we 're tolerant because we condescend to accept flamboyant gay men in the Julian Clary / Graham Norton mould .
But we have more problems with accepting our gay neighbours , our gay relations , the gay mechanic , the gay bricklayer and the gay farmer .
That 's another reason why it 's such a big deal that Donal óg came out .
Because one look at how the man plays the game is sufficient to destroy that old myth that gay men are uniformly effeminate , sissyish and , above all , instantly recognisable .
It 's been a good week for Irish sport .
It 's also been a good week for the gay man I know who religiously travels forward and back from England every year to watch the Galway hurling team in action and a good week for a friend of mine whose brother recently got married in England .
It was a gay wedding and the family , died in the wool fans of GAA , soccer and Munster rugby , all went over .
So did the children from the brother 's previous marriage .
When I see solid no bullshit country people reacting like this , I wonder if Brian Lenihan underestimates us a bit .
It 's been a good week for our gay friends , our gay neighbours , our gay brothers , our gay uncles , our gay sons and daughters .
And that means it 's been a good week for all of us as we continue the struggle towards that day when we cast aside all the old bigotries and taboos , a day when our kids and grandkids will look on our hang - ups as relics of a darker , thankfully departed time .
And when that day comes one of the people we will have to thank is a very brave man from Cork .
A very brave gay man .

The New York Times declined to publish an op - ed presented by the Archbishop of New York , Most Reverend Timothy M. Dolan , in which he made the point that the “ Gray Lady ” has been reporting stories with a strong anti-Catholic bias .
In his new blog on the archdiocese ’s website , Archbishop Dolan explains that his article was submitted in a slightly shorter form to the New York Times as an op - ed , but the Times declined to publish it .
In the blog version , Archbishop Dolan says that next to baseball , “ sadly , America has another national pastime , this one not pleasant at all : anti-Catholicism . ”
“ If you want recent evidence of this unfairness against the Catholic Church , ” writes the Archbishop , “ look no further than a few of these following examples of occurrences over the last couple weeks . ”
On October 14 , in the pages of the New York Times , reporter Paul Vitello exposed the sad extent of child sexual abuse in Brooklyn ’s Orthodox Jewish community .
“ Yet , ” Archbishop Dolan observes , “ the Times did not demand what it has called for incessantly when addressing the same kind of abuse by a tiny minority of priests : release of names of abusers , rollback of statute of limitations , external investigations , release of all records , and total transparency . ”
“ Given the Catholic Church ’s own recent horrible experience , I am hardly in any position to criticize our Orthodox Jewish neighbors , and have no wish to do so ... but I can criticize this kind of ‘ selective outrage , ’ ” he insists .
The op - ed explains that “ In 2004 , Professor Carol Shakeshaft documented the wide - spread problem of sexual abuse of minors in our nation ’s public schools ; while in 2007 , the Associated Press issued a series of investigative reports that showed numerous examples of sexual abuse by educators against public school students . ”
“ Both the Shakeshaft study and the AP reports were essentially ignored , as papers such as the New York Times only seem to have priests in their crosshairs , ” the Archbishop writes .
The Archbishop then takes issue with a New York Times October 16 “ front page , above - the - fold story on the sad episode of a Franciscan priest who had fathered a child . ”
“ Even taking into account that the relationship with the mother was consensual and between two adults , and that the Franciscans have attempted to deal justly with the errant priest ’s responsibilities to his son , this action is still sinful , scandalous , and indefensible . ”
“ However , ” he writes , “ one still has to wonder why a quarter - century old story of a sin by a priest is now suddenly more pressing and newsworthy than the war in Afghanistan , health care , and starvation –genocide in Sudan . ”
“ No other cleric from religions other than Catholic ever seems to merit such attention , ” he charges .
Then , on October 21 , the Archbishop recounts , “ the Times gave its major headline to the decision by the Vatican to welcome Anglicans who had requested union with Rome . ”
“ Fair enough .
Unfair , though , was the article ’s observation that the Holy See lured and bid for the Anglicans .
“ Of course , the reality is simply that for years thousands of Anglicans have been asking Rome to be accepted into the Catholic Church with a special sensitivity for their own tradition , ” he explains .
Nevertheless , the Archbishop of New York says the “ most combustible example ” was “ an intemperate and scurrilous piece ” on the opinion pages of the Times by Maureen Dowd , a 57 - year - old alumna of Catholic University of America who has a history of anti-Catholic bias .
“ In a diatribe that rightly never would have passed muster with the editors had it so criticized an Islamic , Jewish , or African - American religious issue , she digs deep into the nativist handbook to use every anti-Catholic caricature possible , from the Inquisition to the Holocaust , condoms , obsession with sex , pedophile priests , and oppression of women , all the while slashing Pope Benedict XVI for his shoes , his forced conscription -- along with every other German teenage boy -- into the German army , his outreach to former Catholics , and his recent welcome to Anglicans . ”
Describing the current visitation of women religious by Vatican representatives as “ the matter that triggered the spasm ” of Dowd , Archbishop Dolan says that it “ is well - worth discussing , and hardly exempt from legitimate questioning . ”
“ But her prejudice , while maybe appropriate for the Know - Nothing newspaper of the 1850 ’s , the Menace , has no place in a major publication today . ”
“ I do not mean to suggest that anti-Catholicism is confined to the pages New York Times , ” writes Archbishop Dolan , who also admits that “ the Catholic Church is not above criticism . ”
“ We Catholics do a fair amount of it ourselves .
We welcome and expect it .
All we ask is that such critique be fair , rational , and accurate , what we would expect for anybody .
The suspicion and bias against the Church is a national pastime that should be ‘ rained out ’ for good . ”
The Archbishop of New York , also an alumnus of the Catholic University of America with a doctorate in Church History , writes that “ my own background in American history should caution me not to hold my breath . ”
“ Then again , yesterday was the Feast of Saint Jude , the patron saint of impossible causes . ”

This is a great move by Chipotle ... they 've introduced a kid 's menu .
Fast food kid 's meals are nothing new ... most of the fast food chains have them .
But many health - conscious parents will be thrilled to hear that they can now take their children to Chipotle for a healthier , more natural option with kid -sized portions .
I personally discovered the kid's menu at Chipotle when I saw the first guy on the production line at Chipotle cover one of the tortillas they use for burritos with cheese , fold it over and heat it on the tortilla grill - press .
This was something I 'd never seen before ... then I saw that the woman in line had some kids in tow and then I looked up and saw the " Kid 's Menu " addition to the menu board .
Here 's the kid 's menu as it appears at a Chipotle I visited :
Editor 's note :
The original online version of this story was previously posted .
Over the next five years at least half a million tons of carbon dioxide will be injected into rock deep underneath the Mountaineer power plant near New Haven , W.Va .
Although that is less than 0.00001 percent of global emissions of the greenhouse gas and less than 2 percent of the plant ’s own CO 2 output , the sequestration , which began in September , marks the first commercial demonstration of the only available technological fix for the carbon problem of coal - fired power plants , one that many coal facilities around the world hope to emulate .
Coal accounts for roughly 50 percent of the electricity generated in the U.S. and as much as 75 percent of the electricity generated by American Electric Power , says Nick Akins , executive vice president of generation at the utility , which owns Mountaineer .
The plant can pump out 1,300 megawatts of electricity , making it one of the single largest coal - fired power plants in the U.S. and a leading source of CO 2 emissions .
( The top emitters of global - warming pollution — China and the U.S. — burn nearly four billion tons of the dirty black rock a year . )
As a result , everyone from coal companies to environmental groups have identified carbon capture and storage , or CCS , as critical in enabling significant and rapid cuts in greenhouse gases .
But there have been only a handful of demonstrations of the technology to capture the gas and , outside of using CO 2 to pump more oil out of the ground , even fewer attempts to store it .
To capture CO 2 from its smokestacks , Mountaineer will employ so - called chilled ammonia technology , which relies on ammonium carbonate chemistry to pull CO 2 out of the exhaust gases .
( The other two basic capture technologies either burn coal in pure oxygen to produce a CO 2 - rich emissions stream or siphon off the CO 2 made during the gasification of coal . )
Mountaineer takes the captured CO 2 and compresses it to at least 2,000 pounds per square inch , liquefying it and pumping it about 8,000 feet down into the ground .
At that depth , the liquid CO 2 flows through the porous rock formations , adhering to the tiny spaces , slowly spreading out over time and , ultimately , chemically reacting with rock or brine .
“ We ’re not going into a salt cavern ; we ’re not going into an underground river .
We ’re going into microscopic holes , ” explains geologist Susan Hovorka of the University of Texas at Austin , referring to CCS in general .
“ Add it up , and it ’s a large volume . ”
In fact , the Department of Energy estimates that the U.S. has the geologic room for 3.9 trillion tons of CO 2 underground , more than enough for the 3.2 billion tons that is emitted every year by large industrial sources .
The two geologic formations below Mountaineer are the Rose Run Sandstone and Copper Ridge Dolomite , which run underneath layers of relatively impermeable rock that will keep the CO 2 trapped .
“ Part of our project is to kind of take those through their paces and get an idea of their acceptance of CO 2 , ” says Gary Spitznogle , a CCS engineering manager at American Electric Power .
After all , a similar effort in Ohio revealed that formations there stored less CO 2 than expected .
The company will monitor the CO 2 via three specially drilled wells , in addition to the two wells for pumping the CO 2 down in the first place .
The process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide may be simple chemistry and geology , but it has significant industrial costs .
American Electric
Power alone will pay $ 73 million for just the capture technology at Mountaineer and has asked for $ 334 million in federal stimulus — half the total cost , the company says — to scale up the project to nab roughly 20 percent of the plant ’s emissions in future years .
Despite the steep price of CCS , Mountaineer is not alone .
In the U.S. , utilities are planning multibillion - dollar power plants that will incorporate CCS ; by 2011 Alabama Power may outsequester Mountaineer and bury 150,000 tons of CO 2 from its Plant Barry in the Citronelle Oil Field .
Abroad , China has several test facilities , and in Iceland an international consortium of researchers will pump CO 2 into underground basalt where it will react to form a carbonate mineral .
But even if CO 2 is permanently locked away in rock , other environmental problems surrounding coal remain .
The technology does nothing to remedy the impacts of coal mining , particularly mountaintop removal , or residual toxic fly ash , among other issues .
Moreover , although the Environmental Protection Agency has begun to craft rules to regulate the CO 2 - injection wells , it is still unclear who owns the pore space resource as well as who assumes liability in the event of an accident , such as a sudden , geyserlike release of the gas .
Nevertheless , given looming regulation on emissions , utilities are anticipating extensive CCS installation in just the next few decades .
“ Our first full scale would be around 2015 , and by 2025 we would have a pretty considerable amount constructed on large coal units , ” Spitznogle says .
That means one thing : higher electricity prices .
In May 2007 the Department of Energy estimated that capturing 90 percent of the CO 2 with amine scrubbers would make electricity at a cost of more than $ 114 per megawatt - hour , compared with just $ 63 per megawatt - hour without CO 2 capture .
For the consumer , the extra cost would amount to about $ 0.04 per kilowatt - hour — a necessary price , perhaps , for less of the warming gas in the atmosphere .

President Barack Obama lights a traditional oil lamp as Sri Narayanachar Digalakote , Hindu Priest from the Sri Siva Vishnu Temple in Maryland , chants in observance of Diwali , or the ' Festival of Lights . '

As a first - generation Indian American , I am inevitably faced with many interesting cultural experiences .
Growing up in a small town in the Midwest , I often felt as if I lived two parallel lives ; I was an American in school and Indian at home .
I was truly conflicted and felt unable to share my Indian heritage during my elementary school years , despite my attempts to share the meaning and traditions with others .
My favorite holiday ?
The festival of Diwali , also known as the Hindu New Year .
Diwali is such a bright , colorful holiday celebrating the epic triumph of good over evil .
This holiday is filled with sweets , vibrant clothing , and spending time with families .
Not being able to share this with friends and colleagues was similar to a hypothetical situation where Christmas and Chanukah were ignored at schools , department stores , and at work .
Fast forward many years to 2006 when all of a sudden I was faced with a lot of Diwali questions .
“ When is Diwali this year ? ” I remember a teacher asking me .
Shocked , I had no idea what prompted this newfound cultural awareness .
A few days later it dawned on me : the hit NBC sitcom “ The Office ” actually filmed an entire episode devoted to Diwali .
At first , I was reluctant to watch .
I ’m so used to the typical “ Apu ” jokes from “ The Simpsons ” and was n’t sure if “ The Office ” was going to be laughing at or with the Indian culture .
Safe to say , the creative team at “ The Office ” laughed with us , creating one of my favorite television episodes ever made .
The buzz about Diwali eventually faded a bit after memories of this episode withered away .
Imagine my surprise as an email landed in my inbox .
“ Subject : White House Celebrates Diwali . ”
The White House , led by President Obama , lit the traditional diya ( oil lamp ) to celebrate Diwali .
This is the first time the White House celebrated Diwali with the full attention of the president , as past presidents had not attended the ceremony .
While this news may have been lost to others more concerned with health care and the economy , it struck a chord with many around the world .
I hope that small steps , such as celebrating important holidays around the world , will help to raise cultural consciousness and awareness , if only the slightest bit .
Although at first I was unsure of the impact of this gesture by the Obama Administration , minutes later I received another email from a co-worker with two simple – yet heartfelt – words :
“ Happy Diwali . ”
I ’m not sure who to necessarily thank , but I think both President Obama and ( the fictional ) Michael Scott had something to do with it .

Rob Waters at Hatewatch happened to catch the above short - lived video the other day :
It advises President Obama and other prominent people ( “ Our Dear Leader and co. ” ) to “ leave now and give us our country back ” and to do so by next week .
“ If you stay , ” the silent video message continues , “ ‘ We , The People ’ will systematically dismantle you , destroy you and reclaim what is rightfully ours . …
“ We are angry and we are ready to take back the rights of the people .
We will fight and We will win . …
“ Dead line [ sic ] for your national response : October 15 , 2009 “ Thank you to all patriots who support our cause . …
Be prepared for when the fateful day of the declaration of war is nationally announced . ”
As the post notes in an update , the video was taken down shortly after it appeared on the SPLC site with no explanation .
However , we managed to capture it before then and have reproduced it here in its original form , with a C&L tag at the end .
The " National Militia , Soldiers of Freedom " is not a known organization of any kind .
Most likely it is some guy sitting in his basement .
This is about 99.99999999 percent certain to be just so much hot air from the " Patriot " movement and its attendant lunatic fringe .
It reminds me of the threat to organize a " Million Man Militia " march back in July that never came close to materializing .
These kinds of delusions of grandeur are endemic to the Patriot movement , and are part and parcel of the grand paranoia about a looming New World Order planning to imprison conservatives and the radical communist regime of Barack Obama .
That is , not only do they wildly imagine the nefarious conspiracy out to destroy America , but their imaginations similarly run riot when assessing their own breadth and strength -- not mention their abilities to act on their fantasies .
Still , the spread of this kind of rhetoric underscores the violent mindset of the militia units we now see forming at various locales around the country .
Eventually , someone competent is going to act on it .
And it 's clearly being abetted by the wild fearmongering being promulgated by the likes of Glenn Beck and other right - wing pundits .
Indeed , you have to wonder if this is the kind of thing Glenn Beck had in mind in his recent interview with Newsmax :
" I fear a Reichstag moment , " he said , referring to the 1933 burning of Germany 's parliament building in Berlin that the Nazis blamed on communists and Hitler used as an excuse to suspend constitutional liberties and consolidate power .
" God forbid , another 9/11 .
Something that will turn this machine on , and power will be seized and voices will be silenced . "
Of course , I think we can predict now that if there is another Oklahoma City -- rather than a 9/11 -- Glenn Beck will also be calling it a " Reichstag moment " and claiming it's the product of a government conspiracy to clamp down on civil rights .
This is why he and the rest of the right - wing chorus have been so eager to dismiss the existence of right - wing extremists -- even in the face of obvious evidence that the violent crazies are coming out of the woodwork .
We can thank the tea parties for providing the fertile ground for much of this rhetoric .
If you want a sampling of how bad it 's getting , check out the video below , which I captured from the same YouTube site as the one that hosted the " warning " video .
The owner stocks it up with Alex Jones conspiracy videos , but this profile of the militias caught my eye :
The main militiaman featured in this is a fellow , evidently from Oklahoma , who calls himself " July4 Patriot " and is one of the key players in an outfit of veterans who call themselves the " Oath Keepers " .
They 're organized around a batch of wild conspiracy theories involving supposed plans to use the military to begin rounding up American citizens and placing them in concentration camps .
Indeed , you can see " July4Patriot " -- whose real name is Marine Sgt. Charles Dyer -- in action at a July 4 " Tea Party " in Broken Arrow , Oklahoma , in the video we snagged earlier this summer .
At that event , Dyer ranted at length about the supposed roundup conspiracy .
There 's a growing contingent of people out there on the fringes who not only really believe Glenn Beck when he warns that the government wants to destroy America , but think he 's being too tame .
And of course , the crazier his claims become , the farther out to sea they all go .
Much hope has been invested in Barack Obama 's ability to strike a new course for the US following eight years of Bush administration unpopularity .
Yet many in the US and abroad are impatient with the pace of progress under the Obama administration .
The president made the rounds on five news talkshows on Sunday as he pressed his policies and vision , preparing for what is likely to be a difficult week .
Besides the ongoing battle over healthcare , this week sees two showdowns between Europe and the US that will reveal further slippage in American global leadership .
The first showdown comes today at a UN special session on climate change in New York City ; the second will come at the end of the week at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh , where America and Europe will butt heads over financial system reforms designed to ensure that the AIGs of the world can never again cause an economic collapse .
Europe has been increasingly critical of America 's failures to live up to its global responsibilities .
The US is not only the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases but is by far the largest per capita emitter of carbon and other pollutants .
China comes close to the US in terms of total carbon emissions , but it has four times more people , who each belch far less individually .
Europe , while having much the same high living standard , has an " ecological footprint " that is only half of America's , since Europe has taken leadership in implementing renewable technologies and conservation practices .
On the campaign trail , Barack Obama promised to reverse the Bush administration 's terrible ecological record .
Yet so far the world has seen more symbolic gestures from the Obama administration than accomplishments .
Its biggest achievement so far has been a disappointment .
President Obama signed an executive order to increase US motor vehicle mileage standards – but only to a level that will push fuel efficiency by 2020 to a level that European and Japanese cars reached several years ago , and even China has already achieved .
Europe has announced donations of $ 2bn to $ 15 bn a year for the next decade to help developing nations cope with climate warming , yet the Obama administration has not offered anything close to that amount .
Europe also wants binding , near - term targets for developed nations , proposing a 20 % reduction from 1990 levels by 2020 , or 30 % if everyone agrees .
The Bush administration of course rejected such targets – but now it looks like the Obama administration is not willing to go much further .
It has said such targets should be voluntary but verifiable .
With the US Senate bogged down in the fight over reforming healthcare , American leaders have said that the senators might not move on climate legislation until 2010 , well after the global climate change conference in Copenhagen in December .
That drew a sharp response from John Bruton , head of the European Union delegation : " The United States is just one of the 190 countries coming to this conference , " Bruton said , " but the United States emits 25 % of all the greenhouse gases that the conference is trying to reduce .
I submit that asking an international conference to sit around looking out the window for months , while one chamber of the legislature of one country deals with its other business , is simply not a realistic political position . "
Even Europe 's conservative politicians , such as Connie Hedegaard , Denmark 's minister of climate and energy , are expressing impatience : " It 's rather crucial that the US can show a credible pathway , " Hedegaard said , pointing out that the US emits twice as much carbon dioxide per capita as Denmark , without gaining anything in improving its quality of life .
That 's the start of President Obama 's week .
At the end of it , President Obama will appear at a meeting in Pittsburgh of the G20 , a bloc of both developed and developing nations , representing 85 % of the world 's economic output and most of its population .
On the table will be reforms designed to avoid a repetition of the financial panic and global economic collapse perceived as having originated on Wall Street .
Despite immense , taxpayer - financed rescue packages needed to overcome the crisis , the financial sector in the US is rapidly returning to business as usual .
Indeed , three US banks – Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan – which received some $ 45 bn of bailout aid , each paid billions of dollars more in bonuses in 2009 than they earned in 2008 .
Here again , Europe is leading , while the Obama administration is dragging its feet .
Europe has proposed far - reaching reforms designed to impose new rules on executive pay and bonuses , requiring that banks link pay to long - term rather than short - term performance , and that they " claw back " any bonuses received in the face of losses .
Europe wants a financial police force that has powers to slash payments where investments prove to have failed , and to force boardrooms to control levels of speculation .
Europe also wants to block the exercising of stock options for set periods and expose top bank directors to penalties , following huge payouts to failed bank chiefs .
The Obama administration 's approach has been much more tepid , to say the least .
The US financial industry , as expected , is fighting these reforms , but what do we make of a recent quote by President Obama questioning the need for supporting Europe 's proposals .
" Why is it , " he asked during a recent interview , " that we 're going to cap executive compensation for Wall Street bankers but not Silicon Valley entrepreneurs or [ American ] football players ? "
Besides the fact that President Obama was wrong – the National Football League does have salary restrictions – Silicon Valley businesses and NFL quarterbacks do n't cause an economic collapse when they screw up .
It 's very sobering that , if David Letterman read that quote on his TV show and asked his audience : " Who made this clueless statement , former President Bush or President Obama ? " we know what the response would be .
Or would have been .
In response to American foot - dragging , European leader Jean - Claude Juncker said Europe should act on the bonus issue " whether the Americans are with us or not . "
He said that a Europe - only charge " will take on such force over time that the Americans will not be able to sit on the sidelines . "
Many leaders and supporters are beginning to wonder what is causing this growing gap between the Barack Obama that many people saw on the campaign trail , and the Obama they see in the White House ?
Beyond Obama 's oratorical skills , which excited not only American voters but people all over the world , he is mostly untested as a politician .
His previous experience was only a few years in the US Senate and a few years more as a state senator .
A sinking feeling is arising among many that President Obama may not be up to the task , that he may not possess the artful skills needed to accomplish even his own goals .
But it must be recognised that it's not just Obama 's shortcomings that are causing the problem .
The very structure of the American political system is at the heart of these failures .
For example , thwarting Obama on a regular basis is an unrepresentative senate where " minority rule " prevails and undermines what a majority of the country may want .
With two senators elected per state , regardless of population , California with more than 35 million people has the same number of senators as Wyoming with just half a million residents .
This constitutional arrangement greatly favours low population states , many of which tend to be conservative , producing what one political analyst has called " a weighted vote for small - town whites in pickup trucks with gun racks . "
In addition , the senate 's use of that arcane rule known as the " filibuster " means you need 60 out of 100 votes to stop unlimited debate on a bill and move to a vote .
A mere 41 senators , representing as little as 20 % of the nation 's population , can stymie the other 80 % .
Given a vastly unrepresentative senate wielding its anti-majoritarian filibuster , it is hardly surprising that minority rule in the senate consistently undermines majority rule , whether on healthcare , financial industry reform , environmental legislation and many other policies .
Pile on to that an uncompetitive , winner - take - all electoral system , marinated in money and special interest influence , and the sclerotic US political scene is deeply troubling .
None of these anti-democratic structural features are going away any time soon .
Unless Barack Obama is able to demonstrate a better level of political skill than he has shown so far , everyone needs to fasten their seatbelts .
The world is about to enter a challenging phase where the US – the undisputed leader of the free world for the past 60 years – is going to rapidly cede its place at the head of the line .
It appears that the wheels may be coming off the world 's post - war leader , and not even Barack Obama can stop it happening .
UK Police Spying Began With Animal Rights Activists
Then Expanded to Other Groups
There has been a slew of incredible , and disturbing , reporting by the UK Guardian recently on how police have rebranded activism as “ domestic extremism ” and “ domestic terrorism . ”
Environmental activists , antiwar activists , animal rights activists and many more groups have been targeted .
Specifically , police have gathered personal information on thousands of activists who simply attend protests or political meetings , and created massive national databases .
For instance , this “ spotter card ” was distributed to police officers in preparation for protests at Britain ’s largest arms fair .
According to the Guardian :
These so - called “ spotter cards ” are issued by police to identify individuals they consider to be potential troublemakers because they have appeared at a number of demonstrations .
One of the individuals featured at ‘ H’ is Mark Thomas , a comedian and political activist .
He has no criminal record .
In a column , he noted how this scaremongering reflects truly misplaced priorities :
While being wanted outside the arms fair , I was legitimately inside researching a book on the subject , and uncovered four companies illegally promoting “ banned ” torture equipment .
Perhaps the most important bit of information , I think , is buried a bit in the story .
According to this investigative piece by the Guardian :
Acpo ’s national infrastructure for dealing with domestic extremism was set up with the backing of the Home Office in an attempt to combat animal rights activists who were committing serious crimes .
Senior officers concede the criminal activity associated with these groups has receded , but the units dealing with domestic extremism have expanded their remit to incorporate campaign groups across the political spectrum , including anti-war and environmental groups that have only ever engaged in peaceful direct action .
If you ’re familiar with this site and the Green Scare , you know that one of the key points I try to hit home , repeatedly , is that environmental and animal rights activists may be among the first targets in these political crackdowns , but they will not be the last .
By the admission of some government officials in the UK , this has clearly been the case .
Whether or not that has been the official policy in the United States , the same dynamic is at play .
If we do not stop the terrorism rhetoric , legislation , court cases and scare - mongering in its tracks , no activist and no social movement will remain untouched .
Of course , you could always just continue listening to the soundbites of police and government officials , like this one from Anton Setchell , who is in charges of the “ domestic extremism ” unit in the UK .
People who find themselves on the databases , he says , “ should not worry at all . ”
The more I look at Clojure , the more I think it ’s a heroic attempt to Do The Right Thing , in fact All The Right Things , as we move toward the lots - of - not - particularly - fast - cores future .
I ’m still working my head around Clojure ’s concurrency primitives .
We come to understand the things we do n’t by contrast with the things we do ; so I ’m finding contrast between the Clojure and Erlang approaches to messaging instructive .
[ This is part of the Concur . next series .
By way of motivation , consider the recent 100 - core processor from Tilera .
I quote from the coverage , which says that the new chip should offer “ somewhere between seven and eight times the performance of the original Tile64 chip that debuted two years ago .
That is well above and beyond the Moore ’s Law curve , provided your workload can scale across lots of cores . ”
Which , absent a good Concur. next solution , most workloads can’t . ]
Let ’s suppose we ’ve got a program we want to smash across lots of cores , and we want it to count things .
The counts are n’t going to be reported out till the program finishes , so there ’s no reason for the main workload to wait for the counting arithmetic .
So the obvious thing to do is to run the counters off in their own thread ( s ) , send them please - count messages ( no need to wait for the answers ) , and the numbers will all get added up eventually .
In Erlang · Here ’s how you might do it .
Let ’s take the simplest possible approach and have a separate process for each item you ’re counting .
1 - module ( counter ) .
2 - export ( [ new/0 , incr/1 , count / 1 , counter / 0 ] ) . 3 4 new ( ) -> 5 Counter = spawn ( fun counter : counter/0 ) , 6 Counter. 7 8 incr( Counter ) -> 9 Counter ! { incr }. 10 11 count ( Counter ) -> 12 Counter !
{ count , self ( ) } , 13 receive 14 { count , Count } -> 15 Count 16 end .
17 18 %- The counter process
------------------- 19 counter ( ) -> 20 counter_loop ( 0 ) . 21 22 counter_loop ( Count ) -> 23 receive 24 { incr } -> 25 counter_loop ( Count + 1 ) ; 26 { count , Requestor } -> 27 Requestor !
{ count , Count } , 28 counter_loop ( Count ) 29 end .
When a user calls the incr function , line 8 , that just sends off a one - element tuple in fire - and - forget mode .
The counter ’s main loop , starting at line 22 , receives that message at line 24 , increments its counter and waits for the next message .
To find out what the count is , the count function at line 11 sends off a tuple with the symbol count and your process ID , and waits for the counter to report .
This probably is n’t the world ’s most idiomatic Erlang , but I think it illustrates message - passing pretty clearly .
In Clojure · You ’d use an agent , which is a reference to some data ; here ’s an example from Stuart Halloway ’s Programming Clojure book .
First , you get a reference to the agent :
( def counter ( agent 0 ) )
Then , to increment it , you send it a function ; since Clojure has a built - in inc function , this is pretty easy .
( send counter inc )
Now , you could have sent any old function over there that could apply to whatever counter referred to , in this case an integer , and have that function applied ; you can send arguments too .
Clojure takes care of maintaining a thread pool and sequencing the messages to the agent .
If there ’s a chance that the function might block , you can use send - off rather than send ; it uses an expandable thread pool .
Anyhow , to find the current value , you just ask ; either of these will do .
( deref counter ) @counter
Different Strokes ·
The differences between these two approaches are extremely interesting .
I ’m wondering if the class of things you can do with one but not the other is very big or interesting ; I suspect that both can be made isomorphic to the Actor model of computation , although the mapping from Erlang is more direct .
[ Update : ]
Thanks to Phil Hagelberg for this comment , which links to a detailed discussion of the Clojure / Erlang trade - offs hosted by Bill Clementson .
I see lots of stuff to argue about there ...
I ’ll dig into this some more ( I ’m doing a Wide Finder in Clojure to get some hands - on ) , but I place a certain value on first impressions and thought it might be useful to capture some .
This Is Important · Not all the practical sane lock - free solutions to the concurrency conundrum involve message - passing ; for example , see Clojure ’s Atoms and Refs .
But I do think that message - passing is important ; it presents a relatively simple mental model that is n’t terribly hard to think about , it scales naturally outside the shared - global - memory space , and it maps reasonably well onto the semantics actually provided by the underlying operating systems .
Ceremony · Clojure has a lot less .
You do n’t have to create threads or take care of sending and receiving messages .
That counter function involves three lines of code , as opposed to 29 in Erlang .
This is good .
To be fair , a user of the Counter module would only ever have to say incr( Counter ) and count ( Counter ) .
But still , the whole implementation of both sides is just three lines of Clojure .
I do wonder if there are cases where I ’d miss Erlang ’s direct control over the process inventory ?
Sometimes I might be counting twelve things and sometimes twelve thousand .
Coupling · Erlang has a lot less .
I do n’t need to know what kind of a thing I ’m talking to , the messages I send it are just chunks of data , and it gets to decide how to deal with them .
In particular , it can trivially ignore those it does n’t care about .
This seems good to me .
But maybe I ’m kidding myself here ;
As a developer , normally would n’t I be controlling both sides of the conversation ?
And as I look at actual Erlang code , I notice that in practice , a lot of the messages are along the lines of { opcode , argument , argument , ... } — they smell a lot like dressed - up function calls .
Pattern Matching · I think this is actually the important difference between the approaches .
The message you send to a Clojure agent is just a function , and the system goes about applying it like any other .
On the other hand , the receiving end in Erlang gets to pattern - match , which feels natural and looks readable .
Is this the proverbial Computer Science one - more - level - of - indirection which turns out to solve an important problem ?
Scaling ·
My use - case here , counting integers , is awfully limited .
I ’ve built up a “ feel ” for what Erlang message wrangling feels like in practice at significant - program scale .
It ’s one of the reasons I ’m positive on Erlang : it ’s easy to explain and easy to understand ( well , compared to locking ) .
When I stress Clojure a bit , if I find it even easier , that ’d be a big selling point .
If only Clojure were n’t a Lisp ...
A while back — months , maybe a year or so — I tried installing the Vimperator extension for Firefox .
I played around with it for maybe three minutes or so , then decided I should get back to work and turned off the extension rather than slow down my work by trying to learn how to use Vimperator .
The problem is that Vimperator completely changes the way the browser works , making it an entirely keyboard - driven application .
Yes , you can still use the mouse if you really want to , but a lot of stuff becomes much more difficult to accomplish ( if not nearly impossible ) with a mouse instead of the keyboard .
As such , the learning curve seems steep at first , and it felt a bit much for me at that exact moment .
I figured I ’d get back to it later .
I never did get back to it .
Time passed .
I moved to a new laptop , where it was n’t even installed in the first place , and had long since basically forgotten about Vimperator .
Then , last week , I felt inspired to give it another try .
I ’ve started using Vimperator for real this time .
To my surprise , it took me all of about five minutes to get comfortable enough with it to use it for my everyday browsing tasks without feeling like I was substantially hampered .
By the time I had spent ten minutes with it , while some things still did n’t come as easily for me with Vimperator as without it , other things were easier , so that instead of being more difficult to use effectively than Firefox without the extension it was just a trade - off .
By the time I had spent half an hour using it , Vimperator was turning out to give me a slight boost to the efficiency and “ naturalness ” of the browsing experience for me , in the same way that — once one gets past the initial learning curve hump — vi/Vim enhances one ’s productivity when editing text files .
Part of the key to quick familiarization and comfort with Vimperator was , I ’m sure , my familiarity and comfort with Vim .
Another part is the help page that Vimperator opens the first time the browser is restarted after the Vimperator extension is installed .
That help page is just a Web page ( actually a handful of Web pages that link to each other ) stored on the local system , “ installed ” there along with Vimperator itself .
Do n’t worry about closing it and losing track of it ; Vimperator allows you to open it up again simply by way of the : help command .
Nothing to it .
I ’ve added the NumExt extension for Firefox after getting used to Vimperator .
It does nothing but add simple text numbers to all open tabs and add some ( ignorable ) keybindings to allow switching between tabs .
The keybindings are incredibly limited , but I do n’t much care about that .
The reason I wanted numbered tabs was simply to allow me to type 60gt ( for instance ) to immediately go to tab number 60 .
Vimperator allows me to do this by default of course , but if I do n’t know the numbers of the tabs it makes it somewhat more difficult to magically pluck the number for the desired tab out of thin air .
Since I tend to browse with a lot of tabs open ( sometimes more than 150 ; currently 74 of them ) , this — Vimperator +
NumExt — is a very useful combination .
I do n’t have to count to know that the tab to which I want to switch is six to the left of the current tab before typing 6gT any longer ( or , worse , just hit gT over and over again ) .
Instead , I type 60gt and go directly there ( for instance , again ) .
( NOTE : An anonymous commenter below mentioned that a simple configuration option would add numbers to tabs , so I do n’t need the NumExt extension .
It works well .
Setting it within the current Vimperator browsing sessions can be accomplished by using the : set go +=n command , which adds the n option to whatever other options you already have set .
To save options to the configuration file , use the :mkv command . )
I got rid of the View Source With extension , which I used to let me open a text area on a Web form in an external editor ( Vim in a terminal emulator window , naturally ) , when I realized that when the cursor is in a Web form text area I can just hit < Ctrl > + < I > to open an instance of a Vim - like editor to edit the contents of the text area , thus making View Source With redundant for me .
When using : open or : tabopen ( depending on whether I want to open something in the current tab or a new tab , respectively ) , it ’s probably worth knowing you can use tab completion to get the same effects as using the address bar ’s suggestions .
Start typing something like : open sob.apo then hit the Tab key , and you should get a bunch of suggestions for how to finish that URL just as you ’d get suggestions for how to finish it if typed in the normal Firefox address bar .
Cycle through them with the Tab key , just as you would if you were using tab completion at a Unix shell , and hit the Enter key when you ’ve selected the correct URL .
As long as you are n’t in Insert mode , you can use either the O key or the T key , respectively , to get : open or : tabopen started .
Following that , just type in the beginning of the URL you want , and hit < Tab > to get your tab completion .
To copy the URL of the current tab into the clipboard , just type y ( again , when not in Insert mode ) .
It ’s much easier than having to move my hand to the mouse and highlight the URL in the address bar .
Anyway . . . the point is that , after using it for a a month or so , I think Vimperator is great .
Your mileage may vary , I suppose .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The world needs genetically modified crops both to increase food yields and minimize the environmental impact of farming , Britain ’s top science academy said on Wednesday .
The Royal Society said in a report the world faced a “ grand challenge ” to feed another 2.3 billion people by 2050 and at the same time limit the environmental impact of the farm sector .
The world will have to increase food output by 70 percent and invest $ 83 billion annually in developing countries by mid-century , the U.N. ’s Food and Agricultural Organization said earlier this month .
“ The problem is such an acute one , doing that sustainably without eroding soil , overusing fertilizers is an enormous challenge , ” said the chair of the Royal Society report , Cambridge University ’s David Baulcombe .
“ There is n’t a lot more land to use , ” he told Reuters .
“ And from the point of expense and using fossil fuels , we want to use less fertilizer . ”
“ The food supply problem is likely to come to a head 10 , 20 , 30 years from now , ” he said , adding this did n’t leave much time given the research lead time to develop new crops .
The answer would be a range of approaches from hi-tech genetically modified crops to low - tech management approaches such as sowing grass around maize to divert pests , as well as preserving the diversity of natural , wild crop varieties .
Farming indirectly , including deforestation , accounts for a third of greenhouse gases , say scientists , underlining the problem of increasing production simply by clearing more land or using more fertilizers , the biggest source of a powerful greenhouse gas nitrous oxide .
RESEARCH
Britain had to invest an extra 50 ( $ 82.13 million ) to 100 million pounds annually in research to boost innovation in a sector which had lost allure following food over - supply in Europe , the report said .
A combination of changing diets , growing population , demand for farmland for biofuels and high energy prices have stoked food prices and renewed interest in agriculture .
Wednesday ’s report invoked the successes of the Green Revolution of the 1960s , but aimed for a more sustainable approach .
That revolution had more than doubled food output over 30 years but had also degraded soils in some cases .
The world must develop over the next 16 years through genetic modification and conventional breeding varieties of crops resistant to disease , drought , salinity , heat and toxic heavy metals , the report said .
Progress in DNA - sequencing had made more plant genes available for engineering , improving the predictability of results in a “ second generation ” GM approach .
“ We ’re looking at a different base than 10 years ago , ” said Baulcombe .
A combination of the food crisis and the global economic downturn has pushed more than 1 billion people into hunger in 2009 , U.N. agencies said last week , confirming a grim forecast released earlier this year .
The Pressure group Greenpeace said GM crops were a costly distraction from tackling hunger through fighting poverty and helping smallholders in developing countries sell their product .
“ Poverty and hunger are the same thing , ” said Marco Contiero , Greenpeace ’s European GM policy director , who pointed out that the world already produced enough to feed itself , if that were shared fairly and there was less waste .
We ’ve already covered Catchers ( click here to view ) and First Baseman ( click here to view ) , so naturally Second Baseman are next on the schedule .
The position is certainly deeper then it once was , but that does n’t mean that there is n’t a clear separation between the tiers .
Let ’s take a look ( keep in mind that these are going to be fluid throughout the offseason based on news , transactions and further research ) :
Tier 1 :
1. Chase Utley – Philadelphia Phillies
2. Ian Kinsler – Texas Rangers
Tier 2 :
3. Robinson Cano – New York Yankees
4. Brandon Phillips – Cincinnati Reds
5. Brian Roberts – Baltimore Orioles
Tier 3 :
6. Ben Zobrist – Tampa Bay Rays
7. Aaron Hill – Toronto Blue Jays
8. Dustin Pedroia – Boston Red Sox
Tier 4 :
9. Dan Uggla – Florida Marlins
10 . Jose Lopez – Seattle Mariners
Tier 5 :
11 . Ian Stewart – Colorado Rockies
12 . Howie Kendrick – Los Angeles Angels
13 . Rickie Weeks – Milwaukee Brewers
14 . Asdrubal Cabrera – Cleveland Indians
15 . Placido Polanco – Detroit Tigers
Thoughts :
Terrible average or not , Ian Kinsler went 30/30 last season .
A ridiculously unlucky .243 BABIP certainly should not be repeated , meaning he could easily pair a .280 + average with all of those home runs and stolen bases .
Even if he is n’t in the leadoff spot ( Julio Borbon will likely be there ) , he ’s going to be an asset across the board .
Aaron
Hill went from relatively obscure sleeper prior to the 2009 season to among he top 2B in baseball prior to 2010 .
While the power could take a step back ( can he really repeat the 15.1 % HR / FB ) , he easily should remain among the top performers at the position .
Still , his ranking is tenuous at best and can go either way as the offseason and research progress .
Brandon Phillips or Robinson Cano ?
That ’s an interesting debate that we will be closing examining in the offseason .
Will Dan Uggla remain on the Marlins in 2010 ?
We ’ll have to wait and see what happens , but where he ultimately ends up will certainly determine his potential value .
Jose Lopez seems to enter 2010 the same way he did 2009 , a value pick if you miss out on the top names off the board .
Ian Stewart played 21 games at 2B , so he should be eligible there in most formats next season .
He is likely going to be the Rockies starting 3B next season , with Garrett Atkins shipped out , but if that does not play out that way his value will quickly tumble .
Howie Kendrick has been showing signs of all that potential we ’ve been hearing about .
As a last resort , he ’s worth taking the gamble on because if he gets off to a slow start he’d be easily replaced on the waiver wire .
What are your thoughts on the early rankings ?
Who is too high ?
Who is too low ?
Who was omitted that should n’t have been ?

FORT JACKSON , S.C. 
It may come as no surprise that the Army ’s new top drill sergeant idolizes Gen. George S. Patton Jr. , has jumped out of planes 33 times , aces every physical training test and drives a black Corvette with “ noslack ” vanity plates .
But consider this : the sergeant is a woman .
On Tuesday , the Army will make Command Sgt. Maj .
Teresa L. King , 48 , commandant of its drill sergeant school here .
It is a first .
No woman has run one of the Army ’s rigorous schools for drill instructors .
Petite yet imposing , Sergeant Major King seems a drill sergeant at heart , ever vigilant for busted rules : soldiers nodding off in class , soldiers with hair a fraction too long , soldiers who run too slow .
“ Are you crazy ? ” she shouts at one who is walking across a lawn .
“ Get off my grass ! ”
The eighth of 12 children , the sergeant major is the daughter of a sharecropper who grew cucumbers and tobacco near Fort Bragg , N.C .
Her first job in the Army was as a postal clerk , a traditional position for women in those days .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy , initially dubbed Sarko the American for his pro-U.S. stance , is finding it much tougher to deal with Washington than he had anticipated and is recalibrating his policies accordingly .

Stung by perceived snubs from U.S. President Barack Obama and encouraged by the growing importance of the G20 , Sarkozy is increasingly reaching out to non-aligned states in an effort to extend France ’s international influence .
He has forged especially close ties with Brazil , is seeking alliances in central Asia and is intensifying his activities in the Middle East , using multi-billion dollar military and civilian nuclear trade deals as his calling card .
These initiatives are being played out against a discordant tone in Franco - American relations .
This lack of harmony does not constitute a crisis , but is nonetheless raising eyebrows .
“ Sarkozy has clearly been thrown off course in his relations with America , ” said Didier Billion , a senior researcher at the Institute of International and Strategic Relations ( IRIS ) .
“ America remains of primordial importance to him , but things are more complicated than they were a few months ago , ” he said .
Following his election in 2007 , Sarkozy swiftly established a close friendship with the - then U.S. president , George W. Bush , and buried the U.S. - French row over the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
When Obama took office in January , Sarkozy was still glowing from the praise he had received for his accomplished handling of the European Union presidency , and was convinced that he was the natural partner for the new U.S. leader on the world stage .
“ There is room for the two of us , ” he said , expecting his enthusiastic embrace of American values , which carries political risks at home , to pay dividends in Washington .
CHIDING OBAMA
But the chemistry never bubbled .
Analysts say Obama clearly prefers dealing with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Sarkozy is visibly frustrated by the situation .
Sarkozy ’s critics say he is jealous of Obama ’s high profile and hurt by public putdowns -- such as the U.S. president ’s refusal to dine with him during a visit to Paris last June .
Officials say the disconnect is centred on real issues , such as Obama ’s attitude to Iran ’s nuclear ambitions , which has been less hardline than Sarkozy ’s hawkish stance .
“ There is an annoyance about what the French see as naivety in the Obama administration , ” said Bruno Tertrais , a senior research fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research .
Sarkozy ’s frustrations spilled into the open at the United Nations last month , when he appeared to chide Obama publicly .
“ I support America ’s outstretched hand .
But what has the international community gained from these offers of dialogue ?
Nothing but more enriched uranium and centrifuges , ” he said .
There are also real differences of opinion over how to deal with the lingering financial crisis , with a close Sarkozy aide accusing Washington this week of risking global inflation by printing money and “ flooding the world with liquidity ” .
The French government spokesman said on Wednesday that Sarkozy would propose “ a new international monetary organisation which better reflects today ’s world ” when France holds the presidency of the Group of 20 wealthy nations in 2011 .
Roughly translated , this means France wants to challenge the supremacy of the dollar as the world ’s reserve currency .
Ahead of his G20 presidency , Sarkozy has been reaching out to what he calls “ countries which are bridgeheads ” , creating a body of allies that will help give France international clout .
GLOBAL ARMS DEALER
He has signed accords with Kazakhstan , looked to woo India by giving them rare pride of place at Bastille Day celebrations and struck up strong rapports with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva .
Many of his ties are being underpinned by industrial deals , such as the likely sale of Rafale fighter jets to Brazil , with France presenting itself as the perfect partner for states that do not want to rely on U.S. technology .
This ideology was on display this week , when Defence Minister Herve Morin inched closer to an arms deal with Kuwait .
“ Countries in the Gulf know that they can find in France a second partner , one which is a friend of the Americans , but which has its own vision of security and stability , ” he said , deploying the sort of non-alignment language that France used to roll out during the Cold War .
However , the French vision is not to everyone ’s taste .
Sarkozy ’s relations with China are poor and his efforts to build a meaningful union of states bordering the Mediterranean Sea have been blocked by the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The French president is expected to go into diplomatic overdrive in 2011 when he holds the presidency of both the G20 and G8 club of wealthy nations , hoping that foreign policy triumphs would boost his re-election campaign in 2012 .
But some analysts say he risks overplaying his hand .
“ There comes a time when you have to calm things down a bit and take stock , ” said Billion of the Paris - based IRIS .
“ If he does n’t want to do this because it goes against his nature , then I think the end results will be very limited . ”
Mobile phone use drastically reduces our ability to pay attention to things going on around us .
So claims researchers at Western Washington University who have studied the ability of around 300 individuals to notice a unicycling clown in a busy square on the university campus .
Of those using a mobile phone , just 25 per cent noticed the clown , while those walking alone , in pairs , or listening to music noticed the clown more than 50 per cent of the time .
Even worse , the study showed that mobile phone use even affects our ability to walk properly .
Those talking on their phones tended to walk slower , change direction and weave more often and acknowledge other individuals more rarely .
Dr Ira E Hyman
Jr , head researcher of the study , said the results of the survey proved the sense of restricting mobile phone use while driving .
" If people experience so much difficulty performing the task of walking when on a [ mobile ] phone , just think of what this means when put into the context of driving safety , " he noted .
The results of the study are to be published in an upcoming issue of Applied Cognitive Psychology .
Stroke rehabilitation technology which patients can operate in their own homes while playing computer games , is being developed by academics at the University of Southampton .
Therapists , doctors , engineers and psychologists at the University have come together to set up ARM ( Assessment , Rehabilitation , Movement ) – a unique initiative that is using ideas from industrial robots to help patients regain and control movement of the arm and hand after a stroke .
" We felt it was important for people to have fun while they recovered , " said Professor Jane Burridge of the University of Southampton ’s School of Health Sciences .
" In fact we find it ’s often difficult to get them to stop playing the computer games ! "
" As far as we know no - one has tried using this technique – Iterative Learning Control – to help people move again after a stroke and much of the research and rehabilitation into the effects of stroke has focussed on walking .
We believe ARM is a great example of how state - of - the - art control theory , normally used for industrial robots , can be applied to challenges in rehabilitation . "
Professor Burridge is leading the ARM team , which is the first group to take such a comprehensive approach to upper limb stroke rehabilitation .
The pioneering system developed by researchers at the University ’s School of Electronics and Computer Science , working with colleagues in Health Sciences , aims to retrain weak or paralysed arm muscles in patients who have suffered brain damage as a result of a stroke .
After initial successful trials at the University , the ARM researchers are now applying the system to retrain hand and arm function using computer games technology .
Their research has attracted considerable attention and interest , including national and international awards .
" We can use state - of - the - art engineering discoveries to make a real difference to people ’s lives , " said Professor Burridge .
" We are also breaking new ground in understanding how the brain recovers the ability to control movement of the arm and hand after stroke .
This is essential knowledge to enable us to develop and test new treatments . "
In collaboration with the ARM team , NHS hospitals and the Universities of Bournemouth and Keele , have already attracted a grant of £ 2 M from the National Institute for Health Research ( NIHR ) to take rehabilitation technology out of the laboratory and into healthcare practice nationally .
" By assembling a multidisciplinary team and bringing together their insights and expertise we want to improve people ’s quality of life after stroke by helping them regain the use of their arms , ’ said Professor Burridge .
‘ With this new technique our patients can actually see their progress and work to improve their performance , and have fun at the same time ! "
Mr Wattson said he was considering taking legal action against the hospital in order to gain compensation .
He said that he was concerned surgeons may have removed another part of his body during the first operation .
White House says withdrawal from Afghanistan is not an option
When General McChrystal proclaimed that more troops were needed in Afghanistan or the mission would fail President Obama was left with three options ; give the general the troops needed to secure victory , ignore the general and continue to fight with the current troop levels , or withdraw from Afghanistan .
I support giving General McChrystal the troops that he needs to win this war , but if Obama is not willing to commit more troops than I find it more acceptable to withdraw from Afghanistan than I do to fight a war that the commanding general admits is not winnable under the current circumstances .
Today the White House has stated that withdrawal from Afghanistan is not an option .
This means that the president is now faced with two options ; giving the general the troops needed to secure victory , or continue to fight a war under the conditions that the commanding general admitted will fail .
Now that Obama has seemingly made the decision to stay in Afghanistan , a decision that I agree with , I can only hope that he will provide General McChrystal with the troops that he needs to win this war .
We have attempted to fight this politically correct type of war in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It was n’t until President Bush finally decided to send the troops necessary to win the Iraq war that we finally were able to secure the victory that is now leading to the draw down of troops in Iraq .
This should prove to be a teachable moment to President Obama .
Now that we are going to stay in Afghanistan it is time to send in the needed troops and secure a victory .
A state of emergency has been declared in San Juan Officials in Puerto Rico have ordered the evacuation of a whole neighbourhood near the capital after an explosion at an oil refinery triggered a major fire .
The blast at an oil refinery near San Juan , was measured to a strength of a 2.8 - magnitude quake .
Puerto Rico's governor declared a state of emergency in the capital and four nearby towns , moving 1,500 people .
No -one was killed but hours after it began on Friday , fire - fighters were struggling to dampen the flames .
Two people at a nearby US army base were injured .
Some 130 fire - fighters , supported by the National Guard , tackled the fire which at its peak saw flames reach 100 ft ( 30 m ) above the oil centre .
The US aviation authority diverted plane traffic from the area due to the billowing black smoke and some prisoners in a high security facility were moved across the island .
' Inferno '
The fire , at the facility owned by the Caribbean Petroleum Corp , first destroyed 11 tanks before spreading to others containing flammables such as jet fuel , bunker fuel and petrol .
" There are 17 tanks ablaze , and fire - fighters are cooling the rest to avoid their explosion , " Governor Luis Fortuno said .
Residents were advised to remain indoors to avoid the thick black smoke set off by the fires .
When I went outside , I saw the big orange glow .
It looked like daylight over there
Tamara Rivera , San Juan housewife
In pictures : Puerto Rico blaze Officials said they did not know what had caused the explosion .
The FBI was reported to be helping the authorities in their investigations .
One of the first fire - fighters to arrive on the scene described it as an " inferno " .
Resident Tamara Rivera , 37 , told Reuters she initially believed an earthquake had struck .
" But when I went outside , I saw the big orange glow .
It looked like daylight over there , " she said .
Puerto Rico is the US self - governing commonwealth in the Caribbean .

Roger Harrabin reports on the Chinese car maker BYD , which is about to release a vehicle capable of revolutionising the world of motoring , if its claims prove correct .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement BYD says that its new E6 electric car due out before the end of the year will do 250 miles ( 400 km ) on a single charge .
This is a very big number .
The Tesla electric sports car does almost as much , but has little room for anything else in the car but the battery .
The E6 is roomy with space for five passengers and a good - sized boot .
The battery tucks under the back seat .
It needs 7 - 8 hours with a domestic plug to charge the car but BYD - it stands for Build Your Dreams - says a specially developed fast charging point with a lead the diameter of a fire hose will fill up the car in just one hour .
You can get half a charge in only 10 minutes .
If these claims are accurate and if BYD can persuade either the Chinese government or a Chinese city to install a network of the fast chargers , then this large hatchback could be the vehicle that makes the breakthrough for electric cars .
Extraordinary step ?
Let us look at the accuracy of the claim first .
BYD is already the world 's number two in rechargeable batteries , and for the E6 it is using a ferrous battery it has developed itself .
There is a reputational risk in exaggerating the claims of a product .
And that could be translated into a legal risk if people buy shares in the publicly quoted company as a result of misleading information .
For the E6 to succeed , the company will need a network of fast chargers
The green group WWF has just appointed the Chinese energy expert Dr Yang Fuqiang as its head of global solutions .
He told BBC News that he would reserve judgment on BYD 's claims .
" If they are true , this is an extraordinary step which will prove highly significant , " he said .
So what about the other question about support for a network of charging stations ?
The Chinese government has spent more than any other on its green fiscal stimulus and there is supposed to be support for electric cars .
But BYD 's Rebecca
Wang said that although BYD hoped for co-operation , none was yet forthcoming .
The E6 will sell for £ 30,000 and is aimed initially at the eco-conscious California market .
When the price comes down with mass production , it 'll be rolled out properly in China .
Whether the claims are accurate to the letter or not , the E6 is a marker that China expects to dominate energy storage technologies - which could become much more important if the world makes a significant shift towards renewable power .
Even if they are run on coal - fired power , electric cars still produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a petrol car because they are inherently more efficient , according to the UK 's chief energy scientist David MacKay .
This efficiency is increased if you can run an automobile fleet on either off - peak electricity at night or on intermittent power from , say , wind farms .
Power play I chanced to share lunch recently with the CEO of a major European car manufacturer .
He told me that China intended to become the world leader in battery technology .
" And if that 's what [ China ] wants , it will happen , " he said .
Simple as that .
But the question remains if China has the cars to match its batteries .
As a car maker , BYD is very much at the " functional " end of the Chinese market - a farmer 's car , my Beijing producer Jasmin called it .
There may be a risk that BYD 's batteries could be undone by poor build quality .
The ability to attract top entrepreneurs into this field can only be good for China
Yu Jie , The Climate Group BYD 's chief executive Wang Chuan - Fu is certainly ambitious , and money is certainly not a limitation .
Following a huge investment by Warren Buffet , he has just made it to the top of the Forbes Rich list for China .
He is joined at the top table by another green billionaire , Shi Zhengrong who made a fortune from the Suntech solar PV firm in just four years .
There is such a buzz about the Clean tech gold rush in China at the moment that some analysts warn of the possibility of a bubble .
The Climate Group is an international non-profit organisation that works with governments and businesses with the aim of building a low carbon economy .
It is keen to dispel such pessimism .
Yu Jie , its head of research in Beijing , told BBC News that if the bubble popped , it would only deflate slightly .
" Everybody wants to get into clean energy at the moment , " she said .
" It can only be for the good .
And the ability to attract top entrepreneurs into this field can only be good for China , which has often depended on other people 's technology in the past . "
When we arrived at the BYD plant , the workers were on holiday so there was no activity to film .
And the E6 itself was nowhere to be seen .
But we eventually managed to persuade our hosts that , having travelled all the way from the UK , we deserved a sneak preview , and the E6 itself was unveiled .
My cameraman
Al implied this negotiation might have been part of the company 's publicity strategy .
We will see .

You 're anonymous when you post comments online — except when you 're not .
Though many Internet users still believe that their identities are as hidden as they choose to make them , online anonymity is not always guaranteed and , in fact , there 's no way to stay truly anonymous .
There is always a company somewhere that has information that can be traced back to you , whether it 's Google or your ISP , and judges have shown themselves willing to issue subpoenas to unmask anonymous posters .
But what determines whether or not you will be unmasked ?
Unfortunately , it 's hard to say — there is no black - and - white line to be crossed .
There is , however , a gray area that you could find yourself in if you do the wrong things .
Really piss people off
The first step to getting yourself unmasked online is obvious enough : give someone a reason to go after you by being as obnoxious and offensive as possible in a series of online comments , whether on your own blog or on a forum , or everywhere in between .
Of course , being offensive is n't against the law , and is actually protected by the First Amendment as free speech .
However , the more attention you draw to yourself in this manner , the more likely it is that someone you 're targeting will attempt to sue you .
It 's what you do next that could determine whether you are walking directly into the gray zone or not .
Fail to file an objection
" The civil system is set up by default to allow for the disclosure of information , " Electronic Frontier Foundation staff attorney Matt Zimmerman told Ars .
" By default , unless someone objects to a specific request for info , someone 's identity is most likely to be disclosed . "
In a civil lawsuit , a litigant is often allowed to send out subpoenas in the name of the court — without the court 's prior approval — to Google , Yahoo , or wherever in order to request information about someone , Zimmerman explained .
This can even be done before filing a lawsuit in some states , and some entities use it as a way to find out who their detractors are without ever drawing up a complaint .
If the accused user does n't file an objection within some period of time ( Google 's is 20 days ) , the company will usually go ahead and turn that information over .
One of the highest profile examples of this is a recent case that pitted a former Vogue model against an anonymous blogger posting on a site called " Skanks of NYC . "
The blogger made numerous posts about the model in question , which the model ( Liskula Cohen ) argued were defamation — she alleged that she was decidedly not a skank and that the statements were meant to ruin her reputation .
In August , the court agreed that the posts could be found by a jury as defamatory and gave the green light to subpoena Google for the identity of the blogger , Rosemary Port .
Port turned out to be a loose acquaintance of Cohen 's who had been to various parties with the model around NYC and apparently had an axe to grind .
Since then , this case has become even more controversial , as Port has talked about suing Google for compromising her privacy and otherwise ruining her life .
Zimmerman did n't seem to believe she would have a case , though .
" If that blogger wanted to appeal the decision to subpoena her identity , she could have , " he said .
" I do n't know why she did n't . "
Of course , the onus is n't entirely on the person being sued if they fail to respond to the subpoena .
Zimmerman noted that many service providers ( Google included ) will send a notification to the user 's e-mail address , only for it to end up in a spam folder or not get noticed for weeks .
And often , the person receiving the notice do n't know what to do and does n't have the resources to object , leaving them stuck with no response at all .
Zimmerman said that it's not surprising that the threat of a lawsuit or being outed might chill speech for those who do n't have the legal know - how to oppose these subpoenas .
Seriously : make 'em work
If you do file the objection , the court will be forced to ask whether the complaint alleges something that is actionable and whether the information is absolutely necessary for the case .
Luckily for you , the courts have often sided with anonymous posters in these cases , such as a case involving anonymous donut shop critics , a blogger critical of a local police department , and a blog commenter who targeted a Massachusetts real estate developer .
In these situations , the judge felt that these commenters were acting within their free speech rights , and the ultimate decision was that the commenters were protected by the First Amendment .
Another judge in California recently acknowledged that there may be some scenario in which unmasking commenters is OK , but that the litigant would have to jump through some extra hoops to get the information .
Police officer Calvin Chang had previously settled a lawsuit with UC Davis over race and sexual orientation discrimination , but believed that recent comments on the Vanguard of Davis blog may have been from university insiders attempting to discredit him — a breach of the settlement he had reached with the university .
Chang attempted to subpoena to have the commenters identified , but the judge did not immediately go along with it .
Instead , she ruled that Chang could hire an investigator to find out whether the commenters were " managing agents of the university . "
If they are , then they would indeed be in breach of Chang 's settlement and the judge will permit their identities to be revealed so that he could pursue further action .
Of course , the only way to truly avoid being outed and sued is to avoid saying controversial things online in the first place , but that goes against the open spirit of the Internet .
" You do n't get to pick and choose whose speech is important and whose is n't , " Zimmerman said .
Unless litigants have a legitimate need for people 's personal information to go forward with a lawsuit , it 's worth fighting back to not only protect your own rights , but the rights of others online as well .
ADELPHI , Md. 
A federal advisory panel voted narrowly on Tuesday to recommend a ban on Percocet and Vicodin , two of the most popular prescription painkillers in the world , because of their effects on the liver .
The two drugs combine a narcotic with acetaminophen , the ingredient found in popular over - the - counter products like Tylenol and Excedrin .
High doses of acetaminophen are a leading cause of liver damage , and the panel noted that patients who take Percocet and Vicodin for long periods often need higher and higher doses to achieve the same effect .
Acetaminophen is combined with different narcotics in at least seven other prescription drugs , and all of these combination pills will be banned if the Food and Drug Administration heeds the advice of its experts .
Vicodin and its generic equivalents alone are prescribed more than 100 million times a year in the United States .
Laureen Cassidy , a spokeswoman for Abbott Laboratories , which makes Vicodin , said , “ The F.D.A. will make a final determination and Abbott will follow the agency ’s guidance . ”
The US government does n’t have to reveal information about phone companies that may have spied illegally on Americans because those phone companies are an “ arm of the government , ” the US Justice Department argued in a recent court case .
In a lawsuit over the Bush administration ’s decision to give immunity to telecom companies over its warrantless wiretapping program , the Justice Department argued that it does n’t have to publicly reveal what it discussed with the phone companies because those discussions were “ inter - agency communications , ” explains Ryan Singel at Wired .
ADVERTISEMENT
He cites a passage from a court document in which the department argues that “ the communications between the agencies and telecommunications companies regarding the immunity provisions of the proposed legislation have been regarded as intra-agency … . ”
Singel was reporting on privacy watchdog group Electronic Frontier Foundation ’s two - year - long legal battle with the DoJ over access to those communications .
In 2008 , the Bush administration passed a law granting reotroactive immunity to phone companies that had participated in the administration ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
After news reports in 2007 suggested that the phone companies had lobbied the government to have those protections put in place , the EFF launched a freedom - of - information request to have discussions between the Justice Department and the phone companies made public .
When the government refused , the EFF took the matter to court .
On September 24 , a US District Court judge sided with the EFF and ordered the government to “ release more records about the lobbying campaign to provide immunity to the telecommunications giants that participated in the NSA ’s warrantless surveillance program , ” the EFF stated .
The judge gave the Justice Department until last Friday to hand over the documents .
But , late on Thursday , the government appealed for a 30 - day stay of the judge ’s order .
That order was refused , but the judge has delayed any further decisions on the case for another week .

CONGRESS ‘A MERE APPENDAGE ’ OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH ?
Blogger Marcy Wheeler at FireDogLake says there are more interesting revelations about the government ’s attitude towards constitutional powers in the delay request it filed last week .
“ The language attempting to protect agency discussions with Congress describe Congress as a mere appendage to the executive branch which did not , in 2008 , have its own distinct constitutional interest in legislation concerning matters in which the executive branch had been found to have flouted duly passed laws , ” Wheeler writes .
She cites the following passages from the court filing ( PDF ) :
ADVERTISEMENT
Given the purpose and role of the communications in the agencies ’ own deliberations , the agencies have regarded their communications with Congress as intra-agency documents under the foregoing lines of authority … .
… In providing the agencies with information and views about legislative options for use in the development of the Executive Branch ’s own legislative position , Congress was participating in a common effort with the Executive Branch to advance the public interest .
“ It is a fascinating comment on the state of separation of powers that Congress would be described by the executive branch as a mere appendage to the executive branch , ” Wheeler wrote .
ADVERTISEMENT
She also argued that there is a fundamental contradiction in the government claiming that companies it contracted to do ( potentially illegal ) work would be treated as government agencies :
" With due respect to Malaysia , I came to finish something , " Mr Robert told Reuters before setting off .
" You know , climbing the Petronas [ Towers ] all the way to the top is one of my dreams , maybe because I am having the motivation , maybe also I am a little bit stubborn . "
On his two previous attempts in 1998 and 2007 Mr Robert was seized by security guards when he reached the twin Petronas Towers ' sixtieth floor , prompting secrecy this time .
Detroit News , March 25 , 1931 .
Strikes me that the deathbed statement of an atheist should carry more and not less legal weight .
The guy was sticking to his godless guns while staring eternity in the face , no ?
Note that the “ Negro ” appended to Laura Wright ’s name is intended to contextualize the whole scene .
Had Wilbur not also been black , he would have identified as white .
It was journalism ’s equivalent to the “ one drop ” principle .

With a quick lick of paint , your wi-fi connection could be secured Researchers say they have created a special kind of paint which can block out wireless signals .
It means security - conscious wireless users could block their neighbours from being able to access their home network - without having to set up encryption .
The paint contains an aluminium - iron oxide which resonates at the same frequency as wi-fi - or other radio waves - meaning the airborne data is absorbed and blocked .
By coating an entire room , signals can't get in and , crucially , can't get out .
Developed at the University of Tokyo , the paint could cost as little as £ 10 per kilogram , researchers say .
Cost - effective security
The makers say that for businesses it's a quick and cheap way of preventing access to sensitive data from unauthorised users .
Presently , most companies have to invest in complicated encryption software to deter hackers .
Speaking on the BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme , Shin-ichi Ohkoshi , who is leading the project , explained how the paint could have many uses beyond security .
" In a medical setting , you could transmit large volumes of data from a medical device , such as an endoscope , to a computer .
You could block phone signals from outside and stop people 's phones ringing during the movie .
Shin-ichi Ohkoshi , University of Tokyo " By painting a solution containing our magnetic particles on the walls , you would quickly , and effectively , shield the room from stray electromagnetic radiation from outside . "
While paints blocking lower frequencies have been available for some time , Mr Ohkoshi 's technology is the first to absorb frequencies transmitting at 100GHz ( gigahertz ) .
Signals carrying a larger amount of data - such as wireless internet - travel at a higher frequency than , for example , FM radio .
" I 'm working on a material that can absorb a larger range of frequencies .
We are capable of making a paint that can absorb over 200 gigahertz . "
He hopes that soon the technology could be woven into clothing .
" We 're not sure about the true effects of electromagnetic waves , in this range , on the human body .
" We 're assuming that excessive exposure could be bad for us .
Therefore we 're trying to make protective clothes for young children or pregnant women to help protect their bodies from such waves . "
At the movies
The paint could also provide some much - needed relief during nights out at the cinema .
DIGITAL PLANET Digital Planet is the weekly technology programme broadcast from the BBC World Service
It is broadcast on Tuesday at 1232GMT and repeated at 1632GMT , 2032GMT and on Wednesday at 0032GMT
It is also available as a podcast
It can be found on the social networks Facebook and Orkut " Our current mobile phones work at much lower frequencies , around 1.5 gigahertz .
But , our material can also absorb frequencies that low , so you could block phone signals from outside and stop people 's phones ringing during the movie , " he said .
As well as helping to keep the cinema quiet , the paint may also pave the way for higher quality screens .
" Movie pictures are beamed on the screen by the projector at the back of the cinema .
But in the future , you could use a data link that works with millimetre waves .
" You would have problems with interference , unless you painted the wall and ceiling of the theatre with an absorbent material like ours .
" In fact , we 've had an order from an American company keen to use our ink in its movie theatre - we 've just sent them a sample . "
' Nothing new '
Some security experts remain unconvinced by the paint .
" The use of electromagnetic shielding techniques are nothing new , " said Mark Jackson , security engineer at Cisco UK .
" They have been utilised by highly sensitive environments for many years . "
Mr Jackson notes that while the paint may block eavesdroppers , it would not prevent other types of hackers or intruders .
" Paint that blocks RF based Wi-Fi transmissions does not in any way remove the need to ensure a robust security model is deployed , " he added .
" Surely the thought of having to redecorate a building in order to provide Wi-Fi security is more costly & complex than security functionality available in even the cheapest of Wi-Fi access points ? " he said .

BANGKOK ( Reuters ) -
The world is in danger of spending its “ carbon budget ” by about 2025 and risks temperatures rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius unless nations adopt a flexible carbon accounting system , conservation group WWF says in a report .
The report by Dutch energy consultancy Ecofys and commissioned by WWF , says rich nations must cut emissions by 80 percent by 2050 and global emissions of greenhouse gases must be cut by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2030 .
Failure to do so would lead to rapid warming .
The report , “ Sharing the effort under a global carbon budget ” was released on Friday on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in Bangkok that are trying to find ways for nations to sign up to a broader effort to fight climate change .
The U.N. climate panel says that to limit the average rise in global temperatures to 2 deg C by 2050 , emissions need to peak or stay below 450 parts per million .
To reach that limit , rich nations would need to cut emissions at home and help poorer nations curb the pace of their emissions .
The report lays out three methods to help nations distribute the sharing of the budget by helping developing nations to continue to grow their economies and to recognize financing of clean - energy programs by rich nations in poorer states .
“ If we relax on the trajectory of one country , another country needs to pick up the bill , ” the report says .
It says the carbon budget can be defined as the amount of tolerable global emissions over a period of time to limit the average global temperature increase to 2 deg C .
“ The budget is from 1990 to 2050 , ” Stephan Singer , WWF ’s director of global energy policy , told Reuters .
“ Within the past 18 years , we have used up approximately 40 percent of the budget of 1990 - 2050 .
If we keep on doing what we ’re doing now and including the increase of emissions , we have wasted , not only time , we ’ve spent our budget by about 2025 . ”
According to the report , the cumulative global greenhouse gas emissions excluding land use change and forestry is forecast to be 1,660 billion tons between 1990 and 2050 .
Between 2010 and 2050 , it is 970 billion tons .
But the report , looking at the budget out to 2100 , says because mankind has already increased its global emissions substantially since 1990 , the remaining net cumulative budget between 2009 and 2100 is limited to 870 billion tons of carbon dioxide - equivalent .
“ This translates to an allowable global annual emissions on average for the next 91 years of no more than 9.5 GtCO2 - eq ( billion metric tons CO2 - equivalent ) , or about 20 percent of today ’s net global emissions , ” the report says .
It says in order to stay within the boundary of the global emissions budget , sometime from 2060 net global emissions must be negative , with little emissions from energy use and greater soaking up of CO2 from forests and other methods .
ABC 's Nightline ran a special on Scientology this weekend .
It was typically strange and disconcerting , but nothing necessarily new .
Except :
What could provoke their spokesman to storm off the set of an interview ?
We get to learn .
Paging Lord Xenu .
Martin Bashir was grilling Scientology spokesthing Tommy Davis regarding Xenu , the intergalactic god who did or did not come to Earth 75 million years ago to bury his people in volcanos .
Bashir asks Davis a very simple question :
Do you guys believe in this crazy shit ?
Is Xenu and his people - pod volcano plot part of your religion ?
Etc. Watch what Davis does , starting at about 2:45 for context , but 3:40 if you just want to see him freak out and stomp off .
Why would Davis stomp off ?
Bashir was n't asking him to explain Xenu , or justify Xenu , or even to provide context around Xenu .
All he was asking was :
Do you guys believe in an intergalactic God named Xenu ?
Is this part of your religion ?
How is that an unfair line of inquiry ?
That 's like feigning indignation at a line of inquiry asking whether or not Jews have horns .
How can you ?
Of course we do n't , you moron !
But if we do , well , it 's not a silly question , is it ?
Is it ?!?
The Washington Post reports the Justice Department “ recommended that Congress move swiftly with legislation that would protect the government ’s ability to collect a variety of business and credit card records and to monitor terrorism suspects with roving wiretaps ” set to expire 31 December 09 .
Carrie Johnson and Ellen Nakashima report at The Washington Post :
The three provisions set to expire Dec. 31 allow investigators to monitor through roving wiretaps suspects who may be trying to escape detection by switching cellphone numbers , obtain business records of national security targets , and track “ lone wolves ” who may be acting alone on behalf of foreign powers or terrorist groups .
The government has not employed the lone wolf provision , but department officials want to ensure they can do so in the future .
Obama ’s approach to electronic surveillance has been closely watched since he shifted positions during the presidential campaign last year , casting a vote to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act over the objections of liberals in his party .
That law granted telecommunication companies immunity from lawsuits by Americans who argued that their privacy had been violated in an electronic data collection program … .
The Justice Department inspector general issued blistering audits in 2007 and 2008 , finding , for instance , that FBI agents had used demands for information known as national security letters in many cases where they were not authorized and had employed other tools called exigent letters to quickly obtain data without proper follow - up .
“ As a presidential candidate , Barack Obama said he would take a close look at the law , based on his past expertise in constitutional law , ” Devlin Barrett reported at the Associated Press .
“ Back in May , President Obama said legal institutions must be updated to deal with the threat of terrorism , but in a way that preserves the rule of law and accountability , ” adding :
The lone wolf provision was created to conduct surveillance on suspects with no known link to foreign governments or terrorist groups .
It has never been used , but the administration says it should still be available for future investigations .
“ It should come as no surprise that President Barack Obama supports renewing the provisions , which were part of the Patriot Act approved six weeks after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , ” David Kravets writes at Wired .
“ As an Illinois senator in 2008 , he voted to allow the warrantless monitoring of Americans ’ electronic communications if they are communicating overseas with somebody the government believes is linked to terrorism .
That legislative package , which President George W. Bush signed , also immunized the nation ’s telecommunication companies from lawsuits charging them with being complicit with the Bush administration ’s warrantless , wiretapping program .
That program was also adopted in the wake of Sept. 11 . ”
On Tuesday , National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair said that the U.S. is spending $ 75 billion a year on “ intelligence activities ” , Adam Entous reports at Reuters ( h/t : Jason Ditz ) , adding :
It has disclosed the amount spent by the 16 intelligence agencies — $ 47.5 billion in 2008 alone — but those figures did not incorporate the military ’s intelligence activities , officials said .
Blair , in a conference call with reporters , explained that his four - year strategy was not set up on the “ traditional fault line … between military intelligence and national intelligence . ”
“ This whole distinction between military and non-military intelligence is no longer relevant , ” Blair said .
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on the U.S.A. Patriot Act [ sic ] next week .
As the month of July petered out , so did the patience of Alan Cox , who ended his long tenure as maintainer of the Linux kernel ’s tty subsystem .
Following what seemed to be a fairly bitter argument between Cox and Linus Torvalds over a particularly controversial bug , Cox announced that he would not remain in the role any longer .
“ I ’ve had enough , ” Cox wrote in a frustrated email on the Linux Kernel Mailing List , announcing his decision .
“ If you think that problem is easy to fix you fix it .
Have fun . ”
Bloggers far and wide chimed in with their regrets about the rift , with several pointing to the pressures of working on the kernel as likely causes .
‘ You ’ve Made the Right Move ’
“ Thanks for all the hard work .
Good luck to the next maintainer , ” wrote Hatta among the more than 800 comments on Slashdot , for example .
“ Not much else to say . ”
Then again : “ How about , ‘ Nice work Linus , you ’ll have the entire kernel back to yourself any day now , I ’m sure ’ , ” suggested dotgain .
For Linux developers , one ’s “ success is proportional to the thickness of your skin , ” dotgain added .
“ Your willingness to sit there and listen to argue with some other twit whose age you guess at 13 over something you know is n’t furthering your project one bit .
“ I ’m sorry , Alan .
I ’m really sorry , but you ’ve made the right move .
Thanks for everything , ” dotgain added .
‘ Like a War Zone ’
“ Kernel hacking is an intense affair , ” blogger Robert Pogson told LinuxInsider .
“ Folks are working in a world unknown by most , with successive crises and pressure to deliver . ”
The atmosphere is “ like a war zone , ” Pogson explained .
“ Everyone is trying to solve the problems they can see , and in the fog of war , mistakes happen .
“ Alan Cox has been great for Linux , ” he added .
“ I hope he can regroup and return to contribute .
If not , I wish him well in future endeavors . ”
Indeed , “ the tty layer is probably the oldest Linux kernel subsystem , so pretty much any change is a weird game of Russian roulette , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack agreed .
“ It ’s a thankless job , and I guess it ’s not too surprising Alan Cox finally burned out on working with it . ”
‘ Why Code for Free ? ’
With so much scrutiny placed on the pressures and frustrations associated with working on the Linux kernel , a series of articles on LinuxPlanet , on the other hand , had a decidedly restorative effect .
Specifically , in her three - part series entitled , “ Why Code for Free ? ” Carla Schroder talked to a variety of developers about why they choose to work with FOSS .
One reason is the “ chance to write the sort of code YOU want to write , not what your boss wants you to write or some committee says you should write , ” developer Akkana Peck told LinuxPlanet in part two of the series , for example .
“ Experience , community , and a sense of achievement , ” on the other hand , were among the reasons cited by Daniel Pittman in part three .
‘ Friends and Family Cannot Relate ’
Indeed , it was striking to see — in the very same week —
Cox ’s frustration on the one hand , and the words of ardent FOSS developers and supporters on the other .
Linux Girl could n’t resist using that juxtaposition as the starting point for a closer look .
“ I am not a kernel hacker , but I have been in many intense situations where frustration levels rise , ” Pogson told LinuxInsider .
“ Friends and family cannot relate , so it is easy to become depressed , angry and distracted .
The result is lower performance and a toll on one ’s life forces . ”
FLOSS projects “ will always have collisions of egos / goals / viewpoints , and we should expect people who are motivated to disagree , ” Pogson added .
“ This does not break FLOSS or hold it back .
It is a meritocracy , with survival of the fittest ideas and idealists . ”
‘ Dozens of Possible Reasons ’
There are frustrations everywhere , Slashdot blogger drinkypoo pointed out .
“ This does not , however , differentiate Linux from commercial software offerings in any way , save that someone unhappy at their paying job is less likely to jump ship immediately , ” he told LinuxInsider .
“ They will probably write a bunch of lousy , uninspired code first . ”
There are “ dozens of possible reasons for contributing to FOSS , ” drinkypoo added , “ ranging from feeding the ego to simple pragmatism ” — that is , “ not wanting to maintain a fork of some code that you ’ve had to modify , and wanting someone else to do it for you . ”
‘ FLOSS Is a Huge Opportunity ’
One of the big advantages of the FOSS world is that “ there are plenty of projects with a low barrier to entry , where established developers will help newbies get established , provide free advice and so forth , ” Chris Travers , a Slashdot blogger who works on the LedgerSMB project , told LinuxInsider .
“ The low barrier to entry and the sense of community that comes with it are very strong compelling incentives to do this work even absent financial considerations , ” he explained .
Indeed , “ developers of software are like students , ” Pogson agreed .
“ In many fields , it is hard for newbies to gain that first position to put on the resume , so FLOSS is a huge opportunity for them to make a name for themselves and to improve their skills . ”
‘ It ’s Good for Improving My Skills ’
Even for experienced coders , the educational benefits of open source can be compelling .
“ Why open source ?
Because it ’s good for improving my skills , ” Mack explained .
“ Usually I work for smaller companies , and I ’m often one of the best or the best programmer on staff , ” he said .
“ While that ’s good for the ego , it ’s not good for my personal skills development .
Open source lets me interact with people who are better and more experienced than I am . ”
‘ Paid Developers Are Usually the Majority ’
However , as also noted in the LinuxPlanet series , “ I would suggest that a lot of FOSS developers do n’t ‘ code for free ’ , ” Travers pointed out .
“ They get paid by somebody to do the coding .
“ Once again , the low barrier to entry — no job interview , free help — helps developers become established and newbies often help direct more paid work towards the veterans , ” he explained .
In the end , FOSS developers code for many reasons , Travers asserted : “ Some need the intellectual stimulation .
Some do so for money .
Some for glory .
Some do so just for fun .
However at least in projects I have been deeply involved in , the paid developers are usually the majority . ”
‘ Scratching an Itch ’
Most FOSS developers are either paid or “ scratching an itch , ” Slashdot blogger hairyfeet agreed – though the latter may or may not create results that are useful for “ Sally Home User , who has no IT experience at all , ” he asserted .
With so many developers and “ so many ideas on the way things should go , ” Linux may also suffer from a lack of direction as a result , hairyfeet told LinuxInsider .
“ It would take a leader that made Steve Jobs and Patton look like wimps to get THAT many developers with THAT many egos to all fall in line , ” he added .
‘ This Is What Humans Do ’
Nevertheless , most seem to agree that the rewards are many for those who get involved — whether for pay or not .
“ While we may have multiple contracts , employers and hobbies , a developer can contribute to FLOSS even if not working for pay doing so , ” Pogson noted .
“ Sometimes the most gifted among us have multiple talents and can be gainfully employed for one while doing amazing work in another field , ” he explained .
“ It is all good .
This is what humans do .
They need a purpose in life , and for some , that purpose includes coding . ”

How disgusting .
Code Pink supports the mass murder of Afghans .
Murder is apparently fine with Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin if it results in women ’s rights .
Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin gets manhandled at a McCain - Palin event last year .
Now that Obama ’s in the White House , she supports killing Afghan babies .
“ We have been feeling a sense of fear of the people of the return of the Taliban .
So many people are saying that , ‘ If the US troops left the country , would collapse .
We ’d go into civil war . ’
A palpable sense of fear that is making us start to reconsider that , ” Benjamin told The Christian Science Monitor .
“ The apparent shift in policy comes in the wake of a week - long trip to Afghanistan by Code Pink members , where activists were surprised to find a lot of support among women ’s rights activists for maintaining the US and NATO presence in the country , ” writes Daniel Tencer for Raw Story .
Some observers have been pointing out for years that the Western troop presence in Afghanistan is the principal reason that women in the country are now able to get an education , and that there is now at least a modicum of gender equality in Afghanistan .
Many observers fear that the withdrawal of troops could allow the return of severe discrepancies between women ’s rights and men ’s rights in Afghanistan , as well as widespread violence against women .
But here ’s what Tencer , Benjamin , and corporate media are not telling you — the Taliban was created by Pakistan ’s ISI and the CIA in 1994 with Saudi money .
Phil Gasper explains :
The U.S. government was well aware of the Taliban ’s reactionary program , yet it chose to back their rise to power in the mid-1990s .
The creation of the Taliban was “ actively encouraged by the ISI and the CIA , ” according to Selig Harrison , an expert on U.S. relations with Asia .
“ The United States encouraged Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to support the Taliban , certainly right up to their advance on Kabul , ” adds respected journalist Ahmed Rashid .
When the Taliban took power , State Department spokesperson Glyn Davies said that he saw “ nothing objectionable ” in the Taliban ’s plans to impose strict Islamic law , and Senator Hank Brown , chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Near East and South Asia , welcomed the new regime : “ The good part of what has happened is that one of the factions at last seems capable of developing a new government in Afghanistan . ”
“ The Taliban will probably develop like the Saudis .
There will be Aramco [ the consortium of oil companies that controlled Saudi oil ] , pipelines , an emir , no parliament and lots of Sharia law .
We can live with that , ” said another U.S. diplomat in 1997 .
“ I think [ the Taliban ] was part of your past and our past , and the ISI and CIA created them together , ” Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari told NBC during an interview in May .
The Taliban is a custom - made enemy along with al - Qaeda designed to keep the GWOT rolling for the merchants of death — the corporate media likes to call them the “ defense industry ” — and as an excuse to invade small countries in the Middle East , south central Asia , and now Africa .
An AP photo of an Afghan girl killed by U.S. troops in the Azizabad village of the Shindand district of Herat province in 2008 .
She ’ll never grow up to enjoy the rights Code Pink says they want for all Afghan women .
Prior to Code Pink , Medea Benjamin set - up Global Exchange , an “ anti-globalization ” organization that took money from globalist foundations , including the Ford Foundation , John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation , Rubin Foundation , and Tides Foundation .
As noted by journalist Bob Feldman , these foundations are connected to the CIA , the Council on Foreign Relations , and the Trilateral Commission .
“ Are the interests of the people being served by ‘ dissidents ’ who are being subsidized by the agencies of the ruling class whom they should be exposing ?
What does this say about the motivations behind the Left establishment ’s ideological warfare against conspiracy researchers , and their adoption of an increasingly watered - down analytical view which fails to look closely at the inner power structures and conspiracies of the ruling elite ? ” writes Feldman .
Somebody needs to ask Benjamin how one fights against globalization when you receive money from multinational corporations and banksters .
The Tides Foundation gets its money from AT&T , ChevronTexaco , the Rockefeller Foundation , the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation , Verizon , and Bill and Melinda Gates .
[ efoods ]
” The Ford Foundation ’s history of collaboration and interlock with the CIA in pursuit of U.S. world hegemony is now a well - documented fact .
The remaining issue is whether that relationship continues into the new Millenium after the exposures of the 1960s ? ” muses James Petras .
Petra says the Ford Foundation has refined its style of collaboration and cultural domination over the years .
However , with Medea Benjamin ’s statement in support of the “ mission ” of NATO and the U.S. in Afghanistan this refinement is certainly called into question .
Benjamin ’s outrageous statement is simply more evidence the so - called anti-war left is a sham and a tool of the global elite .
Benjamin and her pliable cohorts are to be used only when Republicans are in office .
Now that Democrat Obama is warming a seat in the Oval Office , it is time for the fake opposition to support more mass murder and military expenditures , the same as liberals did when Bill Clinton conducted his illegal and immoral bombing of Serbia .

The FCC may be yet to act on Chairman Genachowski's proposed net neutrality rules , but the agency 's Canadian counterpart , the CRTC , has made a fairly significant ruling of its own on the matter today , and it seems like it may have manged to disappoint folks on both sides of the debate in the process .
The short of it is that the CRTC will allow internet service providers to practice " traffic shaping " ( a.k.a. bandwidth throttling ) , but only as a " last resort , " and only after it has issued a warning that the throttling will take place ( 30 days in advance for regular users , and 60 days for wholesale customers ) .
What 's more , the CRTC is also recommending that ISPs " give preference to Internet traffic management practices based on economic measures " before cutting into customers downloads -- in other words , charge more for extra bandwidth , or offer discounts during non-peak hours .

Funds would stop children dying from treatable diseases , the agency said
Dramatically reducing global child mortality would cost much less than people around the world think , an international aid agency says .
Launching its biggest - ever campaign , Save the Children said $ 40 bn ( £ 25 bn ) would radically lower the number of children who die of treatable diseases .
The agency said there was insufficient pressure on governments to act , because people thought it would cost much more .
It said about nine million children aged under five died each year .
Illnesses such as pneumonia and diarrhoea or the lack of a trained midwife were often the cause , Save the Children said .
India accounted for a fifth of infant deaths worldwide , it said , because health care did not always reach those in need .
A lack of skilled health workers - both at a child 's birth and in the months after - left children there vulnerable to problems that could be prevented or treated for a " very small investment " , campaign director Adrian Lovett told the BBC .
Progress towards reaching the UN goal of reducing child mortality by two - thirds by 2015 was far too slow , the agency said .
In a survey spanning 14 countries , it found that many people thought making an impact would cost $ 400bn .
In fact only a tenth of that - channelled into maternity care and tackling preventable diseases - would make a significant difference , the agency said .
" The pressure to push world leaders to act simply is n't there , partly because of public perceptions that it 's too costly to do anything about it quickly , " said Charlotte Petri Gomitzka , the agency 's secretary general .
Airline Asks Passengers to Empty Bladders Before Boarding Flights Japan's ANA is trying to reduce weight on environmentally - friendly flights .
Oct. 7 , 2009  --
Just when you thought airlines could n't do anything else to lighten the load , here comes a new idea : Japan 's All Nippon Airways is now asking passengers on select flights to empty their bladders before boarding .
That 's right : at the gate ANA staffers encourage fliers to make that one final dash to the restroom to expel some of that extra weight .
" If the flight is lighter , we use less gasoline which is good for the environment , " ANA North America spokeswoman Jean Saito told ABC News .
It might not seem like much , but the human bladder can hold up to 16 ounces before the urge to urinate .
That 's about 1.1 pounds of fluid .
If all 216 passengers on an ANA Boeing 767 had pretty full bladders , that extra urine would weigh about 240 pounds .
Just add it to the list of weight and cost - saving cuts the airline industry has made recently .
Airlines have already taken away blankets , magazines and even televisions on flights all in the name of reducing weight to save fuel and of course money .
" I think it 's going to win them more humor on late night television than anywhere else , " said Edmund S. Greenslet of The Airline Monitor .
" Clearly everybody is looking pinch pennies if not nickels and dimes but this strikes me as a bit much . "
" It 's seems to me that if there is money to be saved in terms of operations , there 's probably some more fruitful places to look , " he added .
Stay Up to Date on the Latest Travel Trends from ABC News on Twitter
Passengers can be at least assured that even for those who can't " hold it , " ANA wo n't be charging them for the bathroom , an idea that Ireland 's Ryanair has been entertaining .
Back in February , Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the airline was considering charging passengers at some point one British pound -- about $ 1.60 -- to use the toilet while on the plane .
The low - cost airline 's thinking goes like this : not everybody uses a bathroom during a flight so why should everybody have to pay for it .
ANA 's latest effort is part of a month - long trial called " e- flight . "
The " e " stands for ecology and the airline is trying to make flying as environmentally friendly as possible .
Instead of plastic cups , the airline will use cups derived from plant materials .
Paper napkins will come from non -wood products .
Passengers will learn more about the environment during the in - flight entertainment .
But the environmental push starts long before then .
While at the gate , ANA staff will introduce the flight as an e-flight and request that passengers lighten their baggage and to go to the restroom before boarding , according to ANA spokesman Justin C. Massey .
" I think it 's bit redundant to ask people to relieve themselves , " said Rick Seaney , CEO of airfare site FareCompare.com and an ABCNews.com columnist .
" Most people , including my family , do it anyway because they hate the cleanliness of the lavatory . "
The e-flight is being tested on domestic flights between Tokyo's Haneda International Airport , Okinawa 's Naha Airport and Chitose Airport and on one international route between Tokyo's Narita International Airport and Singapore 's Changi Airport .
The test period is from Oct. 1 through Oct. 31 and the airline said it will review whether it wants to continue the program .
Now that this week 's edition of Question Time or the " Nick Griffin Road Show " ( as it might more appropriately be called ) is over , white metropolitan liberals are proclaiming it a triumph for free speech .
But in truth it was nothing of the kind .
For one thing , there was no issue of free speech involved .
Nick Griffin is entitled to make speeches , write pamphlets ( he did one a few years ago about how the media is run by a Jewish cabal ) , author books , go on television , be interviewed on the radio and have a website .
Many of us are opposed to his views and do not want them to spread , but we do not dispute his right to express them just so long as he stays within the law .
But he has no God - given constitutional right to appear on any particular television programme .
That is a matter of judgement .
And in choosing to put him on Question Time the BBC exercised the wrong judgement .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The argument , peddled by Mark Thompson , Director - General of the BBC , that Griffin had to go on because his vote went up in last European elections , is just false .
The BNP vote actually went down in these elections .
It gained two seats , not because of any great upsurge in support , but because everybody else 's vote collapsed and the elections were fought under PR .
The BNP 's relatively increased proportion of the vote got it two seats , not an increase in support .
Nick Griffin may be complaining now that the show was biased against him .
But in fact , the programme was a triumph for the BNP .
Never before has it had wall - to - wall publicity on all the media for so many days .
If it had been obliged to pay for that kind of media exposure , it would have cost it a fortune .
As it is , Nick Griffin and the BNP have seeped into the consciousness of the most apolitical Britons .
A friend described picking up her children from school that day and hearing ordinary mums with no interest in politics who would not normally watch Question Time intoning confidently that this was " BNP Day " on Question Time .
With that level of exposure , there comes a level of legitimacy .
It does not matter that Griffin gave a poor performance .
No matter that London - based middle - class journalists competed to denounce him in the newspapers the morning after .
What people will remember was that last Thursday was indeed " BNP day " and the party and its views were somehow accepted into the mainstream .
More than 22 years ago , I appeared on Question Time as a young parliamentary candidate .
For days afterwards people , black and white , came up and congratulated me .
It did not matter what I said .
My very appearance on the programme signalled acceptance by the political mainstream in a way that appearing on no other political programme could have achieved .
That was why it was wrong to have Nick Griffin on the show .
Furthermore , while metropolitan press coverage saw the show as a disaster for Griffin , it is clear from the comments on blogs and phone-ins that many potential BNP supporters saw Griffin as being ganged up on and treated unfairly by metropolitan elitists .
It may seem ludicrous to many of us for Griffin to be presenting himself as victim .
But it will resonate with many whites outside of the metropolis who see themselves as victimised and marginalised by economic uncertainty and new , frightening , multicultural Britain .
Furthermore , it is noticeable that at least half the show was taken up with discussing immigration .
And even though the other politicians were aggressive about denouncing Nick Griffin , they were equally aggressive in declaring that there was indeed an immigration " problem " that only they knew how to solve .
The Tory spokeswoman Baroness Warsi called for a cap on numbers ( impossible without abrogating the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and withdrawing from the European Union ) .
The Lib Dem spokesman Chris Huhne complained about the numbers of Eastern Europeans who had come here ( odd from a self - confessed Europhile ) and my colleague , Jack Straw , was reduced to bleating about how tough New Labour had already been .
So although they were denouncing the man , the debate stayed firmly on territory delineated by the BNP .
Thus does the introduction of the BNP into mainstream discourse drag our politics further rightward .
The appearance of Nick Griffin on Question Time may have brought it record viewing figures .
But at what cost ?
It is not just the thousands of pounds of police time or even the tens of thousands of pounds of free publicity for a fascist party .
We are moving through a recession , which will undoubtedly get worse ( in terms of its impact on ordinary people 's jobs and services ) before it get better .
These are the classic conditions for the rise of a fascist party .
In retrospect , Nick Griffin 's appearance on Question Time may well be seen as significant .
But its significance may not be a happy one .

According to a report in the Egyptian daily Al - Ahram , by Wajih Al - Saqqar , archeologists have discovered ancient Egyptian coins bearing the name and image of the Biblical Joseph .
Following are excerpts from the article : [ 1 ]
" Koranic Verses Indicate Clearly That Coins Were Used in Egypt in the Time of Joseph "
" In an unprecedented find , a group of Egyptian researchers and archeologists has discovered a cache of coins from the time of the Pharaohs .
Its importance lies in the fact that it provides decisive scientific evidence disproving the claim by some historians that the ancient Egyptians were unfamiliar with coins and conducted their trade through barter .
" The researchers discovered the coins when they sifted through thousands of small archeological artifacts stored in [ the vaults of ] the Museum of Egypt . [ Initially ] they took them for charms , but a thorough examination revealed that the coins bore the year in which they were minted and their value , or effigies of the pharaohs [ who ruled ] at the time of their minting .
Some of the coins are from the time when Joseph lived in Egypt , and bear his name and portrait .
" There used to be a misconception that trade [ in Ancient Egypt ] was conducted through barter , and that Egyptian wheat , for example , was traded for other goods .
But surprisingly , Koranic verses indicate clearly that coins were used in Egypt in the time of Joseph .
" Research team head Dr. Sa'id Muhammad Thabet said that during his archeological research on the Prophet Joseph , he had discovered in the vaults of the [ Egyptian ]
Antiquities Authority and of the National Museum many charms from various eras before and after the period of Joseph , including one that bore his effigy as the minister of the treasury in the Egyptian pharaoh 's court …
" Dr. Sa'id Thabet added that he had examined the sarcophagi of many pharaohs in search of coins used as charms or ornaments , and that he had indeed found such ancient Egyptian coins .
This [ find ] prompted researchers to seek and find Koranic verses that speak of coins used in ancient Egypt , [ such as ] : ' And they sold him [ i.e. Joseph ] for a low price , a number of silver coins ; and they attached no value to him .
[ Koran 12:20 ] . '
[ Also , ] Qarun [ 2 ] says about his money : ' This has been given to me because of a certain knowledge which I have [ Koran 28 : 78 ] . ' "
" Studies ... Have Revealed That What Most Archeologists Took For a Kind of Charm , and Others Took For an Ornament ... is Actually a Coin "
" According to Dr. Thabet , his studies are based on publications about the Third Dynasty , one of which states that the Egyptian coin of the time was called a deben and was worth one - fourth of a gram of gold .
This coin is mentioned in a letter by a man named Thot - Nehet , a royal inspector of the Nile bridges .
In letters to his son , he mentioned leasing lands in return for deben-coins and agricultural produce .
" Other texts from the time of the Third Dynasty , the Sixth Dynasty and the Twelfth Dynasty mention a coin named shati or sat , whose value was equal to that of the deben .
There is also a picture of an Egyptian market showing trade being conducted through barter , but one of the vendors puts out his hand , asking the buyer for a deben in return for the goods .
" Studies by Dr. Thabet 's team have revealed that what most archeologists took for a kind of charm , and others took for an ornament or adornment , is actually a coin .
Several [ facts led them to this conclusion ] : first , [ the fact that ] many such coins have been found at various [ archeological sites ] , and also [ the fact that ] they are round or oval in shape , and have two faces : one with an inscription , called the inscribed face , and one with an image , called the engraved face - just like the coins we use today .
" The archeological finding is also based on the fact that the inscribed face bore the name of Egypt , a date , and a value , while the engraved face bore the name and image of one of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs or gods , or else a symbol connected with these .
Another telling fact is that the coins come in different sizes and are made of different materials , including ivory , precious stones , copper , silver , gold , etc . "
" 500 of These Coins Were [ Recently ]
Discovered in the Museum of Egypt - Where They Were [ Originally ] Classified as Charms and Stored Carelessly in Closed Boxes "
" The researcher also pointed out that the coins made of precious metals or stones usually had a hole in them , like a woman 's ornament , allowing them to be [ worn ] around the neck or on the chest .
Some of them , which bore images of gods and texts from various prayers or incantations , were treasured belongings that were placed into the bindings of mummies or placed [ on the chest , close to ] the heart .
The coins were scarab - shaped .
What made the discovery possible was the fact that 500 of these coins were [ recently ] discovered in the Museum of Egypt , where they were [ originally ] classified as charms and stored carelessly in closed boxes . "
" One Coin ... [ Had ] an Image of a Cow Symbolizing Pharaoh 's Dream about the Seven Fat Cows and Seven Lean Cows "
" The researcher identified coins from many different periods , including coins that bore special markings identifying them as being from the era of Joseph .
Among these , there was one coin that had an inscription on it , and an image of a cow symbolizing Pharaoh 's dream about the seven fat cows and seven lean cows , and the seven green stalks of grain and seven dry stalks of grain .
It was found that the inscriptions of this early period were usually simple , since writing was still in its early stages , and consequently there was difficulty in deciphering the writing on these coins .
But the research team [ managed to ] translate [ the writing on the coin ] by comparing it to the earliest known hieroglyphic texts …
" Joseph 's name appears twice on this coin , written in hieroglyphs : once the original name , Joseph , and once his Egyptian name , Saba Sabani , which was given to him by Pharaoh when he became treasurer .
There is also an image of Joseph , who was part of the Egyptian administration at the time .
" Dr. Sa'id Thabet called on Egypt 's Antiquities Council and on the Minister of Culture to intensify efforts in the fields of Ancient Egyptian history and archeology , and to [ promote ] the research of these coins that bear the name of Egyptian pharaohs and gods .
This , he said , would enable the correction of prevalent misconceptions regarding the history of Ancient Egypt . "

Former Billionaire ' Sir ' Allen Stanford Appointed Public Defender Financier has " nothing … down to his socks and underwear , " recused lawyer says .
Sept. 15 , 2009  -- Flamboyant former billionaire financier ' Sir ' Allen Stanford has been ordered a public defender in his $ 7 billion fraud case because he has no money for an attorney .
" The SEC and the receiver in Dallas took everything from him , not just what they claim was tied to the fraud … everything that he had down to his socks and underwear , " lawyer Dick DeGuerin , who was released from Stanford 's case this morning , told ABCNews.com .
DeGuerin said the problem was not only that he 's received " not a penny " from Stanford , a former jetsetter who traveled to his homes around the world by private jet , but that the confidence they once had in one another was gone .
" It 's all the interference from other [ attorneys ] that destroyed my relationship with him , and it's irreparable , " DeGuerin told ABC News .
Stanford , dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit , attended the court hearing before U.S. District Judge David Hittner and met with DeGuerin for two hours beforehand – their first face - to - face meeting since July 30 .
He was recently released from a Texas hospital and returned to the Joe Corley Detention Facility in Conroe , TX after being admitted for a rapid heartbeat of 300 beats per minutes .
Allegations of Defrauding Investors
Stanford is charged with fraud , conspiracy and obstruction in a 21 count indictment handed down by the Department of Justice .
If convicted , he faces a maximum sentence of 250 years .
Stanford surrendered to the FBI in Virginia in June and has pled not guilty to the charges .
Authorities say Stanford and his alleged co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to defraud investors who purchased approximately $ 7 billion of CDs from the Stanford International Bank , an off - shore entity based in Antigua .
Stanford and his co-defendants are accused of misusing and misappropriating most of their investment assets .
Alleged Ponzi Scheme
The indictment alleges that Stanford and his associates falsely claimed that the bank 's assets had grown from $ 1.2 billion in 2001 to $ 8.5 billion by December 2008 .
The bank also allegedly made thousands of dollars in bribes to the former head of Antigua 's Financial Services Authority to ensure the bank was not audited .
The Securities and Exchange Commission previously filed a civil complaint against alleging Stanford ran a fraud promising investors impossible returns , much like Bernard Madoff's $ 65 billion alleged Ponzi scheme .
Stanford Denies Charges to ABC News
In April , Stanford told ABC News Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross in an exclusive interview that he expected to be indicted soon , but denied that he had run any sort of Ponzi scheme .
" I would die and go to hell if it 's a Ponzi scheme , " Stanford said in reaction to the civil allegations from the SEC that he bilked thousands of customers in a scheme involving " self - styled certificates of deposits " with " improbable " rates of return .
" Baloney .
Baloney , " Stanford told ABC News .
" It 's not a Ponzi scheme .
If it was a Ponzi scheme , why are they finding billions and billions of dollars all over the place ? "
In August , Stanford 's former chief financial officer James Davis pled guilty to conspiracy to commit mail , wire and securities fraud , mail fraud , and conspiracy to obstruct a SEC investigation , in relation to the alleged Ponzi scheme .
Davis faces up to 30 years in prison when he 's sentenced Nov. 20 , although his attorney David Finn told the AP the sentencing may be delayed as Davis continues to help prosecutors .
Finn said Davis has been cooperating for the last six months and has a deal with the Justice Department for a possible reduced sentence .
Davis ' plea agreement brought forth bizarre new details about the case , including the allegation that Stanford entered into a " blood oath " with Antiguan bank officials .
The plea agreement , entered into court Thursday , alleges that Stanford and Leroy King , the former administrator and CEO of Antigua 's Financial Services Authority , participated in the brotherhood ceremony together with another employees of the Financial Services Regulatory Commission .
" This brotherhood oath was undertaken in order to extract an agreement from both King and the other FSRC employee that they , in exchange for regular cash bribe payments by Stanford to King and the other FSRC employee , would ensure that the Antiguan bank regulators would not ' kill the business ' of SIBL , " the agreement reads .
It also said that Sanford 's alleged fraud dates back to 1990 .

It could take years for the World Health Organisation to downgrade the H1N1 flu from a pandemic to seasonal - like virus , the U.N. agency said on Friday .
The WHO moved its six - point pandemic alert level to the top rung in June [ ID : nLC321991 ] in response to the spread of the new virus widely known as swine flu , which has killed at least 4,500 people , especially in North America .
WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said that health warning would stay in place until people can better fend off infection from the H1N1 strain .
“ At some point in the future , there would be a recognition of the fact that if it ’s no longer circulating on a sustainable basis in communities .
Then you would lower the pandemic level , ” he said , while stressing : “ There is absolutely no indication yet of that happening . ”
In previous pandemics , Hartl said , it has taken time for worrisome flu strains to become less contagious .
The slowdown generally comes from people having some prior exposure to the virus or gaining protection from a vaccine .

When my daughter was born , my then - 3 - year - old son clearly felt neglected , as first children always do in such situations .
And as always happens , my son started acting up in a play for attention .
In his case , he regressed on his potty training , crapping his pants .
In a bid for attention , that certainly worked .
Enter Joe Lieberman , and his successful bid for attention yesterday , promising to screw Democrats for the umpteenth time by joining Republicans in a filibuster of the Democratic health care plan .
Whatever .
As much as our favorite boogeyman loves the limelight , there 's one thing he loves even more -- being Senator .
There are two possible options looking ahead to 2012 : 1 ) he will retire , and if so , we have zero leverage with the guy .
He will either vote for cloture after getting the proper feting ( or behind closed - door threats ) from Reid and Obama ( hence the tame and diplomatic reaction to Lieberman 's intransigence ) , or he 'll deliver for his insurance industry pals in Connecticut by making common cause with Republicans .
But if he 2 ) plans on running for reelection ( the likelier choice ) , then his leverage is reduced dramatically .
It was n't that long ago that we polled Connecticut :
Research 2000 for Daily Kos. 9/8-10 .
Likely voters .
MoE 4 %
Do you favor or oppose creating a government - administered health insurance option that anyone can purchase to compete with private insurance plans ?
Favor Oppose All 68 21 Dem 83 8
Rep 33 55
Ind 73 15
Granted , Lieberman is holding a serious grudge against Connecticut Democrats , but those Independent numbers are n't too far off , and even those Republican numbers are better than most ( Maine Republicans , for example , oppose it by a 18 - 58 margin ) -- and this poll was taken in the reform nadir right after the teabagging August .
Health care numbers have improved in the months since .
Given that Lieberman already trailed badly in hypothetical matchups against Attorney General Dick Blumenthal and Gov. Jodi Rell while suffering from a negative approval rating ( 47 - 50 favorability before these latest antics ) , Lieberman can't afford to oppose his constituents on an issue of this magnitude and expect to have any hope of surviving reelection .
In other words , Lieberman is crapping his pants for attention .
Call his bluff .
A second young victim has come forward with allegations against a former Mesa police officer who now faces 30 child molestation - related charges in Pinal County .
Justin Bowman , 30 , was on the verge of being fired when he resigned Sept. 18 , 2008 , as an officer with Mesa police , internal documents show .
The following month , Maricopa police arrested Bowman on suspicion of molesting a girl under 15 years old .
In November 2008 , a Pinal County grand jury indicted Bowman on 12 molestation charges .
Those charges were thrown out but then refilled Sept. 10 after a second victim came forward , court documents show .
The indictment has since grown to 30 felony charges , including five counts of furnishing obscene or harmful items to minors ; seven counts of child molestation ; 15 counts of sexual conduct with a minor ; and three counts of sexual exploitation of a minor .
Both victims , a boy and girl , were under 15 years old when the alleged molestation occurred between March 1 and Oct. 29 , 2008 , court documents show .
The molestation stopped the day Bowman 's wife called police , saying he was suicidal , Maricopa police said at the time .
While at their Maricopa home , investigators learned Bowman was allegedly molesting children inside the home .
The young girl told police Bowman showed her nude photos of her stepfather and mother , had sex with her , and performed other sexual acts on multiple occasions , court documents state .
The second victim to step forward , a young boy , raised similar allegations .
Some of the alleged events occurred inside each of the young victim 's bedrooms , in Bowman 's vehicle , the garage and aboard a boat , the complaint states .
Bowman is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 2 .
Before Bowman 's legal troubles began , he was being investigated internally by Mesa police .
Police documents show Bowman was facing discipline for a number of issues from failing to turn in required paperwork to failing to show for up for duty .
At the time of his resignation , Bowman faced three written and two verbal reprimands , and three 10 - hour suspensions , according to police records .
Bowman offered no reason for his departure in his resignation letter .

Massive disruption is expected across Ireland as public services shut down in a national strike over pay cuts .
More than a quarter of a million public workers are staging a walk - out - thought to be the biggest in 30 years - despite signs unions are preparing to restart talks with the Government .
Hospitals , schools , social welfare offices and local authorities will be closed during the one - day action over plans to slash 1.3 billion euro from the public sector wage bill .
Flood relief workers and emergency staff in Clare , Galway and Cork will continue working to deal with the worst flooding in living memory in parts of the west and south .
Union leaders also vowed that critical medical services , including intensive , elderly and maternity care as well as cancer services would not be affected , but thousands of hospital appointments , planned admissions and surgery have been cancelled .
Accident and emergency services are being staffed by local strike committees who will judge the needs of patients on the day , according to Liam Doran of the Irish Nurses Organisation .
Congress - the umbrella organisation for trade unions - insisted a blueprint for an overhaul of the public sector handed to them on Friday night by the Government had come too late to halt the 24 - hour stoppage .
Peter McLoone , chairman of the Congress public services committee , said the document did not carry guarantees being sought by the unions , but he signalled it could form the basis of renewed negotiations with the Government , starting as early as Wednesday .
The industrial action is expected to wreak major disruption on health services , education , local authority services , government departments and the courts .
Semi-state companies including bus and rail services will not be affected .
Although the Garda is forbidden by law from striking , members have been advised by the Garda Representative Association they do n't need to issue penalty point or fixed charge notices to motorists .

Geht 's dem Dollar an den Kragen ?
Wolfgang Pomrehn
Britische Zeitung berichtet von Geheimgesprächen über Alternativen zur US - Währung
Der Guardian will von geheimen Gesprächen über die Ablösung des US - Dollar als Weltwährung gehört haben , die zwischen der chinesischen und einigen Regierungen der Ölförderländer in Nahost stattgefunden haben .
Die Gerüchte gaben den Kursen für Gold und viele andere Rohstoffe neuen Auftrieb .
Gold wurde am Dienstag für 1040 US - Dollar pro Unze gehandelt .
Der Dollar sackte hingegen auf 1,47 Dollar Dollar pro Euro ab .
Am Mittwochnachmittag hatte er sich allerdings wieder ein bisschen erholt und bewegte sich bei 1,467 Dollar pro Euro .
Letzte Woche hatte Weltbank - Chef Robert Zoellick gewarnt , dass die USA die Rolle des Dollars nicht als gegeben ansehen sollten .
Es gebe im zunehmenden Maß Alternativen , und in zehn bis 20 Jahren werde der chinesische Yuan an den internationalen Finanzmärkten eine wichtige Rolle spielen .
Bevor Zoellick den Posten bei der Weltbank übernahm , hatte er unter unter George Bush jun .
als Handelsminister und zuletzt als Vizeaußenminister gearbeitet .
Gerüchte und Diskussionen über die Ablösung des US - Dollars gibt es bereits seit über einem Jahr ( Siehe z.B. Dollar - Absturz nimmt Fahrt auf , Auch Frankreich stellt Dollar als Leitwährung in Frage , Unabhängigkeit wider Willen , Argentinisierung der USA , Chinesisches Weltgeld , Asiens IWF , Yuan statt Dollar , " Dann werden die USA ihr blaues Wunder erleben " ) .
Allerdings ist nicht mit einer schnellen Lösung zu rechnen .
Nicht nur die US - Regierung hat ein Interesse daran , den Dollar halbwegs stabil zu halten .
Auch Länder wie China , Japan , Taiwan und einige arabische Erdölexporteure , die zusammen vier bis fünf Billionen US - Dollar an Währungsreserven halten dürften , werden aus purem Eigeninteresse versuchen , den Übergang möglichst glatt zu organisieren .
Die Ablösung des Dollars dürfte daher eine Sache von vielen Jahren sein .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
You wo n't see it all in one neat package .
And you wo n't hear the White House call it stimulus .
But there 's a good chance lawmakers will decide to extend some of the stimulus measures included in the $ 787 billion economic recovery package passed in February and possibly create some new ones as well .
On Wednesday , House Democrats are convening a forum of economists to debate the state of the economy , with a specific focus on job creation .
And lawmakers are convening hearings on Capitol Hill this week to discuss the economic outlook and the state of the housing market .
A number of ideas on the table are lifeline measures , while some are flat - out incentives to spur economic activity .
Here 's a rundown of what 's under consideration , estimates of what the provisions might cost and where they stand currently in the legislative process .
Unemployment benefits extension
By year - end , an estimated 1.3 million jobless workers will have run out of unemployment benefits , according to the National Employment Law Project .
It 's expected that lawmakers wo n't let that happen .
The House has already approved an extension and the Senate has amended it but not yet voted on it .
Both parties say they want to extend benefits but they disagree over how to pay for it and how to handle amendments to the bill .
In the Senate proposal , unemployment benefits would be extended by up to 14 weeks in every state and then another six weeks on top of that in states where the unemployment rate tops 8.5 % .
Currently , states with unemployment rates topping 8 % now offer up to 79 weeks of unemployment benefits , said Chad Stone , chief economist of the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities .
States with unemployment rates between 6 % and 8 % now offer up to 59 weeks .
And all other states currently offer up to 46 weeks .
Estimated cost : $ 2.4 billion .
But Senate Democrats say the proposal would be paid for in full by extending an add - on tax for employers under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act .
For the past 32 years , employers were required to pay an additional 0.2 % on the first $ 7,000 of a worker 's annual wages on top of the 0.6 % they normally pay , said George Wentworth , a policy analyst for NELP .
That surtax was supposed to expire this year .
But lawmakers would extend it through June 30 , 2011 , to pay for the benefits extension .
If they do , the Congressional Budget Office estimates such a move could reduce the deficit by $ 200 million over 10 years .
Cobra premium subsidy extension
The White House supports extending the federal subsidy now offered to unemployed workers who opt to continue their health insurance coverage from their former employers .
Under the original provision passed under the economic recovery act , Uncle Sam agreed to pick up 65 % of the cost of the Cobra premium for up to nine months for workers laid off between Sept. 1 , 2008 , and Dec. 31 , 2009 .
That 65 % comes close to replicating the share of the premium typically paid for by employers when a worker signs up for coverage .
To date , a Cobra extension has not been attached to any proposed legislation .
Estimated cost :
The original provision was estimated by the CBO to cost roughly $ 25 billion .
Absent the exact parameters for an extension , however , it 's too early to tell how much the provision would cost .
There will likely be a cost to employers as well .
The publication Business Insurance reported recently that companies typically pay out $ 1.50 in claims for every $ 1 collected in Cobra premiums .
Emergency payment to seniors
To compensate for the fact that there will be no cost - of - living adjustment made to Social Security benefits in 2010 due to a lack of inflation , President Obama has proposed sending a $ 250 economic relief payment to seniors , veterans and the disabled next year .
It would be identical to the $ 250 emergency payment sent out earlier this year under the economic recovery law .
Democratic leaders in the House and Senate have voiced their support for such a payment .
But others do n't think it 's a good idea .
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes that the cost - of - living adjustment for 2009 was much higher than average -- 5.8 % -- due to record energy prices .
So " even holding Social Security benefits steady means they will have increased in value .
There is no economic or moral justification for increasing them further , " said CRFB president Maya MacGuineas in a statement .
To date , a proposed emergency payment to seniors has not been attached to any legislation .
Estimated cost :
The measure would cost $ 13 billion , according to White House estimates .
Homebuyer tax credit expansion
An estimated 1.4 million tax filers to date have taken advantage of a temporary first - time homebuyer tax credit aimed primarily at people making less than $ 75,000 ( $ 150,000 for joint filers ) .
An estimated 15 % of them bought their home specifically because of the tax break .
The latest iteration of that credit is worth $ 8,000 , and it 's scheduled to expire on Nov. 30 .
Many lawmakers want to extend that deadline , expand eligibility beyond first - time homebuyers and include those who make more than is allowed under the current rules .
Sen. Johnny Isakson , R - Ga. , and Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , co-sponsored an amendment to the unemployment extension bill that would extend the credit until the end of June 2010 and be available to single filers making up to $ 150,000 and joint filers making up to $ 300,000 .
The amendment may or may not remain attached to the unemployment bill -- which has been stalled due to political skirmishes between Democrats and Republicans .
But Congress
Daily reports that senators and aides " said both [ measures ] appear likely to clear the chamber in some form this fall . "
It 's still not clear where the White House stands .
At a Senate Banking hearing on Tuesday , Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan said " within a few weeks we 'll have sufficient data to get to a conclusion on this . "
Estimated cost : The Isakson - Dodd bill is estimated to cost $ 16.7 billion .
Isakson said at the Senate Banking hearing that he'd be happy to look for ways to pay for it and Dodd concurred .
Typically , if a measure is considered stimulus it is not something that lawmakers feel obligated to pay for by either reducing spending or raising revenue in other areas .
Jobs credit creation
Although no formal proposal has been made , there has been some talk of creating an employer tax credit for hiring new workers .
The idea is to spur job creation and to do so in the face of forecasts for a 10 % unemployment rate in 2010 .
But it 's hard to do that without rewarding companies that were already planning to hire anyway , said Clint Stretch , managing principal for tax policy at Deloitte Tax .
Consider two competitors who dealt with the downturn differently , Stretch said .
One made deep cuts to its workforce and is ready to ramp up again , while the other cut costs but managed to do so without laying off too many people .
In this instance , the first company benefits far more from the credit than its competitor .
A hiring credit was put in place during the Carter administration and the consensus among researchers is that two - thirds of the 2.1 million jobs created by the credit would have been created without it , according to a post on Tax Vox , a blog of the Tax Policy Center edited by Howard Gleckman .
" Tim Bartik [ of the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research ] and John Bishop [ of Cornell University ] ... argue it nonetheless created 700,000 new jobs in a year - not bad , even if a lot of money was wasted .
Others insist the research they used is flawed , " Gleckman noted .
Estimated cost : Bartik and Bishop estimate that a job creation tax credit that refunds to employers 15 % of new wage costs in 2010 and 10 % in 2011 could create 5.1 million jobs at a cost of $ 27 billion , or $ 5,400 per new job created .
Credit card holders could be forced to double the current monthly repayment on their outstanding debt under proposals being put forward by the government .
On Tuesday , consumer affairs minister Kevin Brennan will unveil the results of a review into credit and store card practices that it has been conducting over the summer .
The review will include a proposal forcing an increase to the level of minimum monthly repayments card issuers ask for each month .
Over the past few years these minimum repayments have fallen from a typical 5 % of the outstanding balance to an average 2 - 3 % of the outstanding debt .
This can quadruple the original credit card debt for those people who never pay off more than the minimum over a long period .
The government believes the card industry is not doing enough to address this issue and will suggest legislation that will push up the minimum required amount .
It is going to put three proposals forward for consultation , one of which will force minimum repayments back up to at least 5 % of the debt left on the card .
The proposal will form part of a wider crackdown on credit card lending and follows a government white paper published in July .
This outlined a ban on the controversial practice of sending out unsolicited credit card cheques .
These cheques can be used like ordinary personal cheques but come with a punitive rate of interest , and are often sent unsolicited to card customers with letters suggesting they are used for holidays or home improvements .
Because credit card cheques are charged as cash advances , a £ 500 cheque can cost an extra £ 150 in charges over a year .
From next month , card issuers will only be able to supply these cheques if a borrower requests them .
In its announcement , the government is also expected to outline its intention to stop card issuers increasing existing borrowers ' interest rates without explaining why or giving them notice of the change .
It will propose stopping issuers upping a cardholder 's credit limit , thereby encouraging them to borrow more , without that borrower asking for the increase .
It is understood that the government believes that while the credit card industry has made some changes to lending practices this year , it has n't moved far and fast enough .
Another target is expected to be the adverse order of repayments currently applied by the majority of card issuers .
Credit card users are routinely hit with hundreds of pounds in extra interest because banks force them to pay off their cheapest debts first .
" Adverse order " means that by paying off your cheapest debt first , credit card companies let more expensive ones last longer thus earning extra interest .
This practice means we now overpay an estimated £ 500 m every year , according to Nationwide building society , one of the few card issuers to allocate card payments in a positive way .
In the United States , legislation will be brought in next year to end this practice for American cardholders .
" This is an issue that affects people in different ways but it has the biggest impact on the most vulnerable , " said Steve Blore at Nationwide .
" It would not be good financial advice to tell someone who was trying to manage their unsecured debts to repay their cheapest debt first – but this is what most credit card providers do . "
The government will implement a three - month public consultation period following the announcement .
DETROIT -- Veteran goaltender Dan Cloutier , out of hockey last season , will attend the Detroit Red Wings ' training camp ( Sept. 13 - 15 ) on a tryout .
Cloutier , 33 , who contacted the club and asked for the tryout , has n't played since appearing in nine games with the Los Angeles Kings in 2007 - 08 .
He has been bothered by a series of ailments , including a season - ending hip injury midway through 2006 - 07 .
This does n't mean Jimmy Howard 's status as Chris Osgood 's backup is in jeopardy .
Cloutier is a long shot to earn a contract from the Red Wings .
A 10 - year NHL veteran who also has played for the Rangers , Tampa Bay and Vancouver , Cloutier is best remembered -- by Detroit fans -- for letting in Nicklas Lidstrom 's shot from center ice in Game 3 of the 2002 first - round playoff series against the Canucks .
The Red Wings , reeling after losing the first two games of the series at home , went on to win the Stanley Cup .
Cloutier has a career NHL record of 139- 142-33 , with a 2.77 goals - against average and .899 save percentage .
On September 6th last year , just two weeks before the full international financial crisis hit , David McWilliams went on the radio to warn that Irish banks were in grave danger of going bust .
Finance Minister Brian Lenihan , who was on the same programme .
accused McWilliams of " dangerous talk " .
But afterwards , as they left the ' Saturday View ' studio in RTE , Lenihan suggested that they get together to talk about the banks -- although nothing definite was arranged .
Over the next two weeks the financial crisis reached a peak in New York .
First it was Lehmans , then Merrill Lynch , then AIG .
McWilliams believed Irish banks , with their mountain of bad loans , could go belly - up within weeks .
And he knew that the minister was getting unreliable and misguided advice because he was listening to the banking and political establishment , who continued to bluff and bluster that the Irish banks were well capitalised and in no danger .
On September 16th -- the day AIG went bust -- McWilliams appeared on ' Prime Time ' .
He again warned that the banks were bust and again the establishment -- this time in the guise of the head of the Irish Banking Federation -- accused him of " loose talk " .
Driving home from RTE that evening , McWilliams decided the situation was so serious and the bankers in such denial that it was time to call the minister .
They arranged to meet .
Even so , he was a little surprised when , late the next night , there was a loud knocking on his front door .
Standing alone on the doorstep was Brian Lenihan . . .
In this exclusive extract from his new book ' Follow The Money ' , David McWilliams tells the story of the late - night session with the minister and how they came up with the bank guarantee scheme :
On Wednesday , September 17th , at 10.20 in the evening there was a knock on our front door .
Our bell was broken , so the visitor had to knock loudly .
I hoped he would n't disturb the children , who had woken as I 'd gone out to Centra for milk and biscuits 40 minutes earlier .
It was late and it was a school night .
The phone had rung about an hour before , so I was expecting him .
Even so , as we'd never had a politician in our house , never mind a Minister for Finance , seeing the bulk of Brian Lenihan at the door came as a surprise .
In fact , I had only once met the minister before and that had been in an RTÉ radio studio for Saturday View less than two weeks previously , on September 6th .
That day he was confident and calm .
The man who appeared at my door was a different character .
There was still the confidence and yet he was nervous and fidgety .
His suit looked as if he 'd slept in it .
He had heavy bags under his eyes , his tie was undone and he held a copy of that day 's Irish Independent .
Days before this late - night visit , Lehman Brothers had gone bust .
That was on Saturday , September 13th .
Merrill Lynch went on Sunday , 14th , and AIG -- the world 's largest insurer -- went bang on Tuesday , 16th .
The financial world was collapsing and the Irish banks were worth pennies , not pounds ; cents not euros .
The banks were running out of money .
Ordinary people were beginning to panic .
We were starting to twig that we had been lied to .
My mother had called me earlier in the day to ask whether she should take her life savings out of Bank of Ireland .
I told her that the risk was now too great and there was only one thing that could be done : take your savings out and put them in a continental bank trading here .
After all , the morons who got us , and their banks , into this mess would n't shed a tear for her , so why should she worry about them ?
If something radical was not done and done quickly , it was crystal clear to me that the Irish banks would experience a traditional run , with depositors taking out their savings , and the banks would go bust .
That one thing , at least , was certain .
The minister walked straight through the hall and headed directly into the kitchen as if he knew where he was going .
Jaded , he sat down and turned off his phone .
Our dog Sasha -- a Labrador puppy -- got very excited about a visitor coming in the dead of night , way after the children had gone to sleep .
She slobbered all over the minister 's suit and tried to make off with his left trouser leg .
At least she broke the ice .
He laughed and went off on a tangent about dogs , kind of nervously .
After a few minutes , Sasha settled down under the kitchen table , rested her head on his brogues and fell asleep .
Taking note of his 12 o'clock shadow and red eyes , I suggested that he should catch a kip too .
He said he 'd doze off in the car on the way home .
Then he pulled a bulb of garlic out of his pocket and started to peel it .
It was one of the odd moments in a long night of odd moments .
In subsequent meetings , the raw garlic was produced and squashed into bowls of soup .
This time he just peeled a clove and left it on the table .
He explained to me that the garlic gave him strength and kept him healthy and alert .
I had no reason to doubt him .
He went on to say that he had been chomping raw garlic all summer , since he'd got the Finance job .
I did n't know what to think but when you have the Minister for Finance of a country that is going down the tubes sitting opposite you at your kitchen table , about to wolf down raw garlic , you have to suspend your disbelief .
I made him a cup of tea .
That was to be the first of many that night .
We asked the driver would he like a cup of tea too .
He said no .
Had he known how long we were to talk , he 'd probably have asked for a camp bed .
I felt sorry for Brian Lenihan that night .
He looked exhausted .
He had been working day and night and he was trying to understand everything .
This must have been very difficult for a man who had spent all his life in law .
I thought to myself that this would be like me being thrown in as Attorney General in the middle of the country 's worst constitutional crisis .
I would n't know where to start .
He told me he'd been breaking himself into the job and economics by reading Alan Greenspan 's biography .
" Sweet Jesus ! " I thought .
That was the worst place to start .
That epoch was over .
It was like a Minister for Transport a hundred years ago trying to learn about cars by reading a book about fast horses .
Greenspan 's nonsense caused this mess and I told the minister as much .
With that out of the way , I got a pencil and paper and we started scribbling .
This was the way I 'd learned economics years ago , always joining the dots as if you are piecing together a big puzzle .
If that is related to this , then this will happen and if that happens , this is likely to move and so on and so on .
He gave me the impression that he was quite isolated from his officials .
He repeated again and again , " They just do n't get it ; we do n't have much time . "
He was confused but was getting to grips with things .
I offered him a glass of wine .
He told me he was n't boozing until after the Budget .
I said the Budget was the least of his worries .
That night , even after a few minutes , it was clear that here was a man who could pick things up quickly .
But we were starting pretty much from scratch .
It was also obvious that he was , at best , sceptical about the advice he was getting .
Given the spin that was coming out of the Government , I was n't too surprised and I was quite relieved that he doubted the Regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank when they continued to parrot platitudes about the banks being fine and being stress - tested .
He kicked off by saying if his officials knew he was here in my house , there 'd be war .
They thought I was a maverick .
I took it as a compliment .
He got to the point quickly .
He was sitting opposite me and he had a habit of looking around rather than catching my eye as if he expected someone to join us at any minute .
I told him we were on our own , just the pair of us and the puppy .
He leaned over and , in a hoarse voice , almost whispering , he said : " What would you do ? "
McWilliams explained to the minister that he had worked in the Central Bank during the 1992/1993 currency crisis and knew from experience that the mandarins would n't do anything out of the ordinary even when the situation was desperate .
And having also worked in two of Europe 's largest investment banks in similar banking crises in Russia , Asia and Argentina , he knew that radical action was the only thing that could prevent catastrophe .
I asked him how bad the situation was .
He was guarded , as I expected him to be .
But it soon became clear , as he revealed , " The situation is worse that even you think and we all know what you think ! "
I took this to mean not only that the banks could not roll over their debts , but that he had only just been told this truth .
We had weeks at best , days at worst .
My own reckoning was that the banks had a few weeks ' financing .
The minister indicated that the problem was more acute .
The most revealing thing about our conversation was that it was AIB , not Anglo Irish , that had the most severe funding problems .
Ireland 's biggest bank was actually our biggest problem .
I was aware that the Irish banks could no longer finance themselves and were borrowing in the very short - term and rolling over .
This is why I 'd warned on September 6th on Saturday View that we would have a banking crisis .
What I did n't know was the bank that was pretending to be the most prudent was possibly the most delinquent .
We were on the precipice .
On the table from the Department of Finance was a plan for the two big banks to take over Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide .
I reminded the minister that they were all at the same game and merging them would n't ease the liquidity crisis because two bad balance sheets did n't make one good one .
. .
So we to -ed and fro-ed with what had been done before .
I had worked for UBS ( Union Bank of Switzerland ) in Zurich in the years after Switzerland experienced a banking crisis in the early 1990s .
The Swiss government guaranteed all liabilities of the banking system even though the banks ' balance sheets were a number of times bigger than the country 's GDP .
A guarantee had worked there .
I 'd also worked in Sweden where I 'd seen the Swedes guarantee all their deposits in the face of a banking crisis .
I told the minister it seemed to me that Sweden 's reaction was an interesting place to start .
Above all , we needed to protect the ordinary savers , not bond or equity holders .
They were playing a different game .
They were in the business of gambling .
But the savers , the ordinary people who had bank accounts , needed protection .
The crux of the issue was that the problem had gone way beyond normal remedies .
The minister was aware of that .
The officials in the Department were ( by then ) also advocating a guarantee of people 's deposits but only to a certain level .
However , I argued because the Irish banks ' funding had become so unstable , if we did n't guarantee the funding as well as the deposits , the banks would come crashing down and you would have had to come up with the money immediately for people 's deposits .
The whole point of a guarantee is that you want to avoid paying out right away .
Now , on September 17th , we were stuck and only the nuclear option would work .
Over tea and digestive biscuits , to the background noise of the gentle snoring of the puppy , the minister naturally worried about pushing the button .
I showed him an article I had written earlier that evening which outlined the bank guarantee plan .
I had wanted to get the idea down on paper so that I was clear .
Because we were all groping in the dark .
This was economic policy - making formulated in a kitchen and made up on the spot .
He was worried that this guarantee idea was too radical .
And I could understand this because he was the man who had to make the decision , not me .
I told him he simply had to guarantee everything for a limited period to make sure that an illiquid dilemma did n't lead to an insolvency catastrophe .
But , he argued , warming to the idea , what if we got the insolvencies ?
We could never afford to cover all the liabilities .
This was the risk , a huge risk , but one that could be reduced if the guarantee was not extended beyond a fixed period .
I argued that over the two years of the guarantee , the true extent of the bad debts would become apparent as would the depth of the recession and , armed with this knowledge , he could then choose which banks to save , or not , in an orderly fashion .
I said that this was not the perfect solution but we were in a crisis and anything we did now was from a position of weakness .
The US had let Lehman go and it had prompted the market to freeze up .
It had written a huge cheque for its banking system 's toxic debt ; we did n't have the money to do this so could n't .
There was simply no alternative .
We had to do something that cost nothing in the immediate term but might stop the money flowing out of the economy .
Otherwise the system would break and with it would go the savings of thousands of ordinary people .
We both agreed that this would mean saving banks that probably did n't deserve to be saved but I contended that we did n't have time to disentangle the good from the bad .
This way , if the plan worked , he and his officials would have time to unpick the mess .
Meanwhile it would be essential to make the guarantee conditional so that the minister would be in control and the banks would be working for him , not him working for the banks .
That night , it never struck me that the banks would be allowed to get away with what they did in subsequent months .
We outlined how the plan might work on a piece of paper .
It was well past one in the morning when we decided to call it a day .
He stuffed the paper in his pocket and was about to go when he said he'd have another cup of tea .
The chat ebbed and flowed and there was more tea .
I felt like Mrs Doyle by this stage .
He would n't take a drink and , by the time we finished up , it was nearing two .
I walked him out to his car and he reiterated the fact that his officials would explode if they knew he was there .
I said I would n't tell a soul if he did n't .
The minister called me the next day and again on Friday , the 19th , when he rang to say they were contemplating a partial guarantee .
My view was that such a move would accelerate capital flight , not avert it .
From then on , we spoke on a daily basis , but he still was n't convinced and , from what I could gather , his officials in the department were dead set against a full guarantee , although they did n't seem to be coming up with an alternative .
McWilliams flew to the World Economic Forum in China that day but used his weekly articles to outline the plan and how it would work .
Over the following week , I wrote three articles advocating the guarantee as the only option : on September 21st in the Sunday Business Post ; on September 24th in the Irish Independent ; and finally on September 28th in the Sunday Business Post -- the day before the guarantee was announced .
Throughout the week in China the minister was on the phone , but it seemed to me that the guarantee would not be introduced as the officials still thought a merger of the bigger and the smaller banks was the right way to go .
On Saturday , September 27th , the phone rang .
" Are you sure about this , David ? "
" No , Brian , I 'm not sure it will work .
But I am sure of one thing : we have no alternative . "
He had to make up his mind .
It was an impossible situation .
I could sense down the phone a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders .
He phoned again on Sunday , September 28th ; he was like a different person .
He was joking and in good spirits and he seemed to be relieved .
I could n't figure it out .
I had no idea whether he had made a decision either way .
He asked about Beijing and what it was like .
I wished him luck in the week ahead .
He chuckled and said he might need it .
I touched down in Munich on Tuesday morning after an overnight flight from Shanghai .
My phone rang .
It was RTE radio .
Sean O'Rourke demanded to know how the guarantee would work .
He said the latest article , together with the two previous ones , constituted , according to him , the only blueprint out there .
A little later the minister called me .
He was euphoric .
I suggested that he should really go for it now .
He could orchestrate a clean sweep of the old regime .
I put the phone down , thinking that we were in a position of strength and hard decisions would flow from this , and the people who had brought the country to its knees would be brought to theirs .
I expected our most delinquent banks would eventually go to the wall with the Irish State acting as broker , not principal , in negotiations between the bankrupt banks and their creditors .
How wrong could I have been ?

HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Apple faces the possibility of having to pay Nokia up to $ 1 billion for the technologies used in iPhones sold so far if it loses a lawsuit brought by Nokia , analysts said .
The world ’s top cellphone maker Nokia filed the suit in the United States on Thursday , saying Apple had infringed 10 patents in technologies like wireless data transfer , a key factor in the success of iPhone , and accusing Apple of trying to hitch a “ free ride ” on Nokia ’s technology investment .
Apple , a latecomer to the cellphone industry , has won 15 percent share of the smartphone market , but it has limited intellectual property assets compared with rivals , when all vendors work under cross-licensing agreements .
Neil Mawston at Strategy Analytics said Apple could have to pay Nokia anything between $ 200 million and $ 1 billion for patents used in 34 million iPhones shipped so far .
In the last quarter alone Apple sold 7.4 million iPhones for an average sales price of $ 566 , according to Strategy Analytics .
The analysts said Nokia has a case to claim such sums as it is one of the key patent holders in mobile technologies , alongside Qualcomm and Ericsson .
“ It is almost inconceivable that someone can produce a mobile phone without using Nokia patented technologies , ” said Ben Wood , research director at CCS Insight .
An Ericsson spokesman said on Friday the company has a licensing deal with Apple .
Nokia said in its court filing it had made several price offers to Apple on per patent and on portfolio basis , but the U.S. firm had declined those .

15 PCT ROYALTY RATE
The analysts said top vendors who have been in the industry for a long time usually pay a few percent of their revenue as royalties , but new entrants pay around 15 percent of the sales price of 3G phones to patent holders .
For older 2G technology the rate is clearly lower .
“ Intellectual property licensing costs create a significant barrier for late entrants into the mobile phone space .
As a result they become net payers to the big established players such as Ericsson , Motorola , Nokia and Qualcomm , ” CCS Insight ’s Wood said .
Nokia said all iPhones -- the original GSM model , and the following 3G models -- use its patented technologies .
“ This issue has the hallmarks of the iPhone name and the deal Apple struck with Cisco for the use of this name .
They wanted it , and needed it , in the same way they need Nokia ’s technologies , ” said Steven Nathasingh , managing director of research firm Vaxa Inc .
Cisco sued Apple for trademark infringement in 2007 , after Apple unveiled its iPhone , a name claimed by the network equipment maker .
The lawsuit was short lived , and settled within a month for an undisclosed amount and an agreement that both companies were free to use the “ iPhone ” trademark .
Nokia dominates the global handset market but it has lost some ground to new smartphone entrants like Apple , which entered the market with its iPhone in mid-2007 .
In July - September Nokia saw its smartphone market share dropping to 35 percent from 41 percent in the previous quarter , while Apple saw its market share rising .
“ The smart phone market share issue is a factor relative to the timing of this suit .
This has to create concern for Nokia , ” Nathasingh said .
Nokia ’s previous major legal battle ended last year with a one - time payment of 1.7 billion euros ( $ 2.55 billion ) to U.S. mobile chipmaker Qualcomm as part of a 15 - year patent agreement .

That 's a Centaur , the upper stage of the Atlas 5 rocket that took the Lunar CRater Observing and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) to our beloved Selene .
It will impact against the Cabeus crater at 5,600 mph , causing another crater about one third the size of a football field .

The Cabeus crater was selected because it 's likely to show definitive proof of water in the moon , based on the information from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , Lunar Prospector , Chandrayaan - 1 , and JAXA 's Kaguya spacecraft .
The bombing is designed to measure the proportion of water — ice to dust ratio — in lunar regolith .

The effects of the impact — a plume projected to be thirty miles high — will be observable from Earth using telescopes larger than 10 inches .
The good news is that you do n't have to own such a huge telescope to see it .
In fact , you have three options to enjoy the show .

Objective - 2.0 property methods are a nice convenience but if you need to override a property implementation — particularly an atomic , retained or copied object setter property — there are some potential bugs you can create if you do n't follow the rules carefully .
I 'll show you the pitfalls and the correct way to implement a property accessor .
I 'll also show a way to directly invoke hidden runtime functions to let Objective - C perform atomic getting and setting safely for you .
Custom getter and setter methods for implicitly atomic types
For implicitly atomic types or for types where memory management does n't apply , custom getter and setter methods in Objective - C are easy .
These " easy " situations include :
Basic value types ( char , short , int , float , long , double , etc ) .
, , , , , , etc ) .
Objective - C objects in a garbage collected environment
Assigned ( non-retained ) pointers
For these types , it is pretty hard to get a custom getter or setter method wrong .
For the following property declaration :
@property SomeAtomicType somePropertyVariable ;
the custom getter and setter simply look like this :
- ( SomeAtomicType ) somePropertyVariable { return somePropertyVariable ; } - ( void ) setSomePropertyVariable : ( SomeAtomicType ) aValue { someProperty Variable = a Value ; }
Common mistakes in accessor methods for non-atomic types
Non-atomic types require greater care .
These types include :
Objective - C objects in a manually managed memory environment
struct s and other compound types
Given how simple custom getter and setter methods are for atomic types , it is easy to be complacent about implementing methods for these types .
However , following the wrong approach can lead to memory crash bugs and lack of proper thread safety .
To illustrate how simple it can be to introduce bugs while implementing a custom setter method , consider the following declared property :
@property NSString ( copy ) someString ;
A hasty implementation of the setter might be :
- ( void ) setSomeString : ( NSString * ) aString { [ someString release ] ; someString = [ aString copy ] ; }
This implementation actually contains two bugs :
This method is not atomic .
The someString object changes twice : once on release and again when it is assigned the copied object 's address .
This method is not atomic and therefore violates the declaration ( which omits the nonatomic keyword and therefore requires atomicity ) .
The assignment contains a potential memory deallocation bug .
If someString is ever assigned its own value , it will release it before copy ing it , causing potential use of a release d variable .
The code : self .someString = someString ; is an example of this potential issue .
Do n't feel too bad if you 've ever made these mistakes .
I spent some time looking at clang 's synthesized method implementations when I was researching this post and I noticed that they 've forgotten to handle struct accessor methods in an atomic manner when required .
Safe implementations of custom accessor methods for non-atomic types
To address this second issue , Apple 's Declared Properties documentation suggests that your setter methods should look like this :
- ( void ) setSomeString : ( NSString * )
aString { if ( someString != a String ) { [ someString release ] ; someString = [ aString copy ] ; } }
This only fixes the memory issue , it does n't fix the atomicity issue .
To handle that , the only simple solution is to used a @synchronized section :
- ( void ) setSomeString : ( NSString * )
aString { @synchronized ( self ) { if ( someString != a String ) { [ someString release ] ; someString = [ aString copy ] ; } } }
This approach will also work for retain properties as well ( simply replace the copy method with a retain .
To maintain atomicity , you also need a retain / autorelease pattern and lock on any getter methods too :
- ( NSString * ) someString { @synchronized ( self ) { id result = [ someString retain ] ; } return [ result autorelease ] ; }
The @synchronized section is only required around the retain since that will prevent a setter releasing the value before we can return it ( the autorelease is then safely done outside the section ) .
For struct and other compound data types , we do n't need to retain or copy , so only the @synchronized section is required :
- ( NSRect ) someRect { @synchronized ( self ) { return someRect ; } } - ( void ) setSomeRect : ( NSRect )
aRect { @synchronized ( self ) { someRect = aRect ; } }
A faster , shorter way to implement custom accessors
There are two negative points to the custom accessor methods listed above :
They need to be coded exactly to avoid bugs .
The @synchronized section on self is coarse - grained and slow .
There is another way to implement these methods that does n't require as much careful coding and uses much more efficient locking : use the same functions that the synthesized methods use .
The following functions are implemented in the Objective - C runtime :
id objc_getProperty ( id self , SEL _cmd , ptrdiff_t offset , BOOL atomic ) ; void objc_setProperty ( id self , SEL _cmd , ptrdiff_t offset , id newValue , BOOL atomic , BOOL shouldCopy ) ; void objc_copy Struct ( void * dest , const void * src , ptrdiff_t size , BOOL atomic , BOOL has Strong ) ;
While these functions are implemented in the runtime , they are not declared , so if you want to use them , you must declare them yourself ( the compiler will then find their definitions when you compile ) .
These methods are much faster than using a @synchronized section on the whole object because ( as shown in their Apple opensource implementation ) they use a finely grained , instance variable only spin lock for concurrent access ( although the copy struct function uses two locks following an interface design mixup ) .
When you declare these functions , you can also declare the following convenience macros :
# define AtomicRetainedSetToFrom( dest , source ) \ objc_setProperty ( self , _cmd , ( ptrdiff_t ) ( &dest ) - ( ptrdiff_t ) ( self ) , source , YES , NO ) # define AtomicCopiedSetToFrom ( dest , source ) \ objc_setProperty ( self , _cmd , ( ptrdiff_t ) ( &dest ) - ( ptrdiff_t ) ( self ) , source , YES , YES ) # define AtomicAutoreleasedGet ( source ) \ objc_getProperty ( self , _cmd , ( ptrdiff_t ) ( &source ) - ( ptrdiff_t ) ( self ) , YES ) # define AtomicStructToFrom ( dest , source ) \ objc_copy Struct ( &dest , & source , sizeof ( __typeof__( source ) ) , YES , NO )
I like to include the " To / From " words so I can remember the ordering of the source and destination parameters .
You can remove them if they bother you .
With these macros , the someString " copy " getter and setter methods above would become :
- ( NSString * ) someString { return AtomicAutoreleasedGet ( someString ) ; } - ( void ) setSomeString : ( NSString * ) aString { AtomicCopiedSetToFrom ( someString , a String ) ; }
and the someRect accessor methods shown above would become :
- ( NSRect ) someRect { NSRect result ; AtomicStructToFrom ( result , someRect ) ; return result ; } - ( void ) setSomeRect : ( NSRect ) aRect { AtomicStructToFrom ( someRect , a Rect ) ; }
Conclusion
Most of the accessor methods I 've shown here are atomic but in reality , most Objective - C object accessors are declared nonatomic .
Even if your properties are declared nonatomic , the memory management rules still apply .
These rules are important to follow since they can lead to some very obscure and hard to track down memory bugs .
The macros I 've provided are all for atomic properties .
For non-atomic properties the boilerplate assignment code is probably simple enough to remember .
If not , you could also use a macro :
# define NonatomicRetainedSetToFrom( a , b ) do {if ( a!=b ) {[ a release ] ; a= [b retain ] ; }}while (0 ) # define NonatomicCopySetToFrom( a , b ) do {if ( a!=b ) {[ a release ] ; a= [ b copy ] ; }}while (0 )
Update : following comments below , I realize I omitted to qualify the situations in which these accessors are thread - safe .
Specifically :
Washington ( CNN ) --
The Federal Aviation Administration revoked the licenses of two Northwest Airlines pilots Tuesday in an extraordinary letter in which the agency chastised the pair , saying they endangered the public by flying an hour and half without contacting controllers " while you were on a frolic of your own . "
The letter to Northwest Captain Timothy B. Cheney and First Officer Richard I .
Cole puts the total time the pilots maintained radio silence at 91 minutes -- 13 minutes longer than originally defined by federal investigators .
The letter said the pilots were " extremely reckless . "
" Not only did you not comply with ... [ air traffic controller ] instructions , you did not even monitor the aircraft 's air - ground radios , " the letter said .
" You were disengaged and impervious to the serious threat to your own safety , as well as the safety of people for whom you are responsible .
This is a total dereliction and disregard for your duties . "
The letter provides new details about the flight .
Cheney , 53 , and Cole , 54 , were piloting Flight 188 from San Diego , California , to the Minneapolis - St. Paul airport in Minnesota on Wednesday when air traffic controllers lost radio contact with the Airbus A320 over the Denver , Colorado , area .
Instead of beginning to descend as planned about 22 minutes before its scheduled arrival , the plane continued flying at its cruise altitude of 35,000 feet and passed over the Minnesota airport .
At 8:14 p.m. CT -- 36 minutes after the plane was to begin its descent and 14 minutes after its scheduled arrival -- the pilots contacted controllers , the FAA said .
One of the pilots radioed : " We got distracted and we 've overflown MSP [ Minneapolis - St. Paul airport ] .
We are overhead EAU [ Eau Claire , Wisconsin ] and would like to make a 180 and to [ make ] an arrival from over EAU . "
Cheney and Cole told federal investigators that they " lost track of time " while working on personal laptop computers , the National Transportation Safety Board said .
They became aware of their plane 's position only after a flight attendant asked about the landing time , according to the NTSB .
The FAA said the revocations cite several violations of regulations , including failure to comply with air traffic control and clearances and operating carelessly and recklessly .
The pilots have 10 days to appeal the revocations , which are effective immediately , to the NTSB , the FAA said .
Flight 188 carried 144 passengers , the two pilots and three flight attendants .
Cheney was hired in 1985 and has more than 20,000 hours of flight time , while Cole was hired in 1997 and has about 11,000 hours of flight time , according to an NTSB report released Monday .
Neither pilot reported having had an accident , incident or violation , neither had any ongoing medical conditions , and neither said he was tired , the report said .
They each had had a 19 - hour layover in San Diego ; neither said he had slept or argued during the flight , but both said " there was a distraction " in the cockpit , according to the report .
The pilots said there was " a concentrated period of discussion where they did not monitor the airplane or calls " from air traffic control , though both said they heard conversation on the radio , the report said .
Neither pilot said he noticed messages sent by company dispatchers , the report added .
It said the men were talking about a new monthly crew flight scheduling system that was put into place in the wake of Northwest 's merger with Delta Air Lines .
" Each pilot accessed and used his personal laptop computer while they discussed the airline crew flight scheduling procedure , " the report said .
" The first officer , who was more familiar with the procedure , was providing instruction to the captain . "
After landing at the Minneapolis - St.
Paul airport , both voluntarily underwent alcohol breath tests , which proved negative , the report said .
John Smith is an amoral gunslinger in the days of Prohibition .
On the lam from his latest ( unspecified ) exploits , he happens upon the town of Jericho , Texas .
Actually , calling Jericho a town would be too generous -- it has become more like a ghost town , since two warring gangs have ' driven off all the decent folk . '
Smith sees this as an opportunity to play both sides off against each other , earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun .
Despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions , he finds himself risking his life for his , albeit skewed , sense of honor ....

Now , on top of all that , the bureau is confronting what former director Kenneth Prewitt regards as an “ unprecedented ” resistance to the census itself .
The GPS units are these objectors ’ most fantastical bogeyman , but the Census Bureau , just by trying to do its job , has served up several others .
Since well before the September death of department field worker Bill Sparkman - found strung from a tree in Kentucky with “ Fed ” scrawled on his chest - brought the issue to mainstream attention , the critics have been constructing an alternative paradigm , in which the census is not the benign bureaucratic exercise it pretends to be but instead a citizen - tracking , election - manipulating project controlled by Barack Obama , administered by his minions at ACORN , and aimed at advancing the agenda of Big Government while trampling personal freedom .
That ’s how it ’s gone for the Census Bureau all year .
Its objective in the 2010 Census , as it has been going back to the inaugural census in 1790 , is to produce the most complete possible accounting of the US population .
That goal , never easy to achieve , has in recent decades been complicated by hard - to - count minority and immigrant groups and an increasingly transient general population .
This time around it faces the added wild card of hundreds of thousands of people displaced by Hurricane Katrina and the foreclosure crisis .
Creeped out , people were .
Hypotheses flew on right - wing websites and talk radio :
The feds wanted the coordinates of American homes in order to facilitate an eventual roundup of dissenters .
Or the GPS readings were for when the White House , under the cover of an unspecified calamity , invites in the UN soldiers - who , after all , wo n’t be able to read American street signs .
Or for when the authorities , cutting to the chase , call in unmanned Predator strikes against undesirables .
But as census canvassers took their handheld computers down city streets and exurban cul - de- sacs and backcountry lanes , something started to happen .
“ They show up at your house , and you look down , and you ask what they are doing , ” says Alex Jones , the syndicated radio host .
“ And they say , ‘ Oh , just getting a GPS reading . ’
Regardless of your political affiliation , there ’s just something inherently creepy about that . ”
IN THE HIERARCHY of scary - looking devices , the Census Bureau ’s new handheld computers fall somewhere below the staple remover , and only a little above the hole punch .
The boxy units , about the size of a checkbook , allow the department ’s field workers to collect and transmit information electronically , including GPS positions , so houses and apartments get placed in the right location in its records .
In early April , when census agents began the address canvassing that is the initial phase of every decennial count , they carried these handhelds for the first time .
This milestone initially stirred the same buzz as an Agriculture Department report on projected avocado yields .
Yet from the beginning , there have also been Americans who ’ve wanted nothing to do with it .
George Washington , for instance , was miffed that the inaugural census put the population at only 3,929,214 - he ’d hoped to break 4 million , knowing that the bigger the number , the stronger the deterrent to would - be attackers .
Washington partly blamed the shortfall on residents who ’d ducked the process , some citing religious reasons for their non-compliance .
As the country , and census tactics , evolved , so too did the grounds for defiance .
In 1940 , as the US pulled out of the Depression , Congress authorized for the first time asking people how much money respondents earned .
“ Needless to say , ” says the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee ’s Margo Anderson , author of “ The American Census : A Social History , ” “ when the public got wind of that , there was a huge debate . ”
Two decades later , future National Review senior editor William Rickenbacker would earn notoriety , and a $ 100 fine , for refusing to fill out his long - form questionnaire .
( He railed against its intrusiveness in a letter to the secretary of commerce , whom he addressed “ Dear Snoopchief . ” )
COUNTING PEOPLE IS one of the first jobs America assigned to its young federal government .
The Constitution calls for an enumeration of the population every 10 years “ in such manner as [ Congress ] shall by law direct , ” and the stakes of that effort are huge .
The results determine how many seats states get in the House of Representatives , as well as where a lot of federal money - currently more than $ 400 billion - gets spent .
Over time , Congress has also employed the census to collect figures on everything from home ownership to commuting habits , and use them to shape policy .
To the census ’s admirers , it qualifies as a singularly potent expression of national ideals .
Writing in “ The American People , ” a book about the 2000 Census , Prewitt put it this way : “ As a civic event with the ambition to include every person in the nation , the only such civic event in America ’s democracy , the census counts . ”
It can all sound like the plot line for a lost Robert Ludlum novel , and indeed , the anti-census claims are easy to knock down on factual grounds .
But the roots of the concerns are genuine , and trace back to the fundamental American conflict between a democratic government ’s need for information and citizens ’ desire for privacy .
Humdrum as it seems , the U.S. Census has always ridden that fault line .
Heading into 2010 , the question , and it ’s not an idle one , is whether we ’re merely witnessing a particularly fevered installment of a long - running national debate , or the arrival of a United States where even such a seemingly basic act of government is just another thing that a fractious populace refuses to agree on .
Such was the atmosphere that the census canvassers and their GPS devices walked into in April .
A woman named Jane Lesko , who heads the Idaho chapter of the conservative Eagle Forum , encountered one of the field workers at her rural property .
“ The woman {hellip}said that her supervisor told them that they could climb locked gates with “ NO TRESPASSING ” signs on them , ” she wrote in the “ alert ” she subsequently sent out to her members via e-mail .
Her missive was picked up by anti-government websites , and before long came to the attention of conservative activist and online radio host Douglas Gibbs , who invited Lesko onto his show and advanced the aforementioned possible UN - soldiers - connection in a post on his blog .
That theory gained momentum on March 18 , when Fox News reported that ACORN , the community organizing group beset with voter - registration fraud allegations , had signed on as one of the Census Bureau ’s national partners , and would among other things help put out word about the more than 1 million temporary workers the bureau needs to hire to complete next year ’s count .
Though ACORN would be just one of 100,000 groups expected to come aboard as a census partner , and although its staffers would not be doing any actual canvassing or enumerating themselves , its involvement fed the growing right - wing suspicions .
The movement began to take shape last winter , after President Obama announced his first nominee for commerce secretary , the official to whom the Census Bureau traditionally reports .
Obama ’s pick , New Hampshire Republican Senator Judd Gregg , raised alarm among some minority advocates , who noted that Gregg had opposed increases to census funding and could not be trusted to do everything necessary to reduce undercounts .
To mollify those critics , White House spokesman Ben LaBolt indicated that for 2010 , the census director would now “ work closely with White House senior management . ”
To some census observers - especially those observing from GOP congressional seats - this looked like a power grab , and Gregg mentioned the move when he withdrew from consideration the following week .
The Obama team backed off , stressing that the new commerce nominee , former Washington Governor Gary Locke , would oversee the census as usual .
But by then , aided by Republican spin , the notion had taken hold : Obama wanted control of the Census , and had put chief - of - staff Rahm Emanuel in charge of rigging the 2010 results .
In a sense , this year ’s controversies echo the tradition of protesting the census ’s mission .
But they are also different , in both form and volume .
Thanks to the Internet ( and with an assist from partisan broadcasters ) , the Census Bureau is contending not with individual dissenters , but with a collective and vocal resistance whose arguments challenge the legitimacy of federal census - taking itself .
More recently the Census Bureau has triggered political fencing matches over its statistical methods .
To compensate for undercounting immigrants and poor members of racial minorities , who disproportionately fail to participate , the agency in 1990 and 2000 sought to use the technique called statistical sampling , which would adjust the “ hard count ” by consulting a subsequent survey showing how many people had been missed .
Both times , those plans were blocked by Republicans worried that such sampling would bolster the size of traditionally Democratic voting blocs .
Most of the elements of the supposed Obama - led plot to hijack the 2010 Census had their origins long before Obama ’s presidency .
The handheld computers were approved during the Bush administration in a bid to boost efficiency ; the partnership program made controversial this year by ACORN ’s involvement was created by Riche prior to the 2000 Census as a cheap way to halt a decline in mail - back rates .
It was the same rationale that prompted the bureau that year to start emphasizing that it ’s against the law to ignore the census - which , this time around , has only further provoked those wary of government coercion .
Census in Schools dates back even farther , and was designed to reach families whose bilingual children are the home ’s only English speakers .
( And while intrusiveness is very much in the eye of the beholder , next year ’s census will be the first in 70 years to omit the long form , which asks finer - graded questions about lifestyle and socioeconomic status . )
THE CENSUS BUREAU , of course , does n’t want to scare people .
It wants to count them .
And it sees its job as to do so by all available means - “ by hook or by crook , ” says Martha Riche , who preceded Ken Prewitt as bureau director .
Paranoid thinking , like lint , has a way of balling up with like elements .
Eventually everything to do with the 2010 Census started to look like a plot .
On Aug. 26 , a week before the fracas over President Obama ’s back - to - school speech surfaced , USA Today published an article about the Census Bureau ’s “ Census in Schools ” outreach effort , which distributes posters and lesson plans to public schools nationwide in a bid to boost participation .
Over the summer , Representative Michele Bachmann , a Republican from Minnesota , provided possible recourse , declaring a kind of info - blockade .
In June , she told the Washington Times that she planned to answer only the first question on the 2010 form , which asks how many people live at your address .
Bachmann claimed , incorrectly , that the Constitution authorized the Census to count people and nothing more .
The other queries , she said , were overly intrusive .
Later , during an interview with Fox News ’s Glenn Beck - who has taken up census concerns as a favorite story - she mentioned that it was census data that aided the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II .
By that logic , it ’s the very innocuousness of the 2010 count that makes it suspect .
But how to combat such a sneaky enemy ?
After all , as Lesko points out , now that the government has your GPS position locked in its databanks , it ’s not like you can “ have it back . ”
“ We ’re talking government here , ” says Gibbs in an interview .
“ Why would they want these coordinates ?
The first answer is to more easily find people .
I ’m not trying to be a conspiratorialist or anything like that .
I ’m just asking the question .
” As he sees it , once Washington decided it wanted these GPS readings , the way to go about obtaining them was obvious .
“ People do n’t really question the Census Bureau , ” he says .
Not that pointing any of that out would change the minds of current census critics .
Sarah Igo , a Vanderbilt historian who has studied the census as part of her research into perceptions of public surveys , notes that how the bureau ’s actions are perceived is always influenced by the broader national mood .
“ When the data is collected every 10 years , ” she says , “ attitudes toward the government get projected onto what is ostensibly a non-political agency . ”
Amid a health care debate that has some Americans worried about bureaucrats inserting themselves between patients and their doctors - and in the wake of an Iraq invasion and massive bank bailout that stirred unease with unchecked Washington power on both sides of the political spectrum - perhaps it should n’t be surprising that the early stages of the 2010 Census have met stubborn pushback .
At the same time , to attribute the resistance to the present political climate might be to overlook the emergence of a more fundamental challenge for the Census Bureau .
The agency has n’t changed how it handles personal information :
The paper forms and corresponding electronic records that show how you , as an individual , answered the agency ’s questions ( the “ microdata , ” in agency parlance ) are sealed for 72 years to maintain privacy and confidentiality .
But as the Census Bureau has adopted new tools in pursuit of its mandate - and opponents have gained a powerful tool with the blogosphere - it has inevitably become a bigger and scarier - looking target .
In its files , the satellite readings that canvassers collected with their handhelds are paired with addresses , not their occupants ’ names - another layer of protection for individuals .
That does n’t sound so reassuring , though , to privacy - minded homeowners who glance outside to see a government worker pointing a GPS device at their door .
It ’s less than six months to go before next April 1 , Census Day for 2010 , the day to which the next national count will be pegged .
By then , asks Anderson , the census historian , “ Will we have worked ourselves through this debate and made some decisions about how to deal with it ? ”
In her view , it ’s too early to say , though precedent does offer census proponents some cause for optimism .
For all the debate over the income questions in 1940 , ultimately , a compromise was struck - people who felt uncomfortable telling a stranger what they earned would be handed a card on which they could privately enter that information and submit it by mail .
What ’s more , says Anderson , “ When it came down to it most people did n’t mind , and did volunteer the answer to their enumerator . ”
While the activists urging defiance of the 2010 Census have one American impulse on their side , those who hope to see everyone counted can play to another .
We like being left alone , but perhaps even more , we also like to feel that we count .
And in past fights over the census , it ’s the latter urge that has won out .
“ Americans have on balance always come around , ” says Anderson , “ and been more concerned about getting into the census than getting out of it . ”

FRANKLIN TOWNSHIP ( Somerset County ) --
A pair of New Jersey lawmakers are asking Gov. Jon Corzine to pardon a Somerset County man who is facing trial for growing marijuana to
alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis
.
Sens. Nicholas Scutari and Raymond Lesniak ( both D - Union ) are urging Corzine to drop the most serious charge pending against Franklin Township resident John Ray Wilson , who is accused of first - degree maintaining or operating a drug- production facility and other offenses .
If convicted , the 37 - year - old faces up to 20 years in prison .
The case , being prosecuted by the state Attorney General ’s Office , is an “ inappropriate ” and “ inhumane application of the letter of the law , ” the senators said in a release today .
“ It seems cruel and unusual to treat New Jersey ’s sick and dying as if they were drug cartel kingpins , ” said Scutari ( D - Union ) , who is the prime sponsor of the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act , which is pending before the state Assembly .
Wilson was arrested in August 2008 after a helicopter pilot spotted marijuana plants growing behind his home .
Detectives then found well - worn trails leading to 17 plants , some up to 6 - feet tall .
His case has drawn widespread attention as lawmakers ponder whether New Jersey will become the 14th state to give patients with debilitating illnesses structured access to the drug .
“ New Jersey ’s tough criminal drug laws were never intended to be used against patients suffering from chronic and terminal medical conditions , ” said Lesniak ( D - Union ) , who is the bill ’s co-sponsor .
Wilson ’s lawyer James Wronko said his client is grateful that the senators are attempting to secure a pardon and are pushing the legislation .
In July , Superior Court Judge Robert Reed said Wilson could not reference his condition at trial or assert personal use as a defense , as such claims do not apply to the charges .
The establishment of medical marijuana for personal use as a state policy or as a defense is for the Legislature to decide , and not for a court to create , he said .
He is expected to set a trial date Friday .
“ You know what makes this a special case ?
Charging this guy with a first - degree offense for maintaining a drug production facility , ” Lesniak said by phone .
“ We ’re only asking for him to be pardoned from that charge , which would allow him to enter the pretrial intervention program , ” Lesniak said , referencing the probationary program for first - time , nonviolent offenders .
Upon successful completion , the charge would be dismissed .
While pardons are typically requested after a conviction , it is within the governor ’s power act at any time , Scutari said by phone .
Wilson ’s case is “ a good example of why we need to move this legislation forward , ” he said .
Corzine spokesman Robert Corrales said : “ It ’s just inappropriate right now to comment on an ongoing investigation . ”

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation , 30 percent of 19 - 24 year olds are uninsured , more than any other group .
In its 2008 study , the Commonwealth Fund found that 66 percent of young adults aged 19 to 29 who experienced a time without coverage in the past year said they had gone without it because of the cost .
The GOP's and Blue Dog 's solution : Catastrophic insurance .
Catastrophic insurance does n't kick in until $ 2,500 - $ 5,000 from what I 've seen .
Even if they start at a $ 1,000 deductible , you 're still talking about a prohibitive expense , particularly in this job market .
So , kids like Ms. Young end up airlifted to emergency rooms , when an office visit with proper pharma coverage might have sufficed .
The unlucky ones like her pay the ultimate price for our lack of compassion and self centered drive to maintain the status quo ; in the face of overwhelming moral and financial evidence ; that we should do otherwise .
A large part of our uninsured population has always been young adults .
The general consensus has been that they 're less likely to need healthcare , and therefore insurance .
The Swine Flu , however , affects the young in disproportionate numbers .
Thousands of students at Washington State University were recently afflicted .
Much like the recent immolation of everything Wall Street touches , human error and Mother Nature have exposed the Status Quo for what it is :
Greed triumphing violently over compassion , common sense and decency .
News of Kimberly Young ’s death Wednesday , Sept. 23 , came as a shock to those who knew the vibrant 22 - year - old who was working at least two jobs in Oxford after graduating with a double major in December 2008 .
Young lived in an off - campus apartment and had been working at least two jobs — four years at the Kofenya coffee shop and nearly three years at the Bagel & Deli , both on High Street in uptown Oxford .
At the Bagel & Deli , a memorial sign in the window reads , in part : " In a world where happiness comes with such a price , you made everyone richer by just being you .
Life just is n’t the same without you , friend . "
Rest in Peace Miss Kimberly Young
22 years of age .

This is what happens when Wall Street Owns HealthCare
Percentages of ownership of insurance companies by Wall Street Banks and funds :
United 86.03 %
WellPoint 89.03 %
Aetna 91.80 %
CIGNA Corp. 84.91 %
Coventry Health 92.87 %
Health Net Inc. 100.59 % ???
Humana 88.88 %
Amerigroup 108.38 % ( WTF ???)
The same 15 - 20 companies that own and control 40 % shares in these health insurance companies control 20 % of GE , 40 % of CBS and 25 % of ABC .
Perhaps , that has something to do with overexposure of manufactured dissents instead of factual reporting and data analysis .
Andy Phifer , like many of us , faced a glowing red ring on his nonfunctional Xbox 360 .
Facing an RRoD warranty technicality , he sent Microsoft $ 100 to make necessary repairs .
Things did n't go so well .
Here 's his story : UPDATE
I 'm sure you get stories like this all the time , and I 'm sure the news is old ( Xbox 360s break , they suck , haha ) , but this is n't so much a story about an Xbox being broken as it is a story about Xbox support failing to repair and identify the problem after a few months and three repairs .
I can't get anyone at Microsoft to even apologize for them messing up over and over time and time again , so I thought I 'd take to the internet to see if anyone wants to write about a true Xbox Support horror story .
I 'm 25 years old , work in a professional office building as a newspaper designer , am married , have a son and am not very dumb .
Xbox got four red lights back in July .
My Xbox is still under warranty , but warranty does n't cover four red lights .
I happily send them $ 100 .
[ Ed note : 4 red lights is code for a missing AV cable , but can be caused by other issues .
3 red lights is the famous RRoD and is covered by the warranty . ]
Four weeks after putting in the repair order , the Xbox was sent back fixed .
It is now August .
It took four weeks for the repair to complete in part because of shipping problems , including five boxes being delivered to my door and two instances of undeliverable addresses .
Really , the repair only took a week .
Getting the correct box to my house took three weeks .
Three weeks after I got it back , on August 27 , I got three red lights about ten minutes away from beating Shadow Complex with 100 % items found .
About 2 weeks after repair was ordered , Xbox was returned to me – three red lights remained .
About 2 weeks after repair was ordered , Xbox was returned to me – three red lights remained .
About 2 weeks after repair was ordered , Xbox was returned to me – three red lights remained .
( that 's not a typo .
I sent it in three times , and it was sent back still broken three times )
It is now October .
I took to Twitter to rage about Microsoft and a friend asked me if I checked the lights on the power supply .
No person at any point in this repair process going all the way back to July has ever asked me or told me or hinted about or mentioned the light on the power supply indicating the power supply might be faulty .
I checked it , and the power supply was orange .
I 'd bet the very first time I got the three red lights , this might 've been the problem .
Why no one in the process , after the Xbox came back to me " unrepaired , " asked me to check the power supply I do not know .
After much convincing , a new power supply was ordered sent to me by Microsoft .
It arrived after a week .
The male power supply did n't fit into my female Xbox port .
Apparently , Xbox has used a few different kinds of power supplies over the years .
Today , October 7 , the new power supply has been ordered and might arrive in 2 - 3 weeks ( they have to process the request , 7 days they say , and then ship it , 5 days .
Add weekends off and time to deliver , and it 'll be 2 - 3 weeks ) .
So after all that , I 've been able to play my 360 for about three weeks total since July ...
Am I at fault ?
Maybe 1 % of this is my fault – I could 've looked online for more reasons the three red lights might happen , at which point I would 've found out about the power supply problem … but still , that 's no excuse , because it is n't my friends job to fix my console , it is Microsoft 's job , and they have failed .

Proponents of health reform say women do n't know what 's in it in for them - and question why Democrats have been slow to target women .
Analysts to Dems : Aim pitch at women
With health reform still struggling among voters , analysts say Democrats are missing the chance to win over one key group — women — despite dramatic proposals to transform the way insurers treat them .
All of the bills in Congress add strong new protections for women ’s health , but President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats rarely talk about them .

Maternity care would be guaranteed .
Insurance companies could no longer charge higher premiums for women than men .
And insurers now allowed to label a Cesarean section or even domestic violence a pre-existing condition to deny coverage would be barred from the practice .
But proponents of health reform say women do n’t know what ’s in it in for them — and question why Democrats have been slow to target women with the same intensity that political campaigns pursue this key swing group .
“ In general , health reformers have missed the opportunity to define health reform as a bread - and - butter issue for women , ” said Drew Altman , president of the Kaiser Family Foundation , a nonprofit health policy organization .
“ It gets discussed in the Beltway , but it does n’t break through . ”
Women typically make most of a family ’s decisions on health care and have historically been more concerned about health care and supportive of making changes to the system .
Women also are less likely to work at jobs that provide insurance or make the wages necessary to purchase coverage on their own .
But in a surprise to Democratic strategists , polls find women are not much more likely than men to support health care reform .
A Kaiser Family Foundation survey from September showed 42 percent of women thought they would be better off if reform passed , while 42 percent of men thought the same .
Women over 65 are less likely to support the plan than younger women .
“ They feel conflicted , ” said Celinda Lake , a leading Democratic pollster on health care issues .
Following a tumultuous summer , public opinion on health care reform has climbed back up to the levels seen before angry town halls dominated the news .
But if Democrats want to strengthen support for the proposal , they need to zero in on women , proponents say .
“ Women are the ones who are going to pay attention to health care , women are the swing vote on health care , women are the ‘ influentials , ’ meaning if women like the plan , then the men in their lives like the plan , ” Lake said .
“ So in that sense , it makes sense to target women . ”
Richard Kirsch , campaign manager for Health Care for America Now , an umbrella group of liberal organizations , said “ a lot more can be done to focus health care as a women ’s issue . ”
“ Particularly for independent women , focusing on this more can really help lift reform with the public , ” he said .
First Lady Michelle Obama spoke with the leaders of women ’s groups in September .
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , White House health reform director Nancy - Ann DeParle and a cadre of senior White House aides who are women have done most of the outreach , speaking with women 's groups , nurses and small businesses .
HHS released a report earlier this year on how the system does n't work for women .
Obama has targeted his message more broadly , appearing with nurses and emphasizing stability in cost and care as a key outcome of the reform legislation — which pollsters say appeals strongly to women — but he has yet to do an event aimed solely at making the case to women .
Linda Douglass , a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Health Reform , said more events targeting women are in the works , as part of a “ vigorous outreach program . ”
Sen. Barbara Mikulski ( D - Md. ) , the dean of the Senate women , initiated her own drive two weeks ago that has included women - only talk - in on the Senate floor , an appearance by 11 women senators on CNN ’s “ Larry King Live ” and a hearing last week in which a Colorado woman described how an insurer would n’t provide coverage unless she was sterilized .
The National Women ’s Law Center , which produced an influential 2008 report on gender disparities in health care , launches a campaign Tuesday called Being a Woman Is Not a Pre-Existing Condition .
Still , with so much of the debate consumed by the public option , the divisions in Congress and the lack of bipartisan support , the message has been overshadowed .
“ There has been a lot of attention this year on the need for health reform , ” Sen . Sherrod Brown ( D - Ohio ) said last week , “ but there has been too little focused on how health reform will work to improve the health and well - being of more than half our nation ’s population — America ’s women . ”
Brown described the elimination of gender discrimination in health care as an historic advance comparable to landmark legislation prohibiting unequal treatment between men and women in employment , education and sports .
“ The sex discrimination in pricing , I have personally tried to get rid of that for 40 years , ” said Eleanor Smeal , president of the Feminist Majority .
The problem is the individual market , where insurance is often more expensive and less predictable because people do not have the bargaining clout that comes with an employer - provided plan .
The bills passed by five congressional committees would prohibit insurers from charging women more than they do men .
Insurers would also be required to provide coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions and provide maternity care as part of a minimum benefits package .
The National Women ’s Law Center report found women in some states pay 50 percent more in premiums — and it was n’t necessarily because they received maternity care .
The “ vast majority ” of the plans surveyed did not offer maternity coverage or women were asked to purchase a supplemental plan , according to the report .
“ I imagine if we went out and did a poll , I do n’t think they know this ends discrimination pricing , ” Smeal said .
“ And most do n’t even know they are paying more . ”
The practice of charging higher premiums based on gender is prohibited or limited in 12 states , according to the law center report .
Insurers can end these practices but only if the risk pool is expanded by requiring all Americans — young and old , health and unhealthy — to purchase coverage , said Karen Ignagni , president of America ’s Health Insurance Plans , the industry ’s lobbying group .
AHIP released a report last week raising concerns that the individual mandate in the Finance Committee , which could be the blueprint for the Senate bill , may be too weak .
Jim Kessler , vice president for policy for Third Way , a centrist think tank , said with public opinion on health leveling off , a rigorous campaign for women ’s support is more important after a bill is signed .
Women form the base of the Democratic Party — and if they ’re not sold next year on health reform , Democrats will suffer in November 2010 , Kessler said .
“ The moment health care is signed into law , that is half - time .
The next half is selling it to the American people — and women , ” Kessler said .
“ They have to know what ’s in it for them .
The American people will either put a stamp of approval on reform or repeal it .
That is going to be the central question . ”
The offbeat bride : Anli , data analyst
Her offbeat partner : Laura , public servant
Location & date of wedding : The Old Stone House , NSW Australia — 5 September 2009
What made our wedding offbeat :
We wanted a ceremony that reflected our geeky , romantic , pink aesthetic , while at the same time being profound and meaningful .
Our ceremony was themed around the video game Portal and the anime series Revolutionary Girl Utena .
We incorporated lots of geeky details , from the table names ( Revolution , Sierra , Katara and GLaDOS ) to the choice of music .
We also kept several traditional elements such as bouquets , dresses and bridesmaids .
However , we both walked down the aisle unaccompanied and skipped the garter / bouquet toss .
I DIY 'ed many details , including bouquets , centrepieces , bonbons , stationery and my hand - embellished corset , skirts , petticoat and detachable train .
Because our wedding was so small , we skipped having a dance floor and invited guests to games of Lupus In Tabula after dinner .
Our cake and bonbon were companion - cube shaped .
We played Rock Band instead of having a Hens Night .
And we walked down the aisle to an obscure piece of music from Utena .
Because we can't legally be wed in Australia , we had a good friend officiate and he did a great job .
We kept our vows secret from one another until the night before , but somehow both of us managed to discuss Laura 's fear of spiders in each of our vows .
Many of our friends very kindly offered their support and help , from playing violin at the ceremony , setting up decorations , making sure we were fed , proof - reading our vows , driving us around before the day and looking after our cats .
We also both wore dresses , although we did n't keep our dresses secret ; we had photo shoots together before the ceremony and even got dressed in the same room !
Laura kept her pink hair , I kept my glasses on through all the photos and we posed with Nintendo DS consoles .
Our biggest challenge :
We were engaged for almost two years and picked our venue a year and a half in advance .
Closer to the date , we were unsure whether the site vendors understood our vision for the day as we had originally discussed .
We were very concerned about having adequate heating as many guests would be traveling in from a warmer state .
We also had problems with not being able to order the correct furniture that we originally wanted .
With some good communication , we were able to sort out our issues .
And the venue was set up mostly as we had originally envisaged .
It helped that our vendors were very patient and understanding people .
We needed to get confirmation on details early on as it really made the process less stressful .
We also made contingency plans ( for example , seeking alternative sources for furniture and decorations ) which we , fortunately , did not have to use .
My favorite moment : Laura 's favourite moment was watching me walk down the aisle towards her while our lovely friend Katherine played Hikari Sasu Niwa on violin .
We had decided she would go first as during the rehearsal I felt really nervous being the first in line .
However , during the ceremony I read my vows first .
My favourite moment was the sunset photoshoot after the ceremony .
I felt much more relaxed after everything had worked out really well and we had a lovely romantic walk together at the bottom of the garden and had some time alone with one another and our discreet photographer , Julie Clyde .
My offbeat advice :
Our advice is to really spend some serious time with one another discussing your direction for your ceremony and the kind of vows that you want to make .
We spent a lot of time developing our vows and had great input from some of our friends , which we highly recommend seeking if you can .
Also , if you 're going the DIY route , try to have everything done at least a month in advance .
I was still altering dresses ( which was unplanned for ) on the week of the wedding which was n't fun at all given that we had international and interstate guests to entertain and an international honeymoon to prepare for .
Care to share a few vendor links ?
Enough talk — show me the wedding porn !
A Maricopa County Sheriff 's detention officer told a Superior Court judge on Friday that he removed documents from a defense attorney 's table last week because he recognized the paperwork as material that court security employees had not previously screened , according to an attorney representing the Sheriff 's Office .
The detention officer 's decision in a hearing on Oct. 19 led Judge Lisa Flores to suspend the sentencing for Antonio Lozano .
At a hearing before Judge Gary Donahoe on Friday morning , Officer Adam Stoddard said security officers had screened defense documents in the case , all of which were typed on white paper with a legal caption on them , said Tom Liddy , an attorney from Maricopa County 's civil division who appeared at the hearing Friday on behalf of the Sheriff 's Office .
The record of the hearing Friday was sealed .
Stoddard told the judge that when he walked near the defense attorney 's table he recognized some documents that were n't previously screened , Liddy said , so he had the paperwork copied for the record and returned it to the defendant 's table .
Donahoe reviewed the paperwork in question on Friday and determined that the documents were subject to attorney - client privilege , Liddy said .
The only question remaining , Liddy said , is whether Stoddard was acting in good faith when he had the documents copied or whether he was in contempt .
After more than 90 minutes of testimony from Stoddard , Donahoe continued the hearing to Thursday where he could make a ruling , Liddy said .
Security officers regularly screen paperwork for in -custody defendants , like Lozano , to ensure that there is no contraband stuffed between the documents and that nothing is included which could be used as a weapon , Liddy said .
Lozano pleaded guilty to aggravated assault on Sept. 10 and was in a sentencing hearing when , according to court - surveillance video , he noticed Stoddard taking the documents .
Lozano then alerts his defense attorney , Joanne Cuccia .
Cuccia did not return a call for comment .
A defense attorney who saw video of the event expressed shock .
" He did it with such utter nonchalance ; it appears to me there was some direction for him to do that .
It 's just completely astounding , " criminal defense attorney Mike Black told Channel 12 ( KPNX ) .
Sheriff 's Deputy Chief Jack MacIntyre said a detention officer screening paperwork was standard procedure .
" The original papers were given back to the defense attorney , and the copy that was made was sealed in an envelope and given to county counsel .
When county counsel read them , they gave them back to the defense attorney , " MacIntyre said .
" Nobody from the Sheriff 's Office ever read them . "
The Obama administration “ refused ” to take meaningful steps to reform the banking system in the wake of last year ’s financial crisis , and the opportunity to do so has now been missed , says a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund .
Simon Johnson told PBS ’s Bill Moyers that he expects an even larger financial crisis to hit the United States in the coming years because the system was not fixed through reform , but rather through a massive injection of taxpayers ’ money into the failing banks .

“ The short term opportunity was missed , ” Johnson said on Bill Moyers Journal Friday night .
“ There was an opportunity the Obama administration had .
President Obama campaigned on a message of change . …
The time for change for the financial sector was absolutely upon us , this was abundantly apparent in January of this year . ”
Johnson continued : “ Rahm Emanuel , the president ’s chief of staff , is known for saying ‘ Never let a good crisis go to waste . ’
The crisis for the big banks is substantially over .
And it was completely wasted .
The administration refused to break the power of the big banks when they had the opportunity earlier this year .
And the regulatory reforms they are now pursuing … will turn out to be essentially meaningless . ”
Johnson said that the bank bailout would not fix the long - term instability of the financial sector , and “ when [ the crisis ] comes back , it will come back with a vengeance , and it will be I think even more devastating . ”
The government ’s policy towards the financial crisis amounts to “ socialism for the big banks , ” US House Rep. Marcy Kaptur ( D - OH ) told Moyers and Johnson .
“ They ’ve basically taken their mistakes and they ’ve put it on the taxpayer … that ’s socialism , that ’s not capitalism . ”
Kaptur has become something of a crusader for homeowners ’ rights in the wake of the housing crisis , as well as a major critic of US banks .
Moyers played a clip of her giving a speech this past January in which she urged homeowners to ignore eviction notices and become “ squatters in [ their ] own homes ” if they need to .

So why should any American citizen be kicked out of their homes in this cold weather ? …
Do n’t leave your home .
Because you know what ?
When those companies say they have your mortgage , unless you have a lawyer that can put his or her finger on that mortgage , you do n’t have that mortgage , and you are going to find they ca n’t find the paper up there on Wall Street .
So I say to the American people , you be squatters in your own homes .
Do n’t you leave .
In Ohio and Michigan and Indiana and Illinois and all these other places our people are being treated like chattel , and this Congress is stymied .
Kaptur recounted an anecdote about inviting representatives of investment bank JPMorganChase , the largest forecloser of homes in Kaptur ’s Ohio district , to a meeting , and then waiting around all day as no one from JPMorganChase showed up — until nearly the end of the day .
“ That ’s how they treat our people , ” Kaptur said .

Asked what she thought of the Obama administration ’s decisions to have in place many of the figures associated with the financial collapse — such as former Federal Reserve Bank of New York head Timothy Geithner , who is now treasury secretary , and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , a Bush administration appointee — Kaptur said : “ I do n’t think any individuals who had their hands in creating this mess should be in charge of cleaning it up .
I honestly do n’t think they ’re capable of it . ”
In May , Johnson penned an article for The Atlantic in which he compared the US ’s financial system to that of a corrupt third - world country , and said that , if the IMF had given the US the same advice it gives developing countries , it would have told Washington to break up the banks .
ADVERTISEMENT
Johnson described a “ deep and disturbing ” similarity between the US financial crisis and similar crises to have hit developing countries in earlier times :
Elite business interests — financiers , in the case of the U.S. — played a central role in creating the crisis , making ever - larger gambles , with the implicit backing of the government , until the inevitable collapse .
More alarming , they are now using their influence to prevent precisely the sorts of reforms that are needed , and fast , to pull the economy out of its nosedive .
The government seems helpless , or unwilling , to act against them .
Rep .
Kaptur said the only way to reform the political system is to “ take the money out ” of it .
“ We have to get rid of the constant fundraising that happens inside the Congress , ” she said .

Health news :
A new method to cure snoring and how eating dates may prevent heart attacks
Health stories from around the world this week include a new method to stopping snoring , how eating dates may prevent heart attacks and using insulin spray to beat depression .
£ 3 jab in your mouth can stop snoring
A simple £ 3 injection in the mouth could significantly reduce snoring .
The jab works by stiffening the floppy tissue at the back of the mouth , which stops it vibrating and causing the snoring sound .
An estimated 15 million people in Britain snore .
The problem is often caused by breathing through the mouth .
As air is breathed in , the pressure causes the tissue at the back of the mouth ( part of the soft palate ) to vibrate .
Being overweight or obese makes the problem worse , as the extra fat around the neck means the airway is compressed more than normal when you lie down .
Rest easy : A new pain free treatment for snorers is available in Britain
Over a prolonged period , snoring can lead to health problems .
Regularly taking in less oxygen increases the risk of high blood pressure , stroke , diabetes and heart conditions .
Snorers often use over - the - counter devices , from plastic clips to stick - on nasal strips , to open up the airways .
But these can fail because they can't reach the lower part of the soft palate - the uvula or the small piece of flesh you can see hanging down at the back of the throat - which vibrates and causes the noise .
Doctors can use a laser or scalpel to trim the uvula so it does n't vibrate , but recovery is extremely painful and can take weeks .
It makes eating and drinking difficult for some time afterwards .
The operation costs around £ 2,000 privately and does n't always work .
Now a new pain - free treatment - pioneered in the U.S. six years ago - is available in Britain .
It involves injecting the soft palate with chemicals to ' burn ' the tissue .
As it heals , it forms scar tissue that can't vibrate .
The technique was discovered while diagnosing patients before surgery .
Patients would have the chemicals injected into their soft palate to confirm this as the source of snoring before undergoing more invasive surgery to treat the problem .
Surgeons found that in many cases the liquid created sufficient scar tissue to reduce snoring significantly without the need for surgery .
Now doctors at Southport and Ormskirk District Hospitals are using the liquid , a hardening agent called Fibro - vein , to treat snorers .
The two - minute procedure - known as snoreplasty - is done under local anaesthetic .
Patients can go home immediately and eat and drink half an hour later .
In an initial trial of 60 patients given a single dose injection , 40 showed significant improvement .
For many , the snoring disappeared completely .
An esimated 15 million people in Britain snore
In half the patients , the effects lasted a full year until the scar tissue healed .
Those who need more frequent treatment can have up to three injections a year .
' The operation is cheap and effective , so could save the NHS large sums of money , ' says Hadi Al - Jassim , the consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon using the treatment .
' It could help elderly people who are not fit enough for surgery , and younger people who simply can't afford to take weeks off work .
' But patients need to be selected carefully , because there are many causes of snoring and this would n't work for everyone , such as people with sleep apnoea ( where the upper airway becomes totally blocked ) . '
• A new bedside lamp is said to help wake sleepers at the best time to prevent grogginess .
The Zeo lamp is wired up to a headband worn during sleep .
This contains sensors that the developers claim can measure brain activity .
It is known that waking up in the middle of a deep sleep cycle can leave you feeling groggy .
This device apparently detects when you move from deep to light sleep , a natural waking point , and then triggers an alarm to wake you up .

Could eating dates prevent heart attacks ?
Eating dates every day could cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes dramatically .
Though in Britain we tend to eat dates only at Christmas , research suggests eating them regularly could produce significant health benefits .
This was the finding from a small study in Israel .
A group of ten healthy adults were given a couple of handfuls of dates a day for a month .
At the end of the study , blood tests showed the volunteers had a 15 per cent drop in fats called triglycerides , implicated in heart disease and strokes .
The scientists also found that dates reduced oxidation .
This is a damaging process that increases the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the artery walls .
A spray of insulin up the nose may beat depression
An insulin spray squirted up the nose is being tested as a treatment for depression .
In a clinical trial , patients with severe depression will undergo the therapy for eight weeks .
Researchers believe the hormone - which usually works to manage blood sugar levels - can also affect mood and memory .
Some of the effects may kick in just an hour after treatment .
The Toronto University trial comes in the wake of previous research showing insulin's benefits .
One study at the University of Lubeck in Germany found that nasal insulin taken for two months increased feelings of well - being .
It also reduced feelings of anger , and improved word recall and memory .
This may be because insulin boosts levels of fatty acids in the blood .
These are important for the production of the brain chemical serotonin - too little can cause depression .
Dr Danielsson disagrees , arguing that the financial system is still cripple by bad banks and a lack of trust in the authorities .
" Things have not been able to progress and are getting worse , " he says .
" The government needs to act to try to find anyone who is guilty and punish those people .
That is important for the country to heal . "

'' Do n't take my photo .
If you take my photo I will put you on your arse so fast it will not be funny , '' the junior officer had said .
The other told Ms Turner : '' You 're obviously a bloke . ''
Ms Turner was asked for identification and when she refused , was told to get off the train at the next station or be '' dragged off ' ' .
The senior constable told her she was being arrested for taking a photograph of an officer in the execution of her duty .
Ms Turner denied taking a photograph and pointed out it was not an offence to do so .
As was her legal right , she again declined to provide identification .
She was then detained for 30 minutes in front of a crowd of onlookers at Kogarah station .
Ms Turner successfully sued the state of NSW for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment in the District Court , telling the Herald : '' How could I have backed down when I tell my own clients , ' That is thuggery , that is unlawful behaviour and you can't let them get away with it ' ? ''
The state had admitted liability for the incident , but did not accept it should pay aggravated or exemplary damages .
Awarding Ms Turner $ 20,000 in aggravated and exemplary damages , Judge Anthony Garling found she had displayed no signs of aggression during her arrest and there was no suggestion that the officers had needed to use force .
Yet three police officers were called in as back - up before she was escorted off the platform .
Another five - including two detectives - also arrived on the scene .
Despite several phone calls to their superiors , none of them knew which offence , if any , Ms Turner had committed .
'' It was an unjust arrest , it was a wrong arrest , '' Judge Garling said .
Without explanation , Ms Turner was freed without charge .
But what happened next was even more serious , with Ms Turner falsely accused of a ' ' terrorist act ' ' , Judge Garling found .
Police had decided not to pursue the matter or formally record the incident in the police COPS system .
But later the same day Ms Turner called the police station to complain about her treatment .
'' The police officer then decided to lessen whatever complaint could be made against her by falsifying a public record , that is , by alleging that the plaintiff committed an offence which is related to railway property , not to photographing the police officer , '' Judge Garling said .
The senior constable had written in the falsified COPS entry : '' It should be noted that at the time of dealing with the person of interest police were unaware of the exact offence .
It is an offence to take photos on railway property under the new terrorism laws . ''
The judge said : '' This lady was sitting on a train going for a bushwalk when the police mistakenly did what they did .
In no way could [ it ] be suggested that it related to terrorism . ''
He criticised the police force for not removing or amending the falsified COPS entry or apologising to Ms Turner .
In a statement NSW Police said it would treat the judge 's comments seriously .
'' The matter will be investigated and any issues identified as a result of that investigation will be addressed . ''
High - definition television images are luring more American eyeballs to professional hockey and invigorating the NHL's prospects in the U.S. , say leading sports industry experts .
" HDTV will have a greater impact on hockey than any other sport , " says Matthew Pace , a lawyer with prominent sports law firm Herrick , Feinstein in New York .
" You can follow the puck much easier ( on HDTV broadcasts ) .
The action is clearer .
I think the television future of the NHL is bright . "
The holy grail of professional sports – routine access to 115 million American television households – has long eluded the NHL despite efforts dating back to the infamous glowing puck of the 1990s .
While the NHL has built a national U.S. footprint that includes hockey - tepid cities across the sunbelt , major U.S. broadcast deals still have n't come .
And without the billions of dollars in revenues that come with a major TV deal , the league is left to contend with financial basket cases in cities such as Phoenix , Florida and Nashville , which have no cultural connection to hockey .
Many Americans complain the game does n't translate well onto a television screen where the untrained hockey eye , unaccustomed to the flow of the world 's fastest game , struggles to follow the puck .
Currently , the league 's primary U.S. television deal is with cable firm Versus ( reaching just over 70 million U.S. households ) along with the occasional game on NBC .
But a more ambitious role for hockey in the U.S. is unfolding , says Neal Pilson , former president of CBS Sports and founder of his own television consulting firm .
" Because hockey is probably the most difficult of the major sports to follow on television , HDTV has helped hockey more than the other sports .
" Much is riding on that technology - mediated assistance .
Professional hockey 's long - term growth ultimately lies south of the border , Pilson says .
" I have great respect for cities like Hamilton and the idea of a second club in Toronto .
But if hockey retreats back to Canada , that would begin to diminish the game here in the United States and the future of hockey is with the 300 million who live here , not the 30 million who live in Canada . "
Hockey ratings in the U.S. are actually better than many Canadians might think .
Yesterday , the league announced buoyant new regional TV numbers across the U.S. , including ratings above or level with last season for 19 of the 24 U.S. NHL teams and triple - digit growth for the Anaheim Ducks , Florida Panthers and New Jersey Devils in the first two weeks of the season .
Versus , now in its fifth year broadcasting the NHL nationally , reported a 21 per cent viewership growth for the 2008 - 09 regular season compared to the year before , reaching 32.9 million total viewers .
The networks ' hockey viewership this season is up another 16 per cent from the same point last season .
" We see that as HD gets more prevalent and more people get it hooked up ... our growth in hockey has been amazing , " says Marc Fein , executive vice - president of programming with Versus .
" We 're seeing very nice ratings from all the hardcore hockey markets but we would n't be seeing the growth we 're seeing if we did n't have the other markets coming along as well . "
All Versus games are available in high definition .
And a dramatically growing number of Americans are able to take advantage of that crystal - clear image .
HDTV penetration in the U.S. has gone from 34 per cent of households last year to " slightly under half " today , says Bruce Leichtman , president of television research firm Leichtman Research Group .

While hockey 's current viewership does n't warrant national TV deals with the likes of baseball or basketball , continued growth could put the league in a stronger bargaining position when agreements come up for renewal , experts say .
" The key in generating significant revenue growth is n't just ratings , it 's competition , " says Pilson .
" If there 's only one guy bidding , the value of the painting is determined by the one person willing to buy . "
The best prospect for the NHL , say experts , would be interest from ESPN as a competitor to Versus or even adding ESPN to the stable , experts say .
The Fox Network 's now infamous FoxTrax ( also referred as the glow puck ) , the last major technological attempt at making the game more accessible to Americans , streaked across U.S. TV screens between 1996 and 1998 .
Steve Solomon , who was the NHL's chief operating officer then and now a leading U.S. television consultant , was instrumental in bringing the idea to the screen at a time when the league saw some of its best ever U.S. TV ratings .
He says hockey played in crisp HDTV detail on a wide - angle screen will have a meaningful impact on the game 's place in the U.S .
" The brilliance of the picture makes it more authentic and no sport competes with the in - arena experience of hockey . "
The fragmentation of the television market in North America has also opened new opportunities for the league , Solomon says .
No longer do a handful of national networks hold all of the cards in the age of personal electronic devices like mobile phones and digital devices capturing more and more market share .
" As a content owner and provider , the NHL is in a very good position . "

Using compression in your mixes is essential – and you need to use it right .
OK maybe not if you play classical harp or Polynesian nose - flute – but in most genres , using compression to control the dynamic range of instruments in the mix is fundamental .
The problem is , learning to use compression is n’t easy .
And it ’s not helped by the fact that most explanations start out saying something like “ a compressor reduces the dynamic range of it ’s input by attenuating signals that exceed a pre-defined threshold ” .
Or something .
Personally I do n’t find this kind of description very intuitive , so this post will try and keep things straightforward .
So before we go to much further :
What is compression , and why use it ?
Here is the explanation I was given as a trainee :
Compression is used to make things louder
Meaning , you can use it to lift levels in the mix without overwhelming everything else .
Most sounds are very “ peaky ” to begin with , with lots of contrast between the loudest and the softest notes .
Compressors automatically turn down the loudest parts of a sound , and as a result make the average level more consistent .
So , you can turn the overall level up in the mix without distorting or “ sticking out ” .
There can be all kinds of positive side - effects of this process , like making things sound fuller , richer , more controlled or punchier , but at the end of the day it ’s all about loudness .
Not excessive loudness , but something musically beneficial .
Using a compressor – an introduction
Here ’s a fantastic video introduction to compression by Joe Gilder from the excellent Home Studio Corner blog .
Check it out , and then I ’ll expand on some of the points he makes , and offer some suggestions for achieving specific effects using compression .
Exploring compressor controls
Joe ’s video is great , but there ’s no substitute for trying this stuff yourself .
Try overdoing everything to begin with , so you get a feeling of what the different parameters do .
Toggle bypass on and off to clearly hear the effect , but make sure you adjust the make - up gain so the levels before and after are similar for a fair comparison .
Here are some pointers to get you started .
Ratio & Threshold
High ratios ( 4:1 ) with high thresholds give a “ hard hitting ” sound for punch and thump .
Watch out for pumping and sucking , or even distortion
Lower ratios ( 2:1 ) with lower thresholds give softer “ warming ” or “ thickening ” effects
A low threshold with a high ratio will give lots of hard compression and probably sound very squashed and lifeless
Attack & Release Time
As a rule , avoid very short ( low ) attack and release times , as Joe says .
Fast attack times can be useful , for softening very spiky sounds ( eg. slapped bass ) but can remove life and impact if overdone , especially with a high ratio
Long attack times with high ratio and moderate release give the classic “ thump - suck - relax ” pumping sound
Automatic or “ intelligent ” settings reduce “ unnatural ” effects like this , but increase the risk of using too much compression without realising it .
The Golden Rule ( of thumb )
If the gain reduction meter does n’t return to zero several times a bar , you ’re almost certainly using too much compression
– because this means that the signal is being compressed all the time , and may sound squashed or flattened as a result .
Try a higher threshold , and then higher ratio if it ’s not doing enough .
Use your ears
Do n’t be tempted to compress everything , or to over - compress .
You might like to try using my Dynameter plugin as an aid to judging how much compression to use , but always listen to the sound before and after compression , and ask yourself these questions :
Which do I prefer ?
Have I achieved what I wanted ?
( ie. made it punchier , fuller , with more impact & excitement )
Does the compressed version still sound lively and exciting , or is it too squashed ?
Does it sound closer to similar tracks I ’m trying to emulate ?
Can I hear more of the quiet details in the mix , or is it getting “ mushy ” and confused ?
Does it still sound natural ?
Advanced compression techniques
This post is to help get people started – it does n’t cover “ creative compression ” , meaning breaking these rules - of - thumb to achieve a specific sound .
In particular , “ classic ” or analogue compressors are often driven hard for a distorted sound , or to exploit unusual settings , like the 1176 ’s famous “ all - button ” option .
To learn more about this , check out this post :
When over - compression sounds great

Compression in mastering is different .
The goals are different , and so are the strategies and techniques .

The government - administered insurance fund that protects depositors fell into the red for the first time since the fallout from the savings - and - loan crisis of the early 1990s as the pace of bank failures accelerated .
The fund had a negative balance of $ 8.2 billion at the end of the third quarter , federal regulators said Tuesday .
Bank customers , however , should remain confident that their deposits would be protected since most of the amount reflects money that Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation has already set aside to cover the losses from future bank failures .
Officials of the F.D.I.C. said in October that the deposit insurance fund had been depleted , but the third - quarter report card on the banking industry issued on Tuesday was the first time that hard numbers had been released .
Even amid early signs that the economy is recovering , the report suggested that the country ’s 8,100 lenders remain in fragile condition .
In its state of the industry report , the F.D.I.C. reported that banks posted a $ 2.8 billion gain in the third quarter , after a $ 4.3 billion loss in the previous period .
Meanwhile , the number of “ problem banks ” that run the biggest risk of collapse increased to 552 , from 416 in the second quarter .
The number of bad loans of nearly every stripe  credit cards , mortgages , small business and commercial real estate  continue to grow , albeit at a slower pace .

UPDATE 22 OCT 5 pm – Police released more details of their investigation into the Oct 18 slaying of 27 - year - old gay man Chris Skinner .
Skinner was walking home on Adelaide St from a birthday party for his sister in the Entertainment district when he was “ assaulted by between two and four males , ” det Stacey Gallant , the lead investigator on the case said in an Oct 22 press conference .
“ He was beaten to the ground and kicked when he was on the ground , ” before the attackers returned to their black SUV .
Once in the car , they “ ran over Mr Skinner with both the front and rear tires .
They accelerated the car away from the scene and continued to go east on Adelaide St . ”
Several eyewitnesses have come forward to police and provided detailed accounts of the incident .
Police believe the driver deliberately ran over Skinner .
The driver of the SUV is described as “ male with light skin , short hair in a military style , wearing a tight black tank top , similar to an undershirt . ”
The make , model , and licence number of the SUV are still unknown , but it is described as black with a light coloured tan or grey interior and having high - intensity headlights .
Video of the SUV approaching the crime scene was shown at the press conference .
Police continue to search through security videos culled from their own CCTV cameras in the Entertainment District and from other businesses along Adelaide as far east as the DVP .
They say they captured images of both Skinner and the SUV minutes before the attack began .
Gallant also told reporters that police are not treating the murder as a hate crime .
“ We have explored that possibility and we do n’t have any evidence to corroborate that , ” he says .
“ As the investigation goes forward , if that comes up again we will investigate that , ” suggesting that the fight could also have started as a traffic dispute .
“ There was a lot of construction on Adelaide .
[ Skinner ] may have been walking in the roadway and bumped into the car and they may have taken offence to that , ” Gallant said .
Gallant appealed to any other witnesses to come forward , noting that video evidence suggests that a number of taxi drivers may have seen the attack against Skinner as they drove past .
He also appealed to anyone involved in the crime to turn themselves in to police .
“ We know there were at least one , two , or three people in the car with him .
If it was [ the driver ’s ] decision alone to run over Skinner , then it ’s all going to fall on him .
If the others in the car had some influence over that , then they are just as culpable as he is .
They are all culpable for the assault that happened outside of the vehicle , ” Gallant said .
Skinner ’s funeral was today at a private ceremony in Uxbridge , his hometown .
Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Stacy Gallant at 416−808−7410 and Detective Doug Dunstan at 416−808−7406 , or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416−222−8477 or online at www.222tips.com.

UPDATE 20 OCT 8 am – Ryan Cooke did n’t know that his fiancé had been brutally murdered seven hours earlier when he posted on his Facebook page : “ HEY … does anyone know where Chris is ? ” at 10:04 am on Sun Oct 18 .
Cooke had lost his phone and no one could reach him .
Police had been called to the corner of Adelaide St E and Victoria St at 3:05 am by several eyewitnesses who had seen Cooke ’s fiancé Chris Skinner attacked by a group of men who beat him to the ground then ran over him with an SUV .
Skinner was taken to hospital where he died of his injuries .
Skinner is the 43rd homicide of 2009 in the city of Toronto .
Hours earlier , Skinner and Cooke had been celebrating Skinner ’s sister ’s birthday in the entertainment district .
Skinner decided to leave the party and walk home alone .
Details of the attack are being kept under wraps as the police investigation continues , but it is known that Skinner got into an altercation with the occupants of a black SUV before he was beaten , and that after running him over the attackers fled east on Adelaide in their SUV .
The number of attackers has not been confirmed , but it is believed there were at least two and possibly three or four .
The make and model of the SUV and its licence plate number were not yet known , but police will be combing over surveillance video from the area to see if it can be determined .
Friends of Skinner suspect that the killing may have been a hate crime , but police have n’t drawn that conclusion .
“ No , there ’s not at all any indication that there were homophobic elements to the attack , ” says Det Stacey Gallant .
But that does n’t sit well with Skinner ’s friends who are struggling to find a motive for the murder .
“ Not a single person who knows him would say that he would cause a ruckus , ” says Skinner ’s long - time friend Craig Lund , “ but he would stand up for himself if he was called on anything .
I find that Toronto Police very rarely jump to the conclusion that homophobia exists . ”
Skinner , 27 , lived with Cooke and they planned to get married next summer .
He worked as a graphic designer at Endeavour Marketing .
Cooke could not be reached for comment at press time .
Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Stacy Gallant at 416−808−7410 and Detective Doug Dunstan at 416−808−7406 , or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416−222−8477 or online at www.222tips.com.

Blogging on App Engine , part 10 : Recap
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under coding , app - engine , tech , bloggart
This is part of a series of articles on writing a blogging system on App Engine .
An overview of what we 're building is here .
Over the last 9 posts , we 've covered building a fully functional blogging system for App Engine from scratch , and I 've even migrated this blog to it .
In the process , we 've covered many important components of App Engine , including the new deferred library ( and through it , Task Queues ) , important design principles , such as pre-generation of content , and interesting technologies such as PubSubHubbub , CSEs , Disqus , and sitemaps .
There 's also been significant community involvement , for which I am very grateful .
Amongst the contributors were :
Moraes , who ported bloggart to werkzeug , calling it bloggartzeug
Sylvain , who ported bloggart to tornado , calling it bloggartornado
andialbrecht , who contributed - and continues to contribute - enhancements and bugfixes for bloggart
Everyone who contributed a name suggestion on the first post , and everyone who has provided feedback during the series
Everyone who filed bug reports and feature requests in the issue tracker
To give some sort of objective assessment of how well Bloggart measures up , we need to compare it to our original goals , outlined in the very first post :
Simple authoring .
Achieved .
With andialbrecht 's recent contribution of support for several additional markup languages , including plain text , ReStructuredText , Markdown and Textile , users can now write in whatever format they prefer .
Good isolation of code and markup .
Mostly achieved Sylvain has pointed out that to some degree the use of Djangoforms runs counter to this , so it can still use a little work .
RSS and Atom support .
This should go without saying , these days .
Achieved .
We only implemented Atom support , but since everything supports both , these days , I still count this as a success .
PubSubHubbub support .
Achieved .
Sitemap support .
Achieved .
Tagging , and filtering based on tag .
Achieved .
This could still use some enhancement , though .
Easily support new output formats .
Achieved with the use of our generator pattern .
Extensible .
Achieved , as evidenced by the volume of contributions from readers !
Easy import of posts from other blogging systems .
Achieved , though we could have spent more time on it .
Multiple author support .
Not achieved - but definitely on the todo list !
Scheduled posts .
Not achieved , though basic support for draft posts is available .
Also on the todo list .
Fast .
Really , really fast .
Achieved !
With typical rendering times sub 50 milliseconds in production , and cold - starts typically below 500 ms , we knocked this one out of the park .
This could be improved still further with a little care as to what the static module imports .
Where to from here , you may ask ?
At this point , I believe I 've extracted most of the explanatory value from the series .
There are still features to be implemented , but many of them make for dull writing and boring reading .
Scheduled posts and multiple author support may warrant an article of their own in the future , but for now we 're going to take a break from blogging about Bloggart .
This is n't it for Bloggart itself , though .
There 's nearly 20 issues open in the issue tracker , and since they 're mostly feature requests , I consider that a victory .
Development - both by myself and by other contributors - will doubtlessly continue , and in the near future I hope we can present the App Engine community with a 1.0 release , ready for deployment by people who do n't care to hack on it to get it working !
In the meantime , contributions - feature suggestions , bug reports , and actual code - are more than welcome from all of you .
Let me know what you think , and how things could be improved , in the comments , and keep filling out bug reports and sending in patches !
Once again , I 'd like to express my gratitude to everyone who 's contributed to this series , in ways large and small , and to everyone who 's read and commented on it .
In the next post we 'll tackle ... well , you 'll have to wait and see .
Edit :
To my shame , I mis-measured the rendering and startup times of Bloggart .
I 've updated the timings in the list above .
The new ones are n't _quite_ as impressive , but they 're still good .
Disqus
As promised , this is one in a series of posts I ’ll write about online interventions that help treat specific mental health concerns .
In this post , I ’ll talk about some of the depression programs available online .
The Australian National University ’s Centre for Mental Health Research is one of the unsung heroes in the development and research of programs to treat depression online , for both adults and teens .
What they have done over the past decade is not exactly rocket science , and yet , surprisingly , most people have never heard of one of their free online programs .
They ’ve taken cognitive behavioral theories and techniques and translated them into online tutorials and programs .
Then they did something a lot of organizations ( and virtually all companies ) fail to do — they did solid , randomized controlled trials to show their designed interventions work .
Their simplest intervention is an educational website about depression called BluePages .
Yes , it offers the usual array of information about depression symptoms and treatments , but they ’ve gone a step further and provided an evaluation of what treatments work for depression by evaluating the clinical research .
Most interesting is that the BluePages website itself has clinical evidence backing its usefulness .
A more involved intervention offered by the same researchers from the CMHR is the MoodGYM training program .
This is a web - based , self - guided program based upon cognitive - behavioral and interpersonal therapy techniques that is intended to help people with depression .
MoodGYM is comprised of 6 modules .
We ’ve mentioned MoodGYM previously in relationship to another online depression program and reported on the previous research about MoodGYM .
MoodGYM has eight published research citations ( some of which are noted in the references to this entry ) , and a few of them are randomized controlled trials .
MoodGYM is not for the faint of heart , however .
In many ways , it is just as in - depth as a face - to - face clinical intervention and therefore takes nearly as much time and effort .
And that ’s one of its drawbacks — few people stick with the program to fully benefit from its positive effects .
Despite this challenge , over 34,000 people visit MoodGYM every month and they have over 200,000 registered users .
MoodGYM is reaching a lot of depressed people who want help for their depression , but ca n’t ( or wo n’t ) see a professional for it .
Another self - help program presented at the e-Mental Health Summit 2009 was Beating the Blues , a UK - based program composed of 8 , 50 - minute weekly sessions conducted on a computer or online .
This program is available for free to most people living in the UK ; it ’s meant to be “ prescribed ” by a general practitioner .
In the early research data presented at the conference , for those who completed the program , researchers saw a decrease of approximately 50 percent in patients ’ outcome measure scores — they got significantly , clinically better after completing the program .
The Beating the Blues program suffered from the same problem that seems to plague all self - help programs — poor followup and completion by participants .
Out of the people referred to the program in the research discussed by Kate Cavanagh of Newcastle University , only about 37 percent actually completed it .
This leaves a lot of room for improvement for non-completers .
As Helen Christensen , the Director of the Australian National University ’s Centre for Mental Health Research noted in her presentation to the conference , web - based interventions are attractive for many reasons .
Their costs actually decline the more we can get people to use them , which is one of the few treatment interventions that can be said for .
They are easy to make available and administer to the entire population , and they do n’t require a professional ’s oversight in a one - on - one environment .
She also mentioned a few ways of combating the drop - out problem in these programs .
One is to start designing online interventions that are tailored for the individual .
For instance , a teen might see a more entertainment - oriented , video - based program while an older adult might be more comfortable with text - based images and information .
Voluntary reminders administered via your mobile phone , Twitter , Facebook or email might also be helpful .
Incentives for completing major steps in the program — for instance , each module in the MoodGYM — might also help drive a person to finish the intervention .
I ’ve touched upon only a few of the online depression interventions now available presented at the conference ( another self - help program for the Netherlands was called Colour Your Life ) .
The key point is that there are many of these kinds of online interventions available that directly treat mild to moderate depression — the most common form of depression that affects the greatest amount of people .
If you ’re suffering from depression , I encourage you to try out one of these free online depression programs .
Help may be , literally , just a click away .

Getting Help for Depression Online
( Reuters ) - Gold rose to a fresh record high $ 1,104.80 per ounce on Monday , with investors scurrying for a safe haven after a softening U.S. dollar and bleak jobs data underlined the shaky pace of economic recovery .
Here are key dates tracing gold ’s trading history since the 1970s , and it ’s historic post - September 2009 rise :
* August 1971 - United States President Richard Nixon takes the dollar off the ‘ gold standard ’ , which fixed paper notes ’ value to a pre-set quantity of gold .
It had been in place , with minor modifications , since the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 fixed the conversion rate for one troy ounce of gold at $ 35 .
* August 1972 - U.S. devalues dollar to $ 38 per ounce of gold .

High inflation because of strong oil prices , Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the impact of the Iranian revolution , prompts investors to move into the metal .
* August 1999 - Gold falls to a low at $ 251.70 on worries about central banks reducing reserves of gold bullion and mining companies selling gold in forward markets to protect against falling prices .

Thomas Vermaelen
By James Lawton , Chief Sports Writer
Emmanuel Adebayor 's impact at Manchester City has probably caught most attention – for both solid and spectacular reasons .
However , the irony is that the seller Arsène Wenger can make an unimpeachable case for his own move into the market .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Thomas Vermaelen , Arsenal 's £ 10 m signing from Ajax , made a largely unheralded arrival .
Indeed , the word from the Netherlands was that he was an unlikely candidate to fill the hole left by Kolo Touré 's move to Eastlands with Adebayor .
Wenger , it was suggested , had made a flimsy move to stiffen an area of obvious weakness in the centre of defence .
Vermaelen was more a utility defender than a rock in the middle of the backline .
The Belgian was n't big , was n't a guy who could take hold of a critical situation .
A useful player , perhaps , but not some instant cure for the defensive frailty that has bedevilled Arsenal in recent years – and betrayed some of the best pure football being played across Europe .
It was then a case of cue one of the most impressive ever arrivals in the Premier League .
Vermaelen was masterful in Arsenal 's superb start to the season at Everton .
He scored the second of his team 's six goals in a plundering raid into the box to get on to the end of a trademarked Robin van Persie free - kick .
In defence , he did n't put a foot wrong .
Against Celtic 's mostly ineffectual forwards he was similarly confident , snuffing out rare points of danger with fine anticipation , most notably a potentially significant threat from Scott Brown .
The acid test came at Old Trafford at the weekend when he was again quite outstanding .
Arsenal lost but no responsibility rested with Vermaelen , United coming to life because of critical mistakes by goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and midfielder Abou Diaby .
Vermaelen was impeccable , quick to read the opposition , quick to make sure - footed tackles .
Wenger says that , despite his faith in Vermaelen , he has been a little surprised by the speed of his smooth grasp of the requirements of the Premier League .
" Normally it takes a little time for a player from abroad to settle down here but remarkably this has not been the case with Vermaelen . "
Indeed not , in just a handful of games – literally five , three Premier League and two Champions League – he has imparted a stunning sense of a man utterly at ease with his challenge .
That it is one of the key ones of the new season only underlines the extent of his achievement .
Peter Crouch
By Sam Wallace , Football Correspondent
Peter Crouch has always scored goals at each of his seven clubs .
That 's a lot of clubs but then , wherever Crouch has been , so misfortune has followed him in the shape of managerial sackings , financial crises or – in the case of Liverpool – the best centre - forward in the world arriving to take his place in the team .
But the big man always bounces back .
He moved for £ 9 m to Tottenham this summer and demonstrated against Birmingham City on Saturday that he can rough up a defence with the best of them .
Yet despite his height he is primarily a goalscorer , just one who happens to be in a targetman 's body .
After QPR , Portsmouth , Aston Villa , Norwich ( loan ) , Southampton , Liverpool and Portsmouth ( again ) , it would seem that Crouch has at last found a club on an even keel where he can play out his career .
Graham Taylor , who signed him at Villa , always said that Crouch 's best years would be in his late twenties and early thirties and now , at 28 , is the time that he should flourish .
The best of the rest ?
With Thomas Vermaelen , Arsène Wenger seems to have struck gold .
At £ 10 m from Ajax he looks great value : a tough centre - half who also scores goals .
He is uncompromising , aggressive and about £ 14 m cheaper than Joleon Lescott .
What 's not to like ?
There are a few honourable mentions .
Tuncay Sanli's transfer to Stoke ( £ 5.5 m from Middlesbrough ) means this accomplished footballer stays in the Premier League although it is hard to see how his style of play complements that of his new club .
There has always been a lot of interest in 18 - year - old Irish prodigy James McCarthy , who cost Wigan £ 2 m from Hamilton Academical .
He was the young player of the year in Scotland last season so it will be revealing to learn whether the likes of Manchester United made a mistake in not buying him .
The winger Lee Martin was not quite good enough for Manchester United but this exciting player obviously made an impression on Roy Keane when he was there .
The Ipswich manager bought him for £ 1.6 m .
Paul Gallagher cost Leicester £ 1 m from Blackburn – he is a classy striker who could easily make the step up again to the Premier League .
Gareth Barry
By Glenn Moore , Football Editor
Not as high - profile as many of City 's signings , despite the controversy surrounding his move from Villa Park , but the £ 12 m midfielder is arguably the most effective of Mark Hughes ' many signings .
The manager has already privately confided that Barry is " an even better player than I thought " and , having watched him operate from close quarters at Selhurst Park last week , it is easy to see why .
Barry is the understated hub of City 's Harlem Globetrotters team , the man who knits it all together .
He links defence and attack , left flank and right , and enables the many offensive players to push forward with freedom .
He is also capable of producing goals of his own , some through his set pieces .
Barry has been earmarked as a player to watch since his teenage years , when Villa ruffled feathers themselves in poaching him from Brighton .
His development has taken time , in part through losing his way a little .
There is also a lack of pace that particularly put off Sven Goran Eriksson , and he played in too many positions .
All these experiences have , though , now combined to his benefit and he is peaking at the right time , for his own World Cup ambitions , and the Manchester City " project " .
A final reference : Rafael Benitez , as he tries to repair the damage wreaked by Xabi Alonso 's departure , can only look eastwards to Eastlands with envy .
Michael Owen
By Ian Herbert , Deputy Football Correspondent
The lightning move by Sir Alex Ferguson for Owen was done and dusted inside three days and caught the football world more by surprise than any other transaction this summer .
But the deal – which began with a telephone call from Ferguson on an afternoon in early July and saw him on United 's books by the Friday – looks like a priceless piece of business on the basis that there was no price , save for Owen 's salary , and that the striker is a good bet to deliver .
The view inside the game is that Owen will start no more than 20 games but the more significant statistic is how many times he will net as an impact player .
The detractors – and they are curiously abundant , looking for a player who dares continually to express confidence in himself to demonstrate the perils of pride before a fall – point to his fluffed chance against Birmingham City on the opening Sunday .
But the quite exquisite finish against Wigan Athletic six days later – Owen displaying that propensity for finding space that he has and angling his shot in off the post – revealed qualities that were not there in Old Trafford 's departed Carlos Tevez .
Owen might not have the pace which allowed him to see off all of those Ian Rush goalscoring records in Deeside football well over a decade back but the understanding he evidently has with Wayne Rooney is already in evidence .
Dimitar Berbatov , on whose shoulders so much rests , would not have hared after the through - ball from Rooney which Owen reached and wasted against Birmingham City .
The odds about him scoring 20 times this season were 18 - 1 , a worthwhile flutter .
Owen 's lack of conviction before goal in significant games to date might suggest fluttering nerves where those of steel once were , but the 29 - year - old has an incentive to overcome any .
Suggestions by managers and chairmen in the game that he lacks the appetite have hurt him more than he admits .
The England flight to South Africa is not beyond his reach and to be aboard it and to disprove the doubters offers far more incentive than the bonuses for playing and scoring which Owen has signed up to , having taken a huge pay cut from his £ 110,000 - a- week salary at Newcastle .
The re-emergence , in a World Cup season , of the man who chose France , three tournaments ago , to signal his arrival , just might be one of the stories of the campaign .
Emmanuel Adebayor
By James Corrigan , Football Writer
No doubt Arsenal supporters would roll their eyes and advise their friends up north to judge him in March not September and to check how high his head remains when their form enters one of those inevitable dips .
But on the evidence of these opening weeks Emmanuel Adebayor does look to be the canniest piece of summer business on behalf of that Imelda Marcos of the Premier League , Manchester City .
Even at £ 25 m .
Mark Hughes , in particular , would agree .
In terms of the Welshman 's continuing employment , much was made of the necessity for City to hit the ground running this season ; and with three wins from three league games they have given Sparky his flyer .
Yet take out Adebayor 's third - minute strike in the season opener at Blackburn , then his low drive against Wolves two weeks ago – for the 1 - 0 win – and then his bullet header against Portsmouth on Sunday – for the 1 - 0 win – and the table would not make such pleasing reading .
True , City were deserving victors on all three occasions , and another striker presented with the same chances – and yes , others too – might well have applied the necessaries equally as well .
But with Adebayor there is always far more than meets the scoreboard .
Swiftly and surely , the Togo man has alerted the Eastlands faithful to the argument that he should be the fans ' favourite and not Carlos Tevez .
No matter who he left to join them .
Surely nobody , not even the bitterest Gooner , could argue with the talents at the 25 - year - old 's disposal .
Adebayor is one of the few lanky forwards who knows how to maximise his advantage in the air – as he showed at Fratton Park – while on the ground his pace and skill levels are not at all compromised by his physique .
He is a stunningly athletic specimen who proved at the Emirates two years ago that he has the wherewithal to last a full campaign .
Back then , everyone believed his qualities included the attitude .
After last season 's personal implosion , the jury understandably remains out and will not be returning until the games stack up and his performances follow suit .
However , a change of scenery – and he as he puts it " the loves of the fans " – has clearly reinvigorated Adebayor and in these early days he has , at the very least , helped make it possible to regard that top - four placing as not such an outlandish reach .
In the sheikh 's £ 200 m revolution he may just come to represent the snip .

You can make your system unbootable if you 're not careful .
I highly recommend you read this entire document at least once , then work through it as you build your kernel .
If you have ever compiled a kernel you will be amazed at how easy it can be .
This tutorial was designed to enable you to use Debian 's kernel - package system , which simplifies building and installing custom kernels .
Learn to create Debian packages of kernels and their modules , and manage the resulting kernel images with dpkg .
I used to compile kernels manually , and it involved a series of steps to be taken in order ; kernel - package was written to take all the required steps ( it has grown beyond that now , but essentially , that is what it does ) .
This is especially important to novices : make - kpkg takes all the steps required to compile a kernel , and installation of kernels is a snap .
— Manoj Srivastava , author of kernel - package
You can use any version of the kernel sources you wish ; I chose 2.4.18 because it 's the most current in Woody .
Debian maintainers have done an excellent job packaging kernel sources into .deb files , and I recommend you use those rather than other source packages .
The only reason I can see to use other kernel source packages is to get hardware support not available in Debian .
If you 're compiling a 2.2 series kernel for the PC architecture ( machines with AMD processors are PCs , but not Macs or Alphas ) you 'll need the bin86 package .
Installing these packages will cause several other packages to be installed to satisfy dependencies .
You can install these packages by doing ( as the root user ) :
kernel - source -2.4.18
( or whatever kernel sources you will be using )
We will be working with Debian 3.0r1 ( Woody revision 1 ) ; you will need the following packages :
Replace path_to_kernel with the appropriate information , such as " /boot/ vmlinuz -2.4.18 - bf2.4 " ( if you installed Woody with the 2.4 kernel ) .
Before you make a new kernel the first thing to do is make a boot disk for the kernel you 're running .
This way , if anything gets screwed up you 'll be able to boot the machine and fix it .
Grab a floppy disk you do n't mind erasing and do this ( as the root user ) :
If you 're using sources from kernel.org or from the Debian testing or unstable branches , you may need to update some of your tools to meet the minimal requirements .
If you 're using sources from the Debian stable branch the above should have been a mere formality .
Now that you have the source tree set up you can configure the kernel .
If you can't determine program versions on your Debian system using the above methods , try using dpkg .
Instead of checking for each required program individually , you can run the script ver_linux , which is found in the scripts directory of the kernel tree .
You 'll need to make it executable first .
Note that the script may not check all the requirements listed in Changes , and that it checks for some programs not listed .
The Changes document lists a required program in the first column , the required version in the 2nd , and a command to check the version in the 3rd .
You may not need all the programs / packages listed .
( For example you do n't need pcmcia-cs if you do n't use PC cards . )
Inside the linux directory you should find another called Documentation .
Change into that directory and look for the file Changes .
Open it with your favorite text editor and look for the section " Current Minimal Requirements " .
Here 's an excerpt from mine :
It 's a good idea to double - check symbolic links , so do " ls - l " .
It should look like the example below .
Substitute the name of the directory created when you expanded your kernel source for " kernel - source -2.4.18 " .
There should not be a symlink pointing to any kernel source tree ; it 's time to create that link now .
This should create a directory called kernel - source - 2.4.18 / owned by you and the src group .
If you have gzipped kernel sources ( the filename ends in gz instead of bz2 ) use z instead of j as an option to tar .
To expand the source tarball do this as a regular user :
Debian kernel source packages expand to a directory named kernel - source - x.y.z/ .
" Official " kernel sources for kernels up to 2.4.18 expand to a directory called linux / .
( We recommend moving that directory to linux - x.y.z/ . ) " Official " sources for kernels 2.4.19 and later expand to linux - x.y.z/ .
If you have that symlink and do n't remove it before expanding your new source tarball , you may get a mess of old and new source files which wo n't compile correctly .
If you also see a symbolic link called linux remove it :
As a normal user , change to the directory /usr / src and list its contents ; you should see the bzipped tar file you installed :
You should see " src " among the groups listed .
( By default , you also belong to the one - user group " my_username " . )
To make sure you were actually added to the src group , issue this command ( once you 've done the logout / login dance ) :
If you 're at a console just log out and log back in .
If you 're using a graphical login manager like xdm , gdm , or kdm , log out of X and back in again .
If you 're at a terminal window inside X , log out of X and logout from the console .
Then log in at the console and start another X session .
Of course , substitute your own user name for " my_username " .
Your group memberships are checked during login , so you need to logout and login again to be recognized as a member of src .
Here are three ways to do so :
When a kernel source package is installed , the source tarball is placed in the /usr / src directory .
To work in this directory , you must be the either the root user or a member of the src group .
To avoid doing things as root whenever possible , add yourself to src .
Only the root user can add users to groups , so become root and do the following :
" Source tree " is just a term for the directory which contains the source code you will be compiling .
Now exit " make config " .
You do n't want to answer as many as ~1300 different questions one at a time , and there 's very little chance you 'd get a configuration you could live with anyway .
Much better is to use either xconfig or menuconfig .
Kernel 0.01 had no configuration at all , because there were no options .
Kernel 1.0 had 49 different options , so a configuration mechanism was needed .
Enter " make config " .
For this reason many of us encourage kernel newbies to use xconfig , and try menuconfig later when they 're more familiar with kernel configuration .
The options are the same as you 'd see in xconfig , with one crucial difference -- there 's no way to " grey out " an option in menuconfig .
If you do n't select " Prompt for development or incomplete code / drivers " , you wo n't even see the options for Firewire or Bluetooth .
If you start menuconfig in a longer terminal window , you 'll be able to see more categories without scrolling .
Menuconfig opens to the size of the terminal you start it from .
Perhaps you are n't using X . Perhaps you 're getting better at this configuration business , and your trusty keyboard is faster than a mouse .
( Maybe your cat is a little too efficient . )
Menuconfig may be just the tool for you .
Notice that the " IEEE 1394 ... " and " Bluetooth support " buttons are greyed out .
They are not available because they depend on another option which has not been enabled .
Click on " Code maturity level options " and change " Prompt for development and / or incomplete code / drivers " to " y " .
Now click the " Main menu " button , and notice how the IEEE and Bluetooth buttons can be selected just like the others .
Anywhere you see an option that 's greyed out , it depends on another option that has been disabled somewhere else .
There are several ways to configure the kernel .
The first one we will cover is called " xconfig " .
Once you 've changed to the /usr / src / linux directory , start it like this :
Unfortunately a detailed explanation of kernel options is well beyond the scope of this document .
To find out more about configuring the kernel , please see The Linux Documentation Project 's " Kernel - HOWTO " , the files in /usr / src/ linux / Documentation , and your hardware documentation .
Search the archives of the debian - user mailing list , and ask questions there if you do n't find answers in the archives .
Remember that " Google is your friend . "
Be sure (! ) that you build floppy disk support into the kernel .
If you compile it as modules you wo n't be able to boot with your new kernel from a floppy disk .
Apart from larger and larger sizes , another feature of recent kernel images is their use of initrd .
A special dictionary I keep next to my computer defines initrd as " one more thing to worry about " .
You can avoid the need to worry about initrd by ensuring that you compile directly into the kernel ( not as modules ) support for your boot hardware and root filesystem .
If the hard drive you boot from is IDE , compile IDE support into the kernel .
If your root filesystem is Reiserfs be sure Reiserfs support is built not as modules but directly into the kernel .
Kernel size depends on configuration .
My kernel 2.4.18 was 645 KB ; the kernel I built using Debian 's 2.4.18 - bf2.4 configuration was 1228 KB .
To make their kernels useable by most people on most hardware , Linux distributors generally include support for most hardware and functions .
Debian is no different ; pre-compiled kernels include support for hardware you 'll never have and languages you 'll never read .
My general rule for kernel configuration is , " If in doubt leave it out . "
If you test your new kernel and find that some of your hardware does n't work , it 's easy to tweak the configuration and build another kernel .
An important principle of kernel configuration is TANSTAAFL ( There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch ) .
Any features you add to the kernel increase its size ( and the time to build it ) , even if you choose to add them as modules .
Now all you can do is wait for the computer to finish .
Take a few minutes off and enjoy yourself while the computer does its fair share of the work .
The manual page for make - kpkg describes one way to use fakeroot ; we will use the simpler method of putting " fakeroot " at the beginning of the make - kpkg command line , like this :
Using fakeroot you can start make - kpkg as a normal user , and most of the job will be run with normal permissions .
Near the end of the job , fakeroot will simulate a root environment to create the kernel - image package .
When you added yourself to the src group you made it possible to do most kernel - package work with normal user privilege .
However the files that are part of a kernel package ( like the kernel and kernel modules ) will be owned by root and run with root privilege ; they must be created with root privilege .
Please read /usr / share / doc/ kernel - package / README.gz if -- append - to- version or -- revision is unclear , or if you plan on using options different from the ones I suggest .
( One way to do this is " zcat README.gz | most " . )
Ignore the discussions of flavours and epochs until you are more familiar with make - kpkg and with Debian packages generally ; they are not likely to be useful to you now .
I recommend using a different -- append - to - version value for each kernel you compile , and letting make - kpkg assign the default revision .
Date - based values work for me , but you are free to invent your own scheme .
I have two revisions of kernel 2.4.18.030320 : revision 1.0 and revision 10.00 .
Custom .
If I install either of these kernels and later try to install the other I will get a warning about conflicting kernels / modules .
If I continue I will overwrite the already - installed kernel and its modules .
I have two kernel names : 2.4.18.030309 and 2.4.18.030320 .
I can install both without worrying about conflicts .
Now you can see why underscores are not allowed in make - kpkg options — they separate the elements of package names .
The package name is everything before the first underscore .
Here is a partial list of my kernel packages :
You will not be using -- revision in this tutorial .
Using different values of -- revision will not prevent conflicts between kernels with the same name .
Another make - kpkg option is " - - revision " , which affects the name of the Debian package itself but not the kernel name .
As with -- append - to - version , you may use only alphanumeric characters , " + " and " . " .
Do not use underscores " _ " .
If you do not supply a value for -- revision , make - kpkg will use " 10.00 .
Custom " .
If you install a kernel with the same name ( the same version and -- append - to - version ) as an already - installed kernel , installing the new kernel package will overwrite the old kernel and its modules .
You will be warned and offered the chance to abort .
Take it .
Use another value for -- append - to - version and rebuild .
This means that by using a new value for -- append - to - version each time you build a kernel image , you can ensure that the new kernel will have a new name , and that its modules wo n't conflict with those of other kernels .
Kernel modules live in subdirectories of / lib / modules ; each kernel has its own subdirectory .
Every time you install a kernel image with a new name , the package installer creates a new subdirectory of / lib / modules to hold its modules .
You should avoid using -- append - to - version values such as " - 686 " , " - K7 " , and " - sparc " .
They are commonly used for Debian pre-compiled kernels .
I used " -- append-to-version=.030309 " ( note the leading " . " ) when I built the image for this kernel .
It 's shorthand for " 2003 March 09 " , and it 's my way of distinguishing this kernel from other 2.4.18 kernels ( such as kernel 2.4.18.020724 which I built on 2002 July 24 ) .
The first option lets you specify an addition to the kernel version , which then becomes part of the kernel 's name .
You may use alphanumeric characters , " + " and " . " ( period or full stop ) ; do not use underscore " _ " .
Your target will be " kernel_image " .
Let 's examine two of the more important and common options , " - - append - to- version " and " - - revision " .
The make - kpkg command line can be complex and at first intimidating .
Its basic syntax is
make - kpkg is part of the " kernel - package " package .
Its documentation is located in /usr / share / doc / kernel - package / .
To build the kernel you 'll invoke " make - kpkg " , a script which automates and replaces the sequence " make dep ; make clean ; make bzImage ; make modules " .
Take a few minutes and read over the manual page for make - kpkg .
If you have an older machine with a slower processor it can take several hours to build a Debian kernel image .
( It is possible to build your kernel on a faster machine and install it on the slower machine , but I wo n't cover that here . )
I built a kernel 2.4.18 package on my high - speed low - drag 166 MHz Pentium and it took about 1 hour 40 minutes .
That was using my configuration .
Using Debian 's kernel 2.4.18 - bf2.4 configuration , it took 4 hours 45 minutes on the same machine .
On a 1GHz Pentium III the same packages built in 9 and 23 ½ minutes , respectively .
Congratulations on compiling your first kernel with kernel - package .
No sweat eh ?
There are still a few things you should do before you declare victory and fire up Quake III .
If everything went well , all you need to do now is reboot .
If your new kernel does n't boot , insert your boot floppy and restart .
Go back to Configuring the kernel , tweak your configuration , and try again .
If you use grub see Kernel - package and grub .
If you say " yes " , you 'll be prompted to install a partition boot record , install a master boot record , and make your root partition the active partition .
If you are using a bootloader other than lilo you should check the documentation in /usr / share / doc / kernel - package before answering this question .
You probably will not want the post - install script to handle your bootloader .
Be sure you say " no " when the script asks if you want to install a boot block using the existing / etc/lilo.conf .
That would be trying to boot the new kernel with the old configuration , and it wo n't work .
Next you 'll be asked if you want to wipe out the old LILO configuration and make a new one .
If you use LILO that would be " yes " .
Then you 'll be asked whether you want to set up Linux to boot from the hard disk .
If you have n't made a boot disk yet then you need to do so .
If the post - install process whacks lilo you will not be able to restart without a boot floppy .
The post - install script should ask if you want to make a boot disk .
If you made one earlier you can say " no " here .
Otherwise grab a floppy you do n't mind erasing and say " yes " .
To install a kernel - image package from disk ( as opposed to installing from a Debian archive ) use the full file name .
To install the kernel and all its modules become root and do :
Once the kernel image is built you will install the kernel - image package , which includes the kernel and its modules .
First check to make sure it was built successfully by changing to the /usr / src directory and listing its contents :
If you want to rebuild your kernel because you just bought a new sound card , or you want to enable a new feature you forgot to include the first time , all you need to do is reconfigure , do " fakeroot make - kpkg clean " , and rebuild with a different value for -- append - to - version .
Your session should look something like this :
If the modules subdirectory still is n't empty , you probably have kernel modules that you did n't build with make - kpkg .
You can remove the modules subdirectory once you 're satisfied there 's nothing there you need .
If you get a message that " /lib/modules /2.4.18.030309 is not empty so was n't removed " , you probably have third - party modules installed there .
They too can be removed by purging their packages .
( See Third - party modules to find out how to make them with make - kpkg . )
Now that you see how easy it is to build and install kernels , it wo n't be long before your / boot directory is crowded with kernels and configs and System .maps .
Use dpkg to purge the ones you do n't need :
Create another boot diskette , this one for the kernel you just installed .
Grab another floppy — it 's not a good idea to overwrite your old boot disk ; you have n't been using your new kernel long enough to be sure it works .
Once your kernel has been packaged with its modules , you can install it on any machine that has the hardware you specified in your kernel configuration .
You could even reinstall it on your current machine after reinstalling your system .
While not required , it 's a good idea is to back up your custom kernel .deb .
Copy it to a secure undisclosed location .
When you download patches or other source code into a specific source tree , you do n't want anything else messing with it .
By removing the symlink you might prevent # 1 from happening .
The next time you download the kernel source from the Debian archive , you might expand the source into its own tree without problems .
But since you already have a symlink called " linux " in the src directory , you might go ahead and compile ( forgetting of course that it 's linked to your old source tree . )
The next time you download a kernel it might not be from a Debian archive .
When you expand the source tarball it could overwrite your old source tree right through the old symlink .
Bummer .
Next , you should get rid of the symlink you created in the /usr / src directory .
There are several reasons for this :
Of course substitute the real name of your kernel .
To refer to a package that dpkg knows about ( an installed package or one in an archive 's list ) use the package name rather than the full file name .
Also , the " | " character is made by typing Shift - \ .
Check that the package really is on hold ; if it is you should see :
If you used -- append - to - version you should n't need to worry about apt - get trying to " upgrade " your kernel .
If you 're paranoid ( it is out to get you ) you can make sure by doing this ( as root ) :
It may seem a bit strange to have a page for " Advanced topics " in a newbiedoc .
We know that some of our readers are n't new to Linux or even to building kernels ; they are trying to learn The Debian Way to administer their systems .
Once you have successfully used kernel - package to build and install your own custom kernel , you may want to explore some ways to make life even better .
8.1 . Using an existing configuration
When you installed your custom kernel , its configuration was copied to / boot / config - x.y.z .
You may want to squirrel it away in another location ( or several other locations ) for safekeeping or later re-use .
Suppose that just last week you picked your way through the maze of options , and settled on a configuration that supports all the hardware and features you want .
Today a new stable kernel is released and of course you want to upgrade right away .
Is it necessary to start from scratch configuring the new kernel ?
Not at all .
Download and expand the new source tarball and make a new symlink .
Then change directories to /usr / src/ linux , copy your existing configuration there and do " make oldconfig " : bash:/usr/src/linux $ cp /boot / config-2.4.18.030320 .config bash:/usr/src/linux$ make oldconfig
You 'll be asked questions about new kernel options .
It 's generally safe to answer " no " to all the questions ; make notes of the new options that interest you .
After you finish oldconfig you can run xconfig or menuconfig to review your selections , change your answers , or investigate the options you noted .
Then do " fakeroot make - kpkg clean " and you 're ready to build the latest stable kernel with your own configuration .
8.2 . Kernel - package and grub Although LILO is still Debian 's default boot loader , grub is an outstanding alternative , and it works and plays well with make - kpkg .
After you 've installed grub , run " grub - install / dev/hda " ( substitute your boot device for " / dev/hda " ) .
Then run " update - grub " .
Edit / boot / grub / menu.lst and substitute your defaults on the " #groot " and " # kopt " lines ( and any other lines you need for your situation ) .
Run " update - grub " again .
Create the file
/etc/kernel-img.conf and insert the following lines : postinst_hook=/ sbin/update - grub
postrm_hook=/sbin/update-grub
Now whenever you install a new kernel image , update - grub will scan your / boot directory , inventory the kernels there , and write a new boot menu .
If you took my suggestion and used " -- append-to- version=.yymmdd " , your kernels will be sorted by kernel version and date .
The grub default is to start the first kernel in the list ( your newest kernel ) , unless you choose a different one before the menu times out .
When you remove a kernel , update - grub will remove its entry from the boot menu .
When you 're comfortable with grub , do " dpkg - P lilo " and you wo n't be asked about lilo when you install a new kernel . :)
8.3 . Third - party modules " Third - party modules " is the term I use for kernel modules with source code outside the kernel source tree .
An example is " pcmcia-cs " , which many laptop users need for the latest PCMCIA support .
To use pcmcia-cs , apt - get the " pcmcia - source " package ; the source tarball should be in /usr / src .
As a normal user , expand the source tarball to /usr / src/ modules / pcmcia-cs .
If you do n't already have a modules directory one will be created .
When you configure your kernel , disable PCMCIA support .
( If you have PCMCIA support enabled , pcmcia-cs wo n't build drivers . )
If you want to use wireless LAN , enable it under " Network device support " but do n't select any devices .
When you are ready to build your kernel , add " modules_image " to your command line : bash :/usr/src/linux $ fakeroot make - kpkg -- append - to - version=.030401 kernel_image modules_image
( As you learn more and more the make - kpkg command line gets longer and longer . )
After your kernel - image .deb is made , make - kpkg will go to /usr / src/ modules and build a modules .deb for each subdirectory , with the same version and -- append - to - version as your kernel .
Install the modules - image .debs after you install the kernel - image .deb .
That 's it .
Could this get any easier ?
8.4 .
Adding third - party modules to an existing kernel
You 've been monitoring the debian - user mailing list , and you notice that more and more people are interested in alsa ( Advanced Linux Sound Architecture ) .
You realize that your new sound card does n't sound as good as it should , and you want to try alsa yourself .
You fire up " make menuconfig " ( you are more experienced now ) but in the " Sound " section you do n't see anything labelled " alsa " .
What to do ?
Install the " alsa - source " package .
By now you know to look for a new tarball in /usr / src , and there it is : bash : /usr / src$ ls alsa - driver.tar.bz2 kernel-image-2.4.18.030401_10.00.Custom_i386.deb kernel -source-2.4.18 kernel -source-2.4.18.tar.bz2 modules pcmcia-modules-2.4.18.030401_3.1.33-6+10.00.Custom_i386.deb
Expand the alsa - driver tarball and re-create the symlink .
Note the -- append - to - version value of your kernel image ; you 'll need it as an option for make - kpkg : bash : / usr / src$ cd linux bash : /usr / src/linux $ fakeroot make - kpkg -- append - to- version=.030401 --added-modules=alsa-driver modules_image
Notice that you do n't need the " kernel_image " target here .
Unless you reconfigured the kernel , there 's no need to rebuild it .
Using the " - - added - modules " option lets you build only the modules you need , instead of all the modules in /usr / src/ modules .
If you want to build a modules .deb with a different -- revision than the kernel , you may need to appease make - kpkg by doing " fakeroot make - kpkg clean " .
Of all the myths that have grown up around open source software , perhaps the most pervasive is Eric Raymond 's aphorism that " Many eyes make bugs shallow " , suggesting that if lots of people can view a program 's source code , they will find and fix its errors more quickly than commercial products whose code is jealously guarded .
The only problem with this is that it 's not true - certainly not in one of the flagship projects of open source , OpenOffice .
This project is most often quoted as the threat to Microsoft 's cash - generating Office suite .
The free suite comprises a word processor , spreadsheet and presentation program ; and graphics , equation editor and database programs if you want .
OpenOffice is the only free and open source product competitive with Office , able to read and write Microsoft format documents almost flawlessly .
For GNU / Linux desktop users , it is the only way to communicate in the universe of business .
But it also vividly demonstrates the limitations of open source as a way of producing software , and its futility as an ideology .
I like OpenOffice .
I used it long before it was usable , out of a mixture of perversity , stinginess , and vague anti-Microsoft sentiment .
When I started writing books , I had Microsoft Word 97 , which could not print a 60,000 - word manuscript without crashing .
I have written numerous macros ( which automate less obvious , or screamingly obvious , tasks ) , including the word count for version 1 .
I have done quality assurance work , submitting reports on bugs and testing those reported by others .
So I know something about the open source " community " and the enormous gap between myth and reality .
Improbable assumptions
The reality is that any computer user probably depends on open source programs every time they look up anything on the net .
But they do n't know that , and they do n't have to .
The myth of open source rests on two improbable assumptions .
The first is that a significant proportion of users can fix bugs .
That is true at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where the concept of free software was first formalised in the 1980s by Richard Stallman and others , and it is true in some of the geekier corners of the internet .
But on programs intended for use by the non-programming public , it 's a very different story .
This is important because of the second crucial false assumption : that even if not all users can fix a bug , they can help find them .
They can't .
Most users just think : " The computer is n't doing what I want . "
Big commercial software companies know this well .
When developing products for the public , they spend a lot of money on usability testing to find out what users expect from software , and how to meet those expectations .
Companies lose from user dissatisfaction in a way open source software does n't , and so have an incentive to avoid errors in the first place : the number of calls to a support desk grows exponentially with the number of bugs and users .
Where 's the support desk for OpenOffice ?
Despite the open source rhetoric , OpenOffice actually started as a commercial product - StarOffice , from Germany 's StarDivision - before being bought in October 1999 by Sun Microsystems .
Almost all the work on it is now done by about 100 full - time Sun programmers .
That is a tiny fraction of the armies Microsoft or Google can deploy to solve a problem .
But what about the innumerable volunteers who can download the code and fix what they like ?
They take one look at the effort involved and run .
OpenOffice is an extremely complex mountain of source code .
As far as I know , in the five years it has been available as open source , not one contribution to the program has come from amateurs .
The outsiders who have provided input have been full - time professionals employed by Linux companies to help make the software credible .
There has been a lot of volunteer effort , but it has gone into support .
Without the efforts of French and Italian volunteers , it would be more or less impossible for anyone to write macros .
Some volunteer energy goes into localisation efforts : the suite is available in practically every language , and four or five people put in a real effort to help puzzled users on the internet , but the overwhelming energy seems to go into filling the blogosphere with remarks about the merits of open source software and getting outraged about inconvenient facts .
Kindergarten noise
For example , just before version 2 was released , a Ziff - Davis blog ( blogs.zdnet.com /Ou/?p=120 ) pointed out that OpenOffice is bigger , less efficient , and much slower than MS Office ( tinyurl.com / 4evmt ) .
Large spreadsheets take more than 100 times as long to load .
Some of this is a result of inefficient code , and some the result of an inefficient storage system ; the figures are undeniable and not disputed by Sun developers , but the shrieks of outrage in the comments would be alarming even in a kindergarten .
So why is OpenOffice so dire ?
The project claims more than 50 m downloads of the software , so let 's assume that 50 m people have tried it at least once .
More than 50,000 bugs have been reported .
And how many have been fixed by open source 's uniquely efficient processes ?
According to the ( public ) bugs database , at last count , there were more than 6,000 unfixed bugs , and more than 5,000 feature requests .
While the number of bugs discovered seems to rise with the number of users , the number of fixes does n't , and the number of fixers certainly does n't .
Only about 500 people have signed the legalese that would enable them to submit code to the project ; since you need to do this even to make changes to the website , that will translate to far fewer than 500 volunteers submitting real code .
A reasonable guess would be 50 , or even five .
Meanwhile , there are some simple , hugely irritating bugs that are four years old .
Two obvious ones : notes ( or comments , as Word users call them ) do n't have word wrap ; and spaces typed at the end of a line wo n't show .
It 's not many eyes making bugs shallow ; more like many eyes making bugs invisible .
Most software has similar irritations .
But complex open source projects seem uniquely badly placed to fix them .
They rely on a very small group of programmers relative to the user base , and who have no direct incentive to work on the bugs that are important to users .
Perhaps like Microsoft Windows , which took many goes to hit its stride , OpenOffice 3.1 will be a world beater .
But if it is , it will have nothing to do with the fact that any user can , in theory , fix things they do n't like .
It will be because large companies such as Sun , Google , and IBM have decided that open source is the cheapest way to gang up on Microsoft , because it means they need spend nothing on support .
But , for what it 's worth , I still think OpenOffice may be better for books than Microsoft Word .
