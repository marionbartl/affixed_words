Replikins , Ltd. published a FluForecast® warning on April 7th , 2008 , a year before the recent Mexico and California H1N1 cases .
The company was able to state the likelihood of H1N1 outbreaks based on its patented Replikin Count™ genomics technology , which examines specific regions in virus genes which have been linked with past epidemics .
A synthetic H1N1 Replikins Vaccine is available for testing .
A similar synthetic Replikin Vaccine has been shown to successfully block the entry of H5N1 virus into , replication in , and excretion from chickens .
Another synthetic Replikin Vaccine has been shown to protect 91 % of shrimp from the lethal Taura Syndrome Virus .
The company is able to produce these vaccines in as little as 7 days , rather than the many months needed for traditional vaccines , because they are synthesized at the peptide level .
The following is the text of the April 2008 release in which Replikins was able to pinpoint the high risk of H1N1 outbreaks :
" H1N1 Influenza Virus with Highest Replikin Count™ Since the 1918 Pandemic Identified in the U.S. and Austria
Boston , MA ( PRWeb ) April 7 , 2008 -- Replikins , Ltd. has found that the Replikin Count™ of the H1N1 strain of influenza virus has recently increased to 7.6 ( plus / minus 1.4 ) , its highest level since the 1918 H1N1 pandemic ( p value less than 0.001 ) .
A rising Replikin Count of a particular influenza strain , indicating rapid replication of the virus , is an early warning which has been followed consistently by an outbreak of the specific strain .
The current increase appears to be specific to H1N1 ; there was a concurrent 80 % decline in the Replikin Count of H3N2 , for instance .
The current H1N1 appears to be rapidly replicating simultaneously in the U.S. and Austria .
It may succeed H5N1 as the leading candidate for the next expected overdue pandemic .
However , the same virus replikin structures detected by FluForecast® software in all three previous pandemics , namely 1918 H1N1 , 1957 H2N2 , and 1968 H3N2 , as well as in H5N1 , have not yet been detected in the currently evolving H1N1 .
There is evidence that many factors , including virus structure , host receptivity , and the environment , together with infectivity and rapid replication , need to converge for a pandemic to occur .
For H5N1 , the high human mortality rate , which peaked at over 80 % in 2006 - 07 in Indonesia , as well as current low infectivity , both appear to limit H5N1 's ability to produce a pandemic .
Furthermore , the H5N1 rapid replication cycle which began in 1996 now appears to be over .
The H5N1 virus produced less than 300 World Health Organization confirmed deaths over the past 10 years .
On the other hand , H1N1 , with an estimated human mortality rate of only 2.5 to 10 % , but with much higher infectivity , produced an estimated 50 million deaths in the 1918 pandemic .
A number of countermeasures exist today which did not exist in 1918 , however .
Among these is Replikins ' ability to manufacture synthetic vaccines based on current sequences , with a seven day production turnaround .
( end of 4/2008 release )
In the April 2008 announcement above , as published on the Web , Replikins stated that it had detected the highest levels of its specific genome regions ever seen in any virus samples , except for those from the 1918 pandemic which killed tens of millions of people .
Today , the company is actively pursuing licensing partnerships to apply its groundbreaking technology not only to early warning systems , but also to the development of synthetic vaccines to prevent or slow future epidemics .

The situation is loaded with all the irony of classic Canadian comedy : at a time when any clear - thinking Canadian is – for perhaps the first time ever – envying the United States for its political leadership , it seems that Canada is finally being envied for its economic strength .
Not only has President Obama praised the robustness of Canada 's banks , but recession - hit Ireland is considering restructuring its financial regulatory bodies to look " similar to the Canadian model " .
Unlike the United States and Great Britain , Canada 's government has n't had to bail out any of its banks , and its banks are ranked top in the world by the World Economic Forum for soundness .
And although Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper has overstated the claim that sub - prime mortgages are n't a problem in Canada , the reported 7 % market share of sub - prime lenders in Canada is nowhere near their 22 % market share in the United States .
None of this happy news is lost on Canadians .
Gary Rabbior , president of the Canadian Foundation for Economic Education , told CTV's Tom Clark that " compared with how many are doing , we 're probably the envy of many right now .
And if we can hold our act together and continue to do as we 've done in the past , we should be the envy of the world coming out of it . "
The Globe and Mail waxed lyrical about Canada 's " balanced cultural approach to savings and risk " , both amongst lenders and consumers , and , after the early 1990s recession lingered far longer in Canada than America , a cultural debt- aversion that differentiates Canadians from Brits and Americans .
Optimists also point to the fact that Canada 's office of the superintendent of financial institutions has been far more regulatory than the United States , and that , unlike America , the country 's main banks chose not to sell most of their mortgages , giving them an incentive to ensure they were good loans .
Harper , hanging on by the skin of his teeth and recently proroguing Parliament against a challenge by a centre - left coalition , has used upbeat analysis of the Canadian economy to paint his challengers as pessimists , although Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff has countered that " it 's not good enough to go to Canadians and sing them happy songs " , and that Canadians " want their prime minister to tell them the truth , and I think he 's being economical with the truth " .
Indeed , the robustness of financial institutions is far from the whole story , and unfortunately for the proponents of " Canada envy " , there 's really no such thing as Canada doing better than America .
A delayed reaction , or a less severe impact , is the most Canadians can hope for .
It is hard to visualise the current suffering of many ordinary Canadians in Harper 's optimism , but Canada 's unemployment rate now stands at 7.7 % , with the manufacturing centre in Ontario suffering over half of the country 's joblessness since October 2008 .
Alberta 's oil sands , often seen as central to the country 's future prosperity , have seen all major companies delaying or shelving their expansion plans .
When life for the average Canadian is hardly getting easier , the smug talk of envy by Ottawa politicians hardly seems appropriate given the reality of their situation .
Analysts have pointed out that using alternative measurements produces a very different picture of Canada 's current economic situation .
An independent institution , the office of the parliamentary budget officer , has found that using yardsticks such as year - over - year comparisons of real GDP ( in this case , the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 ) shows Canada 's real GDP was down 0.7 % , not significantly different from the United States ' 0.8 % .
When they looked at nominal GDP , which includes the effects of inflation , Canada 's nominal GDP declined 13.4 % between the third and fourth quarters of 2008 , whereas the American nominal GDP shrank 5.8 % .
In the face of these facts , it 's unsurprising that Bank of Canada 's governor has just ditched the earlier prediction of a " made - in - Canada " economic rebound by 2010 .
And really , all the talk of a stand - alone Canadian rebound seems to contain a glaring omission : the North American Free Trade Agreement , and Canadian economic dependence on the United States .
Obama was n't wrong about the soundness of Canada 's banks , nor was Harper wrong that regulation and risk - aversion have put Canada in a better position than many nations .
It 's just that those good practices are n't enough to inure Canada against an economic crisis , given its overwhelming reliance on trade with America .
According to the Economist , around 80 % of Canada 's exports go to the United States , yet US imports from Canada have fallen 36 % since July 2008 .
Although modifications were made to Obama 's proposed " Buy American " restrictions after the Canadian trade minister warned that they could take legal action against America under the terms of Nafta , the state of America 's economy alone means Canada will suffer enough , even without further restrictions .
Rather than the optimism of " Canada envy " , the worrying message of Canada 's current economic crisis is that even countries that mostly did everything right will still have to suffer along with everyone else , so dependent as they are on America .
With Nafta securing the " strongest " trade relationship anywhere in the world , Canada and the United States may still variously envy each others ' politics and economies – but one partner clearly still has the upper hand .
Britain and America could certainly have done with a drop of Canada 's appreciation for regulation , but the recklessness of Wall Street and London 's financial giants has ended up damaging a country that had it own financial house in order .
Tally concludes finding 312 vote victory for the Democrat , as the Republican contester prepares his final appeal (s )
But does the state 's former Senator have a legal leg to stand on ?...
Ernest A. Canning Byon 4/7/2009 , 11:07 am PT
Guest Blogged by Ernest A. Canning
Author and former radio talk show host Al Franken , the Democratic challenger for the U.S. Senate seat in Minnesota , will be the state 's next U.S. Senator , according to a final tally by the bi-partisan three - judge panel overseeing challenger Norm Coleman 's election contest against him .
This morning in St. Paul , officials from the Minnesota Secretary of State 's office , under the in -court direction of the three - judge Election Contest panel in the former Senator 's contest against Franken , tallied all remaining lawfully cast absentee - ballots that were not previously opened and counted .
This was done on camera , in open court .
The attorneys from both sides , along with the media , were all present .
The final tally of the remaining ballots was 198 votes for Franken , 111 votes for Coleman and 42 votes for " other . "
When this is combined with the initial 225 vote lead , certified by the bi-partisan State Canvassing Board in December , it adds up to a 312 vote Franken victory , arrived at by both a transparent , post - election hand - count late last year , and the additional tallies added under the painstaking care exercised by the three - judge panel in Coleman 's three - month long contest trial .
Al Franken has now won the U.S. Senate seat , but do Coleman 's promised appeal (s ) stand a chance of winning ?
And will the Democrats in the U.S. Senate now assume their Constitutional right to dutifully seat the Senator from Minnesota ?...
The Transparent , Painstaking Road to Victory
After Franken was unanimously declared the winner by a 225 vote margin on Jan. 5 , 2009 , by the bi-partisan Minnesota State Canvassing Board , Coleman filed notice he was contesting the election .
The contest was assigned to a bi-partisan three - judge panel , which , during the span of a seven week trial , reviewed 19,181 pages of filings and 1,717 exhibits , and heard the testimony of 142 witnesses .
The panel issued a key Feb. 13 , 2009 ruling that expressly rejected [ PDF ]
Coleman 's central legal argument contending the court should " accept the introduction of absentee ballot return envelopes and supporting materials en masse in accordance with categories [ he had ] identified . "
Coleman 's position rested " upon the faulty premise that [ he ] could meet [ his ] burden …by proving that the reason for which the absentee ballot was rejected was not proper . "
The court found that simply because an election official gave an erroneous reason for rejecting an absentee ballot , that did not mean that the ballot " was lawfully cast . "
Proof that a ballot was lawfully cast must be made on an individualized basis , the court determined .
Last week , on March 31 , 2009 the court issued another key ruling seen as unfavorable to Coleman 's case .
Where he had claimed at the start of the contest that some 5,000 absentee ballots were improperly rejected , the court , after a painstaking , ballot - by - ballot review , directed that 400 previously unopened ballots be delivered to the court by yesterday , April 6 , 2009 to be opened .
A good number of these were previously unopened absentee ballots that Franken had sought to be opened .
The court cautioned that some of these ballots may not be counted ; that some were being opened because the court needed to see the originals to assure that they were lawfully cast .
Today , in open court , the remaining , uncounted , lawfully cast absentee ballots were carefully opened and tallied , giving Franken a final 312 vote victory out of some 2.9 million ballots cast in the election .
On Election Night , when he held a slender lead in the unofficial early count , Coleman said that if he were behind he would not so much as seek a recount because he thought " the need for the healing process is so important . "
Coleman to Appeal , But on What Grounds ?
So the question now remains , what will Coleman now do ?
He could honorably , and finally , concede , but do n't hold your breath .
Based on statements made by his attorney , Ben Ginsberg , Coleman 's next step will be an appeal to the Minnesota Supreme Court .
Almost from the moment the three - judge panel issued its Feb. 13 , 2009 ruling , Ginsberg had begun stridently claiming that the election was " fatally flawed " ; that the strict standards applied by the court for the opening and counting of absentee ballots designated by Coleman in the contest had not been uniformly applied by election officials throughout the state with respect to the more than 280,000 absentee ballots that had been previously opened and counted .
Referencing Florida 2000 's controversial U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Bush v. Gore , Ginsberg contended Coleman was denied equal protection .
As both the Franken legal team , and the three - judge panel , observed , Ginsberg 's equal protection argument is fatally flawed .
For starters , there is a serious issue of waiver .
Coleman did not challenge the lawfulness of the previously counted absentee ballots either during the post-election hand - count or in his notice of contest .
The three - judge panel observed [ PDF ] that Bush v Gore was based on questions arising under " Florida 's basic command …to consider the ' intent of the voter . '
The United States Supreme Court found that while this principle was ' unobjectionable as an abstract proposition … the problem inheres in the absence of specific standards to insure its equal application . ' "
Minnesota 's objective standards for opening and counting absentee are specific , clear , and unmistakable .
Franken 's legal team argued [ PDF ] that imperfect application of these clearly delineated standards by local election officials does not " constitute a constitutional violation .
Not only would this result in an untenable rule that would make democratic and federalist government impossible ; it finds no support in the case law .
Rather , courts have consistently refused to find constitutional violations due to errors or inconsistencies , where clear state standards exist . "
Under Minnesota law , the governor is ordinarily required to prepare an original certificate of election , countersigned by the secretary of state , after the recount is completed , unless a contest is filed .
In a March 6 , 2009 decision , Franken v. Pawlenty [ PDF ] , the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that , where there is a contest , no certificate can issue , " until a court of proper jurisdiction has finally determined the contest . "
On 4/6/09 Mike McIntee of TheUptake.org reported that Minnesota 's Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty said he may not sign the certification for Al Franken 's victory --- both he , and the state 's Democratic Sec. of State Mark Ritchie , are required to do so --- until all appeals are exhausted even after a decision by the state Supreme Court .
If so , this would be at odds with his previous legal position .
The Court in Franken v. Pawlenty stated :
The Governor and Coleman respond that the expression ' finally determined the contest ' used in the contest tolling provision refers to the final decision of the state courts in adjudicating the contest …
If my reading of the Minnesota contest statutes is correct , however , Pawlenty may have already been removed from the equation .
The pertinent provision , section 209.12 , not only limits the question to be decided in a contest to " which party received the highest number of votes cast and is therefore entitled to receive the certificate of election , " but states :
After the time for appeal has expired , or in the case of an appeal , after the final determination of the contest , the court administrator … shall promptly certify and forward the files and records of the proceedings …to the presiding officer of the Senate .
This raises a question as to whether there would even be a need for the governor 's certification .
Regardless , the issuance of a certificate is a ministerial act .
After denying Coleman 's appeal , which is likely , the Minnesota Supreme Court could simply order Pawlenty to certify .
Coleman could then prevent certification only if the U.S. Supreme Court issued an immediate stay as it was deciding whether to hear the case .
The combination of what I regard as a frivolous equal protection argument and the fact that four Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court are associated with the radically subversive Robert Bork - founded Federalist Society raise a truly disturbing potential .
As I noted in " Prosecute or Perish " here at The BRAD BLOG the Federalist Society is committed to a hard - right agenda .
While a majority of five Justices are needed to prevail in the U.S. Supreme Court , only four are needed to decide that a case should be heard .
Make no mistake .
The Coleman legal challenge is being driven by the same hard - right movement that brought us eight years of the lawless " Unitary Executive " regime of George W. Bush .
The hard right is a " revolutionary power " ; billionaire - funded , anti-egalitarian ideologues dedicated to smashing the existing constitutional framework .
While the hard right recognizes its equal protection argument is bogus , it succeeds if it prolongs its ability to obstruct efforts to unravel the damage it caused over the past eight years by delaying the seating of a 59th member of the U.S. Senate 's Democratic Caucus .
It 's an echo of the Clinton years when the hard - right bottled up Clinton judicial appointments , taking the long view towards a day when the Bush regime could fill vacancies with " radicals - in- robes . "
Thus we find Senator Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) stating , " The battle in Washington is real .
Every day in the Senate without Al Franken is a great day . "
Sen. John Cornyn ( R - TX ) , chair of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee ( RSCC ) , confirmed their caucus 's anti-democratic intentions recently , threatening " WWIII " if Senate Democrats attempted to seat Franken .
Yet , it is the Senate to which both Franken and those who support democracy should now turn .
As the Minnesota Supreme Court observed in Franken v Pawlenty , " the authority of the Senate under Article I Section 5 [ of the U.S. Constitution ] is plenary , and the Senate is therefore free to seat Franken if it so chooses … "
It can do so with or without certification .
Constitutional democracy cannot allow its future to be placed into the hands of the Court which gave us Bush v. Gore .
While there may be some room for reasonable minds to disagree on whether the Senate should wait for a Minnesota Supreme Court ruling ( I would certainly invite readers to weigh in on the subject ) , I believe that democracy should not have to wait another day .
The U.S. Senate should immediately take up the issue of seating Al Franken as the duly elected Senator from Minnesota .

While Clojure 's moving towards a 1.0 release , interest in the language has reached other platforms as well .
Clojure - contrib now contains two implementations of Clojure on different platforms .
A large part of Clojure 's written in Clojure , so the implementatations can share a lot of the code :
ClojureCLR is a port of Clojure to .NET
ClojureScript compiles a subset of Clojure to Javascript , opening up interesting opportunities , eg. sharing the same Clojure code between server side and client ( browser ) side parts of an application .
Clojure users are experimenting with JVM libraries and frameworks .
Clojure focuses on concurrency in one JVM and does n't have special support for distributed work .
Terracotta is a technology that allows to tie JVMs , on the same machine or distributed , together .
Paul Stadig has been experimenting with getting Clojure to use Terracotta 's features .
( A similar project was attempted with JRuby ) .
A recent progress report is promising :
So it looks like three of the biggest issues I had to work around in getting Clojure to work with Terracotta , will be resolved on the Terracotta side .
This means that the Terracotta Integration Module that I wrote [ 3 ] will pretty much boil down to a configuration file .
Finally , a new Clojure release is available with these changes :
Incorporates all the recent additions - fully lazy seqs , : let option for doseq / for , letfn for mutually recursive local fns , synchronous watches , multi-arg set / union / difference / intersection , counted ? , per- defmulti hierarchies , # _ ignore form reader macro , future - calls , future and pcalls / pvalues , defmulti docstrings and metadata , methods / prefers for multimethod reflection , uniform metadata handling for atoms / refs / agents / vars / namespaces , condp , release - pending - sends , AOT tweaks to support applets and Android , etc .
All this in addition to many fixes and enhancements .
The changes include the updated lazy behavior of sequences .
The multimethod reflection support allows to look at the mapping between dispatch values and functions ( using the methods function ) .
Evidence indicates a relationship between marijuana use and later schizophrenia .
Should this be a factor in debates about legalizing marijuana ?( online surveys )
Smoking marijuana ( cannabis ) , an icon of the bandana - wearing flower - child generation , is a subject of ongoing medical debate and a ballot measure in many states .
Is cannabis use harmless recreation , a medical necessity for end - of - life pain , or a disorder contributing to psychosis and associated with schizophrenia ?
Perhaps all three ?
It is the latter question that engaged a team of Finnish researchers who conducted a meta analysis of studies published between 1996 - 2008 and published in the current issue of Schizophrenia Bulletin .
Finnish researchers report cannabis use disorder ranged from 16 % to 27 % of the patients with schizophrenia , and was more common in those with samples drawn from younger , first - episode patients .
Males were also more numerous than females .
Should findings such as these affect the legalization of marijuana ?
Take our survey .
The former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori was today convicted of kidnapping and murder and sentenced to 25 years in what was described as a landmark ruling for human rights cases in Latin America .
A three - judge panel found the 70 - year - old guilty of authorising a military death squad during the state 's " dirty war " against Maoist rebels in the 1990s .
The 15 - month trial , held at a special forces police base just outside the capital , Lima , was the first time a democratically elected Latin American leader had been tried on home soil for human rights abuses .
" This court declares that the four charges against him have been proven beyond all reasonable doubt , " Judge Cesar San Martin told the courtroom .
Observers said the marathon case – involving 80 witnesses , 160 sessions and a 711 - page ruling – continued a trend towards bringing rogue former heads of state to book .
" After years of evading justice , Fujimori is finally being held to account for some of his crimes , " Maria McFarland , a Human Rights Watch researcher who attended , said .
" With this ruling , and its exemplary performance during the trial , the Peruvian court has shown the world that even former heads of state cannot expect to get away with serious crimes . "
Outside the tribunal , violent clashes flared between rival groups of supporters and opponents of the accused , underlining Peru 's split over whether he was a hero or villain .
A university chancellor and political outsider who unexpectedly won power in 1990 , Fujimori crushed a terrorist insurgency and tamed rampant inflation , paving the way for stability .
But corruption and murderous excesses marred his autocratic rule until his fall in 2000 when he fled to Japan , his parents ' homeland , and faxed his resignation .
Fujimori attempted a political comeback in 2005 when he flew to Chile in the run-up to Peru 's presidential election , only to be arrested and extradited in 2007 .
Fujimori protested his innocence and said he deserved credit for saving Peru from anarchy .
" I governed from hell , not the palace , " he told the court .
He blamed his former spy chief , Vladimiro Montesinos , for any counter - insurgency excesses .
An estimated 70,000 people died during the leftist Tupac Amaru and Maoist Shining Path insurgencies .
Around 37 % were killed by the military , according to Peru's Truth and Reconciliation commission .
The court convicted Fujimori of the deaths of 25 people in two massacres and the kidnapping of a businessman and a journalist .
The massacres were carried out by the Colina unit , consisting of specially trained military intelligence officers .
In the first , the unit used silencer - fitted guns to shoot 15 people at a chicken barbecue in Lima in 1991 , mistaking them for guerrilla sympathisers .
The following year , it abducted and " disappeared " nine university students and a professor.

A member of cabin crew was taken to hospital with " flu - like symptoms " today after falling ill on a British Airways flight from Mexico City to Heathrow .
The World Health Organisation has warned countries to be on alert for any unusual flu outbreaks after a swine flu virus was implicated in possibly dozens of human deaths in Mexico .
The BA employee , who has not been named , has been taken to Northwick Park hospital in Harrow , a hospital spokesman said .
He added : " He has flu - like symptoms and is responding well to treatment .
The patient was admitted directly to a side room and the hospital is scrupulously following infection control procedures to ensure there is no risk to any other individual in the hospital . "
The man was taken from flight BA242 which landed at 2 pm today , a BA spokesman said .
A Health Protection Agency spokesman said : " We are aware of a patient admitted to a London hospital with reported travel history to Mexico .
" As a precautionary measure the patient is being tested for a range of respiratory and other illnesses in line with UK health guidance .
At present there have been no confirmed cases of human swine flu in the UK or anywhere in Europe . "
A spokesman for Hillingdon Council , which is responsible for the health of people passing through the airport , said : " As the port authority for Heathrow Airport we already have Health Protection Agency doctors in each of the airport 's terminals at all times .
" Should we receive instructions from the Department for Health or the Health Protection Agency we will be well placed to respond appropriately . "
World Health Organisation director - general Margaret Chan has said the outbreak in Mexico involves " an animal strain of the H1N1 virus " .
The flu virus , which is suspected of killing at least 60 people in Mexico , has the potential to become a pandemic , she said .

Apparently , Internet Explorer is on its way out .
JCXP . net is saying that Internet Explorer 8 will be the last traditional version of Microsoft ’s web browser , and that Microsoft ’s next web browser will be based on a promising Microsoft Research project dubbed “ Gazelle ” .
Reading through the Microsoft Research paper on Gazelle , it becomes clear that it is an intricate beast .
It relies on a “ browser kernel ” , 5000 lines of C# code , that exposes the underlying system to webpages using a set of system calls .
Web content does not interact with the actual operating system at all ; all communication goes through the sandboxed browser kernel .
The browser kernel takes care of all resource protection and sharing .
In addition , Gazelle takes the multi-process approach used by Google ’s Chrome and Internet Explorer 8 a few steps further by not only running each tab or webpage in a separate process , but by also giving separate parts of each website their own process .
The authors of Gazelle believe the model introduced by Chrome is n’t sufficient .
“ This granularity [ in Chrome and IE8 ] is insufficient since a user may browse multiple mutually distrusting sites in a single tab , and a web page may contain an iframe with content from an untrusted site ( e.g. , ads ) , ” they explain .
They go even further by considering content coming from “ ad.iloveponies.com ” to be separate from “ user.iloveponies.com ” .
Plug-ins are also run in separate , sand - boxed processes , so that if they go bad , they only affect that particular sandboxed plug - in process .
Currently , Gazelle is built with some additional IE bits on top , and is not production ready .
Still , it renders most websites correctly , but there is an additional performance overhead thanks to the IE bits .
The authors also state that they have made no concessions to backwards compatibility in favour of security .
JCXP now claims that Gazelle will be the basis for Microsoft ’s next web browser , which wo n’t sport the IE name , but there ’s no source .
Whether or not this is true remains to be seen ; when news of Singularity came out , the entire web automatically assumed that this Microsoft Research project would be the next Windows .
Still , the ideas behind Gazelle are sound , and do n’t sound too far - fetched to be implemented .
A somewhat self - serving survey ahead of an information security trade show in London next week reveals a third of workers can potentially be bribed into handing over company data .
A poll of 600 workers at busy London railway stations found more than a third ( 37 per cent ) , admitted that they would hand over their organisation 's most sensitive data for inducements ranging up to a million pounds .
Respondents were asked what it would take to persuade them to download and hand over sensitive company information to a stranger , with suggested incentives ranging from a " slap up meal " to offers of over ten million pounds .
Such disloyalty was n't easily purchased , with two - thirds of those with flexible ethics saying they 'd only engage in a spot of industrial espionage for at least one million pounds , although 10 per cent would do it if their mortgage was paid off .
Around one in twenty of the sample would do it for modest inducements of a holiday , getting rid of credit card debt or a new job , respectively .
One in 50 told researchers running the poll that they'd be willing to hand over their company ’s crown jewels in exchange for a slap up meal .
When the requested information changed to credit card details or security codes , then employees became harder to bribe , with 80 per cent refusing to hand over the data at any price .
Workers quizzed had access to a range of information ranging from customer data bases ( 83 per cent ) to business plans ( 72 per cent ) , accounting systems ( 53 per cent ) , and IT admin passwords ( 37 per cent ) .
Two thirds ( 68 per cent ) of employees reckon it would be easy to sneak data out of their organisation .
One third felt less loyalty to the organisation they worked for against five per cent who felt more loyalty , compared to a year ago .
In previous years , Infosecurity surveys have concentrated on what little inducement workers need to hand over their passwords ( biros , choccy bars , take your pick ) .
This year around the show organisers have upped the ante , with a pitch calculated to push the message that in an uncertain economy , firms should be more wary of their workers .
The argument is that firms should install Data Leak Protection technology , undoubtedly music to the ears of Infosec 's exhibitors .
It 's conventional wisdom that corrupt insiders - rather than hackers - pose the greatest security threat , but a recent survey by Verizon Business , which looked at real incidents of data breaches , found the opposite .
The Verizon survey is well worth thinking about before placing too much weight on what people are apt to say at train stations . ®
Scientists at North Carolina State University and three universities in Japan have shown for the first time that it is possible for certain female termite " primary queens " to reproduce both sexually and asexually during their lifetimes .
The asexually produced babies mostly grow to be queen successors – so - called " secondary queens " – that remain in the termite colony and mate with the king .
This produces large broods of babies without the dangers of inbreeding , as secondary queens have no genes in common with the king .
Babies produced the old - fashioned way , between either the primary or secondary queens and the king , are mostly workers and soldiers of both genders , the research shows .
Dr. Ed Vargo , associate professor of entomology at NC State and a co-author of the paper , says that the species of subterranean termite studied , Reticulitermes speratus , is an important economic pest in Japan and is in the same genus as termites found in North Carolina .
Termite colonies are generally founded and then sustained by a primary king and primary queen .
In the study , the scientists collected termites from a number of different colonies in Japan .
In many colonies , the primary queen was not present , but had been seemingly succeeded by numerous secondary queens .
Most primary kings , meanwhile , were present in the colonies .
This suggests , Vargo says , that the primary kings live longer than the primary queens , so there is a strong need for these termites to have genetically diverse queen successors to grow the colonies efficiently .
Vargo 's genetic analysis of termite populations in several colonies showed that secondary queens shared genes with primary queens but not with primary kings , suggesting asexual reproduction .
At the same time , male and female termite workers and soldiers had genetic traces of both the primary king and primary queen , suggesting sexual reproduction .
" The conditional use of sex is unusual in insects and was previously unknown in termites .
This novel use of both sexual and asexual reproduction is a way for primary queens to maximize reproductive output allowing the colony to grow bigger and faster while maintaining genetic diversity and avoiding the disadvantages of inbreeding , " Vargo says .
Vargo plans to continue this research by looking for other species of female termites with dual mating systems .
He adds that learning more about the genetics behind reproduction could lead to ways of preventing the production of certain castes of termites – like the primary queens that reproduce in two ways – or ways of knocking out certain gene functions in those castes .
BOAO , China -- China Investment Corp. plans to expand its international investment this year , including in European countries that it had shunned because they tried to set limits on its investments , the Chinese sovereign - wealth fund 's chairman said Saturday .
Speaking to a meeting of business and political leaders here , Lou Jiwei reiterated complaints about resistance last year from Western governments to the fund , known as CIC .
Some foreign politicians worried that the fund , which was established in 2007 to invest $ 200 billion ...
The Hummer is the poster child of excess consumption and inefficiency , but a Utah company is converting the much - maligned SUVs into a range - extended electric vehicle good for 100 mpg and a range of 40 miles .
Raser Technologies will unveil the Raser H3 on Monday in Detroit .
It promises a 90 mph top speed , off - road capability and a lithium ion-battery you can recharge in as little as three hours .
What 's more , the company says the drivetrain can be installed in other trucks and it hopes to have 2,000 converted vehicles on the road by the end of next year .
That 's a tall order , and there is no shortage of companies promising us wonder cars with miraculous fuel economy and impressive range .
But Raser is taking a different approach .
It is n't building a car from scratch like Aptera Motors or Lightning Hybrids .
Instead , it 's essentially cribbing from the Chevrolet Volt and Fisker Karma to convert existing vehicles with off - the - shelf parts .
" We 've taken the worst environmental offender on the road and made it greener than a Prius , " David West , the company 's vice president of marketing , told Wired.com .
" It truly is incredible to see and hear a Hummer that truly hums . "
But why start with a Hummer ?
Because SUVs are popular but get lousy fuel economy , they 're great candidates for electrification , said Jim Spellman , company vice president .
Spellman came to Raser from General Motors , where he worked on the Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid .
" SUVs and trucks are the number one selling vehicle in America , " he said .
" Unlike the Prius , which is a mild hybrid vehicle , an eco-friendly SUV will get people 's attention . "
Spellman says there are practical reasons as well : Trucks are big enough to package the gasoline engine , electric motor and lithium - ion batteries without radically altering the bodywork or designing an all - new vehicle .
" Unlike the Volt and other hybrid cars we did n't have to build an entire car around the battery packs , " Spellman said .
" There was plenty of room in the back of the Hummer to install them , and they do n't affect the ground clearance of the vehicle . "
Raser Technologies has been building electric motors and developing geothermal electric plants since 2003 , and Spellman says it started " cutting steel " on the H3 prototype 15 months ago .
The prototype we 'll see in Detroit at the Society of Automotive Engineers World Congress on Monday features a series - hybrid drive train similar to the Voltec system in the Chevrolet Volt .
Like the Volt , the H3 will be driven solely by electricity .
The engine – the 260 - horsepower 2.0 - liter turbocharged four - cylinder used in the Pontiac Solstice – will drive a 100 - kilowatt generator to recharge the three lithium - ion battery packs .
Fisker Automotive is using the same engine in its Karma range - extended EV .
All together the battery packs have a combined capacity of 40 kilowatt hours and total weight of 600 pounds .
Raser claims a recharge time of between 3 and 10 hours , depending upon the voltage of the outlet the batteries are plugged into .
For the sake of comparison , the Volt uses a 16 - kWh pack that weighs 375 pounds , while the Tesla Roadster has a 53 - kWh pack weighing 992 pounds .
Tying it all together is something Raser calls the Hybrid Master Controller , which is a fancy name for the software that manages the engine , generator , motor and batteries .
It was designed by FEV , a hybrid drive train engineering firm that is working on a range - extended EV based on the Dodge Caliber .
General Motors provided some expertise along the way , said GM spokesman Kyle Johnson .
" We 're well aware of this project , " Johnson said .
" We helped them with some of the electronics integration and did some consulting . "
Getting all the hardware to fit required modifying the Hummer 's chassis .
The transmission was moved back , the drive shafts altered and the exhaust re-routed .
The Raser H3 also has a smaller fuel tank – 11 gallons instead of 22 – and it's been moved to make room for the batteries , which are mounted under the vehicle near the rear axle .
Despite the mods , Raser says the vehicle does n't lose any of its off - road utility .
West says production will begin " soon " and the company hopes to have 2,000 vehicles in the form of SUVs and trucks on the road by the end of 2010 .
He says Pacific Gas & Electric has requested two of them .
No word yet on how the project will be funded or what the vehicle will cost .
Raser promises more details when the vehicle is unveiled Monday .

ISTANBUL — “ Iran is the center of terrorism , fundamentalism and subversion and is in my view more dangerous than Nazism , because Hitler did not possess a nuclear bomb , whereas the Iranians are trying to perfect a nuclear option . ”
Benjamin Netanyahu 2009 ?
Try again .
These words were in fact uttered by another Israeli prime minister ( and now Israeli president ) , Shimon Peres , in 1996 .
Four years earlier , in 1992 , he ’d predicted that Iran would have a nuclear bomb by 1999 .
You ca n’t accuse the Israelis of not crying wolf .
Ehud Barak , now defense minister , said in 1996 that Iran would be producing nuclear weapons by 2004 .
Now here comes Netanyahu , in an interview with his faithful stenographer Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic , spinning the latest iteration of Israel ’s attempt to frame Iran as some Nazi - like incarnation of evil :
“ You do n’t want a messianic apocalyptic cult controlling atomic bombs .
When the wide - eyed believer gets hold of the reins of power and the weapons of mass death , then the entire world should start worrying , and that is what is happening in Iran . ”
Geithner ’s ‘ Dirty Little Secret ’ F. William Engdahl
www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net/
Mar 30 , 2009 US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has unveiled his long - awaited plan to put the US banking system back in order .
In doing so , he has refused to tell the ‘ dirty little secret ’ of the present financial crisis .
By refusing to do so , he is trying to save de facto bankrupt US banks that threaten to bring the entire global system down in a new more devastating phase of wealth destruction .
The Geithner Plan , his so - called Public - Private Partnership Investment Program or PPPIP , as we have noted previously ( Obamas Rettungsplan für die Banken : keine Lösung , sondern legaler Diebstahl ) , is designed not to restore a healthy lending system which would funnel credit to business and consumers .
Rather it is yet another intricate scheme to pour even more hundreds of billions directly to the leading banks and Wall Street firms responsible for the current mess in world credit markets without demanding they change their business model .
Yet , one might say , wo n’t this eventually help the problem by getting the banks back to health ?
Not the way the Obama Administration is proceeding .
In defending his plan on US TV recently , Geithner , a protégé of Henry Kissinger who previously was President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , argued that his intent was ‘ not to sustain weak banks at the expense of strong . ’
Yet this is precisely what the PPPIP does .
The weak banks are the five largest banks in the system .
The ‘ dirty little secret ’ which Geithner is going to great degrees to obscure from the public is very simple .
There are only at most perhaps five US banks which are the source of the toxic poison that is causing such dislocation in the world financial system .
What Geithner is desperately trying to protect is that reality .
The heart of the present problem and the reason ordinary loan losses as in prior bank crises are not the problem , is a variety of exotic financial derivatives , most especially so - called Credit Default Swaps .
In 2000 the Clinton Administration then - Treasury Secretary was a man named Larry Summers .
Summers had just been promoted from No. 2 under Wall Street Goldman Sachs banker Robert Rubin to be No. 1 when Rubin left Washington to take up the post of Vice Chairman of Citigroup .
As I describe in detail in my new book , Power of Money : The Rise and Fall of the American Century , to be released this summer , Summers convinced President Bill Clinton to sign several Republican bills into law which opened the floodgates for banks to abuse their powers .
The fact that the Wall Street big banks spent some $ 5 billion in lobbying for these changes after 1998 was likely not lost on Clinton .
One significant law was the repeal of the 1933 Depression - era Glass - Steagall
Act that prohibited mergers of commercial banks , insurance companies and brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch or Goldman Sachs .
A second law backed by Treasury Secretary Summers in 2000 was an obscure but deadly important Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 .
That law prevented the responsible US Government regulatory agency , Commodity Futures Trading Corporation ( CFTC ) , from having any oversight over the trading of financial derivatives .
The new CFMA law stipulated that so - called Over - the - Counter ( OTC ) derivatives like Credit Default Swaps , such as those involved in the AIG insurance disaster , ( which investor Warren Buffett once called ‘ weapons of mass financial destruction ’ ) , be free from Government regulation .
At the time Summers was busy opening the floodgates of financial abuse for the Wall Street Money Trust , his assistant was none other than Tim Geithner , the man who today is US Treasury Secretary .
Today , Geithner ’s old boss , Larry Summers , is President Obama ’s chief economic adviser , as head of the White House Economic Council .
To have Geithner and Summers responsible for cleaning up the financial mess is tantamount to putting the proverbial fox in to guard the henhouse .
The ‘ Dirty Little Secret ’
What Geithner does not want the public to understand , his ‘ dirty little secret ’ is that the repeal of Glass - Steagall and the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization
Act in 2000 allowed the creation of a tiny handful of banks that would virtually monopolize key parts of the global ‘ off - balance sheet ’ or Over - The - Counter derivatives issuance .
Today five US banks according to data in the just - released Federal Office of Comptroller of the Currency ’s Quarterly Report on Bank Trading and Derivatives Activity , hold 96 % of all US bank derivatives positions in terms of nominal values , and an eye - popping 81 % of the total net credit risk exposure in event of default .
The five are , in declining order of importance : JPMorgan Chase which holds a staggering $ 88 trillion in derivatives ( €66 trillion ! ) .
Morgan Chase is followed by Bank of America with $ 38 trillion in derivatives , and Citibank with $ 32 trillion .
Number four in the derivatives sweepstakes is Goldman Sachs with a ‘ mere ’ $ 30 trillion in derivatives .
Number five , the merged Wells Fargo - Wachovia Bank , drops dramatically in size to $ 5 trillion .
Number six , Britain ’s HSBC Bank USA has $ 3.7 trillion .
After that the size of US bank exposure to these explosive off - balance - sheet unregulated derivative obligations falls off dramatically .
Just to underscore the magnitude , trillion is written 1,000,000,000,000 .
Continuing to pour taxpayer money into these five banks without changing their operating system , is tantamount to treating an alcoholic with unlimited free booze .
The Government bailouts of AIG to over $ 180 billion to date has primarily gone to pay off AIG ’s Credit Default Swap obligations to counterparty gamblers Goldman Sachs , Citibank , JP Morgan Chase , Bank of America , the banks who believe they are ‘ too big to fail . ’
In effect , these five institutions today believe they are so large that they can dictate the policy of the Federal Government .
Some have called it a bankers ’ coup d’etat .
It definitely is not healthy .
This is Geithner ’s and Wall Street ’s Dirty Little Secret that they desperately try to hide because it would focus voter attention on real solutions .
The Federal Government has long had laws in place to deal with insolvent banks .
The FDIC places the bank into receivership , its assets and liabilities are sorted out by independent audit .
The irresponsible management is purged , stockholders lose and the purged bank is eventually split into smaller units and when healthy , sold to the public .
The power of the five mega banks to blackmail the entire nation would thereby be cut down to size .
Ooohh .
Uh Huh ?
This is what Wall Street and Geithner are frantically trying to prevent .
The problem is concentrated in these five large banks .
The financial cancer must be isolated and contained by Federal agency in order for the host , the real economy , to return to healthy function .
This is what must be put into bankruptcy receivership , or nationalization .
Every hour the Obama Administration delays that , and refuses to demand full independent government audit of the true solvency or insolvency of these five or so banks , inevitably costs to the US and to the world economy will snowball as derivatives losses explode .
That is pre-programmed as worsening economic recession mean corporate bankruptcies are rising , home mortgage defaults are exploding , unemployment is shooting up .
This is a situation that is deliberately being allowed to run out of ( responsible Government ) control by Treasury Secretary Geithner , Summers and ultimately the President , whether or not he has taken the time to grasp what is at stake .
Once the five problem banks have been put into isolation by the FDIC and the Treasury , the Administration must introduce legislation to immediately repeal the Larry Summers bank deregulation including restore Glass - Steagall and repeal the Commodity Futures Modernization
Act of 2000 that allowed the present criminal abuse of the banking trust .
Then serious financial reform can begin to be discussed , starting with steps to ‘ federalize ’ the Federal Reserve and take the power of money out of the hands of private bankers such as JP Morgan Chase , Citibank or Goldman Sachs .

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
Something else to add to President Obama 's ever - expanding to - do list : regulating the credit card industry .
The president and his chief economic adviser , Larry Summers will meet tomorrow with executives from some of the top credit card issuers .
The administration has vowed to crack down on high interest rates and predatory lending practices it says contributed to the economic crisis .
New measure would call for clearer labels on credit card offers - similar to food nutrition information labels .
Many lenders have raised credit card interest rates significantly as the recession drags on ; which means defaults and delinquencies have shot up .
Consumer groups are especially critical of companies who raised rates on existing card holders while they were getting federal bailout money .
Meanwhile the House Financial Services Committee is looking at a bill that would call for clearer labels on credit card offers - almost like what 's used for food .
In the Senate , Chris Dodd is calling for stricter federal oversight that would say when lenders can raise rates and would prevent rate hikes in certain instances .
The Federal Reserve passed new rules that limit some credit card rate increases this winter , but they wo n't go into effect until July 2010 .
It 's no surprise that the banking industry is pushing back ; they want the White House and Congress to wait until the Fed 's new rules go into effect before taking any other action .
And that 's more than a year away .
Lobbyists for the credit card industry argue that if the measures are too tough they could end up restricting the flow of credit to consumers and blocking the economic recovery .
Here ’s my question to you :
How would you regulate the credit card industry ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Marin writes :
The credit card companies are hurting the consumer rather than helping .
The interest rates skyrocketed for everyone , even for long - term customers like me who have always paid on time .
The only option they have left me with is that I have stopped using my cards .
Rich from San Clemente , California writes :
Jack ,
There 's way too much fine print in all the offers .
Take the ability to arbitrarily raise rates away from the companies .
The card balance is a " loan " and should be dealt with as such : a fixed - rate loan with a definite term .
Or , the government should open a national citizens ’ bank and issue national credit cards that have fixed low rates and no arbitrary adjustments .
Gareth writes :
Only in America would you have contracts where one party can alter the terms to suit themselves at any time for any reason .
They all operate out of South Dakota which legalizes usury , a den of thieves .
Get a rope !
Richard from Colorado writes :
Encourage people to go to the nearest pair of scissors and destroy all of their cards and pay cash for everything except their home and possibly a car .
This is only common sense .
Diana from Monroe , Michigan writes :
Make the banks that issue the credit cards pay the same rate of interest on customer 's savings accounts that they collect on that customer 's credit card .
Mark from Voorhees , New Jersey writes :
I would reinstitute the usury laws .
What happened to them , anyway ?
They seem to have disappeared during the Bush administration .
I just borrowed ten grand from the mob because their rates were cheaper than my credit card company .
DAYTON , Nev. – Gabriel Hurles ' sixth birthday party was n't a surprise , but his present sure was .
The kindergartner was so engrossed in the cupcakes his mother brought to his class on Wednesday that he did n't notice the enormous wrapped box off to the side .
" That 's one big , giant present , " a 6 - year - old classmate told him .
" See what you got , Gabriel . "
Gabriel peeled back the wrapping paper to find the surprise of his young life — his father , an Army mechanic back in Nevada on leave from his second tour in Iraq .
" It 's my dad ! " he announced to his classmates at Sutro Elementary School in Dayton , a few miles northeast of Carson City .
" Hi , Daddy . "
Army Spc. Casey Hurles , 23 , had n't seen his son since he left in June .
When he learned his leave would coincide with his son's birthday , he hatched a plan to hide out in the 4 - foot - tall box .
" It was such a rush of emotion , " said Hurles , who said he got butterflies in his stomach while waiting in the box .
After Hurles sat down and ate a cupcake with the birthday boy , teacher Dawn VanSickle presented him with a banner from the class that read , " Welcome Home .
Thank you for your service . "
VanSickle said she was happy to arrange the reunion in her classroom .
" One of the first things ( Gabriel ) shared about himself was that his dad was in Iraq and that he was waiting for his dad to come home , " she said .
" He talks about his dad all the time . "
Hurles , who joined the Army four years ago , is a mechanic in the 1st Cavalry Division stationed at Fort Hood , Texas .
He completed one tour in Iraq and is seven months into his second tour .
He expects to finish sometime this summer .
Gabriel said he looks forward to playing with his dad over the next two weeks but understands why he has to leave again .
" He has to work , " Gabriel said .
" He works in the war . "

" We tend to favour bright uniforms so our staff can be easily identified , since a key part of their job is customer service – advising drivers how to park legally , giving directions and so on – and we find that bright uniforms make them easier to find by members of the public who need our help , " he said .
The Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , was warned nine months ago about MI5's alleged campaign of blackmail and intimidation against a group of young Muslim men , The Independent has learnt .
Veteran Labour MP
Frank Dobson wrote to Ms Smith in September about concerns raised by a north London community leader who claimed six youth workers had endured an 18 - month campaign of threats and coercion in an attempt to recruit them as informants on their friends and neighbours .
When they refused to co-operate , the men were targeted by the Security Service who threatened to set them up as terror suspects , Mr Dobson was told .
The allegations have provoked outrage among Muslim leaders who say MI5's alleged actions have not only damaged relations with ethnic - minority communities but harmed efforts to gather intelligence on real terror suspects .
Mr Dobson was contacted by Sharhabeel Lone , chairman of the Kentish Town Community Centre , on 29 August last year , who told the former cabinet minister of the alleged harassment and urged him to intervene .
The MP for Holborn and St Pancras then wrote to Mr Lone on 3 September saying he had raised the men's complaints with the Home Secretary .
But Ms Smith is understood to have written back , declining to intervene .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Last night MPs and Muslim leaders demanded to know whether the Home Secretary had sanctioned the alleged blackmail and harassment .
Edward Davey , foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , said : " These disturbing allegations have echoes of the kinds of dark deals that were allegedly put to British inmates at Guantanamo Bay .
Recent allegations over Britain 's complicity in abduction and torture have already undermined community confidence in the security services . "
He added : " Good intelligence is vital to our security , but it is totally counter - productive to risk alienating communities through heavy - handed recruitment and intelligence - gathering tactics .
Both the Foreign Office and the Home Office need to clarify the extent to which they have sanctioned policies that would condone these tactics . "
In allegations published in yesterday 's Independent three of the men claim they were detained at foreign airports on the orders of MI5 after leaving Britain on family holidays .
After they were sent back to the UK , they were interviewed by MI5 officers who , they say , falsely accused them of links to Islamic extremism .
On each occasion the agents said they would lift the travel restrictions and threat of detention in return for their co-operation .
When the men refused some of them received what they say were intimidating phone - calls and threats .
Two other Muslim men say they were approached last year by MI5 at their homes after police officers posed as postmen .
Each of the five men , aged between 19 to 25 , were warned that if they did not help the security services they would be considered terror suspects .
A sixth man was held by MI5 for three hours after returning from honeymoon in Saudi Arabia .
He claims he was threatened with travel restrictions if he tried to leave the country .
Inayat Bunglawala , spokesperson for the Muslim Council of Britain , said : " We fully understand that the security services have the very grave responsibility of trying to protect all of us from terrorism .
We believe that the most effective way forward is for them to work in co-operation with Muslim communities around the country .
Utilising the methods of coercion or issuing veiled threats is not only unethical but will be entirely counterproductive . "
A spokesman for the Muslim Public Affairs Committee said : " MI5 's entrapment methods are completely counter - productive .
We are constantly trying to sell the idea of liberal democracy to young Muslims but when the security services act like this , it makes our job very difficult .
Either MI5 are out of control or the Government has sanctioned this kind of behaviour .
Either way we would like a full inquiry to uncover whether this sort of behaviour is being backed by the Government . "
A spokeswoman for the Home Office confirmed that Jacqui Smith had responded to Mr Dobson 's letter but declined to say what she had written as this was confidential .
LONDON 
The chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland , whose record loss and near collapse made it a symbol of the financial crisis in Britain , called for an end to “ public flogging ” for past mistakes .
“ We should bring to an end the public flogging and focus on the good and enduring people and businesses of R.B.S. and allow them to earn our way back to success , ” the chairman , Philip Hampton , said Friday in a speech to shareholders at the annual meeting in Scotland .
“ We have suffered a major financial hit and continued collateral damage from public criticism will compound the problem , not resolve it . ”
Bank managers and especially the former chief executive , Fred Goodwin , attracted public anger for the ill - timed acquisition of the Dutch lender ABN Amro at the top of the market .
That purchase reduced R.B.S. ’s share price drastically and forced it to surrender a majority stake to the government .

When I met TJ in the fall of 2005 , she had a shocker for me .
She did n’t just work in a Porta - Potty .
She lived in one .

Look , she showed me one night -- here were her clothes , her fine hats , her personal effects .
Home sweet home .
The column caused no small amount of shame and discomfort at City Hall , and the Porta - Potties , which also served as drug dens , were trucked away .
Every time I saw or heard from LAPD Officer Deon Joseph , I asked if he ever bumped into TJ , which stood for “ Thick and Juicy . ”
He said he ’d seen her once or twice and tried getting her into some housing , but he ’d lost track of her .
Then , a couple of weeks ago , I got an excited e-mail from Joseph .
“ Hey Steve .
Guess who I ran into .
TJ. Correction .
Mrs. Carole Speaks .
She looked fantastic , and has been clean for 1 1/ 2 years . . .
I ’m so proud of her . ”

When I called , TJ said she ’d be happy to meet , but wanted me to know that TJ no longer exists .
She was Carole Lynn Speaks , a church - going believer , and she was engaged but not yet married .
Speaks was waiting for me in front of her house in Compton , and she was wearing a smile to light all of Carson and points south as she leaped to her feet to greet me .
Inside her spotless , nicely furnished living room , she could barely contain herself as she showed off the sofa , entertainment center and other chic furnishings .
This is who she always was , she told me .
Skid row was a wrong turn followed by a tumble down a dark hole .
“ I ’m not of that , ” she said of what she now calls the skid row “ dating ” game .
“ I was a corporate executive assistant for years .
I typed 101 words a minute . ”

Then why did she end up dating ?
To pay for the medication , she said .
Crack cocaine to be specific , which she used to dull bad memories of being beaten as a child and later by a lover .
Connecticut was home , but she moved to Ohio to start over and fell in love with a man and followed him to Los Angeles .
This guy did n’t beat her , but he broke her , nonetheless , walking out without so much as a goodbye .
Speaks says she lined up a job as an accounting assistant , but the salary would n’t have paid enough for her painkillers .
“ It was faster money , ” she said of her life on skid row .
She said she made as much as several hundred dollars a day , most of it going up in smoke .

“ Most of those men , all they wanted was talk , ” she said , claiming that a procession of lost and lonely souls paid their money as much for her gift of gab as for her other services .
“ Talk , ” she urged her girls .
Save your body and “ use your brain . ”
After the Porta - Potties were trucked away , Speaks moved down the block and then pushed farther east to Gladys Street , turning tricks in a tent she pitched on the sidewalk .
Late in December 2006 , an old friend named Vincent came by after a stretch in the joint on a drug conviction .
Something sparked when they talked , but Speaks was still a servant to the pipe .
Early in 2007 she was caught copping some crack near Gladys Park and got a free ride to County Jail for three months .
Vincent , who was with her at the time but claimed innocence , was sent away for another year .
Their jail mail to each other was filled with hearts and kisses .
Speaks kept writing after being rescued from lockup by a mental health agency when a jailhouse evaluation determined that she had a previously undiagnosed condition -- bipolar disorder .

She was still in therapy at the mental health center , getting treatment for her addiction and staying in housing provided by them when Vincent was sprung and came for her last month .
A house owned by his father was now vacant in Compton , and so the happy couple moved in together .
She used to be a singer , she said , and maybe she ’ll give that a try again once they settle into the house .
“ Steve , I ’ve never been in love like this before , ” she told me .
“ I thought I was , but it was nothing like this . ”
I was a little concerned that Speaks might be setting herself up for another fall if the relationship did n’t work out .
She shook that off .
Impossible .

When her fiance came home , they sat together on the couch , holding hands .
Skid row is n’t for either of them any more , said Vincent , who told me he ended up there to self - medicate after losing two siblings at an early age .
Speaks ran to the bedroom when Vincent went out to the frontyard , and she returned with a fat stack of love letters she had sent him in prison , with red lipstick kisses on the envelopes .
“ Baby , you and your letters of love light up my day , ” she said , reading one of them .
“ I love the things you say , and no one else has ever said such things to me . ”
He ’s her life now , she said .
No more drugs and “ dating . ”
Advertisement
She ’s glad she had a wake - up call .
“ Steve , your article never left my mind , ” she said .
“ It opened my eyes to how I was living as opposed to how I grew up .
Between Vincent and that article , I said I just could n’t do it anymore . . .
The Porta - Potties , that was the bottom of the barrel for me .
I was the best - dressed woman out there , but that was the bottom . ”
Crack will make you do things you never would have imagined , she said .
And there ’s no rehab program that will clean you until you decide you ’re ready .
But what if her circumstances change ?
Advertisement
“ Addiction is a sneaky mug , ” she admitted .
“ Maybe when Vincent ’s not here and there ’s a bowl of money , I ’ll be tempted .
But I ’m not giving this up .
It ’s something I ’ve longed for .
He treats me like a queen .
. . .
It was n’t about the drugs .
I needed somebody . ”
It may be more complicated than that , and how she treats herself is probably more important than how someone else treats her .
But I could n’t help rooting for her .
She jumped off the sofa and asked me to follow .
“ Let me show you this , ” the former TJ said , leading me on a tour of the kitchen , the office , the bedroom and the backyard .
“ This is a huge yard .
I want to put a bench all the way around that tree .
Would n’t that be nice , Steve ?
I love it .
I love this house . ”

President Obama reportedly gave an iPod , loaded with 40 show tunes , to England 's Queen Elizabeth II as a gift .
Did he violate the law when he did so ?
You know your copyright laws are broken when there is no easy answer to this question .
Traditionally , it has been the job of the " first sale " doctrine to enable gift giving -- that 's the provision of copyright law that entitles the owner of a CD , book , or other copyrighted work , to give it away ( or resell it , for that matter ) , notwithstanding the copyright owner 's exclusive right of distribution .
In the digital era , however , first sale has been under siege , with copyright owners ( and even the Copyright Office ) arguing that it has no place in a world where " ownership " has been replaced by " licenses " and hand - to - hand exchanges have been replaced by computer - mediated exchanges that necessarily make copies .
But it 's precisely because first sale is central to everyday activities like giving an iPod to a friend , selling a used CD on eBay , or borrowing a DVD from a library , that EFF and others have been fighting for it in case after case .
So , how does President Obama fare in this ?
It 's nearly impossible to figure out .
If he 'd simply purchased a " greatest hits " CD of show tunes and given it to the Queen , the first sale doctrine would have taken care of it .
But because digital technology is involved here , suddenly it 's a legal quagmire .
( And , for the remainder of this discussion , I am going to set aside the Presidential immunity issues and the UK copyright law issues , which make it even more of a quagmire . )
First , let 's imagine that the President ( or his staff ) bought the 40 show tunes from the iTunes music store .
Do you " own " the music that you buy from iTunes ?
The nearly 9,000 words of legalese to which you agree before buying do n't answer that question ( an oversight ?
I doubt it ) .
Copyright owners have consistently argued in court that many digital products ( even physical " promo " CDs ! ) are " licensed , " not " owned , " and therefore you 're not entitled to resell them or give them away .
( And the Amazon MP3 Store terms of service are even worse for consumers than iTunes -- those terms specifically purport to strip you of " ownership " and forbid any " redistribution . " )
Second , even if the first sale doctrine applies to iTunes downloads , what about the additional copies made on the iPod ?
iTunes does not download directly to an iPod .
So President Obama 's staff made an additional copy onto the Queen 's intended iPod .
How are those copies excused ?
The iTunes terms of service say that downloads are " only for personal , noncommercial use . "
Is giving a copy to a head of state a " personal " use ?
Seems more like a " diplomatic use , " does n't it ?
So copyright owners could argue that the copy on the iPod was not authorized , because it was beyond the scope of the iTunes " license . "
And according to the typical rightsholder argument , any use beyond the scope of the " license " is a copyright infringement .
Perhaps it 's a fair use ?
I 'd certainly take that view .
But does it matter here whether President Obama 's staffer first deleted the copy that is still on her computer ?
Should that matter ?
( It does not matter for first sale purposes , which is one reason why the first sale doctrine answers questions so much more clearly . )
Third , what about a breach of contract ?
As I mentioned above , some might argue that this " use " of iTunes downloads breaches the " personal use " limitation in the agreement .
And if it is a breach of the iTunes contract , can the copyright owners sue President Obama as " third party beneficiaries " of the iTunes contract ?
It 's not clear .
( In the Amazon terms of service , copyright owners are specifically made third party beneficiaries , which appears to be an attempt to clear a path for record labels to sue Amazon customers for breaches of the contract . )
And all of this even before you start asking what happens when the Queen connects her new iPod to her computer , thereby making even more copies ( the UK , after all , lacks a fair use doctrine ) ...
UPDATE : Prof. Michael Froomkin points out that the Queen enjoys sovereign immunity under UK law because she is , well , the sovereign .
Of course , no one thinks that copyright owners are going to send lawyers after either President Obama or the Queen over this .
But none of us should want a world where even our leaders -- much less the rest of us -- ca n't figure out how copyright law operates in their daily lives .
Sunday ?
Sunday !
That ’s the day The Detroit Free Press chose to tell the world that GM ’s recent accounts contain a time bomb : the revelation that the company raided — sorry , “ borrowed from ” — its employee pension fund to buy out United Auto Workers employees and pay into their health care fund .
Even though we ’ve become used to gigantic numbers , the sums involved are staggering .
“ Details are emerging about how General Motors Corp . ’s U.S. pension funds went from a $ 20 - billion surplus at the end of 2007 to a $ 12.4 - billion deficit 12 months later . ”
I make that a $ 32.4 - billion swing .
It ’s also approximately $ 11.4 billion more than GM ’s CFO estimated its pension deficit , as declared in The General ’s December pre-bailout report .
The GM pension funds ’ erosion last year included $ 11.3 billion in value because of investment losses ; $ 2.9 billion for hourly and salaried attrition programs , and another $ 8.7 billion for increases in benefit payments as part of changes to retiree health care and a deal regarding Delphi ’s bankruptcy . . .
GM said it used $ 2.3 billion from the hourly pension fund to pay for buyouts in its UAW special attrition program , which encouraged thousands of workers to voluntarily leave the company as a cost - cutting move .
The company also used $ 2.7 billion for the retiree health care trust — called a VEBA , or voluntary employee beneficiary association .
GM spent another $ 2.3 billion for Delphi ’s hourly pension program .
Also , as part of GM ’s decision to cut company health care benefits for salaried retirees 65 or older , it increased pension benefits to retirees at a cost of $ 3.7 billion .
The company spent another $ 600 million on white - collar retirement incentives .
The rest of the pension funds ’ declines were attributed to service and interest costs , as well as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions ( $ 2.2 billion because people are living longer than expected ) .
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. raised the red flag on GM ’s pension funding last fall .
And for good reason .
And now union members ( 650 k are “ covered ” by the fund ) are scared shitless .
“ They robbed it blind to pay off the people to get them to leave , ” said Paul Heller , a GM salaried retiree from Washington , Mich .
“ I ’ve got a retiree club that ’s absolutely sick about it . ”
A new study finds that long - term exposure to ozone is linked to a higher risk of death from respiratory causes .
This map shows average ozone concentrations for the years 1977 - 2000 in the 96 metropolitan regions included in the study .

Long - term exposure to ground - level ozone , a major component of smog , is associated with an increased risk of death from respiratory ailments , according to a new nationwide study led by a researcher at the University of California , Berkeley .
The study , to be published in the March 12 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , analyzed the risk of death for both ozone and fine particulate matter , two of the most prevalent components of air pollution .
The study followed nearly 450,000 people for two decades and covered 96 metropolitan regions in the United States .
The researchers found that people living in areas with the highest concentrations of ozone , such as the Los Angeles metropolitan area and California 's Central Valley , had a 25 to 30 percent greater annual risk of dying from respiratory diseases compared with people from regions with the lowest levels of the pollutant .
Those locations included the Great Plains area and regions near San Francisco and Seattle .
" This is the first time we 've been able to connect chronic exposure to ozone , one of the most widespread pollutants in the world , with the risk of death , arguably the most important outcome in health impact studies used to justify air quality regulations , " said study lead author Michael Jerrett , UC Berkeley associate professor of environmental health sciences .
" Previous research has connected short - term or acute ozone exposure to impaired lung function , aggravated asthma symptoms , increased emergency room visits and hospitalizations , but the impact of long - term exposure to ozone on mortality had not been pinned down until now . "
The study found that for every 10 parts - per-billion ( ppb ) increase in ozone level , there is a 4 percent increase in risk of death from respiratory causes , primarily pneumonia and chronic pulmonary obstructive pulmonary disease .
" World Health Organization data indicate that about 240,000 people die each year from respiratory causes in the United States , " said Jerrett .
" Even a 4 percent increase can translate into thousands of excess deaths each year .
Globally , some 7.7 million people die from respiratory causes , so worldwide the impact of ozone pollution could be very large . "
The findings come a year after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) strengthened its National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground - level ozone from an annual average of 80 ppb to 75 ppb to reflect growing evidence of the harmful health effects of ozone .
A group of leading scientists appointed to advise the EPA had actually recommended stricter health standards for ozone levels - from 60 to 70 ppb .
A month after the EPA released its new standards , a National Research Council report concluded that premature deaths related to ozone exposure of less than 24 hours are more likely among those with pre-existing diseases .
The report called for more research on the link between mortality and ozone exposure over a period of weeks and years .
Ozone - gas made up of three oxygen atoms - forms a protective layer from the sun 's ultraviolet radiation when located in the Earth 's upper atmosphere .
However , that same gas is toxic at ground level where it can be breathed by humans .
Ground level ozone is formed through a complex chemical reaction in sunlight between nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) , commonly spewed from vehicle exhaust , and industrial factory emissions .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change considers ground - level ozone , along with carbon dioxide and methane , to be one of the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth 's atmosphere .
" Ozone levels outdoors are not always highly correlated to ozone levels indoors , making it difficult to fully evaluate associations between ozone and health outcomes using ambient site monitors , " said study co-author C. Arden Pope III , professor of economics at Brigham Young University .
" The reality is that most of us spend the majority of our time indoors .
But this study suggests that repeated exposures to elevated ozone levels over time have cumulative effects on respiratory health . "
The new study analyzed data from 448,850 adults ages 30 and older enrolled in 1982 and 1983 in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II .
The researchers correlated the information from that study with data from EPA air pollution monitors while controlling for potentially confounding factors such as a participant 's age , race , education , occupational exposures , smoking history and diet .
The study also factored in other variables such as unemployment rates in the metropolitan and zip code area levels .
Ozone data were obtained from 1977 through 2000 between the months of April and September .
Those months were chosen because ozone levels are typically higher when it's warmer and because insufficient data was available during the cooler months .
Researchers included EPA measurements of fine particulate matter - particles equal to or smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter and typically found in smoke and haze - when they became available in 1999 and 2000 .
Because fine particle levels had already been linked to increased risk of premature death in previous studies , the researchers included them in the analysis to distinguish the effects of the two pollutants .
In an 18 - year follow - up period , 48,884 of the people in the study died from cardiovascular causes such as heart disease and strokes , and 9,891 died from respiratory causes .
As has been observed in previous studies , the researchers found that fine particulate matter was linked to an increased risk of death from cardiovascular causes when analyzed alone and with ozone .
The new finding was that the effects of ozone remained strongly linked to risk of death from respiratory problems , even after fine particle pollution was taken into account .
Not surprisingly , highly populated regions such as the Los Angeles , Riverside and Houston areas , where the climate is sunny for much of the year and the air mass is relatively stable , had the highest average concentrations of ozone , ranging from 62.5 to 104 ppb .
The regions with the lowest ozone levels had average concentrations of 33.3 to 53.1 ppb .
" Places like the Pacific Northwest and the Minneapolis St. Paul region are cooler and see more rain in the summer , which keeps the ozone levels in check , " said Jerrett .
" Similarly , the San Francisco Bay Area 's infamous summertime fog blocks the sun and helps protect the region from high ozone levels . "
Because ozone formation depends on a complex interaction of multiple factors , it is challenging to regulate , the study authors said .
" Our study for the first time presents evidence suggesting that long - term exposure to ozone and fine particle pollution have separate , independent effects on mortality , and that they seem to impact different parts of the body , " said Jerrett .
" With this research , we now know that controlling ozone is not only beneficial for mitigating global warming , but that it could also have near - term benefits in the reduction of deaths from respiratory causes . "

I recently posted about how cool it was on the Mythbusters when Adam and Jamie slammed a rocket sled into a car at 1000 km / hr .
Now take that collision and multiply it by a million billion gazillion .
What you get is this :
Holy Haleakala .
That 's quite an image .
It 's of an object 5.4 billion light years away called MACSJ0717.5+3745 , which is really just a catalog number and a coordinate on the sky , so it 's not nearly as awesome sounding as what it is : a massive collision between four separate galaxy clusters !
Almost all galaxies reside in a group of some sort .
The Milky Way is part of the local group , a few dozen galaxies , mostly dinky ones , of which we 're actually the largest .
And our little enclave is in the suburbs of the Virgo cluster , a much larger aggregation of hundreds of galaxies .
These clusters move around , and sometimes they collide ( check out the Bullet Cluster , for example , for a fantastic example of this kind of collision , and how it gave us proof positive of the existence of dark matter ) .
But four clusters , colliding all at the same time ?
Wow !
The image is a composite of Hubble ( visible light image ) and Chandra ( which sees high - energy X - rays ) data .
So what are we looking at ?
First off , almost everything you see in that image is a galaxy ( grab the big or the ginormous versions of the image for some fun ) .
Foreground stars are the dots with the four spikes going through them ( that 's an artifact of the camera used by Hubble , and is most obvious in point sources , and almost non-existent in extended objects like galaxies ) .
So right away you get an idea of what a cluster of galaxies is like ... and what a disaster a collision between four of them can be !
The clusters are all moving through space at incredibly high speed , many dozens of kilometers per second .
In a vast collision like this one , the galaxies may physically smack into one another , though I suspect that 's not as common as you might think ; there is still way more empty space in a cluster than there are galaxies .
Still , the gas between galaxies is spread out over hundreds of thousands or even millions of light years , well beyond the galaxies themselves .
So this intercluster gas will indeed collide at high speed , causing it to heat up to millions of degrees and glow in X - rays .
In the image , that 's shown as the diffuse material colored purple - red ( lowest energy gas ) to blue ( highest energy or hottest gas ) .
In fact , by mapping the hottest parts of the gas -- where the light is brightest and bluest -- and comparing that to the positions of the galaxies , astronomers were able to see that there are four distinct clusters in this train wreck .
Also , in the collisions the galaxies just keep moving , while the gas slows down as it collides , so comparing the positions of the gas and galaxies the direction of the clusters was found as well .
The speed can be found by taking spectra of the galaxies , which was done using the giant Keck 10 - meter telescope in Hawaii .
That also helps track which galaxy belongs to which cluster , assuming the galaxies in a given cluster are moving at roughly the same speed .
All in all , I can see that this cluster will keep astronomers busy for a long , long time .
Studying it will tell us a lot about how intergalactic gas behaves , possibly about the nature of dark matter ( which can not be seen in this image -- hello , it 's dark matter -- but certainly profoundly affects the way this system behaves ) , and also just plain old what happens when a few hundred galaxies slam into each other across the depths of space .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama ’s administration will organize healthcare forums across the United States in the coming weeks to involve Americans and local policy makers in a push for reform , the White House said on Friday .
Obama vowed on Thursday to break the political stalemate that has blocked past efforts and pass a comprehensive plan to cut healthcare costs and expand insurance coverage this year .
The regional meetings , which will take place in California , Iowa , Michigan , North Carolina and Vermont in March and early April , are meant to gather ideas from local communities about how to fix the system .
“ The forums will bring together diverse groups of people all over the country who have a stake in reforming our health care system and ask them to put forward their best ideas about how we bring down costs and expand coverage for American families , ” Obama said in a statement .
“ The time for reform is now and these regional forums are some of the key first steps toward breaking the stalemate we have been stuck in for far too long . ”
The events will be hosted by the participating states ’ governors and will include doctors , elected officials from the Democratic and Republican parties , and “ everyday ” citizens , the White House said .
World oil production peaked in 2008 at 81.73 million barrels / day ( mbd ) shown in the chart below .
This oil definition includes crude oil , lease condensate , oil sands and natural gas plant liquids .
If natural gas plant liquids are excluded , then the production peak remains in 2008 but at 73.79 mbd .
However , if oil sands are also excluded then crude oil and lease condensate production peaked in 2005 at 72.75 mbd .
As everyone knows , there is never a post on The Oil Drum that the entire staff agrees on .
Nonetheless ,
Tony bases his findings on solid research , and a staff survey shows that most agree with a 2008 peak .
A post discussing whether an alternate scenario with a second later peak might be feasible is planned for later .
World Oil Production
Both natural gas plant liquids and Canada oil sands production are expected to grow over the near term .
Much of the growth of natural gas plant liquids comes from OPEC .
Non OPEC oil production peaked in 2004 and is forecast to decline at a faster rate in 2009 and beyond due mainly to big declines from Russia , Norway , the UK and Mexico .
OPEC has the ability to increase production later this year and in early 2010 .
Although key OPEC producer Saudi Arabia peaked in 2005 , it probably has sustainable annual surplus capacity of 1 mbd .
Iraq and possibly Nigeria also have potential to increase production but these countries continue to have serious internal conflicts .
By the time 2011 arrives , OPEC will not have the ability to offset cumulative non OPEC declines and world oil production is forecast to stay below its 2008 peak .
The forecast assumes that prices will rise , causing OPEC to produce more oil which explains why the 2010 forecast is slightly greater than that in 2009 .
If world oil demand drops further , OPEC might not increase production causing 2010 production to be lower than 2009 .
It is also assumed that OPEC complies with 85 % of cumulative announced cuts of 4.2 mbd .
This compliance is assumed from March to June of 2009 .
At the March 15 OPEC meeting , no additional cuts were announced , there was 80 % compliance to cumulative cuts in February and full compliance remains the target by May which would reduce OPEC - 11 production by another 0.8 mbd .
My forecasting method aggregates forecasts from all oil producing countries , taking into account forecast field production profiles from existing and new oil projects .
Colin Campbell uses a similar forecasting method but does not directly take into account the timing of new oil projects .
Nevertheless , as peak oil has passed , new oil projects can only serve to slow the production decline rate .
Consequently , Campbell has also stated that peak oil was in 2008 , excluding bio-fuels .
Another method used to estimate the peak production year is to use this oil project database to derive totals of future annual supply additions .
As these additions are insufficient to offset future existing field decline , this indicates that oil production peaked in 2008 , excluding bio-fuels .
Another similar forecast which incorporates forecast production profiles from giant oil fields is Fredrik Robelius ' worst case scenario from his 2007 thesis .
He used actual production data to 2005 and said that " the worst case scenario peaks at just above 83 mbd in 2008 " , excluding bio -fuels .
This scenario has closely tracked actual data since 2005 and assumes a 7 % annual decline rate for production from existing non giant oil fields as at the end of 2005 , delays of many large projects and low recoverable oil reserves for some giant oil fields .
There are just over 500 giant oil fields in the world , each with at least 500 million barrels recoverable oil .
More support is provided for his worst case scenario as Robelius ' original forecast for deepwater production was for a peak of almost 9 mbd in 2012 .
Now it appears that deepwater production entered a 7 mbd peak plateau in 2008 due partly to decline rates as high as 20 % per year from mature deepwater oil fields .
Peak oil production often occurs when about half of the initial recoverable oil reserves are produced .
In the US , production from the lower 48 states peaked in 1970 when 52 % of the oil reserves were produced .
In this forecast of crude and condensate , the peak production occurred in 2005 which coincidentally happened when 52 % of world crude and condensate reserves were produced .
If Campbell 's world reserves estimates are used then 49 % of world oil reserves would have been produced in 2005 .
The discovery of future oil reserves will decrease these percentages and will also help to slow the production decline rate .
World Liquids Production
The definition of oil used by the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) also includes bio-fuels , processing gains and other liquids derived from natural gas and coal .
Although bio-fuels production has been growing exponentially , world liquids production has probably passed peak in 2008 at 85.47 mbd as shown below .
In 2008 , US ethanol production was 0.6 mbd , Brazilian ethanol production was 0.4 mbd , and bio-fuels production outside the US and Brazil was 0.5 mbd .
Processing gains arise at refineries when crude oil is processed into products which have a lower density causing an increase in volume when measured in barrels .
Processing gains are proportional to the volume of the crude oil inputs .
In 2008 , the IEA estimated that processing gains were 2.2 mbd , excluding gains from China and non-OECD Europe .
As crude oil and condensate peaked in 2005 , it is expected that future contributions from processing gains will decrease .
Production from gas to liquids ( GTL ) and coal to liquids ( CTL ) has been increasing but from a very small base and remains negligible .
GTL is about 0.10 mbd in 2009 and is expected to increase to 0.27 mbd by the end of 2012 .
CTL is about 0.20 mbd in 2009 and should increase only marginally by the end of 2012 .
Liquids production from GTL and CTL has significant energy losses and high carbon dioxide emissions implying that it is probably preferable to directly burn the gas and coal to produce electricity .
As production from bio-fuels , oil sands and natural gas plant liquids increase there is a slight chance that world liquids production in 2010 might be close to its 2008 peak .
However , given the suspension of many crude oil and oil sands projects , it is likely that future world liquids production will stay below its 2008 peak and that the world urgently needs to adopt policies to reduce consumption and focus on alternative energy sources .
In contrast , the IEA WEO 2008 forecasts that total liquids production will increase steadily to 106.4 mbd in 2030 , excluding bio-fuels .
Similarly , the ExxonMobil Energy Outlook 2008 forecasts total liquids to be 108 mbd by 2030 , including bio-fuels .
Even these two forecasts have now been cast in doubt as Cambridge Energy Research Associates ( CERA ) have stated this month that , due mainly to the credit crisis and low oil prices causing significant oil project delays , world liquids production could be reduced by almost 8 mbd in five years .
In five years , the production forecasts of both IEA and ExxonMobil indicate 93 mbd , including bio-fuels .
Consequently , both of these forecasts are now revised down to 85 mbd in five years , adjusted for CERA 's supply reduction , which is less than the 2008 peak .
As the production forecasts by the IEA and ExxonMobil are primarily demand derived forecasts , rather than supply based , it is only a matter of time until the IEA and ExxonMobil , as well as CERA , admit that world liquids production peaked in 2008 .
OPEC also uses a demand derived forecast which predicted total liquids production of 117.6 mbd in 2030 in their World Oil Outlook 2007 which stated the underlying logic on page 24 :
A central tenet of the OPEC long - term supply perspective assessment is that resources are sufficient to meet future demand .
The resource base , as defined by estimates from the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) of ultimately recoverable reserves ( URR ) , does not constitute a constraint to supplying the rising levels of oil demanded in the reference case ... so supply projections are , by definition , plausible from the resource perspective .
In other words , first , OPEC forecasts the future oil demand to 2030 based on a 3.5 % annual economic growth rate and second , assumes that future oil production will be equal to the demand because of the huge increase in the world reserve base suggested by this USGS World Petroleum Assessment 2000 report .
In Jean Laherrere 's analysis , he said that this USGS report was misleading and that the USGS claimed reserves growth was excessive .
Similarly , Colin Campbell stated in his response that it " is ironic that OPEC puts out excessive numbers to discourage western investments in renewables , energy saving etc , and the US does the same thing to try to undermine OPEC 's confidence . "

Life after Peak Oil
As oil production declines , consumption must also decline .
Consequently , action must be taken to reduce oil consumption and switch to alternative energy sources such as electricity from the wind and the sun .
This recent Oil Drum story proposes many oil conservation ideas for individuals such as moving to a walkable neighbourhood and trading in your car for one with better mileage .
The IEA has recently published some recommendations to improve energy efficiency which apply not just to individuals but also to industry .
For example , in the transport sector , the IEA is encouraging the use of fuel efficient tires and introducing mandatory fuel efficiency standards for light duty vehicles .
In addition , this IEA document , called Energy Efficiency Policy , also encourages energy efficiency by providing links to almost 30 documents containing energy efficiency policies .
One of these documents called Saving Oil in a Hurry suggests many conservation actions including increased use of public transit , car - pooling , telecommuting and speed limit restrictions .
For further information , the IEA has its own energy efficiency web page .
If there are sudden future oil supply shortages due to events such as natural disasters or acts of terrorism , the IEA has a rationing agreement which applies only to IEA OECD member countries .
As there is no global energy agency , non OECD countries such as China and India do not have to comply with the IEA rationing method .
The IEA has been encouraging China and India to become members but this is highly unlikely until the IEA 's rationing method is based upon oil consumption by person rather than by country .
The map below shows oil consumption per person in 2007 and also indicates the high consumption per person of the oil importing country USA .
In 2007 , the USA consumed twelve times more oil per person than China and in 2008 , using recent data , this ratio was just under eleven .
In 2009 , USA consumption is forecast to fall further while China 's consumption is forecast to increase , according to EIA forecasts .
This implies that the USA will consume just over ten times more oil per person than China in 2009 .

As oil production declines , countries such as India and China will probably increase focus on ensuring their own future oil supplies .
India now has the world 's largest refinery complex , ahead of Venezuela , which can process heavy sour crude oil .
China has been taking advantage of low oil prices and credit constraints to secure future oil supplies from Russia , Venezuela and Iran .
Once global economic growth returns causing increased oil demand , there is a risk that oil importing countries could act aggressively for their own self interests rather than cooperating to manage oil consumption in the context of declining world oil production .
From Dred Scott to Affirmative Action
Decreed a slave was his master 's property and African Americans were not citizens ; struck down the Missouri Compromise as unconstitutional .
A number of cases are addressed under this Supreme court decision .
Decided that the Civil Rights Act of 1875 ( the last federal civil rights legislation until the Civil Rights Act of 1957 ) was unconstitutional .
Allowed private sector segregation .
The Court stated that segregation was legal and constitutional as long as " facilities were equal " — the famous " separate but equal " segregation policy .
The Supreme Court overturned the " Scottsboro Boys ' " convictions and guaranteed counsel in state and federal courts .
The justices ruled that a court may not constitutionally enforce a " restrictive covenant " which prevents people of certain race from owning or occupying property .
Reversed Plessy v. Ferguson " separate but equal " ruling .
" [ S]egregation [ in public education ] is a denial of the equal protection of the laws . "
This case challenged the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
The court ruled that the motel had no right " to select its guests as it sees fit , free from governmental regulation . "
This decision ruled that the prohibition on interracial marriage was unconstitutional .
Sixteen states that still banned interracial marriage at the time were forced to revise their laws .
The decision stated that affirmative action was unconstitutional in cases where the affirmative action program used a quota system .
The decision upheld affirmative action 's constitutionality in education , as long it employeed a " highly individualized , holistic review of each applicant 's file " and did not consider race as a factor in a " mechanical way . "
Next week , the Department of Foreign Affairs will conduct one of the stranger consultations in recent memory .
Officials have invited roughly 70 stakeholder groups to discuss an international intellectual property treaty that the U.S. regards as a national security secret , about which the only public substantive information has come from a series of unofficial leaks .

Since then - minister David Emerson announced Canada 's participation in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement negotiations in October 2007 , the ACTA has been dogged by controversy over the near - total lack of transparency .
Early negotiations were held in secret locations with each participating country ( Canada , the U.S. , the European Union , Japan , and Australia among them ) offering nearly - identical cryptic press releases that did little more than fuel public concern .
The participating countries conducted four major negotiation sessions in 2008 and though the first session of 2009 was postponed at the request of the U.S. ( which was busy transitioning to a new president ) , the negotiations are set to resume later this spring .
When they do , negotiators will face two key challenges .
Open window , let in light
The first involves the mounting disagreement over transparency and the value of releasing the current draft to assuage public mistrust .
According to documents recently obtained under the Access to Information Act , Canadian officials favour a transparent approach that would lead to an early release of the draft text .
Marie - Lucie Morin , then the Deputy Minister of International Trade ( and now National Security Advisor to Prime Minister Stephen Harper ) , warned Minister Stockwell Day in November 2008 that " should there be no consensus among the ACTA partners to make the ACTA text public , the Department will need to develop options to address Canadian stakeholders concerns about the lack of transparency in the ACTA process . "
Further , a department spokesperson has confirmed that plans to establish an ACTA advisory group comprised of a few lobby organizations -- which was the initial intent in the summer of 2008 -- have not gone forward .
Canada is not alone in supporting an open approach .
Earlier this month , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for the public availability of all ACTA materials .
Moreover , while the U.S. government has denied requests for access to ACTA documents on national security grounds , reports indicate that it is currently reviewing its approach .
Harsh penalties , less privacy , tighter borders
Assuming that the documents are ultimately released to the public , negotiators will then face an even tougher challenge -- addressing concerns over the substance of the treaty itself .
While little has been officially confirmed , there has been a steady stream of leaks in recent weeks that paint a picture of the treaty and Canada 's role in it .
The proposed treaty has six main chapters : ( 1 ) Initial Provisions and Definitions ; ( 2 ) Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights ; ( 3 ) International Cooperation ; ( 4 ) Enforcement Practices ; ( 5 ) Institutional Arrangements ; and ( 6 ) Final Provisions .
In addition to drafting two " non-papers " that focus on institutional ACTA issues and procedural matters , Canada supplied the draft text for the Institutional Arrangements chapter at the most recent ACTA meeting in Paris in December .
Most of the discussion to date has centred on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights chapter , which is divided into four sections : civil enforcement , border measures , criminal enforcement , and the Internet .
The first three sections were addressed in meetings last year .
Although there is still considerable disagreement on the final text , leaked documents indicate that the draft includes increased damage awards , mandated information disclosure that could conflict with national privacy laws , as well as the right to block or detain goods at the border for up to one year .
Moreover , the criminal provisions go well beyond clear cases of commercial infringement by including criminal sanctions such as potential imprisonment for " significant willful copyright and trademark infringement even where there is no direct or indirect motivation of financial gain . "
Internet crackdown coming ?
Jail time for non-commercial infringement will generate considerable opposition , but it is the Internet provisions that are likely to prove to be the most controversial .
At the December meeting , the U.S. submitted a " non-paper " that discussed Internet copyright provisions , liability for Internet service providers , and legal protection for digital locks .
The paper raised questions about damage awards , liability for hosting or storing content , and the extent to which national digital lock provisions mirror the U.S. approach .
This indicates that the U.S. is feeling out its negotiating partners on the potential for an international version of its much - criticized Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
The upcoming consultation demonstrates that Canadian officials are working to address the transparency concerns .
If the leaked documents are accurate , however , public support for the treaty will require far more than just greater openness .

Rachel Maddow gives us the inside skinny :
( CNN ) --
An April Fool 's Day computer worm was launched on Wednesday but so far has not caused problems for the millions of computers that are believed to be infected .
This piece of computer code tells the worm to activate on April 1 , researchers found .
" I think joke 's on us a little bit , which you would have expected with having an April 1 date , " said Holly Stewart , threat response manager for IBM 's X - Force , a computer security service .
However , that does n't mean the much - talked - about worm , called Conficker.c , is a joke , computer security experts told CNN on Wednesday .
" By no means do I think we 're in the clear , " said Paul Henry , a forensics and security analyst for Lumension Security , based in Phoenix , Arizona .
On Wednesday , a master computer gained control of an estimated 5 million " zombie " PCs infected with the worm , experts said .
Security experts fear the author of the malicious computer program essentially could do anything with those Windows - based machines .
No attempts by the author to upload anything had been noted as of 8 p.m. ET Wednesday , according to Phil Porras , program director at nonprofit research institute SRI International .
Conficker 's motive is probably financial , security experts said .
The worm 's author could steal financial information , shut down Web pages , track keystrokes or send spam from infected computers .
" They have full administrative - level rights to run anything they want on all of the infected machines , " said Mikko Hypponen , chief research officer for F - Secure , an Internet security company .
Experts who spoke to CNN on Wednesday said it 's unlikely the program 's author will launch any sort of attack Wednesday or Thursday .
But they said some sort of issue is likely to arise in coming weeks or months .
iReport.com : What do you think of the April Fools '
Day worm ?
Experts urged computer users not to panic .
The easiest way for computer users to see if they 're infected is to try to access Windows updates from microsoft.com .
If you can reach the site and if your system updates are working , it is unlikely your computer is infected , experts said .
Further computer patches and information can be found at the Conficker Working Group 's Web site .
The worm does not affect Mac computers .
A core group of about 40 computer analysts , researchers and policy experts is working to dismantle the worm , said Jose Nazario , manager of security research at Arbor Networks , and a member of the group , which some call the Conficker Cabal .
Nazario said the group 's unprecedented efforts may be one reason an attack has n't happened .
He said the April 1 launch date for the virus may have been a ploy by the program 's author to get attention from the news media .
Or it could be a twisted joke .
" Either way , it suggests an interesting sense of humor , I guess , " he said .
The worm allows a master computer to communicate with the infected machines through Web sites the worm generates .
That function became active April 1 , experts said , and allows Conficker 's author or authors to seize control of millions of computers around the world .
Infected machines are generating 50,000 URLs per day , which allows the master to talk with them .
A previous version of Conficker created only 250 domain names per day .
" What happened now , today , is that the machines started pulling 50,000 domain names in 116 countries around the world -- so that 's the change , " said Hypponen , another member of the Conficker Cabal .
" The Conficker gang realized we could shut down 250 domain names a day , so they upped the ante , " he said .
Computer experts will continue to try to shut down the Web addresses that let Conficker 's author communicate with infected machines , he said .
Members of the Conficker Working Group have contacted security officials in all 116 affected countries and have shut down many active domain names , Hypponen said .
Stewart , of IBM , said the sophistication of the worm is unprecedented .
The situation has played out in the news media as an April Fools ' Day joke .
On a technology blog , The Washington Post mocked the hype about Conficker .
" Londoners woke up to find the iconic clock tower Big Ben stopped at precisely one minute till midnight , " Brian Krebs wrote .
" The British tabloids blared that the giant timepiece had been felled by the Conficker worm . "
The post ends with this statement : " In case you have n't guessed it yet , APRIL FOOLS !!! "
Some have compared the situation to New Year 's Day in 2000 , when many feared the world 's computers would crash but few problems were seen .
Henry said that comparison does n't fit .
" Y2 K was a one - time event , " he said .
" The update for Conficker has basically prepped it for its future .
It now has the ability to gather marching orders in a way that , to date , we have n't found a way to block . "
Little is know about Conficker 's author .
A piece of code in a version of the computer worm prevents the program from harming machines in Ukraine , leading some to believe that 's where the program 's author lives .
Others say that could be a ploy .
Many authors of previous computer viruses have come from Eastern Europe outside the jurisdiction of the European Union , experts said .
Matt Watchinski , senior director of a research team at Sourcefire , a computer security company , said the author may try to split up pieces of the infected computer network -- called a botnet -- and sell them to bidders .
The many unknowns about Conficker are what make it particularly concerning , said Patrick Morganelli , senior vice president of technology for Enigma Software .
" [ An attack ] could happen today , it could happen April 15 , it could happen two months from now , " he said .
Henry says an attack will happen sooner or later .
" They 'll wait for the hype to subside , " he said .
" They 'll wait for everyone to stop watching , and they 'll take it for a test run .
They 've put together one hell of a botnet here , and they 're going to want to exercise it . "

I was glad to see that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) revised its Green Power Partnership program requirements last week .
The Green Power Partnership is a voluntary program that encourages the use of renewable energy in the United States .
My firm was chosen to be a Green Power Partner in 2008 because we offset 100 % of our energy with Green-e certified wind power – we have continued the initiative and have gotten a number of our suppliers to join our consortium ( we work with Renewable Choice Energy ) .
Below are the notable changes :
Minimum purchase percentages have risen for an organization to be able to be included in the program Program requires purchase of new renewable energy , rather than from existing sources .
As the announcement stated , “ The Partnership ’s primary objective is to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the U.S. power sector by increasing renewable energy supply . ”
Window for making an initial green power purchase has tightened – new partners will only have 6 months ( rather than the previously - allowed 12 ) to make an initial purchase .
I like this change because companies wo n’t be able to market their involvement in the program without making the necessary investment in renewable energy … if it were up to me , I would shorten the window even further .
These are encouraging changes , as participating companies will now have to make more substantial investments in new energy sources in a shorter timeframe , helping to weed out the types of companies that join to make the minimum investment possible for the purposes of greenwashing .

INCONTROVERTIBLE proof of the existence of God this week has sent shockwaves through atheist communities around the world .
After witnessing a daring and complex laboratory experiment , Professor Dawkins exclaimed :
All my work has been exposed as a sham .
Atheism is a cruel hoax !
I appeal to evangelists and creationists everywhere to forgive me for all I have done to pooh - pooh their beliefs .
The experiment can be seen below .
Chewing hard on his lower lip , and brushing away tears , Dawkins ordered that all copies of his bestselling The God Delusion be removed from bookshelves around the world , and pulped .
Other prominent atheist writers and commentators – including Christopher Hitchens – immediately followed Dawkins example , while atheist organisations around the globe called emergency meetings to decide whether to disband immediately , or re-invent themselves as religious organisations .
Terry Sanderson , President of the National Secular Society , said :
This has come as a terrible shock , and I imagine all of our supporters are devastated too .
But I would urge everyone to keep a cool head .
The first thing we need to do is fall on our knees , pray and repent .
He added :
We have recruited a prominent and highly - experienced Repentance Advisor – Bob Hutton , an evangelist from Broadstairs in Kent – to guide us through repentance procedures which we will pass onto our members in the form of a modestly - priced kit including a DVD ( Â£ 599.99 inc VAT and pp ) .
Furthermore , we have replaced our debaptism certificate with one declaring â€ ˜Ex -Atheist – Hallalujah , I Have Found the Light of Jesus At Last !’ â„¢ ( Â£ 199.99 inc VAT and pp ) .
We are open to suggestions regarding a name change for the society .
He said that , after witnessing the miraculous pickle experiment , top NSS officials concluded that the NSS had clearly been infiltrated by “ imps , djinn and demons ” .
All necessary steps have been taken to recruit reputable exorcists to clear these hellish entities out of our organisation .
Freethinker editor Barry Duke , clutching a Bible which he frequently used “ to highlight the loopholes , atrocities , absurdities and contradictions ” it contained , was last seen banging on the doors of the Calvary Evangelical Church – 100 metres from his home in Brighton – begging to be let it .
He was far too distraught to comment .
But a member of his household , who asked not to be identified , told police that Duke had earlier tried to replicate the experiment using a large Polish pickle .
Between three to five per cent of corporate systems are infected by bots , according to a study by security firm Damballa .
The finding comes from Damballa itself and is being used to promote the need for its line of security appliances , designed to block communications between infected hosts and zombie - control servers , as an added layer of protection in addition to conventional anti-virus defences .
Self - interest aside , the Damballa study may point to shortcomings in conventional anti-virus software that are well worth considering .
A study ( pdf ) of antivirus scanning tools by Damballa over the last six months found that only 53 per cent of 200,000 malware samples were detected by conventional scanners on the day they first appeared .
Around one in seven ( 15 per cent ) of the sample were undetected even after 180 days .
Damballa reckons the average gap between malware release and detection using conventional antivirus is 54 days . ®
As is the case with most services these days , there are a growing number of niche dating websites to be found in the far - flung corners of the internet , but what you may not realise is just how niche some of them actually are .
Below are 5 of the most ' interesting ' examples of dating websites which statistics indicate you will probably never have the urge to join .
1. DiaperMates
DiaperMates is the internet 's premiere destination for all those interested in meeting people who enjoy wearing diapers and / or looking at other adults who wear them .
After you 've re-read that sentence , consider the fact that ( according to their homepage ) they currently have over 11'000 members and you 'll begin to realise that there 's a market for even the most unassuming fetishes .
2. The Ashley Madison Agency
' Life Is Short .
Have An Affair ' .
With a ' trademarked ' greeting like that on the homepage , you can't say the Ashley Madison Agency are shy when it comes the fact that their dating website caters specifically to married people with a roving eye .
There 's even the option to quickly visit a fake home renovation website at any moment by pressing a panic button .
So romantic .
3. VeggieLove.com
No doubt the picture above has already given you the wrong idea about VeggieLove.com .
It is in fact a dating website devoted to hardcore meatists ; vegetarians wishing to find love with other people who choose the sausage - free way of life .
Membership numbers are unknown .
4. Women Behind Bars
Unfortunately , Women Behind Bars is n't a site dedicated to pointing you in the direction of attractive ladies with a flair for cocktail making , however if you 're looking to start a relationship with an incarcerated female , this place could be just the ticket .
Just realise that it could take a few years until your first date , and that 's assuming she behaves .
5. Trek Passions
Trek Passions is basically a dating website dedicated to geeks and nerds , more specifically those people who live for Star Trek and could n't imagine entering into a relationship with someone who could n't recite the Wrath of Khan script .
Please Note :
The picture above in no way relates to the females who use the aforementioned website .
Obviously , if you 're looking for a normal dating website full of regular people , and one which is 100 % free , go no further .
Well , just a little bit further by by visiting the Free Dating Homepage .

Tales from the peloton , April 14 , 2009 The Tour de France ladder By Susan Westemeyer Now that the biggest one - day Classic is out of the way , it 's time to think about the season 's grandest Grand Tour : the Tour de France .
Our intrepid dozen has had another four weeks of preparation chalked off , and we 're back to see how the group of contenders we devised in February have fared .
Just as we started to count Alberto Contador out after an uneven Paris - Nice , he came back flying in the Tour of the Basque Country .
His teammate Levi Leipheimer is a close second after winning Castilla y Leon .
The Astana team has clearly demonstrated its dominance , even if one Lance Armstrong has n't shown himself yet .
Armstrong lost major ground on our ladder when he crashed out of Castilla y Leon before he could show any form .
The biggest jump up the rankings came from Alejandro Valverde , who leapt from twelfth to seventh with two stage wins in the Castilla y Leon , but will he even be allowed to race in July ?
The biggest loser was Michael Rogers , who dropped from second to eleventh after a relatively anonymous performance in the Settimana Internazionale Coppi e Bartali .
He put in a solid effort in the Basque Tour , but it was n't quite what the rest of the contenders have been able to produce .

His performance in Paris - Nice led us to wonder if his mask of invincibility had worn off .
Then , he stormed away on the queen stage of the Vuelta al País Vasco , and then capped it off with an unbelievably dominating time trial performance to seal the overall victory .
Time trials used to be his weakness , but so far this season they 've been a strength .
He smashed the Paris - Nice opening time trial , and held on to the leader 's jersey for two days .
However , the three - time Grand Tour winner lost the jersey on the third stage when a group went clear and he found himself without any teammates to help bring it back .
The Spaniard showed his usual climbing brilliance when he came back on the stage six mountaintop finish to beat the pants off everyone else , but then he finished nearly three minutes down the next day .
That inconsistency evaporated in Spain this month , and we expect by July , Contador will be ready to add a fourth Grand Tour to his name .
2 Levi Leipheimer ( 1 ) Levi Leipheimer ( Astana )

What a guy !
He breaks his sacrum in a crash at the Tour of California but rides on to take the win .
The fracture forces him out of Paris - Nice , but he recovers to win the stage two time trial in Castilla y Leon and holds the lead all the way to the finish .
That 's two stage races already this season .
With Lance Armstrong a question mark for the Giro d'Italia after he broke his collarbone during stage one of the Castilla y Leon , and Alberto Contador skipping the Italian Tour in favour of the Tour de France , Leipheimer could well be catapulted into the role of Astana 's team leader for the Giro .
Will he be able to hold on to this fantastic form until July ?
We do n't know either , but if he can , we may see a repeat of the 2007 Tour de France .
Perhaps this year , he and Contador will swap roles .
3 Damiano Cunego ( 7 ) Damiano Cunego ( Lampre - NGC )

He may not finish this high come July , but the 2004 Giro winner has hit the ground running this month after a stint of training in Tenerife .
He claimed two stages at the Coppi e Bartali as well as the overall , and went on to place sixth overall in the Basque Tour .
For him , the 10th place in the final time trial was a very good result .
There are refreshing signs of life in the rider 's Grand Tour potential .
This week he will be off to defend his title in the Amstel Gold , and this is could be a make - or - break season for Cunego .
Can he regain the form of 2004 or will he fail to live up to expectations in the Grand Tours ?
The jury is still out .
4 Denis Menchov ( 6 ) Denis Menchov ( Rabobank )
Photo © : AFP Rabobank 's monosyllabic Russian is another rider who has risen along with the Spring temperatures .
After having started the season in a modest fashion , he 's begun to show the consistency that helped him to a top five finish at last year 's Tour .
Not only did Menchov climb to the overall win at the Tour of Murcia , he then went on to Castilla y Leon , where he finished fifth .
Never one for flamboyancy , this diesel engine takes a few months to warm up and it is a promising sign that he 's done this well so early .
For this reason , he earns the number three spot for March .
5 Cadel Evans ( 8 ) Cadel Evans ( Silence - Lotto )
Photo © : Sirotti Just as Evans was about to drop from the top ten , he goes and wins the final stage of Coppi e Bartali in a tight sprint finish .
Evans finished second overall in the Italian race � behind Cunego - and also did well in various mountain stages in Paris - Nice .
He seems to be right on track for another fine performance in the Ardennes Classics , which last year presaged his strong performance in the Tour .
In País Vasco , Evans was climbing well - he even dared to go after Contador when the Spaniard attacked on stage three .
Even though he was unsuccessful at reaching him , Evans stayed within eight seconds of the overall until the final stage .
But , a lacklustre time trial dropped him off the podium and made us wonder whether or not he 'll be on track for the Tour .
Also a question mark is the Silence - Lotto team .
They have been less than spectacular this spring , and have been getting beaten down by the Belgian press .
Evans saved Lotto's blushes by picking up the team 's first win of the season , but he 'll have a hard time in the Tour if he can't find any help from his ' mates .
6 Fränk Schleck ( 5 ) Fränk Schleck ( Saxo Bank )
Photo © : Florian & Susanne Schaaf Fränk Schleck : Saxo Bank had a rash of crashes and injuries in March , and Schleck the Elder was one of the victims .
Seven stitches on his chin and a badly bruised wrist were enough to make him sit out a number of races , including the first round of Belgian races .
He bounced back to take three top three finishes in Paris - Nice to give himself second overall .
Fränk did especially well in the mountain stages , which was a good sign .
He was looking strong at the Basque Tour as well , but then dropped out in the fifth stage after getting sick .
He 's clearly saving himself for something big in the Ardennes Classics , and if his continues to show the strength he did in March , we fully expect Schleck to be a major contender come July .
7 Alejandro Valverde ( 12 ) Alejandro Valverde ( Caisse d'Epargne )

The Caisse d'Epargne rider is clearly showing form , but the axe is hanging over him as the Italian Olympic Committee has recommended a two - year ban , claiming it has definitive evidence Valverde was one of the clients of Eufemiano Fuentes of Operaci�n Puerto fame .
The CONI 's final decision is still pending .
He could be cleared , banned only in Italy , or should the UCI back the Italians , he could well drop off the ladder entirely with a suspension .
But until that happens , the scrappy Spaniard cannot be counted out for July .
His March began relatively quietly on the bike with a solid finish in the Clasica Almeria , but the Spaniard re-found his race focus at Castilla y Leon , where he took the uphill mass sprint in stage three and another sprint victory on the final stage .
Luck was n't on his side for the GP Miguel Indurain , where his team worked tirelessly only to have Valverde unable to hold on in the final 500m .
His team did not include him on the roster for the ProTour País Vasco , likely due to the open investigation , but Valverde returned for the Klasika Primavera , and this time he got it right .
If he is allowed to race the Tour , he can not be counted out for a strong performance .

Photo © : AFP Garmin - Slipstream 's great hope Christian Vande Velde moves up the ladder with a stellar stage win in Paris - Nice , but his rise on our list of contenders was slowed by a so - so overall finish in the French race and solid but not spectacular time trial in the Vuelta a Castilla y Leon .
His ride to solo victory on stage four of Paris - Nice was counterbalanced by a somewhat lacklustre opening time trial where he lost 1:15 to Contador .
He went on to lose many , many minutes and finish a third of an hour down on the winner .
In Castilla y Leon , Vande Velde worked for his teammate Dave Zabriskie , who took third overall , so we 're still a bit unclear as to what kind of form the Illinois native has at the moment .
He 's the kind of rider who prefers to fly under the radar a bit , so there is still plenty of time for him to move up a few rungs on our ladder .

A collarbone smashed to pieces and a severely hampered training schedule for the next few weeks .
Then the AFLD attacks him for allegedly misbehaving during a doping control .
He 's convinced they 'll try to stop him from racing the Tour , but Tour director Christian Prudhomme thinks otherwise .
Down and out ?
Not Super - Lance !
Just as he was back on the stationary bike only three days after surgery , we fully expect Armstrong to overcome the issue with the French anti-doping agency in time for the Tour .
He is set to race the Giro d'Italia , and just in case that little problem does n't evaporate before May , the Italian tour organisers just so happened to alter the queen stage so that it no longer crosses onto French soil .
Of course this had nothing to do with Lance - it was the snow .
Honestly .
We swear .
Will those precious weeks out of competition ruin Armstrong 's shot at an eighth Tour title ?
He was n't exactly impressive in Milano - Sanremo , but then again that race was never his forte .
Still , he takes a trip down the ladder simply due to the uncertainty of how he will come out of this setback .
But as a seven - time Tour winner , he can not be completely counted out .

The second Aussie on the ladder lost some ground after he disappeared from competition for several weeks .
He took a long break after California , with Coppi e Bartali being his next race .
He did n't set the world on fire though , finishing way down in 54th place .
Rogers returned for the Basque Tour , where he returned to some promising form .
He placed seventh on the first stage , following an attack with all the favourites on a small climb just before the finish .
He then went on to do a respectable time trial , although a three - time world champion in the discipline should not lose a minute to a climber like Contador .
If he can stay healthy , keep the rubber to the road and slowly build his form , we expect good things out of Rogers come July .
But for now , he is still an unknown quantity and drops to tenth .

Photo © : Susanne Goetze Carlos Sastre : The Tour winner is riding a modest spring schedule , in fact it is so modest we had to do a long search to find it .
He took a long racing break after California before finally coming back to action in Castilla y Leon , where his performance was , what else , modest .
Guess what ?
He rode the Vuelta al País Vasco and put in another quite modest performance .
Most worrying was his final time trial , where he lost 2.11 to Contador .
Time trials have always been his weakness , and we'd expect to see him at least try to test his mettle in the race against the clock .
Perhaps he is content to let teammates like Heinrich Haussler take the spotlight .
Perhaps he needs a bit more time to settle in with his new team .
Perhaps he does n't need as many racing kilometres in his legs as some of the others do .
But we really think it is getting to be time for a sign of life here .

The younger brother is continuing to lay low , and sinks to the bottom of our list for being completely anonymous in March .
After a low - key effort in California , he followed up with a decent ride in the difficult Monte Paschi Eroica ( 8th ) .
His Tirreno - Adriatico was even lower - key than California , and he did n't manage to finish .
Nor did he finish Milano - Sanremo .
Nor did he ride any of the subsequent races until the Criterium International , where he finished buried in the pack .
Even in the Basque Tour his results were nothing special .
He continues to hang around the bottom of the ladder , as we are still waiting for him to give us a reason to remember why we even picked him for this list .
While all the other favourites are showing glimmers of form , it seems like Andy 's lights are out .
That 's our second look at who - is - who this year .
How will they do in their next races ?
Who will climb up the ladder of success or slide down into the pits ?
Heck , how should we know that ?
But we 'll be back with another look soon .

++ constructs such as functions , types , variables , and blocks are associated with implicit properties that you sometimes need to override .
Certain constructs require you to specify their unusual properties , for example :
A function that never returns
A type with a particular alignment restriction
A virtual function that must not be overridden
Attributes , a new C++09 feature , are compile - time tokens that enable you to designate properties like these .
By using attributes , you can specify additional information about your programming constructs conveniently and portably .
This 10 - Minute Solution shows how to apply this technique .
You need to tell the compiler and your fellow programmers how to use a certain component , but you do n't want to use nonstandard features or risk inadvertent usage violations .
Use C++09 attributes .
final , Finally
Before the advent of C++09 , ensuring that clients could not override a certain virtual function any further was a struggle .
Consider the following example :
struct B { virtual void f ( ) ; // do not override this !
} ; struct D : B { void f( ) ; //overriding B : :f , uncaught by the compiler } ;
The author of class B made her intentions clear : Any class derived from B must not override f( ) .
Still , an innocent user who derived D from Bmistakenly violated this requirement .
A standard C++ compiler cannot detect this violation because all public virtual functions can be overridden by default .
C++09 attributes tackle this problem .
An attribute is a token enclosed between double square brackets , for example [ [ myattribute ] ] .
C++09 defines several attribute tokens , which you need to understand are n't reserved keywords .
To indicate that a virtual function must not be overridden any further , you need to appertain the attribute [ [ final ] ] to the last permitted override of that function :
struct B // C++09 only { virtual void f [ [ final ] ] ( ) ;//can't override f( ) any further !
} ; struct D : B { void f( ) ; // compilation error : attempt to override B : :f } ;
The [ [ final ] ] attribute applies to class definitions and to virtual member functions declared in a class definition .
If the [ [ final ] ] attribute is specified for a class definition , it 's equivalent to being specified for each virtual member function of that class , including inherited member functions .
The following declaration of class A ...
struct A [ [ final ] ]
//C++09 only { virtual void f( ) ; virtual void g( ) ; virtual void h( ) ; } ;
... is equivalent to :

Building sets from set ( ) and ANY
When defining a regular expression there is a well known duality between a set of characters specified by enclosing characters or character ranges within square brackets [… ] and defining the pattern of the complement set [ ^… ] by preceding the caret symbol ^ .
[ 0 - 9 ] — matches all digits
[ ^0 - 9 ] — matches all non-digits
The nature of the complement set mentioned here is less precisely defined and is implementation dependent in practice .
If a regexp matcher knows about ASCII only then [ ^0 - 9 ] is the set of all ASCII characters which are not digits .
Suppose now we want to build a character matching set from sets in the sense of a set data - type as inhabited in Python as a builtin .
This is easy because we start from the empty set ( ) and add just more elements .
Each finite set can be constructed in this way and we can establish a set ~ pattern correspondence :
set ( range ( 9 ) ) ~ [ 0 - 9 ]
But how do we find a corresponding set for [ ^0 - 9 ] ?
This cannot be finitely constructed from the bottom up using set ( ) as a start value but it has to be finitely de-constructed from the set of all elements .
This looks like we are running into unlimited comprehension and the Russel paradox but actually the set theory we are using is quite weak and element membership can be decided just by doing hashtable lookups .
Instead of constructing a set from set ( ) we want to ( de - ) construct it from ANY .
The name ANY is not chosen by chance because we want to express the correspondence with .
pattern :
ANY ~ .
( Actually ANY is a little stronger because .
does n’t match newline characters unless explicitly specified by the DOTALL flag in the re.compile function . )
Using ANY we can easily state the above correspondence :
ANY – set ( range ( 9 ) ) ~ [ ^0 - 9 ]
Implementation of ANY
We define ANY as an instance of univset .
The univset has a set - like interface and implements set operations consistently on sets of the type ANY - A , ANY - B , … where A , B… are finite sets constructed from set ( ) .
For example
ANY - A ∩ ANY - B = ANY – ( A ∪ B )
ANY - A ∪ B = ANY – ( A – B )
class univset ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self ._diff = set ( ) def __sub__ ( self , other ) : S = univset ( ) if type ( other ) == set : S._diff = self ._diff | other return S else : S._diff = self ._diff | other ._diff return S def __rsub__ ( self , other ) : return other & ; self ._diff def __contains__ ( self , obj ) : return not obj in self ._diff def __and__ ( self , other ) : return other - self ._diff def __rand__ ( self , other ) : return other - self ._diff def __repr__ ( self ) : if self ._diff == set ( ) : return " ANY " else : return " ANY - %s " % self ._diff def __or__ ( self , other ) : S = univset ( ) S._diff = self ._diff - other return S def __xor__ ( self , other ) : return ( self - other ) | ( other - self ) def add ( self , elem ) : if elem in self ._diff : self ._diff .
remove ( elem ) def update ( self , elem ) : self ._diff = self ._diff - other def __ror__ ( self , other ) : return self .

After yesterday 's revelations that the maker of the $ 2.49 iPhone application Transit Sydney had been threatened by RailCorp , several other train schedule software makers have come forward to complain they have also been threatened with copyright infringement suits .
RailCorp admits threatening four mobile developers but says that 's because the applications were providing " out - of - date " timetables .
The applications use timetable information sourced from the CityRail website but if CityRail updates those timetables , the developer must send out a new version of software for it to remain up - to - date .
It is likely that RailCorp does not want to rely on developers to do this , however , it is refusing to say when its own official version will be released , leaving commuters high and dry .
Dan Stevenson , an avid mobile user , referred the issue to NSW Premier Nathan Rees over Twitter , noting that RailCorp 's Victorian and Western Australian equivalents had no problem with software makers using their timetables .
Rees , or one of his minders , tweeted back , saying : " Thanks for the link - i'll look into it . "
Intellectual property lawyer Trevor Choy said even though RailCorp was a public service , copyright law was " biased " in favour of the Government and did not make any distinction between information that should be a public service ( like train timetables ) and private information .
" Government agencies are supposed to use their powers wisely , but here they are behaving exactly like a private company preventing a competitor from launching a ' competing product ' , " said Choy .
Nick Maher , who developed TrainView - supporting all Java - enabled mobile phones - in 2007 and TripView for the iPhone in October last year , has had to stop selling both applications after threats from RailCorp .
Maher said RailCorp invited him to a meeting in 2007 to discuss the possibility of it licensing TrainView , but " nothing actually came of that " .
" At the time I asked them if they had any problem with me using the data and they said they were OK with it , " he said .
" I continued to sell it for a couple of years and just recently I contacted them to let them know I had a new version for the iPhone and they said they 'd changed their stance with regards to copyright and that they were n't giving any permission for people to use their timetable data in third - party apps . "
The developers of another iPhone app , Metro Sydney , suffered the same fate and were forced to remove the train timetable feature recently after threats from RailCorp .
The software now includes just bus and ferry timetables .
One of the first train scheduling apps , for pocket PCs using the Palm operating system , was broken after RailCorp modified its website to prevent the software from scraping its timetable information .
RailCorp , whose chief executive is Rob Mason , had earlier threatened the developer with legal action but he refused to stop distributing the software , saying he had written permission from RailCorp to use the information .
" RailCorp has contacted about four developers requesting them to remove from sale mobile applications that breach RailCorp 's copyright over its timetables because these applications were providing out - of - date timetables that had the potential to confuse and mislead our customers , " a RailCorp spokeswoman said .
" Copyright in all CityRail timetables is owned by RailCorp .
Any unlicensed republication of the timetables represents a breach of this copyright .
We have not pursued any legal action to date . "
" I think it 's a shame , " said Maher .
" I think there are some really good apps out there and I think that it'd be good to open up the data and let the developers compete .
That way they 'll probably come up with better products than what RailCorp could do by themselves . "
Meanwhile , Thales announced this week that it had been awarded a contract to provide Sydney Ferries with software allowing commuters to access real - time ferry information " on the wharf , on vessels , over the internet , on mobile phones and PDAs " .
The service is scheduled for full implementation by the middle of next year .
" Customers will be able to see what time a ferry is expected to arrive or depart , as well as its location on the harbour , " Thales said in a statement .
Steve and I definitely have challenges when it comes to " keeping rooms clean " in our house .
We are both a bit OCD about cleanliness and organization , while our kids " will be kids , " you know ?
But WOAH , I can't imagine being to the point that Andrew Mizsak was when the Ohio man called 911 to report that his 28 - year - old son 's room was messy .
Mizsak 's son , Andrew , who lives at home and is a school board member in Bedford , a suburb of Cleveland , apparently threw a plate of food across the kitchen table when his dad told him to clean his room .
When police arrived , the elder Mizsak decided not to press charges , so as not to " ruin his son 's political career " ( Andrew also works at a political consultant ) .
Apparently , he now promises to keep his room clean .
Talk about choosing your battles .

Critics say drug arrests of HISD teachers go too far Critics decry drug charges against HISD teachers
As several employees await court hearings , opponents complain some allegations after campus searches lack common sense
More than a dozen Houston school district employees are getting a lesson in the zero - tolerance policies typically applied to students as they await court hearings on drug charges that could land them in jail .
While most of the teachers are charged with possessing pot in their cars at school , a few face time behind bars after police said they found unauthorized prescription drugs in their vehicles .
Some of the charges , particularly those involving prescription pills , are drawing criticism from lawyers , parents and teachers who say the Houston Independent School District and the Harris County District Attorney ’s Office need a lesson in discretion .
Norm Uhl , an HISD spokesman , said the district is treating employees as it would students — arresting them for having drugs on campus and leaving it up to prosecutors to file charges .
“ We do have discretion to accept charges or not accept charges , but as officers of the court , it ’s our duty to see that justice is done , ” said Donna Hawkins , a spokeswoman for the district attorney 's office .
“ And if an officer calls us with a valid charge and probable cause , then we should accept that charge unless there is some extenuating circumstance .
“ We do n’t discriminate based on whether somebody is a teacher or not . ”
If a teacher — or any person — can show proof of a valid prescription , then they should n’t be in trouble with the law , Hawkins added .
Dogs sent to schools
For example , she said , the district attorney 's office filed a motion to dismiss a drug charge against an HISD food service worker after he was able to produce a prescription .
Tom Shahriari , an attorney - turned - HISD elementary school teacher , called the district ’s ongoing drug searches “ a very wide and very destructive dragnet . ”
In December , Superintendent Abelardo Saavedra ordered his police department to take drug - sniffing dogs to every employee parking lot .
His order for the widespread sweep came after anonymous tips to HISD police led to drug arrests of 15 employees — two of them twice — from eight different campuses .
“ I do n’t have a problem with using the drug dogs , ” said Shahriari , a fifth - grade teacher at Roberts Elementary .
“ What I have a problem with is using the zero - tolerance laws to make it zero compassion and zero common sense . ”
One of Shahriari ’s colleagues , a 59 - year - old art teacher named Melinda Herrick , is suspended from the school and charged with drug possession in a drug - free zone .
Herrick ’s attorney , Kent Schaffer , said the former Teacher of the Year award recipient is accused of having two Xanax pills , typically prescribed for panic disorder , in her car .
“ It was n’t hers , ” said Schaffer , who expects the grand jury to no-bill his client , meaning the case would be dropped .
District treated all equally
In the meantime , some parents at the school have launched a fundraising campaign to cover Herrick ’s legal expenses .
Roxanne van Ravenswaay , who is president of the school ’s Parent Teacher Organization has a message for Saavedra .
“ I understand his need to make sure he provides a safe environment for the children , ” said the mother of two .
“ But if he is a man of honor and realizes mistakes have been made , then he should do everything he can to make sure he rectifies this . ”
Uhl , the HISD spokesman , said the district treated all employees equally .
HISD ’s new police chief , Jimmie Dotson , said he has not had a chance to review the drug - dog searches .
His first day on the job was Monday .
“ I can not make a commitment whether they ’re going to continue or not , ” he said .
Job concerns
Houston attorney James Fallon , who is representing several of the charged HISD employees , said police did not investigate thoroughly before making arrests .
For example , he said , the prescription drugs found in the car driven by one of his clients belonged to his deceased father .
Fallon said LeDarien Strauss , a 26 - year - old special education teacher at Yates High School , was driving the car registered in his father ’s name because his own car was being repaired .
“ He ’s the sweetest , kindest guy you ’d ever meet , ” said Fallon , the son of Houston Federation of Teachers President Gayle Fallon .
“ He ’s not popping pills and then going to work . ”
In another case , Hazel Jackson , a 59 - year - old special education teacher at Woodson Middle School , is accused of having unauthorized blood pressure or cholesterol medicine , according to her attorney , Chris Tritico .
He said she did n’t know the pills were there but thinks they belong to a friend .
“ The worst thing that could have happened had she taken that medication is she would have had good cholesterol , ” he said .
Tritico and Fallon said their biggest concern is that the employees could lose their jobs and licenses to teach even if they are not convicted .

Father Daniel says the nun 's death was justified
Members of the convent in north - east Romania claim Maricica Irina Cornici was possessed and that the crucifixion had been part of an exorcism ritual .
Cornici was found dead on the cross on Wednesday after fellow nuns called an ambulance , according to police .
A priest and four nuns were charged with imprisonment leading to death .
Orphan
Police say the 23 - year - old nun , who was denied food and drink throughout her ordeal , had been tied and chained to the cross and a towel pushed into her mouth to smother any sounds .
A post -mortem is to be carried out , although initial reports say that Cornici died from asphyxiation .
I do n't understand why journalists are making such a fuss about this
Father Daniel
Local media reports that the young woman had arrived at the remote convent three months before , having initially gone there to visit a friend and opted to stay .
She grew up in an orphanage in Arad , in the west of Romania .
Mediafax news agency said Cornici suffered from schizophrenia and the symptoms of her condition caused the priest at the convent and other nuns to believe she was possessed by the devil .
" They all said she was possessed and they were trying to cast out the evil spirits , " police spokeswoman Michaela Straub said .
Father Daniel who is accused of orchestrating the crime is said to be unrepentant .
" God has performed a miracle for her , finally Irina is delivered from evil , " AFP quoted the priest as saying .
" I do n't understand why journalists are making such a fuss about this .
Exorcism is a common practice in the heart of the Romanian Orthodox church and my methods are not at all unknown to other priests , " Father Daniel added .
If found guilty of killing Cornici , Father Daniel and the accused nuns could face 20 years in jail .

A few months ago I read Atlas Shrugged , the 1,069 - page Ayn Rand opus that was recently praised by Stephen Colbert ( for its newfound popularity with beleaguered CEOs ) .
As I mentioned in the comments of a previous post , like many other nerds I went through a brief Aynfatuation around the age of 14 .
Rand ’s portrayal of an anti-mind , anti-reason cabal of collectivist rulers , who spout oleaginous platitudes about love and self - sacrifice even as they mercilessly repress any spark of individuality , happens to be extremely relevant to at least two cases I ’m aware of :
Soviet Russia .
The average American high school .
But it did n’t last long .
Even in the midst of it , I could see problems : I wrote a term paper analyzing the rape scene in The Fountainhead as immoral and irreconcilable with the rest of an otherwise supremely - rational novel .
And ironically , once I went to college and started doing more - or - less what Rand extols as life ’s highest purposes — pursuing my ambitions , tackling math and science problems , trying to create something original — her philosophy itself seemed more and more quaint and irrelevant .
I snapped out of it before I reached Atlas .
( Or did I subconsciously fear that , if I did read Atlas , I ’d be brainwashed forever ?
Or did I just figure that , having read the 752 - page Fountainhead and dozens of essays , I already got the basic idea ? )
So , having now returned to Atlas out of curiosity , what can I say ?
Numerous readers have already listed the reasons why , judged as a conventional novel , it ’s pretty bad : wooden dialogue , over - the - top melodrama , characters barely recognizable as human .
But of course , Atlas does n’t ask to be judged as a conventional novel .
Rand and her followers clearly saw it as a secular Bible : a Book of Books that lays out for all eternity , through parables and explicit exhortation , what you should value and how you should live your life .
This presents an obvious problem for me : how does one review a book that seeks , among other things , to define the standards by which all books should be reviewed ?
Mulling over this question , I hit on an answer : I should look not at what ’s in the book — whose every word is perfect by definition , to true believers who define ‘ perfect ’ as ‘ that exemplified by Atlas Shrugged ‘ — but at what ’s not in it .
In other words , I should review the complement of the book .
By approaching the donut through the hole , I will try to explain how , even considering it on its own terms , Atlas Shrugged fails to provide an account of human life that I found comprehensive or satisfying .
( Though on the positive side , it still makes much more sense than my 11th - grade English teacher . )
Without further ado , here are the ten most striking things I noticed in the complement of Atlas Shrugged .
Recent technologies .
For a novel set in the future , whose whole point is to defend capitalism , technology , innovation , and industry , Atlas is startlingly uninterested in any technologies being developed at the time it was written ( the fifties ) .
For Rand , the ultimate symbol of technological progress is the railroad — though she ’s also impressed by steel mills , copper mines , skyscrapers , factories , and bridges .
Transistors , computers , space travel , and even plastic and interstate highways seem entirely absent from her universe , while nuclear energy ( which no one could ignore at the time ) enters only metaphorically , through the sinister “ Project X. ” Airplanes , which were starting to overtake trains as a form of passenger travel even as Atlas was written , do play a tiny role , though it ’s never explained where the busy protagonists learned to pilot .
Overall , I got the impression that Rand did n’t really care for technology as such — only for what certain specific , 19th - century technologies symbolized to her about Man ’s dominance over Nature .
Curiosity about the physical universe .
This , of course , is related to point 1 .
For Rand , the physical world seems to be of interest only as a medium to be bent to human will .
When I read The Fountainhead as a teenager , I found myself wondering what Rand would ’ve made of academic scientists : people who generally share her respect for reason , reality , and creative achievement , but not her metaphysical certainty or her hatred of all government planning .
( Also , while most male scientists resemble a cross between Howard Roark and John Galt , it must be admitted that a tiny minority of them are awkward nerds . )
In Atlas , Rand finally supplies an answer to this question , in the form of Dr. Robert Stadler .
It turns out that in Rand ’s eschatology , academic scientists are the worst evil imaginable : people smart enough to see the truth of her philosophy , but who nevertheless choose to reject it .
Science , as a whole , does not come off well in Atlas : the country starves while Stadler ’s State Science Institute builds a new cyclotron ; and Dr. Floyd Ferris , the author of obscurantist popular physics books , later turns into a cold - blooded torturer .
( That last bit , actually , has a ring of truth to it . )
More important , in a book with hundreds of pages of philosophizing about human nature , there ’s no mention of evolution ; in a book obsessed with “ physics , ” there ’s no evidence of any acquaintance with relativity , quantum mechanics , or pretty much anything else about physics .
( When Stadler starts talking about particles approaching the speed of light , Dagny impatiently changes the subject . )
It ’s an interesting question whether Rand outright rejected the content of modern science ; maybe we ’ll pick up that debate in the comments section .
But another possibility — that Rand was simply indifferent to the sorts of things an Einstein , Darwin , or Robert Stadler might discover , that she did n’t care whether they were true or not — is , to my mind , hardly more defensible for a “ philosopher of reason . ”
Family .
Whittaker Chambers ( of pumpkin patch fame ) pointed out this startling omission in his review of 1957 .
The characters in Atlas mate often enough , but they never reproduce , or even discuss the possibility of reproduction ( if only to take precautions against it ) .
Also , the only family relationships portrayed at length are entirely negative in character : Rearden ’s mother , brother , and wife are all contemptible collectivists who mooch off the great man even as they despise him , while Dagny ’s brother Jim is the wretched prince of looters .
Any Republicans seeking solace in Atlas should be warned : Ayn Rand is not your go - to philosopher for family values ( much less “ Judeo - Christian ” ones ) .
“ Angular , ” attractive people who also happen to be collectivists , or “ shapeless ” people who happen to be rational individualists .
In the universe of Atlas , physical appearance is destiny — always , without exception , from John Galt down to the last minor villain .
Whenever Rand introduces a new character , you learn immediately , after a one - paragraph physical description , everything she wants you to know about that character ’s moral essence : “ angular ” equals good , “ limp , ” “ petulant , ” and so on equal bad .
Admittedly , most movies also save the audience from unwanted thought by making similar identifications .
But Rand ’s harping on this theme is so insistent , so vitriolic , that it leaves little doubt she really did accept the eugenic notion that a person ’s character is visible on his or her face .
Personalities .
In Atlas , as in The Fountainhead , each character has ( to put it mildly ) a philosophy , but no personality independent of that philosophy , no Objectively - neutral character traits .
What , for example , do we know about Howard Roark ?
Well , he has orange hair , likes to smoke cigarettes , and is a brilliant architect and defender of individualism .
What do we know about John Galt ?
He has gold hair , likes to smoke cigarettes , and is a brilliant inventor and defender of individualism .
Besides occupation and hair color , they ’re pretty much identical .
Neither is suffered to have any family , culture , backstory , weaknesses , quirks , or even hobbies or favorite foods ( not counting cigarettes , of course ) .
Yes , I know this is by explicit authorial design .
But it also seems to undermine Rand ’s basic thesis : that Galt and Roark are not gods or robots , but ordinary mortals .
Positive portrayal of uncertainty .
In Atlas , “ rationality ” is equated over and over with being certain one is right .
The only topic the good guys , like Hank and Dagny , ever change their minds about is whether the collectivists are ( a ) evil or ( b ) really , really evil .
( Spoiler alert : after 800 pages , they opt for ( b ) . )
The idea that rationality might have anything to do with being uncertain — with admitting you ’re wrong , changing your mind , withholding judgment — simply does not exist in Rand ’s universe .
For me , this is the single most troubling aspect of her thought .
Honest disagreements .
Atlas might be the closest thing ever written to a novelization of Aumann ’s Agreement Theorem .
In RandLand , whenever two rational people meet , they discover to their delight that they agree about everything — not merely the basics like capitalism and individualism , but also the usefulness of Rearden Metal , the beauty of Halley ’s Fifth Concerto , and so on .
( Again , the one exception is the disagreement between those who ’ve already accepted the full evil of the collectivists , and those still willing to give them a chance . )
In “ Galt ’s Gulch ” ( the book ’s utopia ) , there ’s one judge to resolve disputes , but he ’s never had to do anything since no disputes have ever arisen .
History .
When I read The Fountainhead as a teenager , there was one detail that kept bothering me : the fact that it was published in 1943 .
At such a time , how could Rand possibly imagine the ultimate human evil to be a left - wing newspaper critic ?
Atlas continues the willful obliviousness to real events , like ( say ) World War II or the Cold War .
And yet — just like when she removes family , personality , culture , evolution , and so on from the picture — Rand clearly wants us to apply the lessons from her pared - down , stylized world to this world .
Which raises an obvious question : if her philosophy is rich enough to deal with all these elephants in the room , then why does she have to avoid mentioning the elephants while writing thousands of pages about the room ’s contents ?
Efficient evil people .
In Atlas , there ’s not a single competent industrialist who is n’t also an exemplar of virtue .
The heroine , Dagny , is a railroad executive who makes trains run on time — who knows in her heart that reliable train service is its own justification , and that what the trains are transporting and why is morally irrelevant .
Granted , after 900 pages , Dagny finally admits to herself that she ’s been serving an evil cause , and should probably stop .
But even then , her earlier “ do n’t ask why ” policy is understood to have been entirely forgivable : a consequence of too much virtue rather than too little .
I found it odd that Rand , who ( for all her faults ) was normally a razor - sharp debater , could write this way so soon after the Holocaust without thinking through the obvious implications .
Ethnicity .
Seriously : to write two sprawling novels set in the US , with hundreds of characters between them , and not a single non-Aryan ?
Even in the 40s and 50s ?
For me , the issue here is not political correctness , but something much more basic : for all Rand ’s praise of “ reality , ” how much interest did she have in its contents ?
On a related note , somehow Rand seems to have gotten the idea that “ the East , ” and India in particular , were entirely populated by mystical savages sitting cross-legged on mats , eating soybeans as they condemned reason and reality .
To which I can only reply : what did she have against soybeans ?
Edamame is pretty tasty .
Murray Rothbard and Eliezer Yudkowsky take different routes to some of the same conclusions .

Imagine you 're floating high above Mars , soaring across the butterscotch - tinted landscape .
Up ahead , you spot something odd , a series of lines and weird shapes , just downwind from a dotting of high mesas .
What do you think that would look like ?
I bet it would appear to be something like this :
[ Click to see it embiggened , or click here to see it really cromulently embiggened ]
That picture is from just about my favorite camera in the whole solar system : HiRISE , on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
With a resolution of a half - meter per pixel it has been taking breathtaking images of the Red Planet .
This particular picture shows a region in the southern mid-latitudes of Mars , just west of the Hellas Basin , a vast impact depression 2700 km across .
On the left are two large mesas , flat - topped hills .
As the wind whips around them , it blows sand into those long , linear dunes called seifs .
The seifs themselves can break up and form the horseshoe - shaped dunes called barchans .
I imagine that given time , and a hefty budget , this is what Salvador Dali 's beachhouse property would look like .
Here 's a closeup of the right center of the image :
The lighter object is another mesa , though the top is not quite flat .
You can tell from the shape of the hill the wind is blowing from left to right and has been for a long , long time .
The barchans look smooth , but they do n't need to be ; the wind can carve ripples into them as well :
[ Again , click to enlarge and see the gorgeous detail . ]
Think of them as dunes on dunes .
Funny .
On TV shows and in movies , there 's a tendency to make planets all one environment ( the ice planet Hoth , or Vulcan and Arrakis as desert worlds ) .
But when we look at the planets in just our own solar system -- all born from the same parent disk of gas and dust 4.6 billion years ago -- we see diversity on a magnificent scale .
Features rare on Earth ( like seifs ) are common on Mars , and Mars itself , though apparently fairly dead and lacking any extant water , has an incredible landscape of astonishing beauty and complexity .
What will it look like when we go there , stand on the crest of a seif , and look out over to the Martian horizon ?
What wonders will those humans be able to see ?

The Rev. Al Sharpton owed at least $ 1.8 million in back taxes before striking a sweetheart deal with the feds last summer that chopped the bill almost in half and kept him out of the slammer , The Post has learned .
A series of federal liens — the most recent of which was filed earlier this month — provide a window into the massive tax debts the firebrand activist incurred since 2002 as he remade himself into a millionaire media personality , newly released documents show .
Treasury Department officers say Sharpton owed $ 351,798 from 2007 , according to a document filed March 3 with the New York County Register Office .
This unpaid balance — a potential mix of back taxes and penalties — comes on top of a federal lien filed last Nov. 13 for $ 1,367,521 covering tax years 2005 and 2006 .
All the liens are filed as “ 1040 ” or personal income tax and listed his address as 680 Madison Ave. — the uber - swanky Helmsley Carlton House where Sharpton resides .
Last July , Sharpton cut a deal with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn to end a longstanding criminal probe of his finances that reportedly encompassed his personal fortune , his quixotic 2004 presidential campaign spending and the National Action Network , his advocacy group .
Sharpton said he ’d personally pay back $ 1 million , including $ 500,000 upfront , as part of the settlement .
But , the liens show his debts ran much deeper .
“ Rev. Al Sharpton is meeting his tax obligations with the IRS through an agreement that was completed in late summer of 2008 .
Since that time , he has made substantial payments and continues to do so .
Any federal tax liens that have been filed are inclusive of all years included in the agreement .
As those payments have been made , tax liens have been released , ” said longtime Sharpton attorney Michael Hardy .
So far , only two additional liens worth $ 90,753 were released since the settlement , records show .
IRS protocol allows tax debtors to immediately remove paid debts from their record by calling a toll - free 800 number .
Liens , which are a claim on property to cover a debt , are the last step the IRS will take before seizing a debtor ’s assets .
Sharpton also was hit with a $ 19,914 lien filed on Dec. 31 , 2008 , from unpaid taxes in 1996 .
Meanwhile , Sharpton also owes the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance , which was not part of the July settlement , $ 884,669 , according to two liens covering years 2002 through 2006 .
Hardy said those debts are being addressed .
Sharpton reportedly earns $ 750,000 a year hosting a syndicated radio talk show .
He also collects anywhere from $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 per lecture and $ 2,000 per church sermon .
On top of that , Sharpton does “ consulting ” work for corporations .

( CNN ) -- The Liberty Sun , a U.S. - flagged cargo ship bound for Mombasa , Kenya , was attacked Tuesday by Somali pirates , according to a NATO source with direct knowledge of the matter .
Pirates attacked The Liberty Sun , a U.S. - flagged cargo ship , but were unable to board .
" The pirates fired rocket - propelled grenades and automatic weapons at the vessel , which sustained damage , " said a statement from New York - based Liberty Maritime Corporation , which owns the vessel .
The ship was carrying U.S. food aid for African nations , the statement said .
The pirates never made it onto the ship and the vessel is now being escorted by a coalition ship , still bound for Mombasa , officials said .
Two senior defense officials said the Liberty Sun was being escorted by the guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge .
It is the ship carrying Richard Phillips , the captain of the container ship Maersk Alabama , which was hijacked last week .
Phillips spent days as a hostage of the pirates before being rescued Sunday .
Katy Urbik of Wheaton , Illinois , said her son , Thomas , was aboard the Liberty Sun at the time of the attack .
She shared the e-mails he sent as the ship came under fire .
" We are under attack by pirates , we are being hit by rockets .
Also bullets , " said one e-mail sent Tuesday afternoon .
" We are barricaded in the engine room and so far no one is hurt .
[ A ] rocket penetrated the bulkhead but the hole is small .
Small fire , too , but put out .
" Navy is on the way and helos and ships are coming .
I 'll try to send you another message soon .
[ G ] ot to go now .
I love you mom and dad and all my brothers and family . "
" My heart stopped after I realized there was n't going to be a ' just kidding ' after his comment , " Katy Urbik said .
About 1 ½ hours later , Thomas Urbik sent another e-mail to his mother , which said , " The navy has showed up in full force and we are now under military escort ... all is well .
I love you all and thank you for the prayers . "
In an e-mail only hours before the attack , Urbik 's son tried to assure his mother that his crew was safe and taking precautions .
" Do n't worry too much .
I am fine and we are being well monitored by the U.S. Navy , who is demanding we send them a report every six hours on our position and status , " Thomas Ubrik 's e-mail said .
He added , " We in fact are going to be the second American ship to arrive into Mombasa after the Maersk Alabama .
It should be interesting to say the least .
...
We have had several drills to prepare ourselves to secure ourselves in the engine room .
[ W ]e can do it pretty quick by now . "
The company said the ship had dropped off food aid last week at a Sudanese port and the ship was going around the Horn of Africa to reach Kenya when it came under attack .
However , the exact location of the attack remained unclear .
Earlier Tuesday , pirates off the coast of Somalia seized two freighters , proving they remain a force to contend with just days after the U.S. Navy dramatically rescued an American captain held by other pirates .
First , pirates in the Gulf of Aden on Tuesday hijacked the MV Irene EM , a 35,000 - ton Greek - owned bulk carrier , according to a NATO spokesman and the European Union 's Maritime Security Center .
The crew of the Greek carrier was thought to be unhurt and ships have been warned to stay clear of the area for fear of further attack , the Security Center said .
Later Tuesday , pirates on four skiffs seized the 5,000 - ton MV Sea Horse , a Lebanese - owned and Togo - flagged vessel , said Cmdr. Chris Davies of NATO 's Maritime Component Command Headquarters in Northwood , England .
Details about the ship and its crew were n't immediately available .
NATO has an ongoing anti-piracy mission off Somalia called Operation Allied Protector .
The mission involves four ships covering more than a million square miles , Davies said .
A U.S. - led international naval task force , Combined Task Force - 151 , is also patrolling in the region .
Tuesday 's hijackings came two days after sharpshooters from the U.S. Navy SEALs killed three pirates who had been holding Phillips hostage on the water for days .
Phillips had offered himself as a hostage when pirates attacked the Alabama on Wednesday , officials said .
The ship had been on its way to deliver aid to Mombasa , Kenya .
A fourth pirate had been aboard Bainbridge when the shootings occurred and was taken into custody .
Watch the tough tactics the Navy uses »
The incident follows four freighters being seized over the past two days by pirates off the Somalian coast , proving they remain a force to contend with .
Pirates on Monday hijacked two Egyptian fishing boats carrying a total of between 18 and 24 people , the Egyptian Information Ministry told CNN .
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry is working to end the hijacking , the ministry said .
Egyptian boats are known to use Somali waters illegally for fishing , taking advantage of the lawless state of the country and the lack of enforcement of its maritime boundaries .
Those who have tracked pirate activity in Somalia say it started in the 1980s , when the pirates claimed they were trying to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast .
Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms .
Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions .
Some experts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the pirates .
CNN 's Mike Mount , Barbara Starr and David McKenzie contributed to this report .

Brain scans have long been used to try to find the “ seat of consciousness ” in the brain ( Image : Harry Sieplinga / HMS Images / The Image Bank )
Electrodes implanted in the brains of people with epilepsy might have resolved an ancient question about consciousness .
Signals from the electrodes seem to show that consciousness arises from the coordinated activity of the entire brain .
The signals also take us closer to finding an objective “ consciousness signature ” that could be used to probe the process in animals and people with brain damage without inserting electrodes .
Previously it was n’t clear whether a dedicated brain area , or “ seat of consciousness ” , was responsible for guiding our subjective view of the world , or whether consciousness was the result of concerted activity across the whole brain .

Probing the process has been a challenge , as non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and EEG give either spatial or temporal information but not both .
The best way to get both simultaneously is to implant electrodes deep inside the skull , but it is difficult to justify this in healthy people for ethical reasons .
Brainy opportunity
Now neuroscientist Raphaël Gaillard of INSERM in Gif sur Yvette , France , and colleagues have taken advantage of a unique opportunity .
They have probed consciousness in 10 people who had intercranial electrodes implanted for treating drug - resistant epilepsy .
While monitoring signals from these electrodes , Gaillard ’s team flashed words in front of the volunteers for just 29 milliseconds .
The words were either threatening ( kill , anger ) or emotionally neutral ( cousin , see ) .
The words were preceded and followed by visual “ masks ” , which block the words from being consciously processed , or the masks following the words were n’t used , meaning the words could be consciously processed .
The volunteers had to press a button to indicate the nature of the word , allowing the researchers to confirm whether the volunteer was conscious of it or not .
Between the 10 volunteers , the researchers received information from a total of 176 electrodes , which covered almost the whole brain .
During the first 300 milliseconds of the experiment , brain activity during both the non-conscious and conscious tasks was very similar , indicating that the process of consciousness had not kicked in .
But after that , there were several types of brain activity that only occurred in the individuals who were aware of the words .
Lost seat
First , there was an increase in the voltage levels of the signals in their brains .
Second , the frequency and phase of neurons firing in different parts of the brain seemed to synchronise .
Then some of these synchronised signals appeared to be triggering others .
For example , activity in the occipital lobe seemed to cause activity in the frontal lobe .
Because this activity only occurred in volunteers when they were aware of the words , Gaillard ’s team argue that it constitutes a consciousness signature .
As much of this activity was spread across the brain , they say that consciousness has no single “ seat ” .
“ Consciousness is more a question of dynamics , than of a local activity , ” says Gaillard .
Bernard Baars of the Neuroscience Institute in San Diego , California , who proposed a “ global access ” theory of consciousness in 1983 agrees : “ I ’m thrilled by these results . ”
He says they provide the “ first really solid , direct evidence ” for his own theory .
He also says that having such a signature will make it easier to look for signs of consciousness in people with brain damage , infants and animals with the help of non-invasive techniques such as EEG .

Spore creator Will Wright is bringing to life a new type of entity : a start - up think tank .
Electronic
Arts today announced that Wright is leaving to run a new entertainment think tank called Stupid Fun Club and that EA is making an equity investment in the venture .
Wright hopes to develop new intellectual properties that can become games and other types of entertainment including movies , TV shows , Internet programming and toys .
“ The entertainment industry is moving rapidly into an era of revolutionary change , ” Wright said in a statement .
“ Stupid Fun Club will explore new possibilities that are emerging from this sublime chaos and create new forms of entertainment on a variety of platforms .
In my twelve years at EA , I ’ve had the pleasure to work alongside some of the brightest and most talented game developers in the industry and I look forward to working with them again in the near future . ”
Wright 's last start - up , the game development company Maxis , which he co-founded with Jeff Braun in 1987 resulted in the release of SimCity in 1989 .
Since then , Wright has added The Sims and Spore to a resume that landed him in the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame and won him a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2001 .
" We believe in Will ’s vision for Stupid Fun Club and we ’re looking forward to partnering with Will and his team long into the future , ” said EA CEO John Riccitiello in a statement included in the announcement .
“ Will is a great designer and he ’s been part of a great legacy of globally recognized game franchises like The Sims , SimCity and Spore .
The teams that have been leading those franchises in recent years have a lot of exciting content coming . ”
Maxis general manager Lucy Bradshaw described the development as " good news both for Will and for Maxis . …
I 've been working with him for a long time and find him just amazing , " says Bradshaw , who moved from EA to Maxis upon its acquisition .
" I think the partnership that EA has set up with him and his Stupid Fun Club is actually a pretty exciting endeavor . "
As for Maxis , Bradshaw said , " there 's a lot of incredible talent here in the studio and they are full of creative ideas .
We are working with Spore , which is just a wonderful IP to continue to develop not only from the point of view of the tech we have created for it , but also just the wealth of possibilities in terms of the scope of the original game . "
New Spore developments :
-- Spore Galactic Adventures ( due in June ) is an expansion pack for the original PC game that lets players " beam down from their space ship , they can take a captain and start to play adventures in space that sort of ranks up their captain and their allies , all taking place on the planet level , " Bradshaw ways .
The game also has an " adventure creator " that will let you share planetary adventures with others .
-- Spore Hero ( due this fall for Nintendo Wii ) lets players create , control and evolve creatures that ultimately must fight to save their planet .
The Wii's motion - sensitive remote and nunchuk let players " take control of their creature , " she says .
" It has a much more personal feel to it . "
-- Spore Hero Arena ( fall for Nintendo DS ) carries the galactic threat to Nintendo 's portable .
" You are literally flying from planet to planet in an arena - style battle game , " Bradshaw says .
-- Spore Creature Keeper , a standalone PC game aimed at younger players who want to create , develop and nurture their own creatures .
" You evolve it to its own sort of household from a wild animal .
We had so many players who experienced the Creature Creator and had so much fun with it we wanted to give them more to do with their creatures , to give them more personality and allow them to evolve them , " Bradshaw says .
" It has a multiplayer mode so you can invite your friends ' creatures over .
You can continue to evolve them to the extent they get their own pet . "
By Mike Snider
( CNN ) --
One evening last winter , Mike Harris was watching his local TV news when he saw a segment that caught his attention : Parents were using software to monitor their kids ' cell phones .
As more kids carry cell phones , some parents use software to monitor their calls and texts .
Harris , an investigator for the Child Sex Internet Investigations Unit in Jefferson County , Colorado , thought the service could be a new tool for combating sexual predators .
Equipping his phone with the software , Harris posed as an underage child on social - networking sites and began luring pedophiles .
He immediately got results .
Since then , Harris has made 83 arrests of alleged sexual predators -- 44 of them with the help of the monitoring program .
" It makes life easy for me as an investigator .
It saves me hours of time , which obviously means I have more time to go out and catch offenders , " he said .
The software also documents text messages and other data that can be used in court , he said .
" Now all I have to do is go into the account and pull everything out that was done between that sex offender and me . "
Programs such as My Mobile Watchdog and Mobile Spy are becoming increasingly popular with parents as more school - age children are carrying cell phones .
Parents say the services help them protect their kids against predators and also reduce " sexting , " the growing practice of using mobile phones to share sexually explicit text messages and pictures .
In 2008 , Jessica Logan , a Cincinnati , Ohio , teen , hanged herself after her nude photo , meant for her boyfriend , was sent to teenagers at several high schools , exposing her to ridicule and taunts .
The monitoring programs work like this :
Once a child 's phone is equipped with the software , the parent or law enforcement officer creates a list of contacts -- close relatives , trusted friends -- who are authorized to communicate with the minor 's phone .
An online file , accessed by the parent , stores all activity related to the child 's phone , including text messages and shared photos .
Any unauthorized number that contacts the child 's phone gets flagged , and the parent or guardian receives a real - time text message alerting them to the infraction .
Parents pay a monthly fee -- about $ 10 -- for the service , which only works on so - called " smart phones " with Web access .
My Mobile Watchdog also will alert parents if their child has removed the software from their phone .
e Agency Mobile Solutions of Newport Beach , California , is the creator of My Mobile Watchdog .
Bob Lotter , the company 's CEO , said he never imagined the software would become a tool for authorities cracking down on online sexual predators .
" The threat is huge , " Lotter said .
" There are so many different ways out there for child predators [ to find victims ] -- through Google , Yahoo , MySpace , Facebook and a host of other sites . "
A Lakewood , Colorado , woman said she outfitted her 12 - year - old daughter 's phone with monitoring software after the girl was sexually assaulted by a man she met on MocoSpace , a mobile chat network .
" I was n't going to take away her cell phone , and I knew I had to do something , " said the woman , whose first name is Wendy .
CNN.com is not printing her last name in accordance with its policy of not identifying the victims of sexual assault .
Wendy said the service has given her more peace of mind and her daughter a greater awareness of the responsibilities of having a cell phone .
Other parents have n't been so transparent .
James Green of Sulphur , Louisiana , equipped his daughter 's cell phone with monitoring software but did n't tell her what it was .
He told her the icon was a GPS system .
" I was n't going to get my 15 - year - old a cell phone and not know how she was using it , " Green said .
Over time , Green found the software was n't just useful for tracking his daughter 's behavior ; it also helped him discover more about the nature of his child .
" It 's good to know how she 's treating people and how others are treating her , " Green said .
" I think it 's a caring father that wants to know what 's going on in her life ... wanting to know how she feels . "
When Green 's daughter discovered the software on her phone , she was n't angry , he said .
" She understood that I cared about her . "
A Chandler , Arizona , mother found that monitoring her daughter 's phone calls and texts gave her new insight into her daughter 's life .
" We talk a lot more about what 's going on in her life , " said Trisha , who requested her last name not be published .
" It 's really opened up communication between the two of us . "
Some privacy advocates might object to parents digitally eavesdropping on their kids without their children 's consent .
But an Asheville , North Carolina , mother , who fitted her son's phone with the software without his knowledge , disagrees .
" I monitor my employees at the workplace , " said the woman , who owns a small business and asked that her name not be disclosed .
" And this is my son .
So to me it 's not like I 'm wiretapping him .
Besides , privacy in my house is earned . "

A couple of years ago I found a list from the nice folks at FoodNews.org that helps you decide what organic food is worth the price and what is n’t .
Because , while I love that so many stores have begun carrying Organic produce and products , the sad truth is that they are still going to sell us ( consumers ) whatever it is that we want to buy – whether we need it or not .
The list points out which fruits and veggies are filled with contaminants and pesticides and should be purchased Organic ( or avoided ) and which ones are pretty well okay to buy conventional .
So as a beginner to the Organic game , I suggest just focusing on purchasing the dirty 12 Organic .
If you can afford to buy everything in your grocery cart organic , then great !
But if not , you might as well focus your energies on that which will benefit you the most .
The 12 most contaminated veggies and fruits
You should try to buy these organic if at all possible …
Apples
Bell Peppers
Celery
Cherries
Imported Grapes
Nectarines
Peaches
Pears
Potatoes
Red Raspberries
Spinach
Strawberries
The 12 cleanest fruits and veggies
These do n’t need to be organic
Asparagus
Avocados
Bananas
Broccoli
Cauliflower
Corn
Kiwi
Mangos
Onions
Papaya
Pineapples
Peas
In a perfect world , everything would be organic and we would n’t have to think about this .
But when trying to budget for organic living , it can be very difficult so hopefully this guide will help you out like it has for me .
Any Organic shoppers out there have any other tips ?

Manchester will this autumn become the first city where people can sign up for an ID card , Jacqui Smith has said .
Anyone over 16 in the city with a UK passport will be able to apply for a card from the Home Office .
The home secretary 's speech signals her determination to push ahead with the cards , which will initially cost £ 30 , despite opposition .
The Tories and Lib Dems want the £ 5bn scheme scrapped , while some Labour MPs have expressed doubts about its cost .
People in Manchester who want an ID card can register their interest on the Directgov website .
They will then be told later in the year how to get their card , which will probably involve a visit to the Manchester passport office to be interviewed and have their fingerprints and photo taken .
The Conservatives claim the Cabinet is split on ID cards , with some ministers keen to scrap them to save money .
But the Home Office says it is determined to push ahead , claiming ID cards will reduce fraud - thus saving money - and are vital to combating terrorism and organised crime .
Giving fingerprints
The Manchester launch will mark the beginning of the main phase of the ID scheme which ministers say will culminate in cards being available nationwide by 2012 .
At a series of meetings on Wednesday , Ms Smith said post offices and pharmacies could play an important role in the success of the ID scheme , allowing people to give their fingerprints and a face scan while " out doing the shopping " .
ID CARD TIMETABLE 2009 : Workers at Manchester and London City airport Autumn 2009 : Manchester pilot 2010 : Students opening bank accounts offered ID cards 2011 / 12 : All UK passport applicants 2015 : 90 % foreign nationals covered 2017 : Full roll - out ?
Q&A : Identity cards City 's opinion on ID cards
The cost of the cards will be capped at £ 30 for the first two years and then there will be an additional cost to the applicant of getting a card via a post office or High Street pharmacy .
This charge has yet to be decided , but the Home Office says it hopes it will be " competitive " , and reports have put the total cost at about £ 60 .
People in Manchester will only be able to get the cards by applying directly to the National Identity Service .
They will not be able to get them from shops and post offices for another two years .
" ID cards will deliver real benefits to everyone , including increased protection against criminals , illegal immigrants and terrorists , " the home secretary said .

Government officials will seek to allay people 's concerns about the amount of personal data to be collected and retained for the new cards , saying it will be no greater than for passports .
" I think it is important to recognise that we 're not collecting some massive accumulation of information about citizens , " said James Hall , chief executive of the Identity and Passport Service .
Airport resistance Non-EU residents have been required to have identity cards since the end of last year .
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said the Conservatives would scrap ID cards but were not " assuming vast savings " , as much of the money has already been spent .
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " We are still talking about somewhere between £ 1bn and £ 2bn which , at a time when our public finances are in a right Royal mess , is a saving worth having in my view . "
I have done nothing wrong and I have nothing to hide , why would n't I want a card ?

He claimed " the government 's plans are quite clearly for a compulsory ID card scheme in the end " and people on low incomes , such as pensioners , should not be forced to pay for them .
He also questioned the value of the Manchester trial , arguing it was " very hard to see " how it could be made to work on a voluntary basis in a single city .
If the Conservatives win the next election they would scrap the scheme , said Mr Grayling , adding : " We do n't think the nation can afford them and they wo n't happen . "
' Big Brother ' Efforts to issue cards to pilots and other airport workers - a scheme which is being trialled at Manchester and London City airports - are meeting with growing resistance .
Pilots say they are effectively being forced into signing up for the cards .
" Our members believed the government promise that the ID card would be voluntary , " said Jim McAuslan , general secretary of the pilots ' union Balpa .
" But they now know it is anything but .
Our members must have an airside pass to operate aircraft and now discover that to get that pass they must have a national ID card .
" This is coercion and a case of Big Brother knows best . "
Officials said they were prepared to work with unions to resolve any differences but stressed that ID cards would improve security at airports and speed up recruitment procedures .
Dr Edgar Whitley of the London School of Economics has been warning about the cost of the scheme - which he has estimated at £ 10 bn - £ 20 bn - for the past four years .
The government 's figure for the cost to the Home Office is about £ 5 bn .
Dr Whitley told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : " The more I learn about it , the less impressed I 've become .
" The government said one of the benefits would be you 'll be able to use your identity card to get personalised public services .
" But the most recent date for when that will start to happen is 2015 .
So the people in Manchester , if they enrol with their cards , wo n't get any particular benefit until four or five years from now . "

The man spoke plainly as he explained the horrors he lived through in a Kosovo Liberation Army prison camp 10 years ago .
He told me about how he watched people beaten with steel pipes , cut with knives , left for days without food , and shot and killed .
" What can you feel when you see those things ? " he said .
" It 's something that is stuck in my mind for the rest of my life .
You can not do those things to people , not even to animals . "
As the man talked , his mother paced nervously in the nearby kitchen .
She was panicked and tears were streaming down her face .
" They 'll kill him , they 'll kill him , " she moaned , clutching one of her grandchildren .
But her son persisted .
We spent hours in the family 's sitting room as our source detailed allegations of possible war crimes by KLA officers in a military camp in the Albanian border town of Kukes .
It was a crucial interview for a delicate story I have been investigating for years .
Mystery of the missing Soon after the war ended in Kosovo , I started looking into the thousands of civilians who disappeared during and after the conflict .
Many Albanian victims were dumped in wells or transported to mass graves as far away as Belgrade .
LISTEN TO THE FULL REPORT Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But others - mainly Serbs - simply vanished without a trace .
There were no demands for ransom , no news of any kind .
I had met sources who spoke vaguely about secret camps in Albania where Kosovo Serbs , Albanians and Roma were interrogated , tortured and in most cases killed .
I met another source who agreed to share important details about KLA prison camps .
This man cut a very different profile .
He had returned from a successful career abroad to join the KLA in its fight for Kosovo 's independence from Serbia .
The man was still proud of the goals he fought for , but he had become haunted by the treatment of civilians he had seen at a KLA prison camp .
More than that , he said he felt angry and betrayed by KLA commanders who tolerated and even ordered the abuses .
" It did n't seem strange at the time , " he told me as he described seeing desperate civilians locked in a filthy agricultural shed .
Now , looking back , I know that some of the things that were done to innocent civilians were wrong
Former KLA Fighter
He said the civilians were Serbs and Roma seized by KLA soldiers and were being hidden away from Nato troops .
The source believes the captives were sent across the border to Albania and killed .
" Now , looking back , I know that some of the things that were done to innocent civilians were wrong .
But the people who did these things act as if nothing happened , and continue to hurt their own people , Albanians . "
This man was one of eight former KLA fighters who revealed some of their darkest secrets from the war .
A soldier 's story
Yet another source spoke of driving trucks packed with shackled prisoners - mainly Serbian civilians from Kosovo - to secret locations in Albania where they were eventually killed .
He recalled hearing two of the captives begging to be shot rather than tortured and " cut into pieces " .
" I was sick .
I was just waiting for it to end , " the source told me .
" It was hard .
I thought we were fighting a war [ of liberation ] but this was something completely different . "
A long silence over the atrocities has held strong throughout Kosovo
It has taken these men 10 years to speak to an outsider about the dark side of the war .
They were breaking a code of silence that has held strong in Kosovo .
Very few Kosovo Albanians have publicly revealed crimes committed by their own side .
And for good reason .
Witnesses who have agreed to provide testimony for prosecutions of KLA commanders have faced intimidation and death threats .
Some have been killed , according to United Nations officials in Kosovo .
There is another reason .
All the men we spoke with insisted they were Kosovan patriots and would take up arms again to defend the country 's independence .
But that is precisely the point : independence - of a sort - arrived for Kosovo last year .
Their wartime goal has been attained .
As one of the former KLA fighters told me : " Now is the time to be honest to ourselves and build a real state . "

Let ’s talk about Functors in the OCaml programming language .
I will assume that you know about modules in OCaml , if not you can refresh by reading the manual .
Functors are “ functions ” from structures to structures .
The above is probably the best definition I ’ve seen of a functor .
It touches on what I see as the main motivation behind using a functor .
A Functor being a function from structure to structure means that if you keep the signature of the input structure and the signature of the output structure constant , you are free to change the implementation details without affecting any of the modules that use it .
Functors allow the software designer an easy way of avoiding duplication , increasing orthogonality , all in a type safe package .
Let ’s write an algorithm to determine if a string contains balanced parentheses .
To start , we ’ll define the type of stack we want to work with :
module type STACK = sig
type 'a t
exception Empty
val create : unit -> 'a t
val push : ' a -> ' a t -> unit
val pop : 'a t -> 'a
val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
end
Here we have the basic operations on a very minimalist stack .
Now , we ’ll create a functor that will take a stack structure of this type and return a module containing our parenthesis matching algorithm .
module Matcher ( S : STACK ) = struct
let is_balanced str =
let s = S.create ( ) in try
String.iter
( fun c -> match c with
'(' ->
S.push c s
| ' ) ' -> ignore ( S.pop s )
| _ -> ( ) ) str ;
S.is_empty s
with S.Empty -> false
end
While we rely on the Stack with the STACK type to not change the semantics of its functions , we can guarantee that for any stack with this kind of structure and with the right semantics , our algorithm will work .
Any use of this functor will create a module with one function : val is_balanced : string -> bool .
This also means that if we maintain the signature of the functor we just wrote , we can change any of the implementation details and not affect the outside world .
To use a different stack , all we have to do is change one line of code from module M = Matcher ( Stack ) to module M = Matcher ( CStack ) to change our algorithm to use a stack that keeps a count of the number of things pushed onto it in its lifetime .
Conclusion : functors allow you to write code that will work irrespective of the implementation of the given structure ( so long as it does what it should ) , and produces a structure containing functions that we are free to modify , but only have to change in one location , that of the functor .
Which position is the safest bet in the first round ?
I was watching one of the many Mel Kiper and Todd McShay arguments on ESPN the other day [ video ] , and Kiper was arguing that if McShay has Matthew Stafford ranked so high ( McShay currently has Stafford ranked # 8 ) , then he should almost be a no- brainer for the Detroit Lions , who have the # 1 overall pick and need a quarterback .
McShay is n’t convinced that he ’s a so - called “ franchise ” quarterback , so he says he would go another direction .
( For the record , at the time Kiper called McShay “ crazy ” for having Stafford that high , but now he has the QB ranked # 3 on his big board .
It ’s clear that Kiper ’s pure hatred for McShay is causing him to slowly lose his mind . )
Anyway , the debate piqued my interest and got me wondering – when it comes to the first round of the NFL Draft , is one position safer than another ?
For example , if the Lions have three holes to fill ( they have more , but bear with me ) – quarterback , linebacker and tackle – and they ca n’t decide amongst the three players , is one position a safer pick than the other two ?
So I compiled a list of the 313 players that were picked from 1997 - 2006 ( assuming that it takes three seasons to get a decent idea of what kind of player a draft pick is going to turn out to be ) and asked our NFL guru , Anthony Stalter , to rate each player on a scale of 1 to 5 …
(1) Out of League
(2) Reserve
(3) Starter
(4) Star
(5) Superstar
The Out of League , Star and Superstar categories are pretty self - explanatory .
To qualify as a Starter , the player must be starter - caliber for the majority of his NFL career .
A Reserve is a player that is a backup for the majority of his career , so he may have started at one point , but on the whole he ’s a backup .
For the younger players , Anthony had to project a little bit .
For example , a player is a starter in his third year – does he project to be star or superstar , or will he simply be a starter for the majority of his career ?
Anthony rated each player ( and after some spirited debate about a few of his ratings ) , I compiled all the data into Table 1 below .
It shows each position , the percentage of first round picks that position was taken , and the number ( and percentage ) of times those picks turned out to be superstars , stars , starters , reserves and out of league players .
In Table 2 , I summed the Star and Superstar categories ( naming it “ Star + ” ) to find out which position provided the most .
If the goal of a first round pick is to “ not mess it up , ” and at least get a solid starter out of the pick , then teams would be interested in the sum of the Starter , Star and Superstar categories ( a.k.a. “ Starter + ” ) .
The results are interesting .
There are a number of positions that hit Stars or Superstars at a 25 - 30 % rate – QB , RB , WR , G , LB and S – but quarterback , running back and wide receiver only hit Starter + at a 44 - 57 % rate whereas the other three positions are all at 83 % or more .
The lesson ?
Guard , linebacker and safety are much safer picks .
But back to the Detroit Lions .
They have holes at QB , T and LB and the top player in each category – quarterback Matthew Stafford , tackle Jason Smith and linebacker Aaron Curry – are all reasonable # 1 overall picks .
So who should the Lions take ?
Assuming Detroit has done its due diligence and the three players grade out about the same ( i.e. the Lions ’ scouting has n’t revealed a clear choice ) , the safest pick appears to be Curry .
According to the numbers , he has an 83 % chance of developing into at least a starter and a 27 % chance of turning into a star or a superstar .
Compare that to the numbers for QB ( 44 % Starter + , 26 % Star + ) and T ( 73 % Starter+ , 13 % Star+ ) and it ’s clear why Curry is the “ safe ” way to go here .
As the # 1 overall pick , the Lions are going to have to invest a ton of money in the player , so it ’s better to go with a position that they ’re pretty sure will turn into at least a starter ( and has just as good of a chance of turning into a star or superstar ) .
In short , tackle has less upside and quarterback has more downside – linebacker is juuuuuust right .
Aaron Curry : The Lions ’ best bet .
Let ’s bring in Anthony Stalter for some back - and - forth about the numbers and what they say about how NFL teams should approach their first round picks .
Anthony :
For those who have followed the NFL over the years and more specifically , paid attention as prospects made the jump from college to the pros , it ’s easy to understand why quarterbacks , wideouts and cornerbacks are considered risky picks in the first round .
It ’s the age of free agency in the NFL and with that , teams need rookies to play right away even though quarterbacks , wideouts and cornerbacks would benefit from learning on the sidelines for a year or two before they saw extensive game action .
Granted , wideouts do n’t have to download as much as quarterbacks in terms of recognizing defenses and learning the playbook , but most colleges do n’t run pro style offenses and therefore it takes longer for them to learn how to run routes and understand the nuances of trying to get open .
When you factor in how big the expectations are because these prospects are first rounders , it ’s easy to understand why the failure rate is so high .
If these players are n’t struggling to learn the game , they ’re surely crumbling under the lofty expectations bestowed upon them for being high draft picks .
What ’s interesting about this particular debate as it relates to the Lions is that word is they ’re trying to trade out of the No. 1 slot so they do n’t have to carry the financial burden that comes along with having the top overall pick .
But if Detroit is so concerned with the amount of money they ’ll have to pay the No. 1 pick , then taking a quarterback or an offensive tackle is unwise .
The top quarterback in last year ’s draft was Matt Ryan , who went No. 3 overall to the Falcons .
Ryan signed a six - year , $ 72 million contract that included $ 34.75 million in guarantees .
Jake Long , who was selected No. 1 overall by the Dolphins and who was also the top offensive tackle in last year ’s draft , signed a five - year , $ 57.75 million deal that included $ 30 million in guarantees .
So , whether the Lions drafted Smith or Stafford , they ’d still have to commit roughly $ 12 to $ 15 million a year towards one of those players .
Some analysts ( including me ) consider Curry as the best player in the draft and he fits a major need for the Lions .
When you factor in that the Lions are worried about the potential cap hit that they would endure in going with either Stafford or Smith , as well as the fact that linebackers have generally been one of the safest positions to draft in the first round , Curry would appear to be a slam dunk for Detroit at No. 1 .
By the way , the Jets made Vernon Gholston the top linebacker in the 2008 NFL Draft when they selected him with the No. 6 overall pick .
They signed Gholston to a five - year , $ 32.5 million contract that included $ 21 million in guarantees .
Even though Curry would make more as the No. 1 overall pick , if the Lions selected him they would be looking at a yearly cap hit of roughly $ 5 to $ 8 mil less than if they chose Stafford or Smith .
Gholston ’s salary means the Lions can sign LB Curry for less than QB Stafford or T Smith .
JP : The fact that the Lions would want to trade out of the # 1 pick for financial reasons ( not necessarily to load up on picks in order to fill more holes ) just goes to show how out of whack the rookie salary structure is in the NFL .
These guys are paid like they ’re stars no matter what , even when the numbers show that less than one in five first round picks actually turns out to be a star or superstar .
It seems like , all things being equal , Curry should be the pick because not only is linebacker a “ safer ” position than quarterback or tackle , Detroit wo n’t have to pay him nearly as much on a per season basis .
Is there a pro-QB or pro-tackle argument to be made based on overall league depth at the position ?
Is a great tackle or QB harder to come by than a great linebacker ?
Anthony : I would say so .
Star QBs are few and far between , but there ’s no guarantee that you ’ll find one in the first round .
Tom Brady was a seventh round pick , Drew Brees and Brett Favre were second rounders , and Tony Romo and Kurt Warner were undrafted .
Obviously Peyton Manning , Donovan McNabb and Eli Manning were all first rounders , but there are a ton of first round busts too .
I think star offensive tackles are hard to come by as well because it ’s hard to scout them .
You ca n’t just look at their size and say , “ Yep – he ’s going to be great . ”
Scouts have to take into account their size , strength , footwork and even their arm reach .
Linebackers , on the other hand , are usually easier to spot .
Did they show the ability to shed blocks in college ?
Are they fast enough to play sideline to sideline ?
Are they athletic enough to play on third downs and in obvious passing situations ?
And do n’t forget that there are more linebackers to choose from in college , too .
Four USC linebackers will be drafted this year and all of them will most likely go in the first three rounds .
There ’s only one USC quarterback that will be selected .
It ’s also easier for teams to recognize what kind of linebacker fits their scheme .
USC ’s Rey Maualuga can’t play outside linebacker in a 4 - 3 , but he definitely fits as a middle linebacker in that scheme or an inside linebacker in a 3 - 4 .
Virginia ’s Clint Sintim is n’t a great fit at middle linebacker in a 4 - 3 , but he would make a great strongside ‘ backer in that scheme .
So to answer your question – yes , in my opinion , a great tackle and / or quarterback is harder to come by than a great linebacker .
JP : Maybe it ’s the overall impact on the game by each position .
Is it true to say that a star QB will have more of an impact than a star linebacker ?
It would seem so .
A good QB will throw 20 - 30 passes every game and maybe run the ball a few times as well .
How many impact plays will a great LB make ?
Conversely , it would n’t seem like a star tackle would have a bigger impact than a star LB , would it ?
Anthony :
It ’s all relative .
That star tackle has to keep defenders off that good quarterback in order for him to throw 20 - 30 passes a game .
And that great linebacker can turn a game on its head by forcing a turnover , stopping a run in the backfield or making a game - saving tackle .
It ’s hard to grade impact on a football field .
Every position holds its own value and that ’s why football is the ultimate team game .
But at the risk of contradicting myself , I guess one could say that a quarterback has the ability to make the biggest impact .
After all , the ball is in his hands every play and we ’ve all seen what guys like Manning , Brady and Favre can do when they take over a game seemingly on their own .
But again , they ’re just one cog in the machine .
What everyone hopes to get with a first round QB .
JP : Maybe that ’s the risk / reward of drafting a QB in the first round .
The upside is you get a great player ( i.e. Peyton Manning ) who can help you win for years to come .
The downside is your pick is a bust ( i.e. Ryan Leaf ) .
Manning could turn the Lions around but Leaf would be some of the same ol ’ same ol ’ .
You mentioned how rookie QBs , WRs and CBs need time to learn the position – is that why those positions have such a high bust rate ?
I ’d probably throw tight ends into that category as well .
I keep hearing over and over how difficult of a position it is to learn .
The chances of getting a starter at those four positions are all in the 45 - 55 % range .
But running back is a position that has a reputation for being fairly easy to pick up , yet its Starter + rate is only 57 % .
What is it about running back that depresses this success rate as it relates to the offensive line , defensive line , linebacker and safety ?
My theory is since RB is one of the so - called “ skill positions ” and the best college players at these positions generally get a lot of attention while in school , that the NFL general managers end up pulling the trigger on these players too early on draft day .
Anthony :
The running back position perplexes me when I look at the numbers you mentioned because , generally speaking , that is one of the easiest positions to learn coming out of college .
So why have n’t running backs taken in the first round found much success ?
One notion I have revolves around teams focusing too much on the size and speed of a running back prospect and not taking into account how good his vision is .
( I ’m obviously not talking about his actual vision in terms of being 20 / 20 or what have you , but him being able to read holes and get up the field . )
Players like T.J. Duckett , Curtis Enis , William Green and Ron Dayne all had the size teams looked for , but clearly lacked the ability to recognize where the holes were so that they could make their cuts and get up field .
Teams fell in love with Trung Canidate , John Avery and Michael Bennett ’s speed , but all that speed will be neutralized if a back does n’t have the awareness to get through that initial hole as quickly as he can and get to the next level .
Now look at guys like Warrick Dunn , Shaun Alexander and LaDainian Tomlinson .
Do those players have the best combination of size and speed ?
Nope .
Dunn has always been too small , Alexander has never had enough top end speed and LT is n’t the biggest back in the league at 5 ’ 10 ” , 221 - pounds .
But they all have tremendous vision and that ’s what separates them from other backs taken in the first round .
You asked if quarterbacks , wideouts and cornerbacks have higher bust rates than other positions because of the learning curve and I would have to say yes , that ’s a huge part of it .
Skill position players coming out of college have a hard time adjusting to the speed of the game .
Throw in the amount of knowledge they must attain from playbooks and game film – as well as the lofty expectations for being a first round pick – and you create a tough environment for these players to succeed in .
The game of football has always been the same , but the amount of preparation that goes into just one NFL game is unrivaled by any other sport .
It ’s why fewer than 1,700 players make it on NFL rosters every year .
Dunn is proof that good vision is more important than size or speed .
JP : So when scouting a running back , people should be looking at the percentage of times the player made the correct cut more than they should be looking at his 40 time or overall size ?
That makes sense .
One last question – given these numbers , if you were running a draft room , would they impact how you proceeded in the first round ?
We both agree that Curry is the safest ( and therefore probably the best ) pick for the Lions , but what if you were faced with a different decision .
Let ’s say that you are the owner of the # 10 pick in the draft and you have holes at DE , WR and FS .
Picking 10th , your team is mediocre and is probably at least two years away from seriously contending .
You ’ve done a crapload of scouting , and the next three players on your draft board are a WR ( # 10 ) , a DE ( # 11 ) and a FS ( # 12 ) .
You have the WR ranked slightly ahead of the other two players , but all three are in the same tier ( i.e. there is n’t a big drop off between any of them ) .
Knowing that the WR has a Star+ of 24 % and a Starter + of 49 % , the DE has a Star+ of 17 % and a Starter + of 79 % and the safety has a Star+ of 27 % and a Starter + of 91 % , who do you draft ?
Are these numbers strong enough to draft the safety over the other two positions , or do you go with your scouting grades and take the slight favorite ( the WR ) ?
Or do these numbers justify taking the DE ?
Anthony : I think these ratings would be very beneficial to a team , assuming of course that they agree with my player rankings .
But the thing to keep in mind is that not all of the 32 teams run the same offensive and defensive schemes .
So certain prospects do n’t appeal to some teams like they do others .
That might be an obvious statement , but I do n’t want any reader to interpret our discussion and findings as the end all / be all for how to draft a player .
But your mock scenario is a good one , so I ’ll play along .
If I have the # 10 pick in the draft and I have needs at WR , DE and FS , and there are WR , DE and FS prospects that are available and I have them similarly rated , then I ’m going with the FS .
If I know there ’s a 91 % chance that I ’m going to get a starter at the No. 10 pick and that he filled a need and was high on my board , I would jump at the opportunity .
I ’ll also throw in the fact that having an impact safety in the NFL is almost becoming a necessity .
Look at the safeties in the final four playoff teams last year : Adrian Wilson ( Cardinals ) , Ed Reed ( Ravens ) , Troy Polomalu ( Steelers ) and Brian Dawkins ( Eagles ) .
Another interesting point of view is the one of a fan .
As a fan , I look at these rankings and I hope that my favorite team takes a player in the first round that plays a position that has a high success rate of turning into a starter ( i.e. LB , S , G ) .
Granted , most guards are n’t selected in the top 20 and this year ’s safety class is weak , but in general , I would want my team to stay away from positions that have a lower success rate .
JP : If I were running a draft room , I ’d definitely use these numbers to guide my picks .
I ’d have to be really sure about a skill position player before burning a first round pick and I ’d only go that route if I did n’t have any other holes to fill .
Thanks for your time , Anthony , and once the draft is done , we ’ll definitely look back at the first round to see what kind of decision process each team used .
Anthony :
Thanks , this was fun .
CHICAGO 
At first glance , Chicago ’s latest crime - fighting strategy seems to be plucked from a Hollywood screenplay .
Someone sees a thief dipping into a Salvation Army kettle in a crowd of shoppers on State Street and dials 911 from a cellphone .
Within seconds , a video image of the caller ’s location is beamed onto a dispatcher ’s computer screen .
An officer arrives and by police radio is directed to the suspect , whose description and precise location are conveyed by the dispatcher watching the video , leading to a quick arrest .
That chain of events actually happened in the Loop in December , said Ray Orozco , the executive director of the Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications .
“ We can now immediately take a look at the crime scene if the 911 caller is in a location within 150 feet of one of our surveillance cameras , even before the first responders arrive , ” Mr. Orozco said .
The technology , a computer - aided dispatch system , was paid for with a $ 6 million grant from the Department of Homeland Security .
It has been in use since a trial run in December .
“ One of the best tools any big city can have is visual indicators like cameras , which can help save lives , ” Mr. Orozco said .
It is time for some sounds from the mighty Aphex Twin .
Here is a recorded set by him and Hecker at the BLOC Weekend .

Finally …we ’re back in London .
We left at the beginning of April…went to San Diego and Los Angeles … then to Buenos Aires and Salta …then to Paris for a few days .. and now we ’re back .
London is cold and rainy … just like we left it .
Not exactly home … but it will do .
But what ’s this ?
The City seems to be winding down .
All those hot shots in the financial sector are n’t so hot any more .
In the space of just ten years , the percentage of GDP generated by the financial sector almost doubled – from 5.5 % in 1996 to 10.8 % a decade later .
But now the whole sector is shrinking … along with bonuses … payrolls …and expense accounts .
And since Britain counted so heavily on the financial high fliers and their money … the whole country seems to have gone into a funk .
Tax revenues are collapsing .
Deficits are soaring .
The U.K. ’s national budget deficit is already at 12 % … about even with the United States .
But if current trends continue , she ’ll soon have the largest deficit in the developed world .
But here comes the bad news .
Your editor did n’t mind when investor and speculators lost trillions .
He barely noticed when the U.S. government practically nationalized the largest banks , insurance and automobile companies .
He hardly blinked when $ 13 trillion of the nation ’s treasure was committed to a foolhardy effort to combat capitalism .
But now they are going too far .
In an effort to raise money , the British government is raising your editor ’s taxes !
Yes …your poor editor pays taxes in several countries .
And now the Brits are raising their rates to levels that rival those of the highest tax jurisdictions in the world – Sweden , Norway and the Netherlands .
The trouble with this strategy is that your editor just bought a pair of Argentine boots .
And these boots are made for walking .
If these news taxes pinch too hard he – and thousands of other people working , vaguely , in the financial sector – is likely to walk right out of here .
But to where ?
Ah… there ’s the rub .
All over the world , governments are desperate to get out of the mess they ’ve gotten themselves in .
Argentina and Ireland just got handouts from the IMF .
Other countries are getting in line .
Having spent far too much in the past , they now spend more – hoping that spending will miraculously bring about economic growth .
We say “ miraculously ” because there is no other way to explain it .
When economic growth results from saving , investing and hard work you can describe it in terms of ‘ cause and effect . ’
But if you ever get economic growth simply by spending money , you can only refer to it as an act of God…or the devil .
Black magic , maybe .
Voodoo economics .
Hardly a day goes by without some abracadabra or hocus pocus announcement .
The feds bail out the banks on Monday .
On Tuesday , they take over the auto industry .
By Wednesday , they ’re passing out money on Wall Street .
If any of these tactics result in greater wealth or more output – it will be a miracle .
One question that has so far been avoided by practically all the commentators and well - wishers is this : where ’s the money come from ?
In the popular mind , if you can call it that , the government ’s pockets are infinitely deep .
Reach down far enough and you will pull up whatever resources you need .
But the fact of the matter is a bit different .
In time of war , a government can marshal the resources of an entire nation .
People believe they must buy war bonds , collect old metal , use rationing coupons , forego salary increases , pay higher taxes , and sign up for the Home Guard .
Every back bends to the job ; better that than bending to the lash , people say to themselves .
But the war against capitalism is not getting the same level of popular support .
People are not buying “ war bonds ” so the feds can bail out Wall Street or the City .
They ’re not likely to eat margarine so the bankers can slather real butter on both sides of their bread .
And they ’re not willing to spend less just so the government can spend more .
So instead of asking the whole population to suffer , the feds – both in Britain and back at home in America – have chosen an easy target … the rich !
In the public mind , ‘ rich ’ and ‘ banker ’ are inseparable .
Like ‘ corrupt ’ and ‘ politician . ’
What ’s more , the rich were at the scene of the crime when the financial crisis began .
The rich were caught red -handed .
It does n’t matter if the ‘ rich ’ man earned his money from doing heart operations or selling vegetables .
Every rich person is presumed guilty of the crime of the century .
“ Tax them ! ” screams the mob .
Tax them !
Tax them !
Eat them .
And so , it will come to pass that ‘ the rich ’ are taxed .
The money will be taken from them and given to …well … the rich .
But these will be different rich people – bondholders … bankers … insiders … hustlers and anglers .
Now , we turn to Addison , who is busy deciphering the GDP numbers :
“ Well , ‘ less awful ’ it is : The Commerce Department says first - quarter GDP dropped an annualized 6.1 % , ” writes Addison in today ’s issue of The 5 Min. Forecast .
“ That ’s a tough number .
Wonks , quants and analysts on Wall Street expected an annualized 4.6 % decline .
But the ‘ official ’ number is still a minuscule improvement over the 6.3 % rate for the fourth quarter of last year .
“ But lest you should strive to breathe easy , put the two quarters together and you have the weakest six months in the U.S economy since 1957 - 58 .
One more quarter of contraction and we ’ll officially have the longest recession since the Great Depression .
“ One caveat : Commerce issues three estimates of quarterly GDP growth , and this is just the first .
Expect revisions .
“ The GDP numbers form an interesting backdrop for today ’s meeting of the Federal Reserve ’s Open Market Committee .
The Fed ’s “ deflation boogeyman ” is retreating , for one .
Personal consumption grew 2.2 % in the first quarter … much better than the 4.9 % decline in the previous quarter .
“ So what will the Fed do ?
Predictions in mainstream financial media run all over the map .
One says the Fed will hold off on any more purchases of Treasuries and mortgage securities as long as ‘ green shoots ’ ( like the housing and consumer confidence numbers yesterday ) keep showing up in the economic data .
“ Another speculates some sort of loose - money measures are in the offing to fight the economic effects of the swine flu outbreak .
“ We ’re not going to venture a guess .
We ’ll only remind you that in the Fed ’s fantasy world , interest rates right now would be at minus 5 % .
And go from there . ”
Each weekday , Addison brings readers
The 5 Min Forecast , an executive series e-letter that provides a quick and dirty analysis of daily economic and financial developments – in five minutes or less .
And back to Bill with more thoughts :
The Dow fell 8 points yesterday .
Oil slipped below $ 50 .
Gold slipped too – below $ 900 .
What gives ?
As far as we can tell , the rally that began in March continues .
While it might peter out any day , we continue to believe that this market intends bloody mayhem …and that it wo n’t stop until it has killed both the bulls and the bears .
The bulls will be killed in the classic way .
A strong rally on Wall Street …or a series of minor ones … will lead them to believe that “ the worst is over . ”
They ’ll get back into stocks after a 20 % or 30 % advance – hoping to recover what they lost last year .
Then , the stock market will make a new dramatic move to the downside .
This will probably happen several times … each time leaving bullish investors with more losses .
Finally , the bulls will give up .
They will sell stocks … driving prices down and dividend yields up .
By the time the bottom is reached , former investors will neither know nor care .
P/ Es will be scarcely more than 5 .
Dividend yields will rise above 5 % .
The Dow will sink to 3,000 – 5,000 .
Then , it will be the bears ’ turn .
When stock prices go down , they ’ll sit smugly with their cash , Treasuries and gold .
But gold will not resist the deflationary whirlpool .
It could get sucked down violently …or might just float down gently , remaining low for a long time .
Either way , the gold bulls will give up .
Only the gold bugs will hold on .
Cash and Treasuries , meanwhile , will look smart – for a while .
Then , suddenly , they will look like the stupidest investment on the planet .
In a matter of days … maybe weeks … the dollar could lose half or more of its value .
Savers will suffer staggering losses .
No , dear reader , the months ahead will be a challenge .
The world economy is telling a story no one has ever read before .
Every day we turn the page just to see what happens .
We have no idea how the story might develop .
It ’s all guesswork .
Still , when the final chapter is read out … the moral of the story will probably be familiar to us .
It always is .
China has increased their gold holdings 75 % in the last six years .
They recently announced that the gold holdings have been transferred from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ) books to the People ’s Bank of China .
PBOC .
Our intrepid correspondent , Byron King explains what this really means :
“ China is monetizing its gold !
“ This SAFE - to - PBOC transfer marks a profound decision by Chinese government leaders .
Obviously , the Chinese government has bought gold over the past six years .
But in keeping with a nation where youngsters get their Sun Tzu with their mother ’s milk , the Chinese went through an internal debate over whether to add the gold holdings to the official Chinese monetary reserves .
That is , if the gold was not “ monetary , ” then it was just another nonmonetary investment commodity like iron ore or copper or petroleum .
“ But now , with the announcement by the Chinese Central Bank , it appears that the debate is resolved .
The gold has been added to Chinese monetary reserves .
“ This action by China is part and parcel of an under - the - radar global effort to rehabilitate gold as a monetary reserve asset .
Gold has not been a factor in global trade and currency exchange since the late 1960s .
But there ’s a powerful movement afoot in the world to reestablish gold as part of an international monetary system .
It ’s because the U.S. dollar has been so badly mismanaged over the decades .
No , you wo n’t read about it in your local newspaper , or even in the standard , mainstream business media .
But that movement is out there .
It ’s happening .
“ So now the Chinese are primed to begin using gold as a monetary asset .
What ’s the practical impact ?
I expect to see central banks worldwide start to add gold to their monetary reserves .
The floodgates are opening .
The PBOC and other central banks from here to Timbuktu are going to become net purchasers of gold in the years ahead .
In the future , only central bank suckers and losers will be net sellers of gold .
( Take note , IMF . )
“ And people who own physical gold , as well as shares in well - managed mining companies , will benefit greatly .
Need I say more ? ”
The plane coming back from Buenos Aires was n’t full .
Air traffic is down 11 % from a year earlier .
And this was before people began worrying about swine flu .
Today , commentators are fretting about how a serious epidemic would affect the “ recovery . ”
They need n’t worry .
First , because there is no genuine recovery to worry about .
Second , because if a serious epidemic were to hit the world , economic growth would be the least of our problems .
Until tomorrow ,

Heavy snow is causing disruption in the northern England and north east Scotland .

Meanwhile , falling snow has created difficult driving conditions for motorists in Newcastle , County Durham and North Yorkshire as Danny Savage reports .
MySpace is only just behind rival Facebook , with 130 m users Social networking site MySpace has deleted the accounts of 90,000 users it has identified as sex offenders .
The site was responding to a call from state attorneys general in the US to provide a list of offenders on its roster .
MySpace and rival site Facebook have committed to making their sites safer for the growing number of young users .
However , Facebook 's measures to keep sex offenders off its site have been called into question .
The 90,000 sex offenders found on MySpace represent a significant increase and the figure is nearly twice that predicted by MySpace officials last year in a preliminary estimate .
Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal , who is spearheading efforts in the US to make social networking sites safer for children , was not surprised by the number , telling the AP news agency that it " provides compelling proof that social networking sites remain rife with sexual predators . "
Further moves by both sites to tighten safety include stricter age verification and limiting contact between under - and over - 18s .
Round two
It is not the first time that MySpace has removed sex offenders from its site ; in 2007 some 29,000 users were blocked for the same reason .
For that effort , MySpace worked with security company Sentinel to develop a database that matched user profiles to data on convicted sex offenders .
Facebook does not use the Sentinel database , but employs its own " innovative and complex systems to proactively monitor the site and its users " , according to a statement .
An investigation by website TechCrunch cross-referenced a list provided by Sentinel against Facebook users and found more than 8,000 potential matches .
In its own investigation following TechCrunch 's find , Facebook disabled more than 4,000 accounts with user IDs associated with those on the list .
Facebook spokesman Barry Schmidt added that the external investigation was flawed , and that Facebook 's own tools were more effective .
" Facebook does not allow the same investigations by an outsider as by insiders , " he said .
Facebook has also been asked to provide a roster of sex offenders among its ranks for the state attorneys general , but has not yet responded .
Speaking to the BBC , a Facebook spokesperson was unable to go into detail about its timeline .
" We 've been working productively with Attorney General Blumenthal 's office for more than three years on these issues and we will continue that collaboration . "

People close to Clinton said he has largely got over his resentment at Obama but not toward Ted Kennedy and his niece , Caroline Kennedy .
As Clinton sees it , they say , he did so much for the Kennedys over the years that he felt they became almost family .
Nor has he forgiven Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico , who endorsed Obama even though Clinton appointed him to two cabinet posts .
And the man once called the “ first black president ” remains deeply wounded by allegations that he made racially insensitive remarks during the campaign , like dismissing Obama ’s South Carolina win by comparing it with Jesse Jackson ’s victories there in the 1980s .
“ None of them ever really took seriously the race rap , ” he told me .
“ They knew it was politics .
I had one minister in Texas in the general election come up and put his arm around me . ”
This was an Obama supporter .
“ And he came up , threw his arm around me and said , ‘ You ’ve got to forgive us for that race deal . ’
He said , ‘ That was out of line . ’
But he said , ‘ You know , we wanted to win real bad . ’
And I said , ‘ I got no problem with that . ’
I said it ’s fine ; it ’s O.K .
And we laughed about it and we went on . ”
The other side is moving on , too .
Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina , who once recalled an angry Clinton berating him on the phone for criticizing the former president ’s campaign rhetoric , is letting bygones be bygones , at least publicly .
“ No fence - mending is needed , ” Clyburn said through a spokeswoman .
Yet if Clinton has a powerful memory for slights , he also has a remarkable capacity for reconciliation .
He is likelier to find peace with people who hate him the most than with friends who betray him .
He focuses his considerable charms on seducing the person in the room he finds most resistant .
Among those he has been friendly with lately is Christopher Ruddy , a conservative journalist who was a chief proponent of cover - up theories involving the Clintons during the 1990s .
In his book , “ The Strange Death of Vincent Foster , ” Ruddy rejected official findings that Foster , a deputy White House counsel , killed himself in a Virginia park and suggested the possibility of “ a cover - up conducted by people who have , with the help of the press , placed themselves above the law . ”
Ruddy also advanced the notion that Ron Brown , the Clinton commerce secretary who died in an airplane crash in Croatia in 1996 , was actually shot in the head .
Ruddy today is the founder and chief executive of Newsmax , a conservative news - magazine .
He told me he came around on Clinton after Ed Koch , the former New York mayor , introduced them .
That led to lunches and more contacts , and now Ruddy says he was wrong about Clinton .
“ I do consider Bill Clinton a friend , and I think he would consider me a friend , ” Ruddy said .
“ And to think of all the wars we went through in the ’90s , it seems almost surreal . ”
With the passage of time , Ruddy said he came to believe that Clinton was much less liberal than his enemies thought .
After all , Clinton overhauled welfare , tamed the deficit and promoted free trade .
While still a proud “ Reagan conservative , ” Ruddy said he now thinks the attacks on Clinton in the 1990s went too far .
“ Did we like and enjoy all the salacious reporting and all the stuff going on in the ’ 90s ? ” he asked .
“ I guess we thought , This is just politics .
But looking back at my role , I was probably over the top .
And if I knew then what I know today , I would n’t have pursued some of that stuff as aggressively as I did .
I did an honest reporter ’s job .
But I have a different take on it now . ”
Ruddy also attributes his change of heart to Clinton ’s foundation , which has impressed him and other onetime foes .
Richard Mellon Scaife , the billionaire publisher who financed Ruddy ’s investigations and other anti-Clinton activities , is now a contributor to the foundation .
So is Rupert Murdoch , the News Corporation chairman whose Fox News was a regular thorn in Clinton ’s side .
Clinton over the years has also made peace with other former adversaries , like Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich .
The elder George Bush told me he now considers Clinton “ a real friend . ”
When I asked what changed his view , he wrote in an e-mail message : “ I did n’t know him personally back then .
I knew him , but not up close and personal .
Now I do . ”
Clinton ’s relationship with the younger Bush evolved over the years .
“ President Bush the latter did n’t like me very much , because I defeated his father , and it was obvious to me when he came to the White House when I was president and he was governor of Texas , ” Clinton recalled .
“ Jeb was a better actor . ”
The bad blood increased when Clinton left the White House and stories emerged about W ’s being removed from computer keyboards and so forth , much of which proved to be exaggerated or untrue .
The Bush crew bitterly complained that the Clinton team did little to help them ; Clinton was bitter at the whisper campaign trashing him .
“ I had a talk with him about it one day , a real frank talk , because they were being rough , ” Clinton told me .
“ I told him that I understood how he felt , and it did n’t bother me .
I liked the fact that he loved his father and that I felt a great affection for his father , too .
But I said : ‘ I ’ll tell you what , I ’ll make you a deal .
If you ever need me to do something for you and I can do it consistent with my conscience , I ’ll do it . ’ ”
The following pictures are over six years in the making .
Shortly after moving to East Tennessee I saw something that I just had to photograph .
Do n’t ask me what took so long but the opportunity finally presented itself so I figured I ’d share the pictures in hopes that it puts a smile on your face like it has mine so many times as I ’ve driven past this location .
Whoever said you ca n’t get saved , butchered , and buried all in one convenient location ?
A navigational instrument , an encrusted silver coin , and a thimble 's worth of gold bits are just some of the artifacts recently recovered from a shipwreck thought to be the Queen Anne 's Revenge , the ship of the infamous 18th - century pirate Blackbeard , archaeologists said in March 2009 .
Some of the newfound relics add to evidence that the ship belonged to the pirate .
" We feel pretty comfortable that that 's what this is , " said Marke Wilde - Ramsing , director of the Queen Anne 's Revenge project for the North Carolina Office of State Archaeology .

The End Run blog just sent me an interesting video of a recent speech by Lawrence Korb .
Korb is a consummate insider – Assistant Secretary of Defense from 1981 - 1985 during the Reagan Administration , Vice President of the Council of Foreign Relations ( CFR ) from 1998 - 2002 , CFR ’s director of National Security Studies , Vice President of Corporate Operations at Raytheon , and advisor to Barack Obama during Obama ’s presidential campaign .
Korb said that we need to keep fighting the war in Afghanistan for at least 10 more years , and that we need 100,000 plus troops .
( Article continues below )
Korb all but admitted that Americans are opposed to a long war in Afghanistan and that the U.S was grasping at straws for a rationale for still being there .
He also said some interesting things about 9/11
Read the End Run ’s write up or watch Korb ’s speech here .
Our youth deserve the opportunity to complete their high school and college education , free of early parenthood .
We can make a difference by advocating for effective sex education .
It ’s about time we make the well - being
of our young people more important than ideology and politics .
As a country , we benefit from investing in their future by investing
in teen pregnancy prevention .
Our youth deserve the opportunity
to complete their high school and college education , free of early parenthood .
Their future children deserve the opportunity to grow up in financially
and emotionally stable homes .
Our communities benefit from healthy ,

The Title V funding for abstinence - only
programs is up for reauthorization by Congress .
Since 1982 , the US government
has allocated $ 3.6
billion to abstinence only - until - marriage
programs and has received a dismal return on its investment .
And
not surprisingly – these programs have very little evidence of effectiveness .
Mathematica Policy Research conducted a national evaluation of abstinence - only
programs and its findings show abstinence - only programs have no
beneficial impact on whether young people abstain from sex , delay sexual
activity , or reduce the number of sexual partners .
This lack of
evidence demands we take a different approach to sexual health education .
The US has the highest teen birth rate of all industrialized nations
at 41.9 per 1,000 girls age 15 - 19 .
By comparison ,
the next closest country is the United Kingdom at 26.7 per 1,000 .
In my home state of Georgia , the state
government has received $ 22.4 million in federal funding for abstinence - only
programs over the last two years .
Georgia ’s spending on abstinence - only
programs is two times the amount of funds just approved by the state
legislature for funding teen centers , which provide critical services
including prevention education , counseling , and services for sexually
active youth .

In the face of an aggressive abstinence - only industry , three students in Savannah , GA fight to resist five more years of government funding for these ineffective programs in their public schools .
A teacher of abstinence education for twenty years admits in an on camera interview that comprehensive sex education would be a better way to combat some of the highest teen birth rates in the country .
Georgia ranks 10 th
nationally in teen birth
rates at 54.2 per 1,000 girls age 15 - 19 .
Georgia is 2nd
in repeat pregnancies , 6th in chlamydia , 5th in
gonorrhea , 3rd in syphilis and 9th in AIDS cases .
All told , abstinence - only education , as a program to safeguard young
people from high - risk behavior that leads to unintended outcomes , has
failed miserably .
The persistent status of Georgia among the top
10 worst states for reproductive and sexual health outcomes in teens
illustrates the shortcomings of a policy that insists on teaching abstinence - only - until - marriage as the core sex education strategy .
In 1995 , when Georgia had the highest
teen pregnancy rate in the US , I founded The Georgia Campaign for Adolescent
Pregnancy Prevention ( G - CAPP ) .
G-CAPP brings together community and
school leaders , health officials , and students to advocate for age appropriate ,
evidence - based sex education curricula within local schools and federal
policy to fund comprehensive sex education programs .
Our young people are clamoring for
sex education .
Time and time again , we hear from high school students
saying the sex education they receive is inadequate , it comes too late ,
and it does not teach them the skills they need to act responsibly .
In Savannah , Georgia , where the teen
pregnancy rates are more than double the US rates , three teens are fighting
to replace the harmful abstinence - only - until marriage program " Choosing
the Best " in their school district with comprehensive sex education .
They are rightfully concerned that their school district has signed
on for five more years of the same ineffective curriculum .
G-CAPP is working with 30 youth from
around the state to get their voices heard .
The Georgia Student Youth
Leadership Council ( SYLC ) is a group of dynamic young people who are
actively engaged in mobilizing other youth advocates to bring attention
to the need for better sex education .
Our work is part of a collective
movement in the Southeast region , which has the highest rate of teen
pregnancy .
In Mississippi , the House adopted HB 808 which would require comprehensive sex education
to be taught in grades K through 12 .
The bill died in the Senate ,
but a major victory nonetheless .
In North Carolina , HB 88 would require schools to offer both abstinence - only
and comprehensive sex education giving parents the ability to decide
which program their child would participate in .
The bill is expected
to go before the House for a vote .
In Texas , a recent report showing the ineffectiveness of abstinence - only
programs stated " our schools are failing Texas families by turning
out generations of sexually illiterate young people at a time of high
rates of teen pregnancy and STDs . "
In Florida , SIECUS released a
similar report .
The past administrations have wasted
opportunities to use our government resources to teach our young people
how to make good decisions about their health .
It is time to we advocate
for policies and programs capable of addressing the root causes of adolescent
pregnancy and teach our young people the skills they need to live healthy ,
productive lives .
Our future depends on it .
Two Brentwood publicists said they dropped octuplets mom Nadya Suleman as a client Saturday because they have received a slew of death threats .
Suleman , a 33 - year - old Whittier resident , was unmarried , unemployed and already had six children using a sperm donor when she gave birth to eight children from the same donor Jan. 26 at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Bellflower .
Joann Killeen , president of Killeen Furtney Group , said she and husband Mike Furtney decided to drop Suleman early Saturday .
Soon after the births , the couple began representing Suleman for free , and almost immediately started receiving threatening e-mails and phone calls from people enraged over the octuplets saga , she said .
“ They hope I die , they hope my business goes under , they want to rip her uterus out , ” Killeen said .
“ They say I should be anesthetized and put down like a dog . ”

Killeen said she and Suleman felt so threatened that last week they stayed at an undisclosed “ secure location ” for a few days before returning home .
The babies are still being treated at the hospital , Killeen said .
After creating a website for Suleman on Tuesday , Killeen said , she received 55,000 e-mails , most of them negative , and she has stacks of angry mail .
Killeen said she and her husband became afraid enough to send their dogs to a kennel .
On Friday , they contacted the Los Angeles Police Department , and officers told them that the threats were the worst they had seen since the O.J. Simpson case , Killeen said .
“ The American public have just lashed out , ” she said .
“ I think it has to do with the economy , healthcare -- there ’s not a lot of jobs , people are unemployed and are trying to take care of their families . ”

Suleman has hired the Franklin , Tenn . - based Ambassador Agency Inc. to arrange a book deal and manage her appearances , Killeen said .
Ambassador represented an Iowa couple who had sextuplets in 1995 and the Rev. Rick Warren , pastor of Saddleback Valley Community Church in Lake Forest , who spoke at President Obama ’s inauguration .
The agency ’s president , Wes Yoder , did not return phone calls Saturday .

Are you worried that an organic garden on the White House grounds might cause some Americans to start eating a wide variety of chemical - free , locally grown produce ?
The Mid America CropLife Association , a lobbying group for agribusinesses giants , is .
Just a few days after Michelle Obama invited local fifth graders to help plant the White House Kitchen Garden , the MACA , a group which represents and is comprised of former executives from Dow AgroSciences , Monsanto and DuPont Crop Protection , sent the White House a letter ( which can be viewed in its entirety here ) expressing their disappointment that she had not “ recognize [d ] the role conventional agriculture plays in the US . ”
But that ’s not all .
The group went on to provide a dose of propaganda educational information , including little known fact that “ technology allows for farmers to meet the increasing demand for food and fiber in a sustainable manner . ”
Drawing a clear line between technology , undefined , and sustainability does not , in the strictest terms , suggest the group ’s total disapproval of organic farming methods .
That outright statement came in an email MACA sent their members shortly after sending the first lady aforementioned letter , in which they said that the idea of an organic garden “ made Janet Braun , CropLife Ambassador Coordinator and I shudder . ” [ italics mine ] .
MACA also informed Michelle Obama of the apparent causality between agricultural engineering and national pre-eminence in just about every field :
If Americans were still required to farm to support their family ’s basic food and fiber needs , would the US have been leaders in the advancement of science , communication , education , medicine , transportation and the arts ?
At least one group is reacting to the new War on Homegrown Tarragon .
Quickly responding to MACA ’s below the beltway tactics , Credo , the mobile phone company founded on the principle of social responsibility , has launched a campaign asking concerned citizens to “ Tell the Pesticide Peddlers :
We support Michelle Obama ’s organic garden . ”
How ungrateful of Credo , which evidently fails to realize that , were it not for the “ advancement in…communication ” made possible by agricultural engineering , they would not even exist .

If all this unrelenting violence is too much for you , you can try our other funny games :
Spanking is one of the main aspects of BDSM , that and bondage , add them together and the pleasure is intense , but even when taken separately the fun and enjoyment received from all parties is something that I personally love .
There is something about having a bare ass , waiting for the strike of my hand , the feel of the crop that I am wielding or the flogger as I lay it across her ass that I find a great turn on , and if the sub or slave is what I term a ‘ pain slut ’ then the spankings and the slapping become even more enjoyable .
One thing I have found is that is a sub or slave enjoys the paddle across her ass , then as a punishment it is not something that can have the desired effect , upon saying that , if a certain piece of equipment , say a rubber flogger , is used solely for punishment then they will in time learn to associate that with wrong doing , so it will have the desired effect , however I prefer to use other methods in punishment with those subs and slaves as the message comes across clearer that they have displeased me in some way .
The strength behind a slap or a spanking is something that can be built on , remember we are not trying to ‘ break ’ them by putting all our strength behind whipping them , that then goes from pleasure to abuse , however we are wanting to strike them hard enough for them to feel it , to enjoy it and build their threshold .
Practice with things you have lying around the house , a fly swat can deliver a nice spank as can a hair brush or slipper , in fact even a news paper when rolled tightly can make a sub or slave groan in pleasure and pain , the only limit to what is used is your imagination and your sub / slaves threshold .
Have fun and enjoy all that this activity can add to your sex life .
It was spring 1995 , and four Bentley College roommates had plastered the walls of their Waltham apartment with more job offers than rejection letters .
The economy was growing , and stocks were on the rise .
The guys were feeling good , the way college graduates could back then , confident that they would make it big in business .
By 2001 , Craig Berlinski and C.C. Chapman were earning more than their parents combined , and their college roommates Jim Spoto and Greg Maynard had made tens of thousands of dollars in the stock market .
Like many in their generation , the four roommates believed in an ever - expanding economy and an unstoppable stock market .
But now , Berlinski keeps extra money in savings accounts and refuses to look at his retirement fund .
Maynard and Spoto have watched their investments drop more than 50 percent .
And most of Chapman 's savings were wiped out when he carried two mortgages because he could n't sell his house after buying a new one .
Their first decade out of the school will be remembered not for its unprecedented boom , but for the striking string of bubbles that have burst : technology , housing , stocks .
This recession 's stunning job losses , plunging home values , and plummeting portfolios have turned 30 - somethings uncharacteristically cautious .
It 's a sweeping shift in psychology for a group that is entering its prime earning and spending years - one that could turn them into a generation of savers and have a lasting effect on the economy .
" If I did n't have the memories of the good times , it would n't be so hard to accept now , " said Berlinski , 36 , who described the high life working at EMC between 1997 and 2004 .
He traveled the world , ate out most nights , grew his brokerage account to $ 50,000 , and watched the Hopkinton tech company 's stock break $ 100 .
( Today it 's at about $ 10 . )
" But it was fiction .
And it has changed my mind and my approach . "
Thirty - somethings have been hit particularly hard by the current financial crisis , which last week sent the Dow Jones industrials average to its lowest level since 1997 .
Blame it on bad timing .
They often bought homes and stocks at or near their peaks and now face the steepest losses .
Indeed , over the past decade , this group has seen a greater accumulation and loss of wealth than any other age cohort , according to financial analysts .
In 2007 , households headed by someone under age 35 had an average household net worth of about $ 106,000 , said Michael Feroli , an economist at JPMorgan who recently detailed the trend in a report titled " The Young and the Leveraged . "
That sum plunged 28 percent to $ 76,000 by the end of 2008 , the largest drop among all age groups .
Meanwhile , the percentage of 30 - somethings taking hardship withdrawals from their retirement plans jumped to 2.6 percent at the end of last year from 0.9 percent in 2000 , according to Fidelity Investments .
" The investing experience over the past 10 years has totally skewed their view of the way markets typically work .
It 's definitely going to change the way this group does longer - term investing , " said Sharon Rich , a financial planner in Belmont .
" You saw after the Depression that the mentality of conservative investing - leaving it under the mattress or in the bank - lasted a generation . "
Such an attitude could stunt the economic recovery .
That 's because this age group is entering a period normally characterized by sustained spending , whether it 's starting a family , buying a bigger home , or getting another car .
Nigel Gault , chief US economist at IHS Global Insight , said many 30 - somethings could be reluctant to return to stock investments after their harsh realization that what goes way up can come crashing down quickly .
A new fiscal prudence and increased savings will ultimately help the economy in the long term , he added , but reduce the size or scope of future booms .
" They 've learned some lessons fairly early on that other generations have n't had to learn because we have n't seen market moves like this since the 1930s , " Gault said .
These days , Berlinksi , a staffing manager at Veritude , a temporary staffing firm , is feeling insecure .
His brokerage account has shed half of its value , falling to about $ 25,000 .
Job loss is on his mind .
Last year , Berlinski's $ 50,000 home equity line was slashed to $ 25,000 .
He can't refinance because the Framingham home he bought for $ 295,000 in 2001 is now worth about $ 265,000 .
So projects like a new deck and driveway are on hold .
" It 's all been so jolting , " said Berlinski , who majored in business communications .
Chapman , too , is feeling the brunt of the housing bust .
At the start of the decade , Chapman , who studied computer information systems , had saved more than $ 25,000 in retirement funds working in information technology .
But he drained that account in 2003 to buy a small home in Milford for $ 250,000 .
At the time , it seemed like a no - brainer .
Chapman and his wife figured they could live there comfortably for five years , and , given the way housing prices were soaring around them , make a profit when they wanted to upgrade .
In summer 2007 , they fell in love with a new , larger home and signed the mortgage without selling their first house .
They put the old home up for $ 265,000 .
And then they waited in agony , lowering the price for nine months while paying both mortgages , until someone was willing to buy it for $ 220,000 last April .
" It was hell , " said Chapman , who has two children .
" Paying two mortgages is not easy , and it drained whatever savings we had . "
Today , his retirement fund is pretty barren ; he has n't made a contribution since starting a digital marketing firm in 2007 .
Any extra money these days is in a cash account , including flexible CDs that do n't charge withdrawal fees , a choice spurred by the hard lessons the 35 - year - old has learned .
Today 246 years ago – 23 April , 1773 – John Wilkes published the North Briton No 45 , the final issue of his polemical magazine , which attacked the king and ministers for their corruption and abuse of power .
It is a famous moment in the history of English liberty forced by Wilkes 's exuberant daring and disdain for the authorities , which replied with an arrest warrant for anyone connected with the publication of No 45 .
I thought of Wilkes yesterday during the conference on a new bill of rights staged by the joint committee on human rights in Westminster , and wondered what his high - spirited ghost would have made of it all .
Bizarre is the word that strikes me : a room full of about 40 decent , experienced , intelligent people – academics , lawyers , campaigners and politicians – treating each other with the utmost courtesy while they traded points about a new bill of rights and responsibilities .
It could not have been more removed from the reality of Britain today or the attack on rights and liberties that our society has suffered under this morally and financially bankrupt regime .
Do n't take my word for it – look at today 's newspapers .
Once you 've waded through the appalling news about Britain 's public finances there 's plenty of evidence of something seriously wrong at the heart of the body politic .
Lets start with Ed Balls , minister for children and self - promotion , intimate of Damian McBride , who is accused of misleading parliament by the hapless former chief executive of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority , Ken Boston .
It is all a bit dry and technical but what we should take away from Boston 's evidence to the children , schools and families select committee yesterday is that Balls dumped on Boston in an inquiry in which he prohibited Lord Sutherland to investigate the government 's responsibility in the Sats test fiasco .
He is able to do this because of the Inquiries Act 2005 , which was brought in by Labour to make ministers more powerful and government less accountable .
Balls , not a man of conscience it seems , had no hesitation in " sexing up " the evidence against Boston .
Turn the page and you find another minister exposed for deceit .
David Miliband , the foreign secretary , apparently misled high court judges by claiming that the US would stop sharing intelligence with Britain if documents were disclosed showing MI5 's complicity in the torture of Binyam Mohamed .
Lawyers acting for Mohamed claim the Foreign Office made " false assertions " – ie lied – when it said it had contacted President Barack Obama 's office and was told that America would cease co-operation .
The court has also heard MI5 apologise for misleading statements – ie lies – which disguised the amount they knew about Mohamed 's " secret interrogation " – ie torture – in Morocco .
The same news story delivers the unbelievable information that 17 MI5 and MI6 officers are to be accused of involvement in the extraordinary rendition and torture of seven British citizens and residents .
Of course the officers are innocent until proven guilty so we must make no assumptions about these cases but it is shocking even to read this about officials of the modern British state , which so many were willing to trust with 42 - day detention without charge .
You begin to wonder whether people in authority have lost the ability to tell right from wrong , or simply go on saying things when they know they are wrong , which in a way is worse .
Yesterday we had Sir Paul Stephenson , the new commissioner of the Met , insisting that his force had mounted an astonishing operation during the G20 summit .
He also praised the violent Territorial Support Group , one of whose members attacked Ian Tomlinson moments before he died .
Maybe this was for the consumption of his officers , who have suffered severe criticism for a number of incidents over the last few weeks , but leadership of the Met must include a willingness to address problems rather than reassurance for the force that all is well when palpably it is not .
Then we have the 12 students who were arrested after Bob Quick flourished his briefing documents outside No 10 .
All have been released but 11 are to be deported on national security grounds , which one suspects is a result of police embarrassment rather than any immediate threat to national security .
You can bet that after all the fuss with Quick , the police would have pressed charges on the slightest pretext .
The affair is to be investigated by Lord Carlile , the former Liberal Democrat MP and now the government 's independent reviewer of terrorism .
The words liberal and democrat are surprising elements in that sentence , however the only word I would seriously question is independent because Carlile has steadfastly supported the government 's authoritarian measures , even coming out for the 42 - day detention initiative , which in the circumstances seems hardly to qualify him to investigate the complicated issues that surround the arrest of these 12 young men .
We must wonder whether he will produce a full and frank account or whether this will be the sort of inquiry that Balls favours and Labour legislation enables , one that finds for the state and its agencies as a matter of course .
These stories are in many respects more depressing than reading the economic news because they all seem to tell of the slow deterioration of standards and leadership in British public life .
I think it is possible to argue that this decline is also responsible for the attack on liberty and rights , which is what makes the whole debate surrounding a possible new bill of rights and responsibilities so interesting .
Are we to allow a government that performs so few functions scrupulously and efficiently to start defining our responsibilities to each other and the state , especially as so many responsibilities are – as Afua Hirsch pointed out yesterday – inherent in the Human Rights Act ?
A glance at one day 's newspapers is enough to tell us that the only responsibilities that need defining – and with ever more vigour – are of those of government , a point made at the JCHR conference by Professor Keith Ewing , who publishes a much awaited book called The Bonfire of the Liberties later this year .
Wilkes would recognise what is going on in our society .
Essentially the struggle that he engaged in nearly 250 years ago is no different to the one that we face now .
It is to control the state and make it act with respect towards the individual .
He wrote in No 45 :
The Nintendo Game Boy — the most popular game console of all time — was born today , April 21 , back in 1989 .
Here are its 20 years of history in a timeline that actually goes back to 1889 .

As we examine the standard arguments against same - sex marriage , we must keep two questions firmly in mind .
First , does each argument really justify legal restriction of same - sex marriage , or only some people ’s attitudes of moral and religious disapproval ?
We live in a country in which people have a wide range of different religious beliefs , and we agree in respecting the space within which people pursue those beliefs .
We do not , however , agree that these beliefs , by themselves , are sufficient grounds for legal regulation .
Typically , we understand that some arguments ( including some but not all moral arguments ) are public arguments bearing on the lives of all citizens in a decent society , and others are intra-religious arguments .
Thus , observant Jews abhor the eating of pork , but few if any would think that this religiously grounded abhorrence is a reason to make the eating of pork illegal .
The prohibition rests on religious texts that not all citizens embrace , and it cannot be translated into a public argument that people of all religions can accept .
Similarly in this case , we must ask whether the arguments against same - sex marriage are expressed in a neutral and sharable language , or only in a sectarian doctrinal language .
In February 2010 , Oxford University Press will publish my book FROM DISGUST TO HUMANITY : SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND THE CONSTITUTION .
What follows is a brief extract from the chapter on same - sex marriage .
Although I address the distinction between marriage and civil unions elsewhere in the chapter , I think the arguments against the pending Illinois civil union bill are the same ones standardly made against same - sex marriage .
The first and most widespread objection to same - sex marriage is that it is immoral and unnatural .
Similar arguments were widespread in the anti-miscegenation debate , and , in both cases , these arguments are typically made in a sectarian and doctrinal way , referring to religious texts .
( Anti-miscegenation judges , for example , referred to the will of God in arguing that racial mixing is unnatural . )
It is difficult to cast such arguments in a form that could be accepted by citizens whose religion teaches something different .
They look like Jewish arguments against the eating of pork : good reasons for members of some religions not to engage in same - sex marriage , but not sufficient reasons for making them illegal in a pluralistic society .
A second objection , and perhaps the one that is most often heard from thoughtful people , insists that the main purpose of state - sanctified marriage is procreation and the rearing of children .
Protecting an institution that serves these purposes is a legitimate public interest , and so there is a legitimate public interest in supporting potentially procreative marriages .
Does this mean there is also a public interest in restricting marriage to only those cases where there may be procreation ?
This is less clear .
We should all agree that the procreation , protection , and safe rearing of children are important public purposes .
It is not clear , however , that we have ever thought these important purposes best served by restricting marriage to the potentially procreative .
If we ever did think like this , we certainly have n’t done anything about it .
We have never limited marriage to the fertile , or even to those of an age to be fertile .
It is very difficult , in terms of the state ’s interest in procreation , to explain why the marriage of two heterosexual seventy - year olds should be permitted and the marriage of two men or two women should be forbidden – all the more since so many same - sex couples have and raise children .
As it stands , then the procreation argument looks two - faced , approving in heterosexuals what it refuses to tolerate in same - sex couples .
Sometimes this argument is put a little differently : marriage is about the protection of children , and we know that children do best in a home with one father and one mother , so there is a legitimate public interest in supporting an institution that fulfills this purpose .
Put this way , the argument , again , offers a legitimate public reason to favor and support heterosexual marriage , though it is less clear why it gives a reason to restrict same - sex marriage ( and marriages of those too old to have children , or not desiring children ) .
Its main problem , however , is with the facts .
Again and again , psychological studies have shown that children do best when they have love and support , and it appears that two - parent households do better at that job than single - parent households .
There is no evidence , however , that opposite - sex couples do better than same - sex couples .
There is a widespread feeling that these results ca n’t be right , that living in an immoral atmosphere must be bad for the child .
But that feeling rests on the religious judgments of the first argument ; when the well - being of children is assessed in a religiously neutral way , there is no difference .
A third argument is that by conferring state approval on something that many people believe to be evil , same - sex marriage will force them to “ bless ” or approve of it , thus violating their conscience .
This argument was recently made in an influential way by Charles Fried in Modern Liberty .
What , precisely , is the argument here ?
Fried does not suggest that the recognition of same - sex marriage would violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment – and that would be an implausible position to take .
Presumably , then , the position is that the state has a legitimate interest in banning same - sex marriage on the grounds that it offends many religious believers .
This argument contains many difficulties .
First , it raises an Establishment Clause problem : for religions today vary greatly in their attitude to same - sex marriage , and the state , following this argument , would be siding with one group of believers against another .
( My own denomination , Reform Judaism , has long practiced same - sex marriage , and lobbied vigorously against the proposed constitutional amendment that would have defined marriage as between one man and one woman )
More generally , there are a lot of things that a modern state does that people deeply dislike , often on religious grounds .
Public education teaches things that many religious parents abhor ( such as evolution and the equality of women ) ; parents often choose home schooling for that reason .
Public health regulations license butchers who cut up pigs for human consumption ; Jews do n’t want to be associated with this practice .
But nobody believes that Jews have a right to ask the state to impose their religiously grounded preference on all citizens .
Part of life with in a pluralistic society that values the non-establishment of religion is an attitude of live and let live .
Whenever we see a nation that does allow the imposition of religiously grounded preferences on all citizens – as with some Israeli laws limiting activity on the Sabbath , and as with laws in India banning cow slaughter – we see a nation with a religious establishment , de jure or de facto .
We have chosen not to take that route , and for good reasons .
To the extent that we choose workdays , holidays , etc. that coincide with the preferences of a religious majority , we bend over backwards to be sensitive to the difficulties this may create for minorities .
A fourth argument , again appealing to a legitimate public purpose , focuses on the difficulties that traditional marriage seems to be facing in our society .
Pointing to rising divorce rates and evidence that children are being damaged by lack of parental support , people say that we need to defend traditional marriage , not to undermine it by opening the institution to those who do n’t have any concern for its traditional purposes .
We could begin by contesting the characterization of same - sex couples .
In large numbers , they do have and raise children .
Marriage , for them as for others parents , provides a clear framework of entitlements and responsibilities , as well as security , legitimacy , and social standing for their children .
In fact , the states that have legalized same - sex marriage , Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa , and Vermont , have among the lowest divorce rates in the nation , and the Massachusetts evidence shows that the rate has not risen as a result of the legalization .
We might also pause before granting that an increase in the divorce rate signals social degeneration .
Often , in the past , women stayed married , enduring neglect and even abuse , because they had no marketable skills and no employment options .
It is evident that one factor involved in modern divorce is the autonomy of women , and we should not lament the freedom of choice that increasing opportunities make available .
We should also bear in mind the increased life span .
By some calculations , marriages are not shorter today than they used to be , it ’s just that people live so much longer .
Just as many people go through more than one career these days , so they may go through more than a single marriage .
This may not always be bad .
The human life span is shifting .
But let us concede , for the sake of argument , that there is a social problem .
What , then , about the claim that legalizing same - sex marriage would undermine the effort to defend or protect traditional marriage ?
If society really wants to defend traditional marriage , as it surely is entitled to do and probably ought to do , many policies suggest themselves : family and medical leave ; drug and alcohol counseling on demand ; generous support , in health policies , for marital counseling and mental health treatment ; strengthening laws against domestic violence and enforcing them better ; employment counseling and financial support for those under stress during the present economic crisis ; and , of course , tighter enforcement of child - support laws .
Such measures have a clear relationship to the stresses and strains facing traditional marriage .
The prohibition of same - sex marriage does not .
If we were to study all recent cases of heterosexual divorce , we would be unlikely to find even a single case in which the parties ( or an objective onlooker ) felt that their divorce was caused by the availability of marriage to same - sex couples .
Divorce is usually an intimate personal matter bearing on the nature of the marital relationship .
The objector at this point typically makes a further move .
The very recognition of same - sex marriage on a par with traditional marriage demeans traditional marriage , makes it less valuable .
What ’s being said , it seems , is something like this : if the Metropolitan Opera auditions started giving prizes to pop singers of the sort who sing on American Idol , this would contaminate the opera world .
Similarly , including in the Hall of Fame baseball players who got their records by cheating on the drug rules would contaminate the Hall of Fame , cheapening the real achievements of others .
In general , the promiscuous recognition of low - level or non-serious contenders for an honor sullies the honor .
This , I believe , is the sort of argument people are making when they assert that recognition of same - sex marriage defiles or undermines traditional marriage , when they talk about a “ defense of marriage , ” and so forth .
How should we evaluate this argument ?
First of all , we may challenge it on the facts .
Same - sex couples are not like B - grade singers or cheating athletes – or at least no more so than heterosexual couples .
They want to get married for reasons very similar to those of heterosexuals : to express love and commitment , to gain religious sanctification for their union , to obtain a package of civil benefits – and , often , to have or raise children .
Traditional marriage has its share of creeps , and there are same - sex creeps as well .
But the existence of creeps among the heterosexuals has never stopped the state from marrying heterosexuals .
Nor do people talk or think that way .
I ’ve never heard anyone say that the state ’s willingness to marry Britney Spears or O. J. Simpson demeans or sullies their own marriage .
But somehow , without even knowing anything about the character or intentions of the same - sex couple next door , they think their own marriages would be sullied by public recognition of that union .
If the proposal were to restrict marriage to worthy people who have passed a character test , it would at least be consistent , though few would support such an intrusive regime .
What is clear is that those who make this argument do n’t fret about the way in which unworthy or immoral heterosexuals could sully the institution of marriage or lower its value .
Given that they do n’t worry about this , and given that they do n’t want to allow marriage for gays and lesbians who have proven their good character , it is difficult to take this argument at face value .
The idea that same - sex unions will sully traditional marriage therefore cannot be understood without moving to the terrain of disgust and contamination .
The only distinction between unworthy heterosexuals and the class of gays and lesbians that can possibly explain the difference in people ’s reaction is that the sex acts of the former do not disgust the majority , whereas the sex acts of the latter do .
The thought must be that to associate traditional marriage with the sex acts of same - sex couples is to defile or contaminate it , in much the way that eating food served by a dalit used to be taken by many people in India to contaminate the high - caste body .
Nothing short of a primitive idea of stigma and taint can explain the widespread feeling that same - sex marriage defiles or contaminates straight marriage , while the marriages of immoral and sinful heterosexuals do not do so .
If the arguer should reply that marriage between two people of the same sex cannot result in the procreation of children , and so must be a kind of sham marriage , which insults or parodies , and thus demeans , the real sort of marriage – an argument often made1 – we are right back to the second argument .
Those who insist so strongly on procreation do not feel sullied or demeaned or tainted by the presence next door of two opposite - sex seventy - year - olds newly married , nor by the presence of opposite - sex couples who publicly announce their intention never to have children .
So the feeling of undermining , or demeaning , cannot honestly be explained by the point about children , and must be explained instead by other darker ideas .
If we ’re looking for a historical parallel to the anxieties associated with same - sex marriage , we can find it in the history of views about miscegenation .
At the time of Loving v. Virginia , in 1967 , sixteen states both prohibited and punished marriages across racial lines .
In Virginia , a typical example , such a marriage was a felony punishable by from one to five years in prison .
Like same - sex marriages , cross-racial unions were opposed with a variety of arguments , both political and theological .
In hindsight , however , we can see that disgust was at work .
Indeed , it did not hide its hand : the idea of racial purity was proudly proclaimed ( e.g. in the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 in Virginia ) , and ideas of taint and contamination were ubiquitous .
If people felt disgusted and contaminated by the thought that a black person had drunk from the same public drinking fountain , or gone swimming in the same public swimming pool , or used the same toilet , or the same plates and glasses – all widely held Southern views – we can see that the thought of sex and marriage between black and white would have carried a powerful freight of revulsion .
The Supreme Court concluded that such ideas of racial stigma were the only ideas that really supported those laws , whatever else was said : “ There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification . ”
We should draw the same conclusion about the prohibition of same - sex marriage : irrational ideas of stigma and contamination , the sort of “ animus ” the Court recognized in Romer , is a powerful force in its support .
So thought the Supreme Court of Connecticut in October 2008 , saying :
Beyond moral disapprobation , gay persons also face virulent homophobia that rests on nothing more than feelings of revulsion toward gay persons and the intimate sexual conduct with which they are associated …
Such visceral prejudice is reflected in the large number of hate crimes that are perpetrated against gay persons …
The irrational nature of the prejudice directed at gay persons , who ‘‘ are ridiculed , ostracized , despised , demonized and condemned “ merely for being who they are ” … is entirely different in kind than the prejudice suffered by other groups that previously have been denied suspect or quasi- suspect class status ..
This fact provides further reason to doubt that such prejudice soon can be eliminated and underscores the reality that gay persons face unique challenges to their political and social integration .
2
These arguments against same - sex unions do not seem particularly impressive .
We have not seen any that would supply government with a “ compelling ” state interest , and it seems likely , given Romer , that these arguments , motivated by animus , fail even the rational basis test .
Notes :
What are the Common Reasons to Bear Children ?
The thought that being married without children for more than 5 years is a big question mark that the traditional world ca n’t seem to understand .
This is because most people are already used to the thought that being married means that the couple must want a child or two , even if they are both homosexuals .
But being married without a child is something of a mystery .
Those that are in the kind of relationship that are received with confused and perplexing look .
They never had it in them to step back and think why the couple would choose to do that .
The reason ?
Most couples today , whether it they are teens or already at the years that it is acceptable to get married , have a baby or two to boast about .
But it does n’t mean to say that all couples are like that .
Couples that just stay together for the sake of that reason only is quite rare , but they are growing in numbers now .
But this topic is not about whether the couple is ready to take care of kids or not .
It is about the reasons why they have kids in the first place .
Intelligent Mistakes : How to Incorporate Stupidity Into Your AI Code
By Mick West
[ Neversoft co-founder West presents a thought - provoking look at improving the believability of AI opponents in games by upping their use of " intelligent mistakes " , in a piece originally written for Game Developer magazine . ]
Twenty years ago , I was working on my first commercial game : Steve Davis World Snooker , one of the first snooker / pool games to have an AI opponent .
The AI I created was very simple .
The computer just picked the highest value ball that could be potted , and then potted it .
Since it knew the precise positions of all the balls , it was very easy for it to pot the ball every time .
This was fine for the highest level of difficulty , but for easy mode I simply gave the AI a random angular deviation to the shot .
Toward the end of the project , we got some feedback from the client that the AI was " too good . "
I was puzzled by this and assumed the person wanted the expert mode to be slightly less accurate .
So I changed that .
But then I heard complaints about the decreased accuracy , and again that the AI was still too good .
Eventually the clients paid a visit to our offices and tried to demonstrate in person what they meant .
It gradually came out that they thought the problem was actually with the " easy " mode .
They liked that the computer missed a lot of shots , but they thought that the positional play was too good .
The computer always seemed to be leaving the white ball in a convenient position after its shot , either playing for safety or lining up another ball .
They wanted that changed .
The problem was , there was no positional play !
The eventual position of the white ball was actually completely random .
The AI only calculated where the cue ball should hit the object ball in order to make that object ball go into a pocket .
It then blindly shot the cue ball toward that point with a speed proportional to the distance needed to travel , scaled by the angle , plus some fudge factor .
Where the white ball went afterward was never calculated , and it quite often ended up in a pocket .
So why was it a problem ?
Why did they think the AI was " too good " when it was actually random ?
Humans have a tendency to anthropomorphize AI opponents .
We think the computer is going through a thought process just like a human would do in a similar situation .
When we see the ball end up in an advantageous position , we think the computer must have intended that to happen .
The effect is magnified here by the computer 's ability to pot a ball from any position , so for the computer , all positions are equally advantageous .
Hence , it can pot ball after ball , without having to worry about positional play .
Because sinking a ball on every single shot would be impossible for a human , the player assumes that the computer is using positional play .
Design or Code ?
Is this a design problem or a code problem ?
To a certain extent it depends on the type of game , and to what extent the AI - controlled opponents are intended to directly represent a human in the same situation as the player .
In a head - to - head game such as pool , chess , or poker , the AI decisions are very much determined at a pure code level .
In a one - versus - many game , such as an FPS , there is some expectation that your opponents are generally weaker than you are .
After all , you are generally placed in a situation of being one person against countless hordes of bad guys .
Other game genres , particularly racing games , pit you against a field of equal opponents .
Here the expectation of realistic AI is somewhere between that of chess and the FPS examples .
The more the computer AI has to mimic the idiosyncrasies of a human player , the more the task falls to the programmer .
The vast majority of the AI work in a chess game is handled by programmers .
Game designers would focus more on the presentation .
In an FPS , the underlying code is generally vastly simpler than chess AI .
There is path finding , some state transitions , some goals , and some basic behaviors .
The majority of the behavioral content is supplied via the game designers , generally with some form of scripting .
The designers will also be responsible for coding in actions , goals , and responses that emulate the idiosyncrasies of human behavior .
Heads Up !
In some heads - up games , such as chess and pool , the computer has a huge advantage over the player .
Modern chess programs such as Fritz are vastly stronger than nearly all human players .
In pool and snooker games , the computer can be programmed to never miss a shot .
However , people want to play against an opponent that is well matched to their skills , and so there are generally levels of AI in the game that the player can choose from .
The simplest way to introduce stupidity into AI is to reduce the amount of computation that it 's allowed to perform .
Chess AI generally performs billions of calculations when deciding what move to make .
The more calculations that are made ( and the more time taken ) , then ( generally ) the better the computer will play .
If you reduce the amount of calculations performed , the computer will be a worse player .
The problem with this approach is that it decreases the realism of the AI player .
When you reduce the amount of computation , the AI will begin to make incredibly stupid mistakes -- mistakes that are so stupid , no human would ever make them .
The artificial nature of the game will then become apparent , which destroys the illusion of playing against a real opponent .
Remember what we are trying to accomplish :
We want people to have an enjoyable experience .
No matter what the game , we want the players to feel challenged so that when they win , they feel a sense of accomplishment .
We want them to feel that they were playing against an opponent who was really trying to beat them .
By reducing the amount of computation , we create an AI opponent that is trying to win , but has been crippled in a way that leads to unrealistic gameplay .
But does the player actually care about what is going on under the hood ?
What if we do n't cripple our AI , but instead let it play at full strength , but have the AI deliberately throw the game ?
Throwing the Game
In sports , " throwing the game " means one side makes a series of intentional mistakes that look natural , but result in losing the game .
This behavior is rightly vilified by players and fans , as the agreement is that there be a contest between two equal opponents , or at least , two opponents who are trying equally hard to win .
But in computer games , it 's impossible to have an equal match .
It 's humans versus machines .
One side has an advantage of being able to perform a billion calculations per second , and the other has the massively parallel human brain .
Any parity here is an illusion , and it's that illusion that we seek to improve and maintain via the introduction of intelligent mistakes and artificial stupidity .
The computer has to throw the game in order to make it fun .
When you beat the computer , it 's an illusion .
The computer let you win .
We just want it to let you win in a way that feels good .
AI programmers need to get used to this idea .
We are manipulating the game , creating artificial stupidity , fake stupidity .
But we are not predetermining the outcome of the game .
We do n't set our AI with the intent to lose the game , but rather to give the human player a reasonable chance of winning .
If the human plays poorly , the AI will still win , but the player will at least feel like she came close to beating a strong opponent , and thus feel like playing one more game .
Hidden Handicapping
Computer chess expert Steven Lopez ( see Resources ) describes how in human versus human chess , it 's acceptable for a high - ranking player to give a much lower ranking player an advantage at the start of the game by removing some of his pieces from the board before the game begins .
When the game starts , the master player and the novice player are still playing to the height of their abilities , and yet the game is more evenly balanced .
The master player does not have to play " stupid " in order to give the novice player a chance .
However , humans playing against a computer do not like to be given an advantage in this way , and prefer to play the full board against an AI opponent of approximately their skill level .
The programmers of Fritz hit upon a solution that involved the AI deliberately setting up situations that the human player could exploit ( with some thought ) that would allow the human to gain a positional or piece advantage .
Once the human player gained the advantage , the AI would resume trying to win .
At no point here is the AI actually dumbed down .
If anything , there is actually quite a bit more computation going on , and certainly more complexity .
The goal of the AI has shifted from " win the game " to " act like you are trying to win the game , but allow the human to gain a one - pawn advantage , and then try to win . "
The AI needs to be more intelligent in order to appear less intelligent .
Poker AI
When I programmed the AI for Left Field 's World Series of Poker , the AI computation was basically the same for each difficultly level .
The computer would calculate the odds of winning based on the known cards , and an estimate of the opponent 's hand strength based on betting history .
The odds would then be used to calculate a rate of return , which would be used to decide if they would fold , call , or raise .
There were many special case rules and exceptions , but that 's the basics .
The AI players would all make the same extensive computations , running tens of thousands of simulated hands through an evaluator to calculate the rate of return .
After these calculations were performed , only then would the differentiation be performed .
At that point , the best players would play their best move , and the weak AI players would make intelligent mistakes .
For weak poker AI , an intelligent mistake consists of figuring out what you should do , and then not doing it , so long as not doing it does not make you look stupid .
For example , if the human player just put in a big raise , yet you know there 's a 75 percent chance your hand is the best , then an intelligent mistake would be to fold .
The odds are the AI would win , yet we are simulating a weak human player , and weak human players often fold to a large raise when they are unclear on their odds .
Conversely , weak human players often call when their chances are weak .
It 's a natural thing to do and allows us to reduce the strength of the AI player , without it looking artificially stupid .
These intelligent mistakes were implemented in a probabilistic manner .
The fake - stupid AI would not always fold when the human player seemed to be bluffing -- it was just more likely to .
This worked very well in the highly random game of poker , because the player could never tell in any individual situation if the AI was actually making a mistake .
Since the AI was still performing its full set of millions of calculations , it never made mistakes that were inhumanly stupid , but the layer of artificial stupidity brought on by increased recklessness was enough to even the playing field and give the weak and average human players an enjoyable game .
Artificial Inaccuracy
In pool and in shooters , the computer AI is blessed with an omniscient accuracy .
The shooter AI knows down to the billionth of an inch exactly where you are , and could shoot your hat off your head from five miles away .
Similarly in pool , the AI knows the position of every ball and can calculate where every ball will end up before it takes a shot .
When I implemented my snooker AI , it could perfectly pot any ball off two cushions , and would almost always get a perfect break of 147 every time it played ( except when it potted the white due to its lack of positional play ) .
It was obviously not a fun opponent to play against , so even at the highest levels , the accuracy had to be reduced , and the cushion shots had to be restricted to getting out of snookers .
Simply reducing the accuracy of the AI is not always the best way to improve gameplay .
As I found with the " positional play " in snooker , random outcomes that happen to favor the computer are perceived as being intentional .
If the ball ends up in a good place , or the poker AI makes a lucky call and wins on the river , it can be perceived as unfair or even cheating .
So instead of reducing the accuracy , I 'd suggest , as in chess , we increase the accuracy .
In order to provide an exciting and dynamic game , the AI needs to manipulate the gameplay to create situations that the player can exploit .
In pool this could mean , instead of blindly taking a shot and not caring where the cue ball ends up , the AI should deliberately fail to pot the ball and ensure that the cue ball ends up in a place where the player can make a good shot .
In a shooter , the enemy aliens should not simply randomly break from cover -- they should sometimes break from cover when the player is close to them and panning toward them .
They should " accidentally " throw themselves into the line of fire to make the game more interesting .
Luck of the Draw
Playing against a perfect opponent is no fun .
But playing against a crippled opponent is no fun either .
To create more interesting gameplay , we have to introduce the concepts of artificial stupidity and intelligent mistakes .
Intelligent mistakes seem like failings on the part of the AI , but are actually carefully calculated ways of throwing the game that make it more entertaining for the player .
This does not remove the challenge , as the player still has to have a certain level of skill .
For the programmer , adding intelligent mistakes is much more complex than simply reducing the accuracy of the AI , but provides a much more rewarding experience for the player .

2003 : I 'm a budding marine scientist on my first fishing boat .
" How old are you ? " asks the captain .
" Twenty - three . "
He grimaces and blows smoke from his pipe into my face .
" My niece 's younger 'n you and she got three kids .
You got no business here , what 's wrong with you ? "
2008 : Now a science writer , I 've just returned from a conference , ecstatic to have met one of my -- and everyone else 's -- science heroes .
He somehow tracks down my number and calls the following week .
How would I feel about being " his next mistress ? "
I remind him I have a popular science blog and warn never to call back .
* * * * * * * * * * * * Now folks , I 'm not naive .
I recognize everyone forms preconceived notions based on visual and nonverbal cues .
As it happens , my next book deals with science and sexuality , so this is a topic I 've been thinking about a lot lately off the blog .
Naturally , attention to physical appearance has been hardwired into our neural circuitry over a few millenia , however , you better believe it 's never acceptable judge anyone based on appearances and number of X chromosomes .
And of course I 've noticed the science blogosphereisbuzzing over some neanderthal comments from Monday about my photo .
After Phil was kind enough to welcome Chris and I to Discover Blogs , I was disappointed to read several of the responses .
For example :
as a living breathing male of the species , I look forward to any article with Sherils picture attached .
Or even less articulate :
mmmmmmmm ………..
wo-man
Needless to say , it was n't the most welcoming reaction and I missed the allies I had at our old site .
Any whiff of misogyny and Isis , PhysioProf , and Drugmonkey will smack you down , Abel , Bora , Grrl will set the record straight , ScienceWoman and SciCurious will embarrass you , and Zuska might just vomit on your shoes .
But then I remembered , this troubling mentality is not limited to any network .
I encountered equally unenlightened nonsense at both Wired and ScienceBlogs too .
Furthermore , it 's pervasive well beyond the blogosphere .
For example , when Chris and I recently gave a joint talk , a Nobel laureate commended my co-blogger on his words followed by grabbing for my left hand and uttering , " why are n't you married my dear ? "
I doubt any of the aforementioned anecdotes -- or the now infamous comments -- were intended to be insulting , but they each highlight a broader social issue .
Several female colleagues have similar stories of receiving sexually explicit emails and poetry , while I 've yet to hear the fellows complain of unwanted advances ( though surely that happens occasionally too ) .
This is not an isolated problem , nor is it specific to me as an individual , rather it demonstrates that no matter how much the nature of science has changed , it continues to be very much a ' boys club . '
As David Kroll pointed out on Phil 's thread :
What the hell is wrong with you people ?
Is your life so pitiful that [ appearances are ] the first thing you choose to comment upon regarding an experienced scientist , author , and public policy expert ?
a response read :
The problem is not that Electro and I compliment Sheril ’s appearance .
The problem is that people like you take issue with it , as if somehow that compliment is “ lesser ” than a compliment on someone ’s intelligence .
Remove stick from rear end , move on .
Lather , rinse , repeat .
I disagree , so let 's not ' move on ' immediately .
You see , all of this does matter .
Surely it contributes to the reason so many of us wonder about the dramatic gender gap in science , policy , and much of society .
Of course , on a personal note , I say do n't cry for me academia because while there are undoubtedly hurdles , I 'm having a blast and plan to stick around the ivory towers for a while .
Still , I strongly suspect the veritable nosedive in XX representation over time is , at least in part , a self - perpetuating cycle resulting from long - standing cultural norms and social expectations .
Shortly after entering the blogosphere , there was a period when I stopped posting personal pictures altogether ... until I stepped back and thought about why I felt pressure to remain somewhat obscure .
These reservations stemmed from wondering whether a woman can really be taken seriously as a writer for her ideas , if on some level she is first perceived as female .
Evolutionary psychologists describe subconscious cues and I 've encountered more than a few folks from the fishing industry to the Senate with overtly preconceived expectations on gender .
I 'd like readers here to recognize content before appearances , but I never had the option of anonymity .
Eventually I realized that the truth is , by ' hiding , ' I 'd been undermining myself by unintentionally creating self - imposed constraints based on fear .
I 'd been feeling the need to censor myself because of the potential for external bias .
Thing is , those outside pressures are going to exist no matter what , so the only opinion of real consequence is my own .
And in time , I decided it was incredibly important to openly provide an image of a woman in science to the many bright young readers who follow the blog :
Even in the 21st century there 's still this ridiculous misconception that gets popularized in middle school suggesting girls in academics are weird , unattractive , or nerdy .
' Beauty and the Geek ' anyone ?
I can't fathom why the negative labels persist .
Frankly , I 'm having a blast growing up geek exploring the ivory towers and beyond .
So what we collectively ought to be doing is finding the means to reinforce reality over ' reality ' television !
It 's past the time we get the simple honest message out in a way that resonates that women can be successful , intelligent , hip , and most importantly - - it 's our choice how we define ourselves .
I suspect that society and culture will catch up ... eventually .
While I still feel that way , I 've since decided I 'd rather not be labeled a ' woman in science ' at all .
I have far more dimensions than the ones assigned by base pairs and profession .
So as for the response at Bad Astronomy , it 's a microcosm of a broader cultural issue .
Furthermore , in the end , Phil 's response was the right one and Carey - - one of the original commentors -- recognized his error and apologized .
With that , I 'll end by reiterating I 'm glad to be at Discover - - obviously there 's work to be done !
I plan to continue defying expectations of what it means to be a girl and am encouraged knowing I 've got several new friends along with the old family who have my back .
Prehistoric boneheads be forewarned :
We occasionally exhibit a pack mentality and some bloggers bite , so venture down that road at your own risk ...

From the Zebroid ( Zebra + Equine ) to a Beefalo ( Buffalo + Cow ) , some of the most intriguing hybrid animals .
1 Zebroid = Zebra + Equine
zebroid ( also zebra mule and zebrule ) is the offspring of any cross between a zebra and any other equine : essentially , a zebra hybrid .
In most cases , the sire is a zebra stallion .
Offspring of a donkey sire and zebra mare , called a zebra hinny , do exist but are rare .
Zebroids have been bred since the 19th century .
The zebroid showed in the picture above , Eclyse , is a very unusual one , because of her coloring .
With her über distinct makings , it ’s really hard not think she ’s a Photoshop mock - up .
2 Liger = Lion +
Tiger
The liger is a hybrid cross between a male Panthera leo ( lion ) , and a female Panthera tigris ( Tiger ) and is denoted scientifically as Panthera tigris × Panthera leo .
A liger resembles a giant lion with diffused stripes .
They are the largest cats in the world , although the Siberian Tiger is the largest pure sub-species .
Like tigers , but unlike lions , ligers enjoy swimming .
A similar hybrid , the offspring of a male tiger and a female lion is called a tigon .
3 Beefalo = Buffalo + Cow
What do you get when you cross a cow with a buffalo ?
The Beefalo , a hybrid animal that produces red meat lower in fat and cholesterol than beef .
Most consumers have never heard of beefalo , let alone tasted it , and only a few Seattle grocery stores carry it .
How does a buffalo burger compare to a beef one ?
“ It has a richer flavor and it ’s milder and sweeter than beef , ” says Ellensburg beefalo breeder Mark Merril , “ and more juicy . ”
4 Cama = Camel + Llama
This hybrid animal , the product of breeding a llama and a camel , has been the only creature of this kind since her birth in 1995 .
Camas are humpless and have the long fluffy coat of a llama .
Their ears are half way in length between camels and llamas , but they have the strong , desert - ready legs of a camel .
5 Leopon = Leopard + Lion
The Leopon is the result of breeding a male leopard with a female lion .
The head of the animal is similar to that of a lion while the rest of the body carries similarities to leopards .
The first documented leopon was bred at Kolhapur , India in 1910 .
6 Savannah = Serval + Domestic Cat
The Savannah Cat is created by breeding an African Wild Cat , called a Serval and a domestic cat , usually an exotic looking domestic cat such as a Bengal , Oriental Shorthair , Egyptian Mau , or a Serengeti’s .
The offspring created by this combination are large domestic .
7 Grizzly Polar = Polar Bear + Brown Bear
Also known as Grolar Bear , this bear hybrid is a rare ursid hybrid that has occurred both in captivity and in the wild .
In 2006 , the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the DNA of a strange - looking bear that had been shot on Banks Island in the Canadian arctic .
A number of polar bear hybrids are described as Ursid hybrids , a term that designates any hybrid of two species within the Ursidae family .
Polar bear hybrids with Grizzly bears have been reported and shot , but DNA techniques were not available to verify the bears ’ ancestry .
8 Toast of Botswana = Sheep +
Goat
An unusual case of a sheep - goat hybrid was reported by veterinarians in Botswana in 2000 , called the “ Toast of Botswana ” .
The animal was born naturally from the mating of a female goat with a male sheep that were kept together .
The hybrid was intermediate between the two parent species in type .
It had a coarse outer coat , a woolly inner coat , long goat - like legs and a heavy sheep - like body .
Although infertile , the hybrid had a very active libido , mounting both ewes and does when they were not in heat .
This earned the hybrid the name Bemya or rapist .
He was castrated when he was 10 months old because he was becoming a nuisance .
9 Blood parrot = Midas Cichild + Red Devil fish
The Blood parrot ( also known as bloody parrot and blood parrotfish ) is a hybrid cichlid .
The fish was first created in Taiwan in around 1986 .
Its parentage is unknown , but the most commonly speculated pairings are midas cichlid with the redhead cichlid .
This hybrid cichlid has various anatomical deformities , one of the most obvious , and also deadly , deformities is its mouth , which only has very narrow vertical opening .
This makes blood parrot very hard to feed .
Many die eventually because of this .
Cichlid enthusiasts have called for their removal from the market and organized boycotts against pet stores that sell them .
10 Hybrid Pheasant = Golden + Amherst Pheasant
The Golden Pheasant has commonly been crossed with the similar Lady Amherst ’s Pheasant .
The result is a hybrid with distinguished colors from its parents .
NORWALK , Connecticut ( Reuters ) - U.S. accounting rulemakers bowed to congressional and financial industry pressure on Thursday by allowing more flexibility in valuing toxic assets , a move expected to boost bank earnings and improve their capital levels .
The five - member Financial Accounting Standards Board voted unanimously to let banks exercise more judgment in using mark - to - market accounting that has forced billions of dollars in writedowns and been blamed for worsening the recession .
But the board split 3 - 2 on backing guidance that would let lenders take smaller losses on impaired assets such as mortgage backed securities , a move critics said would let banks hide reality from investors .
The accounting changes were credited with helping U.S. stock rally for a third day , by supporting optimism the financial sector will stabilize in the short term .
Many lawmakers , banks and other supporters of the changes argue that pricing assets to firesale prices during a time of inactive markets has exacerbated the financial crisis through the writedowns , big earnings hits , damage to capital ratios , and a reduced ability to lend .
Investors and some former regulators take a different view , saying that more flexibility with the rules would let big banks hide the real value of their troubled assets .
“ I think it ’s a mistake .
If it ’s too cold in the room , you do n’t fix the problem by holding a candle under the thermometer , ” William Poole , former Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis president , told Reuters at a conference in New Orleans .
“ It may increase reported bank earnings by 20 percent , but it has nothing to do with the reality of bank earnings .
It ’s very important to maintain that distinction , ” Poole said .
Initial euphoria among business lobbyists over the changes was tempered as it became clear FASB would not let banks presume that all transactions within a market are distressed just because a market for an asset is inactive .
“ FASB has taken one step forward and one step back , ” said Thomas Quaadman , executive director for reporting policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
The changes would take effect in the second quarter for most U.S. financial firms , but early adoption could be allowed for first quarter results .
The guidance documents should be issued next week , FASB staff said .
FASB SPLIT ON WRITEDOWN
FASB deliberated for three hours in a drab boardroom that was filled with dozens of representatives of accounting firms , banks and insurance companies .
“ I think this is an improvement , ” FASB Chairman Robert Herz said of the changes .
But board members Marc Siegel and Thomas Linsmeier cast dissenting votes on the guidance for how companies write - down assets that have dropped significantly in value .
“ I ’m afraid that this change will result in fewer impairments being recognized , and I do n’t think that will help the investor confidence in the balance sheet , ” Siegel told the meeting .
FASB said at its meeting that the objective of mark - to - market in inactive markets should be to determine what an asset could fetch in an “ orderly ” transaction between market participants .
Such an “ orderly ” transaction would not include distressed transactions or fire - sales , it said .
A Congressional panel last month told Herz to move quickly to ease the mark - to - market guidance or lawmakers would take action .
Four days later FASB issued two proposals : one to give banks more flexibility in applying mark - to - market accounting and another addressing when banks must take writedowns on impaired assets .

SCRUBBING TOXIC ASSETS
FASB ’s new guidance could affect a federal lending program for asset - backed securities and a public - private partnership to purchase troubled assets unveiled in March by the White House .
The Obama administration ’s plan to scrub toxic assets off banks ’ balance sheets depends heavily on banks ’ and potential investors ’ ability to agree on a value for an asset .
Robert Willens , a tax and accounting analyst , said if a bank gets to write up the value of securities in its available - for - sale portfolio , to levels beyond what potential bidders are wiling to pay , there could be a problem .
“ Banks will be unwilling to sell these assets ( into the government ’s Public - Private Investment Program ) because they would have to record a loss .
It could have a perverse impact on the whole process . ”
But the Financial Services Roundtable , representing big financial companies , disagreed .
“ It would help the toxic asset purchase program for mortgage securities by creating a market value for those securities , which will narrow the difference between buyers and sellers , ” said Scott Talbott , the roundtable ’s senior vice president for government affairs .
The accounting board considered hundreds of letters and e-mails sent by banks , investors and others commenting on the FASB proposals .
Herz also said FASB “ did extensive outreach to investors , particularly major investors in financial institutions ” ahead of Thursday ’s meeting .
But FASB members Linsmeier and Siegel sparred over whether to call the writedown guidance “ ridiculous ” or “ ludicrous , ” and Linsmeier said the board was making changes to address regulatory capital concerns .
“ I find one of the most unfortunate parts of this to be the fact that we ’re continuing to take the responsibility on , rather than having the regulators to take this on , ” said Linsmeier , a FASB member for three years and former chairman of Michigan State University ’s accounting department .
Siegel joined the board in October .
He had led an accounting research and analysis team at RiskMetrics Group that focused on investor - oriented issues .
College women may be drinking to excess to impress their male counterparts on campuses across the country , but a new study suggests most college men are not looking for a woman to match them drink for drink .
A survey of 3,616 college students at two American universities found an overwhelming majority of women overestimated the amount of alcohol a typical guy would like his female friends , dates or girlfriends to drink .
" Although traditionally , men drink more than women , research has shown that women have steadily been drinking more and more over the last several decades , " said the study 's lead author , Joseph LaBrie , PhD , associate professor of psychology at Loyola Marymount University .
" Our research suggests women believe men find excessive drinking sexually attractive and appealing , but it appears this is a giant misperception . "
For this article , the researchers invited the participating students , ages 18 to 25 , to complete an online survey during the 2007 fall semester .
The students were at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles or the University of Washington .
The women answered several questions to determine , on average , how many drinks they thought a typical college man would like his female friends to drink at a typical event , as well as the maximum number of drinks they thought the men would like their female friends to drink .
They then had to say , on average , how many drinks they thought a woman would have to consume for a guy to consider being friends with her , consider dating her or consider her sexually attractive .
The men were asked their actual preferences .
The researchers also asked the women to estimate how much they drank in any given week or month , and how much alcohol they thought the average woman at their university drank in any given week .
The results showed 71 percent of women overestimated the men's actual preference of drinks at any given event .
The women overestimated by an average of one - and - a - half drinks .
When the researchers looked at the different subgroups , 26 percent of women said that men would most likely want to be friends with a woman who drinks five or more drinks and 16 percent said that men would be most sexually attracted to a woman who drank that much alcohol .
Both estimates were nearly double what the men actually preferred .
They also found the women who overestimated the men's preferences were more likely to engage in excessive drinking .
" There is a great , and risky , disconnect here between the sexes , " said LaBrie .
" While not all women may be drinking simply to get a guy 's attention , this may help explain why more women are drinking at dangerous levels .
We believe universities and other public health organizations could use this information to help curb binge drinking among young women . "
LaBrie is doing a follow - up study that looks at what men think women want them to drink to see if this perception has a similar effect on increased risky drinking .

Check out this statute , which covers the property -- including dorms -- of any university ( public or private ) as well as K - 12 schools :
(4) It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to possess or carry , whether openly or concealed , any BB gun , air rifle , air pistol , bowie knife , dirk , dagger , slingshot , leaded cane , switchblade knife , blackjack , metallic knuckles , razors and razor blades ( except solely for personal shaving ) , and any sharp - pointed or edged instrument except instructional supplies , unaltered nail files and clips and tools used solely for preparation of food , instruction and maintenance on educational property .
Any person violating this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and , upon conviction thereof , shall be fined not more than One Thousand Dollars ( $ 1,000.00 ) , or be imprisoned not exceeding six ( 6 ) months , or both .
Scissors that are " instructional supplies , " or that are used solely for " instruction and maintenance , " are excluded , but what about other scissors ?
Or anything else with a sharp point or an edge ?
Yow .
Dice
If you ’re like me , you have a variety of dice in all shapes , sizes and colours .
Many people , myself included , are very particular about their dice and have many superstitions about them .
Let ’s look at a few .
New Character , New Dice
This option works best if you generally play long - term campaigns and use the same character a lot .
Each and every character you roll up gets his own set of dice .
When you ’re playing the Fighter you always use the green dice .
And when you ’re playing the Wizard you always use the blue dice .
This can get expensive if you have the habit of getting killed .
( If this is the case , check out Avoiding Death : Part 1 and Avoiding Death : Part 2 . )
However , if you ’re willing to have one set of dice for each living character then this is a reasonable dice ritual .
Show Me a 1
There are two variations on this theme .
The first take on this ideology ( the one that I follow ) :
Any die I plan to use during this gaming session must be left with the 1 facing up when I ’m not rolling .
My belief is that if it already shows a 1 when I pick it up I ’m less likely to roll a 1 again .
I do n’t know if there ’s any merit to this superstition , but I ’ve been doing it for 20 years .
The second take on this ideology ( which I ’ve never done ) : Roll all your dice until each one actually comes up 1 and then stop rolling until you need that die .
After you ’re done rolling your attack , damage , save or whatever , you roll those active dice again and again until they come up 1 and then you stop .
Mouth Love
This one is n’t limited to gamers .
If you ’ve ever been to a casino and walked past the craps table then you ’ve see this one : people kissing or blowing on their dice for good luck .
I ’ll admit I ’ve done this on rare occasions , but I ’ve never had any noticeable successes .
Plus , my dice are probably pretty dirty since I ’ve never , ever cleaned them .
So the last thing I want to do is put them anywhere near my mouth .
Never Touch Another Man’s Dice
My dice are mine and mine alone .
If you need to roll 3d8 and you only have two you can not use one of mine .
Re -roll one of yours and add them up .
If anyone but me touches my dice they may curse the dice and wreck my good dice mojo .
I may sound crazy , but I know I ’m not alone here .
Most of the gamers I know are very protective and territorial about their dice .
They ’re mine , hands off !
The DM’s Dice
I have player dice and DM dice .
I swear that when I use my blue dice as a DM I roll more 19s than is statistically probable ( much to the dismay of the players ) .
But if I use that same set of dice as a player I never see this same kind of trending .
Of course you could argue that as the DM I roll more often and I ’m bound to see more of any given number .
You call it statistical probability and I call it “ The DM ’s Lucky Dice . ”
Punishing Bad Dice
I may have superstitions about my dice but I do n’t believe in punishing them .
However , many gamers punish bad dice .
If the dice do n’t roll what you need as often as you like , they often become the victims of irate gamers .
I ’ve seen people yell at bad dice , explode dice in the microwave , smash them with a hammer , throw them in the lake or simply toss them in the trash .
Gamers can become unforgiving and ridiculous when it comes to the need to punish bad dice .
I ca n’t justify doing any of these things listed above because I ’m too cheap ( after all , I paid for that die , as crappy as it is ) .
New Dice
One great thing about dice is that a set of 6 or 7 polyhedron dice generally cost between $ 5 - 10 .
This means that I get dice as gifts all the time .
Over the years all those dice start to pile up .
I ca n’t throw them out , that would just be wrong .
So what do I do ?
This Christmas I had a brainstorm ( which I ’m particularly proud of ) .
My core gaming group has six regular players .
We all have giant bags or boxes of dice .
Many of these dice sit in the bottom of the dice bag and are n’t used any more .
So we decided to hold our 1st annual dice exchange .
Why should we all fork out $ 10 when we can just trade with other gamers ?
The results were fantastic .
I got rid of a few old sets I never use , I got a few new sets which I ’m using all the time , and it did n’t cost me anything .
This is also a great opportunity to unload bad dice .
Just because your dice hate you does n’t mean they have any ill - will towards the other players at your table .
Tell us about your dice rituals or superstitions ?
Do you punish bad dice , and if so , tell us what crazy things you ’ve done ?

When will the end of the world end ?
This week opened with an apocalyptic bang , as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit an intraday low of 7105.94 -- the index 's lowest level since Oct. 28 , 1997 .
It rose Tuesday , then fell again Wednesday .
In response , pundits everywhere went picking through their tea leaves one shred at a time , looking for the definitive sign that Armageddon is over , so we can all go back to making money again .
What history shows , however , is that the road to recovery from a catastrophic bear market can be distressingly long .
Friday , finance professor Elroy Dimson of London Business School will publish his periodic update of long - term investment returns , which is eagerly awaited each year among the propeller - heads of the investing world .
Along with his colleagues Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton , Prof .
Dimson compiles vast amounts of reliable data on 17 stock markets around the world all the way back to 1900 .
Naturally , the report this year focuses on bear markets .
The results shocked even me , and I do n't startle easily .
Consider this : Prof .
Dimson estimates that we 'll have to wait nine more years before the Dow average , including dividends , has a 50 % chance of hitting its 2007 highs .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors CEO
Rick Wagoner announced his resignation early Monday as the Obama administration gave automakers failing grades for their turnaround efforts .
White House and GM sources had told CNN Sunday that Wagoner would resign as part of the federal government 's bailout strategy for the troubled automaker .
" On Friday I was in Washington for a meeting with Administration officials .
In the course of that meeting , they requested that I ' step aside ' as CEO of GM , and so I have , " Wagoner said in a statement posted to the GM Web site .
He is being replaced by GM 's president and chief operating officer , Fritz Henderson .
Kent Kresa will serve as interim chairman .
" Having worked closely with Fritz for many years , I know that he is the ideal person to lead the company through the completion of our restructuring efforts .
His knowledge of the global industry and the company are exceptional , and he has the intellect , energy , and support among GM 'ers worldwide to succeed , " Wagoner said .
Wagoner 's departure comes amid promises from the federal government for a sweeping overhaul of GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Chrysler LLC .
The government plans to fund their operations for the next few weeks , but it is holding out the threat of a " structured bankruptcy . "
GM will get 60 days and Chrysler 30 days in which to make a final push toward proving they can run viable businesses .
If Chrysler succeeds , it will receive a $ 6 billion loan .
In GM 's case , the officials would not specify how much money the carmaker might receive .
President Obama is expected later Monday morning to make a formal announcement about his plans for the companies , which have already been given $ 17.4 billion .
( Obama aides flunk GM and Chrysler )
Wagoner , a 32 - year company veteran , has been CEO of General Motors since 2000 .
Prior to becoming CEO , he was chief operating officer and led the company 's North American operations .
He also served as chief financial officer from 1992 to 1994 .
( ' Wagoner : Almost a superstar CEO ' )
GM has been hit hard as auto sales have plummeted .
Sales have continued to tumble through the early months of this year , falling 40 % across the industry and about 50 % at GM and Chrysler .
The companies and industry analysts have slashed their sales estimates for the year -- and that in turn has heightened the need for more loans to keep GM and Chrysler afloat .
Last month , the two companies filed reports on their restructuring efforts .
GM said it needed up to $ 16.6 billion more in loans .
Chrysler asked for an additional $ 5 billion , and said it would need the money by the end of March to avoid running out of cash .
The other member of Detroit 's Big Three , Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) , has a better cash position than its rivals and has so far not needed federal loans .
But Ford has asked for a $ 9 billion line of credit in case sales continue to be worse than expected or if major suppliers have to halt operations .
Job cuts
As part of the viability plan , GM and Chrysler were to win concessions form bond holders and the UAW .
GM has a big debt load , but negotiations with bond holders have gone slowly .
As for talks with labor unions , last week GM announced that 7,500 factory workers had taken its latest buyout offer .
The workers leaving the company represent about 12 % of the GM 's remaining U.S. hourly work force , leaving it with just under 55,000 factory workers in the United States .
With this latest program , GM has shed about 60,000 hourly U.S. jobs since 2006 .
GM has offered buyout packages to all of its remaining hourly workers .
Even if the company needs to hire someone new to replace a departed worker , the company will save money under terms of the 2007 labor contract that pays new hires at a lower wage scale and with a far less lucrative benefit package .

White House approves costly , new spy satellites
WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Tuesday approved the purchase of pricey new spy satellites and will buy more commercial imagery from the private sector to plug immediate gaps in satellite coverage .
The new program will take the place of one that had been awarded to The Boeing Co . The Pentagon canceled that project in 2005 because it was grossly over budget and behind schedule .
An intelligence official , who spoke to reporters shortly after the White House approved the program , said the new spy satellites would offer the same capability of those now in use .
Officials were concerned that significant changes in their design could break the budget for the program or delay the launch of the satellites , he said .
The official , who spoke only on the condition that his name not be used , declined to reveal the budget for the program .
Sen . Kit Bond , R - Mo. , the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee , has already complained about the price tag , which he put at more than $ 10 billion .
The official said that figure is incorrect but would not offer an alternative .
The official would also not specify how many spy satellites would be built or when they would be launched .
He said officials believed it would be soon enough to plug any gaps left by the 2005 cancellation .
However , military , intelligence and industry officials familiar with the program said last week that the program is called “ 2 - plus - 2 ” and calls for building two sophisticated satellites equal to or better than the huge , high - resolution secret satellites now in orbit .
The officials all spoke anonymously because the details of the program are classified .
At the same time , the White House has also agreed to boost the amount of commercial imagery it buys .
It now spends $ 25 million a month with DigitalGlobe of Longmont , Colo. , and GeoEye of Dulles , Va. , buying private imagery that can show outlines of objects as small as 16 inches .
The new contract will be large enough to pay for the construction and launch of two new commercial satellites with the same capabilities as those now on orbit .
The new contract will include “ guaranteed access ” — that is , top priority and the ability to direct the satellites if there is a war or another emergency .
The commercial contract will be negotiated in the coming weeks , the intelligence official said .
Defense giant Lockheed Martin , of Bethesda , Md. , is almost certain to win the secret multibillion - dollar contract for the two new high - altitude spy satellites .
It built the spacecraft now in orbit that will be roughly duplicated in the “ 2 - plus - 2 ” program .
The intelligence official acknowledged the possibility that the massive contract could be awarded this year to Lockheed without a competitive bidding process .
The “ 2 - plus - 2 ” program is meant to avert a potential gap in U.S. imagery satellite coverage around the world .
The sophisticated spy satellites now in orbit are nearing the end of their service life , and replacements must be launched in the next decade to prevent blind spots .
The plan will have to win congressional approval .
A second intelligence official said the administration is confident it will pass .
The Defense Department spends about $ 20 billion annually on space programs .
BMW and Audi are dueling again , but this time , onto the “ marketing battle field ” .
And what would be the best place to do so other than the one of the top states when it comes to car luxury sales : California .

On the corner of Santa Monica Blvd . and Beverly Glen Blvd , Audi has put up some billboards showing the all new Audi A4 along with the headline : “ Your move , BMW ” .
Santa Monica BMW , a local dealership , took on the challenge and entered a virtual chess game ….of course , with cars .
But which one is the king though ?
Will it be the BMW M3 Coupe or the Audi A4 ?
Fair comparison ?
Probably not , but it ’s all fun in the end .
Press Release
Juggernaut Advertising , an independent advertising agency headquartered in Santa Monica , CA , has initiated a tactical outdoor marketing campaign on behalf of BMW of Santa Monica .
The campaign is in response to Audi ’s current billboards challenging BMW with the headline “ Your move , BMW . ”
Juggernaut Advertising ’s creative work features the BMW M3 with the headline “ Checkmate . ” and is positioned prominently within the same sightline to westbound traffic as the Audi ad .
Juggernaut approached BMW of Santa Monica after identifying a unique and immediate geographical opportunity along the highly trafficked Santa Monica Blvd. corridor between Beverly Hills and Santa Monica .
“ When we heard the idea , we loved it and could n’t resist going forward , ” says Del Montell , Jr. of Santa Monica BMW .
P.S
If anyone can come up with a better ad in response to Audi ’s billboard , we will gladly post it here .
Let ’s see some creativity !
Dispelling Myths About Organic Foods
Sir John 's comments led to a letter in The Guardian newspaper from the Policy Director of the Soil Association , Peter Melchett who wrote , ' Sir John 's anti-organic prejudice is matched by his love of GMOs ... " .
So , in 2006 , has the organic information overload left us with facts or fiction ?
We take a look at the top 5 myths .
1 . No nutritional difference between organic and conventional produce .
According to the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics the demand for organic foods are increasing due to consumers believing they are safer and healthier than conventional foods .
Even though there are still gaps and limits in scientific knowledge , what we do know is that fewer chemicals are used in small organic farming than conventionally grown alternatives .
It is well documented that residues remain on our conventional foods and consumed by us over decades , aids heavily to accumulating fatty tissue .
Organic food regulations prohibit hydrogenated fat , phosphoric acid , preservatives , colourings , hormones , antibiotics , GMOs and 7000 other artificial flavourings that are permitted in conventional food .
There is also the environmental issue to which the organic farming method lends its benefits .
The use of drugs is restricted in organic farming which not only keeps animals healthy but results in cryptosporidium , listeria and almonella being a rare occurrence in organic foods .
There is a direct relationship between intensive cattle - rearing and E.coli which is virtually non-existent in organic beef , but kills over 200 Americans and Britons each year .
2.Consumers are paying too much for organic food ?
This debate has grown since the days of comparing the price of an organic apple for a conventional apple .
It seems that the ' value ' of organic produce goes beyond its price tag .
Nutritionally :
In terms of dry weight and nutrients , organic food tends to have more in it Why ?
Produce grown organically through modern methods of small organic farming must be done in enriched soil .
The growth of a plant can be sped up by agrochemicals changing its structure to have more water in it .
As a result , non-organic produce can sometimes shrink more on cooking as the water content dissipates .
Price : Average price difference is 20 per cent between organic and non-organic .
However given that it can contain up to 26 per cent more dry matter ( less water ) could it actually be cheaper to buy organic ?
Conclusion :
It may still look like an apple you are actually buying less food if you do n't buy organic .
3. Organic food and weight loss .
Organic butter can still make you put on weight and clog up your arteries .
Organic sweets and sugar will still rot your teeth .
However , certain kinds of organic food based nutrients found in vegetable broth can act as appetite suppressants as it does not contain excitotoxins .
What are excitotoxin ?
These ingredients can cause neurological disorders by overexciting nerve cells and so causing hunger .
Ingredients such as vegetable proteins , autolyzed yeast extract , MSG , yeast extract and others .
This is perhaps more important in babies who can eat five times the amount of food per kg as an adult .
Therefore , making sure they eat correctly and to not overeat is nowadays a growing concern .
Babies in particular eat far more fruit and vegetables than most adults and are the very foods most likely to be covered in agrichemical residues .
4 . The public is happy with regular , non-organic produce .
Some say that the public is happy with what 's on the supermarket shelves , however various consumer surveys in Europe show many people are worried about pesticides , NPK fertilizers in small organic farming and processed food in general .
In the United Kingdom a survey found 44 % of all consumers were concerned about pesticides and 43 % about the use of food additives ( Food Standards Agency , 2003 ) .
This suggests that organic food based nutrients is something which people are taking more notice of .
5. Organic farming increases the risk of food poisoning .
The Department of Nutrition in Greece said :
" It is difficult ... to weigh the risks , but what should be made clear to consumers is that ' organic ' does not equal ' safe ' .
Much of this was based on the theory that if we do n't use ' modern ' day chemical pesticides that bacteria such as E Coli could not effectively be treated on crops .
However studies made by S.K. Sagoo , C.L. Little & R.T. Mitchell on the microbiological quality of organic vegetables in UK small organic farming & demand showed that : " The majority ( 3185 of 3200 ; 99*5 % ) of samples were found to be of satisfactory / acceptable quality whilst only 15 ( 0*5 % ) were of unsatisfactory quality .
Unsatisfactory results were due to Escherichia coli and Listeria spp ..... The absence of pathogens and the low incidence of E. coli indicate that overall agricultural , hygiene ; harvesting and production practices were good "
They suggested that the growth in the organic market has reflected an increase in the associated microbiological safety .
About the Author
Julian Hall of http://www.Got-Organic.co.uk
There are quite a few articles out there about how Africa holds the key to whether French will retain its status as a major world language or not , so I thought I 'd gather some info from a few of them here .
First from this one , an older article ( 2003 ) but still with a great deal of good information :
Avec plus de 170 millions de locuteurs sur les cinq continents , le français devrait sans ambiguïté être considéré comme une langue mondiale .
La bataille de la science est désormais quasiment perdue .
Durant les trois dernières années , sur les quelque deux millions d’articles publiés dans le domaine des sciences exactes , seuls 25 000 l’ont été en français .
L’un des principaux atouts de la langue française réside dans son implantation géographique .
Alors que le chinois n’est parlé qu’en Chine , l’hindi en Inde , l’arabe dans une zone géographique concentrée ( Maghreb , Moyen - Orient ) , l’espagnol en Espagne et en Amérique latine , le français est plus « dispersé » .
Et de ce fait plus , il est plus « international » .
L’un des signes de ce manque de combativité est perceptible au sein des institutions européennes où le français ne cesse de céder du terrain ... Pour Bernard Cerquiglini : « Si nous perdons dans l’Union européenne , nous perdrons pour la terre entière » .
Pierre - André Wiltzer , le ministre français délégué à la Coopération et la Francophonie , partage ce point de vue et estime que « le plus difficile combat » de la francophonie est celui de l’Europe .
Par contre , c’est en Afrique que le français peut trouver le nouveau souffle qui lui permettra , dans les décennies à venir , de rester démographiquement concurrent .
Pierre - André Wiltzer a ainsi déclaré que « le continent africain est une ressource considérable pour la francophonie » parce qu’il bénéficie d’une « vitalité démographique très importante » .
L’Afrique demeure en effet le plus grand bassin de locuteurs de français .
...le continent africain qui connaît une forte croissance de sa population , qui passerait ainsi d'environ un milliard de personnes en l'an 2000 à deux milliards en 2050 ... À l'évidence , le nombre de locuteurs francophones d'Afrique augmente également .
... ajoute - t - il , outre cinq pays européens -- principalement la France , la Belgique et la Suisse -- le Québec , le Canada et Haïti , « tous les autres pays sont situés en Afrique ! » .
Mieux , si dans les années 1960 les locuteurs des pays francophones du Nord représentaient 80 % de l'ensemble des francophones de la planète , ce taux est passé à 50 % en 2000 .
Et selon des études expertes , ils ne représenteront plus que 15 % des francophones en 2050 .
Présentement , on estime à 200 millions le nombre de francophones dans le monde , alors qu'ils seront plus de 600 millions en 2050 .
« les Africains ne font plus beaucoup référence au français comme langue coloniale » et que « cette vision est largement dépassée » .
With more than 170 million users in the five continents , French should clearly be regarded as a world language .
But : The battle of science is now almost lost .
During the last three years , out of some 2 million articles published in the domain of exact sciences , only 25,000 were in French .
On the geographic distribution of the language compared to others :
One of the main strengths of the French language resides in its geographic implementation .
While Chinese is only spoken in China , Hindi in India , Arabic in a concentrated geographic location ( Maghreb , Middle East ) , Spanish in Spain and Latin America , French is more " dispersed " , and thus it is more " international " .
And finally , how paradoxically French is having a harder time in Europe than in a region like Africa :
One of the signs of this lack of fighting spirit is evident in European institutions where French continues to lose ground ... For Bernard Cerquiglini : " If we lose in the European Union , we lose over the entire world " .
Pierre - André Wiltzer , the French Minister Delegate for Cooperation and Francophonie , shares this view and believes that " the most difficult battle " of the Francophonie is that of Europe .
On the other hand , it 's in Africa where French is able to find new life , which will enable it in the decades to come to remain demographically competitive .
Pierre - Andre Wiltzer also said that " the African continent is a considerable resource for the Francophonie " because it benefits from a " very important demographic vitality " .
Africa remains indeed the largest pool of French speakers .
Next , from an article from 2008 ... the African continent which is experiencing a strong growth in its population , which would increase from about 1 billion people in 2000 to two billion in 2050 ... naturally , the number of French speakers in Africa is also increasing .
and :... he adds , besides five European countries -- mainly France , Belguim and Switzerland -- Quebec , Canada and Haiti , " all the other countries are located in Africa ! "
Moreover , if in 1960 the users of francophone countries represented 80 % of the francophones on the planet , this figure has become 50 % in 2000 .
And according to expert studies , they will only represent 15 % of the francophones in 2050 .
Presently , there are an estimated 200 million francophones in the world , while they will be more than 600 million in 2050 .
And finally , also from 2008 ( he says ) " Africans do not refer to French all that much as a colonial language " , and that " this vision is largely outdated . "
As reported on PlanetHalfLife , both boys met at an internet café to play Counter - Strike against each other where the 17 year old Alexei kept winning against 14 year old Alexander .
Due to this they already had several fights inside of the café but after a while the 14 year old left only to wait for his opponent .
Outside of the building Alexander was waiting with a friend until Alexei finished playing which was reported to be at about 3.00 AM .
The 14 year old then started beating up his rival with a brick until he broke down and died due to the injuries .
The boy has been sentenced to four years of imprisonment also under the circumstance that he did not intend to kill his victim .
The purpose of science education is no longer simply to train that tiny fraction of the population who will become the next generation of scientists .
We need a more scientifically literate populace to address the global challenges that humanity now faces and that only science can explain and possibly mitigate , such as global warming , as well as to make wise decisions , informed by scientific understanding , about issues such as genetic modification .
Moreover , the modern economy is largely based on science and technology , and for that economy to thrive and for individuals within it to be successful , we need technically literate citizens with complex problem - solving skills .
In short , we now need to make science education effective and relevant for a large and necessarily more diverse fraction of the population .
What do I mean by an effective education in science ?
I believe a successful science education transforms how students think , so that they can understand and use science like scientists do .
But is this kind of transformation really possible for a large fraction of the total population ?
Transporting student thinking from novice to expertThe hypothesis that I and others have advanced is that it is possible , but only if we approach the teaching of science like a science .
That means applying to science teaching the practices that are essential components of scientific research and that explain why science has progressed at such a remarkable pace in the modern world .
The most important of these components are : • Practices and conclusions based on objective data rather than — as is frequently the case in education — anecdote or tradition .
This includes using the results of prior research , such as work on how people learn . •
Disseminating results in a scholarly manner and copying and building upon what works .
Too often in education , particularly at the postsecondary level , everything is reinvented , often in a highly flawed form , every time a different instructor teaches a course .
( I call this problem “ reinventing the square wheel . ” ) •
Fully utilizing modern technology .
Just as we are always looking for ways to use technology to advance scientific research , we need to do the same in education .
These three essential components of all experimental scientific research ( and , not incidentally , of the scholarship of teaching and learning ) can be equally valuable in science education .
Applied to the teaching of science , they have the capability to dramatically improve both the effectiveness and the efficiency of our educational system .
When I first taught physics as a young assistant professor , I used the approach that is all too common when someone is called upon to teach something .
First I thought very hard about the topic and got it clear in my own mind .
Then I explained it to my students so that they would understand it with the same clarity I had .
At least that was the theory .
But I am a devout believer in the experimental method , so I always measure results .
And whenever I made any serious attempt to determine what my students were learning , it was clear that this approach just did n’t work .
An occasional student here and there might have understood my beautifully clear and clever explanations , but the vast majority of students were n’t getting them at all .
Student reaction to my brilliantly clear explanations
For many years , this failure of students to learn from my explanations remained a frustrating puzzle to me , as I think it is for many diligent faculty members .
What eventually led me to understand it was that I was encountering the even bigger puzzle of my graduate students .
I have conducted an extensive research program in atomic physics over many years that has involved many graduate students , on whose professional development I have spent a lot of time and thought .
And over the years I became aware of a consistent pattern :
New graduate students would come to work in my laboratory after 17 years of extraordinary success in classes , but when they were given research projects to work on , they were clueless about how to proceed .
Or worse — often it seemed that they did n’t even really understand what physics was .
But then an amazing thing happened :
After just a few years of working in my research lab , interacting with me and the other students , they were transformed .
I ’d suddenly realize they were now expert physicists , genuine colleagues .
If this had happened only once or twice it would have just seemed an oddity , but I realized it was a consistent pattern .
So I decided to figure it out .
One hypothesis that occurred to me , as it has to many other research advisors who have observed similar transformations , is that the human brain has to go through a 17 - year “ caterpillar ” stage before it is suddenly transformed into a physicist “ butterfly . ” Brain - development possibility : 17 years as intellectual caterpillar before transformation into physicist butterfly ?
But I was n’t satisfied with that explanation , so I tackled it like a science problem .
I started studying the research on how people learn , particularly how they learn science , to see if it could provide a more satisfactory explanation of the pattern .
Sure enough , the research did have another explanation to offer that also solved the earlier puzzle of why my classroom teaching was ineffective .
We 're going to look into that reason , do some research on learning and get to some basic concepts in Part 2 .

My friend Jake and I were recently heading back to San Francisco from a party in Oakland .
Jake was traveling with a bicycle and I was n’t and we went back and forth for a long time trying to figure out how the 12 - block trip to the train station was going to work .
Was there a way to share the bike ?
Perhaps I could I sit on Jake ’s shoulders , chicken - fighting - style , while he pedaled ?
We only had one helmet between us , “ but do n’t worry ” , I said , “ My thighs will be your helmet . ”
It made a lot of sense , but we were tired and could n’t figure out how to make it work .
We ended up walking the entire way .
In the days following , we could n’t stop thinking about our failure .
We knew there must be a way for two friends to safely share a bike .
The following series of sketches explore solutions to this problem .
In the first set , Jake provides a classic template for riding on your friend ’s shoulders .
The top rider keeps the hands up as a sign of success .
You ’ll notice that no one gets hurt in a crash because the top rider has a helmet and the bottom rider has thighs protecting their head .
Very nice !
In the next set of sketches , I expand on Jake ’s template by adding some different styles of handgrips and footholds .
Where is the bike ?
There is no bike .
Fantasy !
Next , my sister Anna trashes convention and provides a number of alternative ways to safely sit atop someone ’s shoulders .
I doubt you 'll need to pray .
This is safe .
Finally , our friend Peter provides two vivid , real - life examples .
We ’re so close to figuring this out !
If anyone out there has other ideas , please send in your sketches .
Who knows where this is going ?
We might set up a My Thighs Will Be Your Helmet shop on Etsy and sell t- shirts and handbags .
UPDATE : A few people have mentioned the phrase “ my thighs will be your helmet ” has sexual undertones .
Seriously ?
I do n’t know how I could be any more explicit that this is about friends sharing a bike in a safe manner .
Get your mind out of the gutter .
Sex addiction seems to be popping up all over .
Actor David Duchovny checked into a rehab facility for sexual addiction in August -- just before the new season of his randy TV series " Californication . "
In her new book , " Desire : When Sex Meets Addiction , " Susan Cheever recounts having sex with men she barely knew at times of stress : " Moving men , doctors , lawyers , book salesmen -- any man associated with a threatening change in my life became erotically charged , with predictable results . "
But is sex addiction a real disease , or just an excuse for behaving badly ?
How much is too much ?
When does preoccupation cross the line into pathology ?
The psychotherapy community has been wrestling with such questions for years .
One camp thinks the very notion of " sex addiction " implies a narrow , moralistic view of what 's acceptable .
" There are millions of people stuck in unhappy relationships who go to massage parlors or the Internet and to demonize their sexuality is terribly unfair , " says Marty Klein , a licensed marriage and family therapist and certified sex therapist in Palo Alto , Calif .
He says people who are unhappy with their sexual choices may be depressed or bipolar or need to face the fact that their relationships have failed , but the problem is n't necessarily sex .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former GOP presidential nominee John McCain warned Wednesday that the United States is losing the war in Afghanistan .
Sen . John McCain recommended expanding the Afghan army to between 160,000 and 200,000 troops .
The Arizona senator , the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee , said that while he approved of President Obama 's recent decision to send 17,000 more troops to the country , he believed an additional allied military and civilian surge would be necessary to prevent it from once again becoming an al Qaeda safe haven .
The Obama administration is conducting a review of overall U.S. policy in the troubled Islamic republic , the president said in his joint address to Congress on Tuesday .
" With our friends and allies , we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al Qaeda and combat extremism , " Obama said Tuesday .
" Because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world .
We will not allow it . "
But McCain said on Wednesday , " When you are n't winning in this kind of war , you are losing .
And , in Afghanistan today , we are not winning . "
He delivered his remarks at the American Enterprise Institute , a Washington - based think tank .
McCain claimed that while the situation in Afghanistan is " nowhere near as dire as it was in Iraq , " the number of insurgent attacks had spiked in 2008 and violence had increased more than 500 percent in the past four years .
Growing portions of the country " suffer under the influence of the Taliban , " he added .
McCain 's comments echoed those of Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who acknowledged last Friday that the United States is facing a " very tough test " in Afghanistan .
" But I 'm sure we will rise to the occasion the way we have many times before , " Gates told a news conference in Krakow , Poland , where NATO defense ministers were meeting .
McCain said that the U.S. was winning the war in Afghanistan through early 2005 , when some troops were withdrawn and " our integrated civil - military command structure was disassembled and replaced by a Balkanized and dysfunctional arrangement . "
A Vietnam War veteran , former prisoner of war and longtime member of the Armed Services Committee , McCain said that while he knows Americans " are weary of war ... we must win [ in Afghanistan ] .
The alternative is to risk that country 's return to its previous function as a terrorist sanctuary , from which al Qaeda could train and plan attacks against America . "
Among other things , McCain stated that the U.S. needs to establish a larger military headquarters capable of executing " the necessary planning and coordination for a nationwide counterinsurgency campaign . "
He also said plans to expand the Afghan army from 68,000 to 134,000 troops were insufficient .
He recommended expanding the Afghan army to between 160,000 and 200,000 troops .
At the same time , he said , the U.S. needs to boost the country 's nonmilitary assistance to help strengthen " its [ civilian ] institutions , the rule of law , and the economy in order to provide a sustainable alternative to the drug trade . "
Southern Afghanistan provides about two thirds of the world 's opium and heroin .
Over the years , those two drugs have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency , including the Taliban .
McCain warned that , even if his recommendations are adopted , the violence in Afghanistan is " likely to get worse before it gets better .
The scale of resources required to prevail will be enormous . "
The timetable , he concluded , " will be measured in years , not months . "

Mrike Rrucaj was hit by the bullet while lying in bed in her house An Albanian woman shot in her sleep in 1997 lived for 12 years with a bullet lodged in her cheek without knowing it until it showed up on an X -ray .
Mrike Rrucaj was injured while lying in bed at a time of civil strife in Albania in 1997 .
But doctors told her the bullet passed straight through her cheek and simply patched up her wound .
The truth was discovered a week ago when she collapsed in pain , and the 2.8 cm - long bullet was eventually found .
" I was covered in blood and my husband took me to casualty where there were many people injured , " she told Albania 's Ata news agency of the 1997 incident .
" But the doctor told me the bullet had come out and cleaned the wound .
" I was 28 , and did not feel a thing for 12 years . "
At the time of the shooting , Albania was wracked by civil violence and anger over fraudulent pyramid schemes , with gunfire common and injuries all too common .
Fatos Olldashi , chief neurosurgeon at Albania 's military hospital , did not blame his colleague for not being more attentive in 1997 , when an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people were killed .
" The unique thing about this case is not the operation , but the fact she kept it unknowingly for 12 years in her head , " the surgeon told Reuters news agency .
The doctor who treated Ms Rrucaj had , he suggested , worked in different times .
" It is easy to judge the doctor now , but it was quite different back in 1997 .
He thought it had come out , " he said .
" And they were treating seriously injured people , not someone standing up and talking to them . "

TEN years ago this week a black box was demonstrated at a broadcasters ' convention in Las Vegas .
TiVo 's digital video recorder ( DVR ) was expensive : the cheapest model cost $ 499 .
But it was hailed as revolutionary .
It was much more flexible and easier to programme than a videocassette recorder .
It allowed people to record and play back at the same time , so they could start watching a programme 20 minutes after it had started and fast - forward through all the advertisements .
Experts forecast a severe , perhaps fatal , blow to advertising - supported television .
“ For quite a few years people thought it was going to mean the demise of the television business , ” says Alan Wurtzel , president of research at NBC , an American broadcast network .
Yet DVRs turn out to have done little damage .
Indeed , DVRs ( also known as personal video recorders , or PVRs ) may even have protected television and made it more conservative .
On one point the Cassandras were correct .
As prices fell and cable and satellite firms began to bundle DVRs with other services , their popularity soared .
According to Nielsen , a media - research outfit , 29 % of American homes now have one .
The boxes are in a higher proportion of the households advertisers most care about .
Jack Wakshlag of Turner Broadcasting , a cable company , calculates that DVR - owning households earn about $ 20,000 more than average .
Yet those households do not use them nearly as much as one might expect .
Families with DVRs seem to spend 15 - 20 % of their viewing time watching pre-recorded shows , and skip only about half of all advertisements .
This means only about 5 % of television is time - shifted and less than 3 % of all advertisements are skipped .
Mitigating that loss , people with DVRs watch more television .
Just because technology enables people to do something does not mean they will , particularly when it comes to a medium as indolence - inducing as television .
And people have become lazier .
Early adopters of DVRs used them a lot — not surprisingly , since they paid so much for them .
Later adopters use them much less ( about two - thirds less , according to a recent study ) .
David Poltrack , head of research and planning at CBS , another broadcast network , reckons the networks have already felt most of the DVR 's effects .
Advertisers and television networks have pushed back even against this puny threat .
They have developed relatively static advertisements that get a message across even at high speed .
They put snippets of programming in the middle of ad breaks .
One trick , described by Todd Juenger of TiVo as “ closer to a silver bullet ” , is to run advertisements that resemble programmes — in some cases featuring stars from the show people are trying to watch .
Far from being revolutionary , in some ways DVR has made television more stable .
With the exception of live events it is broadly true that the most popular programmes are recorded the most .
Mr Wakshlag describes it as “ a hit - saving machine ” .
Broadcast television receives a bigger boost from DVR playback than cable television .
The device has made it harder to introduce a new television programme , particularly at 10 pm when people are likely to be playing back shows they recorded at 8 pm or 9 pm .
One reason television executives have calmed down about DVRs is that they have something else to worry about .
Hulu and other video - streaming websites , which are becoming more popular , give a great deal of control to consumers and are thought to pose a threat to advertising - supported television .
Does that sound familiar ?
For al - Hamdani , worse was to come .
In his speech at the Amman conference , he said that the Americans had arrested and detained him in June 2003 .
Three months later he had been freed , only to see his Baghdad home come under U.S. attack : “ There were eight persons in the house , four of them children .
My family was terrified .
I had no idea why they were shooting . ”
He says he gave himself up willingly , but a U.S. soldier pushed him to the ground , handcuffed him , then stood with a boot on his neck .
Al - Hamdani ’s anger as he related these experiences was palpable , yet he remained , he insisted , willing to work with the Americans .
“ The impact was visceral , ” says Clad .
“ The way he put it was that people treated the way he had been ‘ had died in the eyes of their families . ’
Raad had tears in his eyes , remembering the humiliation .
Respect and honor are a crucial part of Arab culture , and here he was , reminding us that we had taken this away from him and his family . ”
In front of the conference , Clad stood up and walked across to al - Hamdani .
“ What we did was shameful , it should never have happened , and we apologize unreservedly , ” he said .
“ There was no intention to bring dishonor on your family . ”
All the other Americans present followed suit .
Talal al - Gaaod had been telling his Sunni friends that the Americans , improbable as it might seem , could well be responsive to an overture .
The apology to al - Hamdani looked like evidence he was right .
“ Word soon got round about this , ” says Jones .
“ It definitely had an impact . ”
Later that day , al - Gaaod asked Jones to arrange a private meeting .
“ He said , ‘ There ’s a fellow here who wants to talk to you , ’ ” Jones recalls .
A little later , Jones , Clad , Walker , and Colonel Roy David Harlan , the U.S. military attaché in Amman , gathered in Jones ’s suite .
With al - Gaaod was a man known as “ the Messenger , ” also called “ Dr. Ismail , ” a medical doctor and lawyer who had come to Amman from Fallujah .
He was , al - Gaaod said , the designated representative of 16 Sunni insurgency groups .
Walker had by now grown accustomed to frustrating meetings with people who claimed to be close to the insurgency ’s leadership .
In April of that year , after the Fallujah lynchings , says Walker , “ there were no less than seven lines of negotiations going on with all manner of reputed ‘ leaders , ’ ” none of whom turned out to be real .
The Messenger , he says , was different .
Walker had been studying Iraq ’s tribal structures on the ground for months .
As he told the Marines ’ commander , Lieutenant General Conway , in an e-mailed report after the meeting , the Sunnis who had come to Amman “ can roughly be likened to the Sinn Fein and the I.R.A. [ in Northern Ireland ] …
One is attempting to work within the system and the other is fighting us on the battlefield . ”
In other words , says Walker , if Talal was the insurgency ’s political face , the Messenger , in contrast , was its military face , “ by far the most credible and important contact with the insurgency we had . ”
Jones agrees .
“ There was just no question that he wanted to make a deal with us .
The insurgents had seen when we went into Fallujah in April what we could do , and they wanted to put a stop to this before any more of their cities were destroyed . ”
The Messenger , Walker says , told the Americans , “ We are not your enemy .
Al - Qaeda is your enemy , ” and the U.S. and the Sunnis should be working together to defeat it .
The Messenger , says Jones , stayed at the conference after the meeting and showed up the next day with two men Talal identified as insurgency colleagues .
They had brought a list of conditions the insurgents were demanding in return for ending the killing of Americans , written in the name of something called the Iraq National Resistance Council .
The original document ’s English was poor .
Working through a translator , Clad and the Messenger produced an improved version .
It began with three “ non-negotiable points ” — that Iraq “ should be viewed as one united country ” ; that the occupation must end , “ even if that has to happen in stages ” ; and that “ the wealth of Iraq should be used for the benefit of Iraqis and should not be siphoned off by others . ”
To this was added a significant rider : “ We do n’t mind participation by American companies .
As a matter of fact , we encourage their participation . ”
It 's emerged that virulent H5N1 bird flu was sent out by accident from an Austrian lab last year and given to ferrets in the Czech Republic before anyone realised .
As well as the risk of it escaping into the wild , the H5N1 got mixed with a human strain , which might have spawned a hybrid that could unleash a pandemic .
Last December , the Austrian branch of US vaccine company Baxter sent a batch of ordinary human H3N2 flu , altered so it could n't replicate , to Avir Green Hills Biotechnology , also in Austria .
In February , a lab in the Czech Republic working for Avir alerted Baxter that , unexpectedly , ferrets inoculated with the sample had died .
It turned out the sample contained live H5N1 , which Baxter uses to make vaccine .
The two seem to have been mixed in error .
Markus Reinhard of Baxter says no one was infected because the H3N2 was handled at a high level of containment .
But Ab Osterhaus of Erasmus University in the Netherlands says : " We need to go to great lengths to make sure this kind of thing does n't happen . "
Accidental release of a mixture of live H5N1 and H3N2 viruses could have resulted in dire consequences .
While H5N1 does n't easily infect people , H3N2 viruses do .
If someone exposed to a mixture of the two had been simultaneously infected with both strains , he or she could have served as an incubator for a hybrid virus able to transmit easily to and among people .
The barreleye ( Macropinna microstoma ) has extremely light - sensitive eyes that can rotate within a transparent , fluid - filled shield on its head .
The fish 's tubular eyes , well inside the head , are capped by bright green lenses .
The eyes point upward ( as shown here ) when the fish is looking for food overhead .
They point forward when the fish is feeding .
The two spots above the fish 's mouth are not eyes : those are olfactory organs called nares , which are analogous to human nostrils .
A bizarre deep - water fish called the barreleye has a transparent head and tubular eyes .
Since the fish 's discovery in 1939 , biologists have known the eyes were very good at collecting light .
But their shape seemed to leave the fish with tunnel vision .
Now scientists say the eyes rotate , allowing the barreleye to see directly forward or look upward through its transparent head .
The barreleye ( Macropinna microstoma ) is adapted for life in a pitch - black environment of the deep sea , where sunlight does not reach .
They use their ultra-sensitive tubular eyes to search for the faint silhouettes of prey overhead .
Scientists had thought the eyes were fixed in an upward gaze , however .
This would make it impossible for the fish to see what was directly in front of them , and very difficult for them to capture prey with their small , pointed mouths .
Bruce Robison and Kim Reisenbichler of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute use videos from the institute 's remotely operated vehicles ( ROVs ) to study barreleyes off Central California .
At depths of 2,000 to 2,600 feet ( 600 to 800 meters ) , the ROV cameras typically showed these fish hanging motionless in the water , their eyes glowing a vivid green in the ROV 's bright lights .
The video also revealed a previously undescribed feature of these fish — its eyes are surrounded by a transparent , fluid - filled shield that covers the top of the fish 's head .
Most existing descriptions and illustrations of this fish do not show its fluid - filled shield , probably because this fragile structure was destroyed when the fish were brought up from the deep in nets .
Robison and Reisenbichler were fortunate to bring a net - caught barreleye to the surface alive .
Over several hours in an aquarium on the ship , they were able to confirm that the fish rotated its tubular eyes as it turned its body from a horizontal to a vertical position .
Barreleyes , just a few inches long , are thought to eat small fishes and jellyfish .
The green pigments in their eyes may filter out sunlight coming directly from the sea surface , helping the barreleye spot the bioluminescent glow of jellies or other animals directly overhead .
When it spots prey ( such as a drifting jelly ) , a barreleye rotates its eyes forward and swims upward , in feeding mode .
The findings were detailed recently in the journal Copeia .

Jack Wrangler , a ruggedly handsome 1970s - era porn star whose openness about his homosexuality made him a symbol of self - confidence for many gay men , died Tuesday in New York City from complications of lung disease .
He was 62 .
His life of sometimes surprising turns -- the openly gay star found decades - long love with singer Margaret Whiting -- was chronicled in the documentary “ Wrangler : Anatomy of an Icon , ” released last year .
Born John Stillman in Beverly Hills , the son of TV producer Robert Stillman , Wrangler got his start performing in the religiously themed 1950s NBC series “ The Faith of Our Children . ”
He studied theater at Northwestern University .
As a young man , he was bartending and go - go dancing in the West Hollywood gay community when a role in a San Francisco play sent his career hurtling in a new direction -- under a new last name , borrowed from the label on his plaid work shirt .
His resume grew to include more than 80 adult films , including “ A Night at the Adonis ” and “ The Devil in Miss Jones : Part II . ”
He met Whiting , a big - band - era singer whose hits include “ That Old Black Magic ” and “ Moonlight in Vermont , ” in the 1970s .
Their romance turned tabloid heads :
She is 22 years his senior , and Wrangler continued to describe himself as gay even in an interview with the gay magazine the Advocate last fall .
Nonetheless , Wrangler told the Chicago Tribune in 1985 that the two saw “ things the same way , comically , professionally and romantically . ”
The pair eventually married .
He got out of porn after meeting Whiting and turned his attention to theater and cabaret , crafting Whiting ’s cabaret acts and several shows around the legacy of songwriter Johnny Mercer , who had fostered her career .

A few weeks ago I received a free copy of Django 1.0 Template Development by Packt Publishing to review .
You can view the chapter about serving multiple output formats on my blog , and below is my review of the rest .
The author is Scott Newman , who has had several years ’ experience with Django , on top of more than a decade with other web development technologies , and his experience shows .
He demonstrates very good understanding of the philosophy of Django ’s template system , while recognising its limitations .
As I ’ve thought about this , given the vastly superior out - of - the - box approach that Django has with regards to security issues ( such as SQL injection , auto - escaping and XSS ) , compared to PHP , I ’ve realised that , armed with a book like this , Django could become the perfect choice for “ My First Dynamic Web Site ” projects .
Securing a PHP web app is a job that is really for experts only , and despite years of experience in PHP , I increasingly feel myself not up to the task , and I positively tremble for all the novices out there stumbling through vulnerability after vulnerability in PHP .
But with Django things are very different — the obvious way to do most things is secure by default .
This idea — ” Django is for newbies ” — is a bit of a surprise to me , as I ’ve always thought of Django as a framework for mature web developers , by mature web developers .
If I ’m right about this , Django really reflects Python itself beautifully — Python has this amazing ability to be just right for complete newbies , and yet provide a depth that rarely disappoints far more experienced programmers .
The only problem left for Django is ease of deployment — PHP still reigns almost unchallenged in this area .
This approach is just perfect for web designers who need to get into Django templates , but do n’t want to learn Python first .
It is also ideal for the likes of Jeff Croft , the designers - cum - developers , who want an easy way in to developing entire Django applications .
One of the great things about PHP is that the progression from knowing HTML to writing dynamic sites is very smooth — you rename your .html files to .php and start adding dynamic bits .
Of course , with PHP things tend to get ugly from there on , so a book that allows designers to take a similar approach with Django is very welcome .
The book is clearly aimed at the same people that Django ’s template system itself is aimed at : web designers with experience in HTML and web development in general , but who might have very little experience with the programming side .
The book assumes almost no knowledge of Python , and while it suggests that you go through Django ’s initial tutorial first , you could easily follow the book without doing so , and with essentially no Python knowledge .
Each topic is presented using examples , and all of the technical bits required to get you to the point of actually working with the templates themselves are covered in flawless detail with nothing assumed i.e. creation of projects , apps , view functions ( or using generic views ) , hooking things up using URL confs , running the development server , calling syncdb etc .
After the first few chapters , most of the rest are essentially stand - alone , so you can skip chapters safely , and if necessary , you will be pointed back to any necessary setup steps for the examples .
The book in its entirety also assumes no knowledge of things like regex syntax or even the HTTP protocol .
Scope and contents
So the scope of this book ends up being slightly broader than the title would at first suggest , but it actually makes perfect sense given this audience .
The chapters are as follows :
An introduction to the Django Template System Views , URLs , and Generic Views Template Context Using the Built - In Tags and Filters Loading and Inheriting Templates Serving Multiple Templates Custom Tags and Filters Pagination Customizing the Admin Look and Feel Caching Your Pages Internationalization
The table of contents is very detailed ( and is available online ) , and there is also a comprehensive index .
The first chapter covers all of the architecture of Django and the request life cycle that a template author , and someone following the book , will need to use .
Chapter 2 goes into detail about how to construct views and supply templates with the context variables they need .
It includes how to make simple models , which are used in the sample application .
It then discusses how to simplify things by using generic views .
Chapter 3 provides more details about Context , and goes on to cover using RequestContext and context processors , which is important as this will be very common , as well as using the shortcuts such as render_to_response , which is the right order to do things I think .
Chapter 4 provides a complete reference to the built - in template tags and filters , which exceeds that available online by providing examples for every instance .
Chapter 5 completes the basics of using templates by going into how loading templates and inheritance works , and helpfully discusses the use of includes over inheritance .
The rest of the book really addresses various tasks that template authors are going to face , and does so very well in my opinion , consistently targeting the same audience and providing all the needed technical details .
Chapter 6 distinguishes itself by a very helpful treatment of various approaches to serving different content to different browsers , particularly thinking about mobile devices , that I ’ve not seen elsewhere .
Throughout the book there is generally very impressive attention to detail .
It also follows Django best - practices and coding style , along with PEP 8 , which I appreciate .
I found just a handful of minor errors ( which should shortly appear on the errata page ) .
There was just one significant error , which was in chapter 7 , p164 , which says that the is_safe attribute of template filters will be explained at some point , but it never is ( that I could find , anyway ) .
On this point , namely the issue of auto - escaping and how it works , I found the explanation of the escape filter to be quite helpful — the book essentially says that the escape filter is always applied last wherever it comes in a chain of filters , which is a nice way of thinking about this somewhat tricky feature .
However , I did think that some more explanation , or at least mention , of the issues surrounding auto - escaping and implementing template filters , including the unexplained is_safe attribute , was in fact necessary .
Given the audience , I thought that the book could have been improved by providing examples of how to better exploit the powerful generic views by ‘ wrapping ’ them with a view function that does some initial work and delegates the rest to one of the generic views .
This is a common pattern , but one missed by lots of newbies ( who instead file tickets for how the generic views can be expanded ) and there were a number of opportunities in the book which could have been used to show this useful technique .
These minor criticisms apart , I found the book very impressive and I ’m happy to say that I would heartily recommend it for all template authors , and especially the type of developers and designers that I ’ve mentioned above .
HOW TO HAIL A BUS
If the ever - expanding lump of petrified chewing gum affixed to the seat of my trousers is suggestive of anything , it 's that I rely on public transport quite a lot these days .
Oh sure , I could get a car , but sadly I have n't caught any leprechauns lately and as such do not possess the required huge pot o' gold or cash equivalent one needs to buy and maintain a vehicle .
So I ride the bus a lot , because you could ride the bus right across the city every fucking day for the rest of your life and it still would not cost as much as a brand new SUV .
You have to take the rough with the smooth , of course .
Buses only drive around where they want and when they want , and you generally just have to hope your interests coincide at some point .
There 's always the risk of weirdoes , and being stared at balefully by old ladies for an entire trip , only after which you realise that you were supposed to give up your seat for them .
And of course , you have to hail them .
Now , I 'm a socially awkward young man constantly afraid of being judged by everyone in the world , and so I wonder what the bus driver thinks when I hold out a hand to flag him down .
Does he think " Ah , another young soul to join the happy bus party " with a smile on his lips , or does he think " How dare this tall drink of water have the audacity to sully my lovely bus with his obnoxious presence !
He 'd better not still be around when we reach the end of the line or I 'm going to fucking piss in his ear ! "
From that line of thinking , I found myself wondering if the arrangement of your hand while hailing the bus affects his opinion of you .
And so , I resolved to write a breakdown of all the different hand gestures to use when hailing a bus , and try to figure out which one is the best .
The Flat Spank The Flat Spank is the hand held rigidly out with all the fingers together , in a display of efficient neatness that will give the driver the impression that he is about to welcome aboard a fine upstanding young fellow who likes things to be tidy .
Or , alternatively , Hitler .
A hand held out like this does look unsettlingly like a Nazi salute and if you unwittingly combine it with sticking a finger under your nose to check if you washed your hands properly in the toilet , you probably should n't be surprised if the bus steers towards you with intent of murder .
The Plymouth Point A single extended finger seems like an appropriate enough hail , but under examination it seems a little condescending .
If you do n't raise it up high enough it 's like you 're saying " Hey , you have to pull the bus up right HERE , remember ?
I know it 's tricky but not everyone gets it the first time , I 'm sure you 'll try your best " .
But of course if you hold it up too high you start to look a bit over enthusiastic , like the teacher 's pet going " OOH ME ME ME PICK ME SIR I'VE BEEN EVER SO GOOD " .
It 's best to go for the middleground and point somewhere diagonally upwards , like you 're drawing attention to an interesting cloud shaped like Pontius Pilate .
The Hitcher This is a hail for the fantasist .
Perhaps the hailer spent their youth hitch - hiking across America , experiencing a series of fantastic adventures with an ageing hippy and an orang - outang as they quested to reach Washington before an evil county sheriff in order to declare his love to Mary - Lou herself at the big national dance contest .
Perhaps sticking out a thumb like this and getting the bus to stop brings back cherished memories of finally getting a ride from a pig truck on some moonlit country road .
Then getting raped by a pig .
The Non-Committal
The hail of choice for most people who do n't like drawing attention to themselves .
With the fingers half - curled the hailer communicates that he 's caught somewhere between hailing and not hailing , so if the bus driver could stop that would be cool , but if he does n't that 's cool too .
You have to remember not to curl the fingers too much , because at some point it becomes the universally accepted sign for " This is my arsehole !
It likes gay sex ! " which a bus driver may find at best unappealing and at worst the opposite .
Brenda
It seems there are a lot of things that could go wrong with Brenda .
The driver may think you strange for putting lipstick and permanent marker on your hand , and for flexing your thumb around to create the illusion of speech while affecting a squeaky voice .
But even if he was offended by you hailing the bus in this way , you could attempt to distance yourself from your actions by maintaining the illusion that Brenda is in control of your body .
You 'll have to ask for your ticket through Brenda , taking it in her toothless mouth .
Perhaps engage the driver in squeaky conversation until , embarrassed , he asks you to move on .
Then maybe as you go to take your seat , hastily plead to him for help while Brenda is n't looking .
This is rather an elaborate way to avoid social awkwardness when getting on the bus I 'll be the first to admit , but it 's somewhat amusing , and you might even get out of paying for your ticket if you creep him out enough .

Another cause of India 's impoverishment is the destruction of her manufactures , as the result of British rule .
When the British first appeared on the scene , India was one of the richest countries of the world ; indeed it was her great riches that attracted the British to her shores .
The source of her wealth was largely her splendid manufactures .
Her cotton goods , silk goods , shawls , muslins of Dacca , brocades of Ahmedabad , rugs , pottery of Scind , jewelry , metal work , lapidary work , were famed not only all over Asia but in all the leading markets of Northern Africa and of Europe .
What has become of those manufactures ?
For the most part they are gone , destroyed .
Hundreds of villages and towns of India in which they were carried on are now largely or wholly depopulated , and millions of the people who were supported by them have been scattered and driven back on the land , to share the already too scanty living of the poor ryot .
What is the explanation ?
Great Britain wanted India 's markets .
She could not find entrance for British manufactures so long as India was supplied with manufactures of her own .
So those of India must be sacrificed .
England had all power in her hands , and so she proceeded to pass tariff and excise laws that ruined the manufactures of India and secured the market for her own goods .
India would have protected herself if she had been able , by enacting tariff laws favorable to Indian interests , but she had no power , she was at the mercy of her conqueror .
A third cause of India 's impoverishment is the enormous and wholly unnecessary cost of her government .
Writers in discussing the financial situation in India have often pointed out the fact that her government is the most expensive in the world .
Of course the reason why is plain : it is because it is a government carried on not by the people of the soil , but by men from a distant country .
These foreigners , having all power in their own hands , including power to create such offices as they choose and to attach to them such salaries and pensions as they see fit , naturally do not err on the side of making the offices too few or the salaries and pensions too small .
Nearly all the higher officials throughout India are British .
To be sure , the Civil Service is nominally open to Indians .
But it is hedged about with so many restrictions ( among others , Indian young men being required to make the journey of seven thousand miles from India to London to take their examinations ) that they are able for the most part to secure only the lowest and poorest places .
The amount of money which the Indian people are required to pay as salaries to this great army of foreign civil servants and appointed higher officials , and then , later , as pensions for the same , after they have served a given number of years in India , is very large .
That in three - fourths if not nine - tenths of the positions quite as good service could be obtained for the government at a fraction of the present cost , by employing educated and competent Indians , who much better understand the wants of the country , is quite true .
But that would not serve the purpose of England , who wants these lucrative offices for her sons .
Hence poor Indian ryots must sweat and go hungry , and if need be starve , that an ever - growing army of foreign officials may have large salaries and fat pensions .
And of course much of the money paid for these salaries , and practically all paid for the pensions , goes permanently out of India .
Another burden upon the people of India which they ought not to be compelled to bear , and which does much to increase their poverty , is the enormously heavy military expenses of the government .
I am not complaining of the maintenance of such an army as may be necessary for the defense of the country .
But the Indian army is kept at a strength much beyond what the defense of the country requires .
India is made a sort of general rendezvous and training camp for the Empire , from which soldiers may at any time be drawn for service in distant lands .
If such an imperial training camp and rendezvous is needed , a part at least of the heavy expense of it ought to come out of the Imperial Treasury .
But no , India is helpless , she can be compelled to pay it , she is compelled to pay it .
Many English statesmen recognize this as wrong , and condemn it ; yet it goes right on .
Said the late Sir Henry Campbell - Bannerman : " Justice demands that England should pay a portion of the cost of the great Indian army maintained in India for Imperial rather than Indian purposes .
This has not yet been done , and famine - stricken India is being bled for the maintenance of England 's worldwide empire . "
But there is still worse than this .
Numerous wars and campaigns are carried on outside of India , the expenses of which , wholly or in part , India is compelled to bear .
For such foreign wars and campaigns — campaigns and wars in which the Indian pcople had no concern , and for which they received no benefit , the aim of which was solely conquest and the extension of British power — India was required to pay during the last century the enormous total of more than $ 460,000,000 .
How many such burdens as these can the millions of India , who live on the average income of $ 6 a year , bear without being crushed ?
I usually agree with the sentiment that if you borrow something you damn well better pay it back .
However , I think admriker444 is justified in being upset that the US is willing to pass the mistakes of the US financial institutions on to tax - payers , while derivative traders are still getting bonuses , and providing no relief for people who spend a good portion of their life studying their asses off in school to then get a job that barely ( if ever ) pays off their education .
So why is it exactly that banking institutions with more gross income than the GDP of a third world country , companies that are critical to the global financial system , can declare bankruptcy and instantly eliminate all responsibility , but a single person who invested years of their life educating themselves , often for the betterment of society ( ie / doctors , scientists , engineers ) under almost no circumstance can discharge their student loans ?
Why do we allow a person who does n't even possess a high school degree to accumulate 10 or 20 credit cards , max out the limit , and then declare bankruptcy with little more than a slap on the wrist ?
Why is it that the government is trying to placate people ( through mortgage rate renegotiation , abatement , and subsidies ) who purchased homes they could n't afford ?
So , the real question is why do we reward the incompetent and punish the responsible ?
I think the simple answer is the intelligencia ( to borrow a word from Colbert ) are the minority .
I 'm left - leaning , I like social programs , I 'd like everyone to have access to healthcare .
I like the idea that we have a social security system in place to help our elderly , but we haveto stop lettingpeople off the hook !
I 'll be paying student loans for the next 20 years of my life and I 'll probably pay 40 - 50 K in interest .
And that 's fine .
I signed up for that and I knew what I was getting in to , but when I see everyone else getting a free ride while I work 100 hour work - weeks ( yes , I really do work that much ) then I 'm going to look for every way I can to cheat this broken , dishonorable system .
Why should I play fair when everyone else is gaming the system ?
So this becomes a question of what values do we want to enshrine in our culture ?
Do we want to devolve to a game of last - man standing , because that 's where we 're headed .
Or do we want to instead encourage people to stand up and be accountable ?
I 'm not suggesting we revert back to 18th century law , but people who purchased homes they could n't afford should lose them .
Living in an apartment ai n't that bad .
Investment bankers who lied should be forced to return their bonuses and pay other monetary damages .
If they can't afford to do it immediately , they can pay it back over time .
There 's no reason to be unduly cruel to any of these people , but everyone should pay their due .
Otherwise why should I ?
Why should admriker444 ?
Why should anyone ?
" This effect suggests that smoking marijuana may act as a primer , or sensitizer , in the airways to amplify the adverse effects of tobacco on respiratory health , " says study researcher Wan C. Tan , MD , of the University of British Columbia and St. Paul 's Hospital in Vancouver , Canada .
The study is among the first to suggest a synergistic relationship between marijuana and tobacco use among older people who are most at risk for COPD .
Smokers in the study who reported using both tobacco and marijuana were three times as likely as nonsmokers to have clinically confirmed COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) ; people who smoked only cigarettes had a slightly lower risk .
April 13 , 2009 -- People who smoke both cigarettes and marijuana have a greater risk for developing the progressive lung disease COPD than cigarette smokers who do n't smoke pot , a new study shows .
COPD Risk
About 12 million Americans are currently living with a diagnosis of COPD ; an equal number are believed to have the disease and not know it , according to the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute .
In the U.S , the term COPD includes both emphysema and chronic bronchitis .
With COPD , breathing becomes more difficult over time .
Largely caused by cigarette smoking , COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S .
While the link between tobacco and COPD is well established , far less is known about the impact of marijuana use on the lungs .
Some studies have found that even short - term heavy marijuana smoking can worsen lung function , while others have not shown this association .
Even less is known about the combined effects of smoking cigarettes and pot , Tan tells WebMD .
The study by Tan and colleagues included 878 residents of Vancouver , Canada participating in a larger investigation examining COPD prevalence .
Participants were considered tobacco smokers if they had smoked at least 365 cigarettes in their lifetime , and were considered marijuana smokers if they reported having ever smoked pot .
The researchers defined " substantial " marijuana use as having smoked at least 50 marijuana cigarettes .
The average cigarette smoker in the study had smoked for 16 years , while the self - described pot smokers had smoked an average of 84 marijuana cigarettes .
Please stop building schools in Iraq and Afghanistan
by mattsteinglass
Filed under : Development May 12 , 2009 , 9:18 amFiled under : Afghanistan
BruceR , just back from a research tour of Afghanistan , has many fascinating insights ( via Kevin Drum ) .
Among them :
Well - meaning people have built a whole ton of schools in Kandahar Province over the last few years .
As far as I could tell when I was there , none out in the rural areas were actually being used as schools during our tour .
Here ’s a general rule that applies to basically every development program in every poor country in the world , including Iraq and Afghanistan : want to do something nice and useful for these people ?
Do n’t build them a school .
Believe it or not , people in poor countries actually have buildings .
And they are capable of building more of them .
They know how to do it , and it usually , for fairly simple economic reasons , does not cost more in any country to build a building than local people can afford .
You know what they do n’t know how to do ?
Teach science and math and English .
And often , employing a trained teacher does cost more than they can afford in a small village , because such people are scarce , and it ’s hard to spare extra labor in subsistence economies .
If you want to spend your money on education , do n’t build them a school ; pay to train some teachers , and then pay the teachers ’ salaries .
Development is not about buildings .
It is not about objects .
It ’s about people .
“ BMW ’s MINI division will debut its first color - morphing car in Singapore in June .
Called the MINI Chameleon , the car changes color according to weather conditions .
For example , on a rainy day , the car ’s paint brightens to improve visibility while on a sunny day , it lightens to reflect heat and cool down the vehicle .
The color - morphing technology was made possible due to a special treatment called FeintPaint by Spanish company Payola Forlids .
Cars treated with FeintPaint comprises tiny magnetic iron oxide particles which can interact with a low grade magnetic field to change the spacing of the particles , and hence its ability to reflect light and change color .
The color changes take effect in seconds , and should be quite a sight to behold !
Unless of course , you ’re the owner , and you ’ve no idea where you last parked your car in a multi-story car park . ”
It ’s about time someone did this !
Wished this color technology could be applied to the interior leather as well … nothing like black leather during the winter , but oh my is it toasty to the touch in the summer !
Would also be cool if the cars color changed as you sped up on the highway , from a cool blue to a hot red the faster you went .

Dutch museum shows New York 's ' birth certificate '
AMSTERDAM –
To see some of the most important documents in the early history of New York , you need to go to Amsterdam .
The Rijksmuseum , the Netherland 's national museum , put those documents on display Friday , including early maps and the only report of the purchase of Manhattan by Europeans .
The exhibit marks the 400th anniversary of the departure of Henry Hudson in April 1609 on the expedition that would lead to colonization of the New York area ...
The exhibition shows the first map of Manhattan as an island , dating from 1614 ...
The only record of the Dutch purchase , which is usually stored in the Netherlands national archives , is the so - called " Schaghen Letter , " sometimes referred to as New York 's " birth certificate . "
It is a 1626 report by Dutch bureaucrat Pieter Schaghen , who interviewed a ship captain returning from the colony for government records .
The captain told Schaghen colonists had purchased an island called " Manna Hatta " for 60 guilders worth of goods .

Legislators and other elected state officials appeared to be headed for a pay cut after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Wednesday endorsed a reduction and appointed new members , who he said were like - minded , to a panel that sets the salaries .
The California Citizens Compensation Commission , which determines the pay for legislators , the governor and other officers , moved Wednesday to slice 10 % from the salaries , noting that they are higher than in many other states and that the Golden State is in poor financial shape .
“ Given the economy , the budget . . . to vote for a decrease across the board is the only way we should go , ” said commission Chairman Charles Murray , who owns an insurance business in Los Angeles .
A decrease would apply to officials elected next year .
Current officeholders would have their pay frozen through December 2010 .

The commission on Wednesday voted 3 to 1 for the pay cut , then learned from its attorney that four “ yes ” votes would be required .
There were three vacancies on the board when it met .
But Schwarzenegger quickly named people to fill them who “ share my belief that state government needs to cut back just like every California family and business is doing , ” he said in a statement .
Schwarzenegger appointed Glendale business executive Scott Somers , Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Sgt. John Stites and AT&T ; Vice President Denita Willoughby of Los Angeles .
The three new commissioners , who do not require confirmation , did not return calls seeking comment .
Meanwhile , Murray said he would schedule another vote by June 1 .
The 10 % pay cut was proposed by Commissioner Kathy Sands , who noted that most state employees had their pay reduced by 9.2 % starting in February , when Schwarzenegger ordered them on twice - monthly unpaid furloughs .

“ So many people have already had salary decreases .
. . .
I think we are in a terrible fiscal challenge , ” Sands said .
Cutting officials ’ pay is necessary , she added , “ so they can really share in this [ budget ] deficit that they helped create . ”
The lone vote against the pay squeeze was by Commissioner William Feyling , a carpenters union official .
Feyling said he would vote for a 5 % cut .
“ While I understand the emotion behind ” the 10 % proposal , he said , “ I do n’t believe it produces the effect we ’re seeking . ”
He noted that the reduction would not affect those currently in office .

Legislators did not protest the planned cuts .
“ The voters set up the commission as an independent entity , so of course we ’ll respect whatever decision it makes , ” said Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) .
The panel was established in June 1990 through voters ’ passage of Proposition 112 and must meet at least once a year to set pay and benefits .
Murray said the commission needs to review officials ’ benefits to determine whether those also should be altered , but that effort has been hampered by the state ’s failure to provide an analysis of them .
He has renewed his request for that information , he said .
A survey prepared in recent months by the state personnel department showed that the annual salaries of $ 212,000 for the governor and $ 116,208 for state legislators are much higher than in eight other states surveyed , including New York and Texas .

Although Schwarzenegger accepts no salary , his official pay is higher than the $ 179,000 paid to the governor of New York .
The next - highest pay for legislators is $ 79,650 , in Michigan .
California ’s controller , secretary of state , insurance commissioner and lieutenant governor are also paid more than their counterparts in other states .
The study found that the pay for California ’s schools chief and treasurer rank fourth and second , respectively , among the states surveyed .

Today 's G20 meeting can make the difference between human hope and despair , between economic recovery and a plunge into deepening recession .
We have seen the frightening velocity of change .
What began as a financial crisis has become a global economic crisis .
I fear worse to come : a full - blown political crisis defined by growing social unrest , weakened governments and angry publics who have lost all faith in their leaders and their own future .
We must stop the slide .
The recession hurts everyone , but those hurt worst are the poor - people with no homes or savings to lose , who in some countries spend as much as 80 % of their income on food , and often lack the basics of healthcare , water and sanitation .
They are the majority of the world 's people - and they have no safety net .
In good times , economic and social development comes slowly .
In bad times , things fall apart alarmingly fast .
It is a short step from hunger to starvation , from disease to death , from peace and stability to conflict and wars that spill across borders and affect us all , near and far .
Unless we can build a worldwide recovery we face a looming catastrophe in human development .
This is what I will tell world leaders at the G20 summit in London .
That is why I will press for urgent collective action to bolster global development and allow people to keep faith in their future .
We must recognise our interdependence .
No single nation can hope to find economic security without taking into account the wellbeing of others .
We therefore need a truly global stimulus .
Between now and the end of next year , at least $ 1tn will be needed to provide liquidity , longer - term resources for productive investment and a safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable .
The G20 looks likely to take steps that ensure developing countries have access to liquidity through the IMF .
This is important because developing countries are experiencing a credit crunch that has devastated trade and slowed growth .
There is a thin line between failing banks and failing countries , and we cross it at our peril .
G20 leaders may also agree to boost lending by the World Bank and other development banks .
This is important because private funding for infrastructure projects has contracted sharply .
The poorer countries have had no part in the making of this crisis and yet they are in danger of suffering the most .
That is why those countries that made a commitment to raising aid at Gleneagles in 2005 should reaffirm that promise , and also allocate more to poorer countries .
This would amount to at least $ 300bn of assistance during 2009 and 2010 .
Meanwhile , we must resist short - sighted pressures that would compromise , if not destroy , the progress we make in London - and say no to the new protectionism .
At their last summit , in Washington , the G20 nations solemnly promised not to place new restrictions on trade .
Since then 17 of the 20 have done precisely that .
We must reverse this .
The London summit is an opportunity for the world 's most powerful nations to act together and show solidarity with their less fortunate neighbours on our small and increasingly vulnerable planet .
Across the globe we face massive job losses .
Many of the unemployed will be young and angry .
Many work in foreign lands , sending money home for food , medicines and school fees .
These remittances make up large percentages of some nations ' GDP .
Their collapse lights a dangerous social fuse .
One trillion dollars over two years is not so large a sum , considering the consequences .
Some might call it a moral imperative .
But if our goal is to reverse a global slump , it is also sound economics .
• Ban Ki-moon is secretary general of the United Nations
NEW YORK ( Money ) -- Question : I 've lost a lot of money during this financial mess and I 'm wondering when I should go back to putting 15 % of my salary into my 401 ( K ) ?
-- Michelle Bonds , Rocky Mount , N.C .
Answer : Uh , how about like , right now .
I 'm serious .
I know that some people have reacted to this financial crisis by eliminating or scaling back their 401 ( k ) contributions .
A recent survey of plan participants by Spectrem Group found that 20 % have cut the percentage of pay they contribute , while another 5 % say they plan to do so over the next 12 months .
But no matter how rattled you may be , I do n't see how stopping or lowering your contributions to your 401 ( k ) or other retirement accounts helps you .
If anything , the events of the past year argue for saving more , not less .
That 's especially true since many employers are now trimming or eliminating matching contributions .
Another survey , also courtesy of the people at Spectrem , says that 34 % of employers have reduced or done away with their match and 29 % plan to do so over the next 12 months .
Oh , I suppose if I really thought about it I could envision some rationale for paring contributions temporarily .
Let 's say you have absolutely no money set aside in an emergency fund .
Given the all - too - real threat of being laid off these days , you could make a case that your first priority should be to accumulate at least three months of living expenses in a savings account , short - term CDs or a money - market fund .
Doing so would prevent you from having to tap into your 401 ( k ) -- and pay tax , plus a 10 % penalty if you 're under 55 -- to tide you over in the event you join the ranks of the unemployed .
Such a situation aside , however , you want to resist the urge to cut or halt your contributions to your 401( k ) .
Why am I so adamant about this ?
Well , aside from the fact that you would be foregoing the lucrative tax benefit of investing pre-tax dollars ( and deferring taxes on gains in your account -- and yes , in the long - term I do n't think it 's rash to expect gains ) , there 's a compelling investing reason to continue funding your 401 ( k ) and other retirement accounts now .
Think of it this way .
When stocks were booming in the late 90s or , for that matter , when they were at their highs in October of 2007 , I got no emails from people saying they were thinking of stopping their 401 ( k ) contributions .
No , people are quite comfortable plowing money into their 401 ( k ) s when stock prices are marching to new highs .
Fact is , though , the long - term return you 'll likely earn on the money you invest after stocks have been on a long run or are at or near a peak is much lower than the return you 'll likely get when you buy after stocks have been seriously hammered , as they 've been over the past year .
Which brings us to one of the great ironies of investing in stocks .
People are least comfortable investing in them when their future long - term return prospects are strongest and most comfortable buying when the outlook for future returns is n't as strong .
It would be nice if you could fund your 401 ( k ) only when you 're confident you 're getting the best investment bargains .
But that 's unrealistic .
Even if you could get around your natural reluctance to buy when stock prices are depressed , it 's still hard to know in real time when stocks are most attractively priced for future gains .
Besides , even if you could know this , it 's not as if you have all your retirement money on hand ready to invest in a lump sum .
You invest your money as you earn it over the course of your career .
That means that you 'll be buying stocks ( as well as other investments ) for your 401 ( k ) at a variety of prices and , in effect , earning a different long - term return on each dollar you invest .
Sometimes you 'll be investing at an advantageous time when stocks are cheap and you 'll earn a superior long - term return .
Other times you 'll invest when they 're expensive and you 'll earn a subpar return .
And you 'll also invest at prices somewhere between those extremes .
The point is that if you invest only when stock prices are on a roll and abstain when they 're in the dumps , you 'll be buying in only when stocks are selling at the high end of their value range and missing the bargains .
In a way , you would be like someone who always pays full retail and never takes advantage of a sale .
This " only buy high " approach will limit the future size of your nest egg .
So for the sake of your future retirement security , I implore you to get back to contributing to your 401( k ) .
Oh , and when you do , make sure that your understandable concern about the money you 've lost over the past year does n't get in the way of investing your money appropriately for the future .
After all , as long as you 're getting the contribution part right , you might as well follow through with the right investment strategy too .

Tesco has come under fire from the pro-Israel lobby after setting up a customer helpline option for people to complain about it stocking Israeli products .
A recorded message told callers ringing its general customer services number : " If you are ringing regarding Israeli goods , please press one . "
The supermarket said it set up the line , which is no longer available , in anticipation of a high level of calls after the Palestine Solidarity Campaign called for a boycott of Israeli goods and urged its supporters to phone Tesco and Waitrose on 30 March about their stance on selling Israeli and Israeli settlement produce .
Tesco insisted it had not meant to cause offence and said it apologised if any had been taken .
Anyone choosing the option , which was designed so customers with other queries would not find the line clogged , would have been put through to specially briefed call centre staff , the chain said .
Jonathan Hoffman , the Zionist Federation co-vice - chair , said Israel had been made a scapegoat , the Jewish Chronicle reported .
" The risk is that supermarkets will say it 's too much of a problem to stock Israeli goods , " he told the newspaper .
A Tesco spokesman said : " We were made aware that a campaign group had asked supporters of its specific cause to call supermarkets .
In order that any caller could be directed to an appropriate customer services operator , a call option was added to the usual menu .
" Our only aim was to be helpful , and if we have caused anybody offence unintentionally , we apologise . "
He added : " It was not making any political point .
There are no plans for Tesco to boycott Israeli goods . "

Five “ can’t - miss ” first round prospects in the 2009 NFL Draft
There is no such thing as a “ can’t - miss ” prospect in the first round of an NFL draft .
They just do n’t exist .
For as much as teams scout and prepare , it ’s inevitable that some prospects just are n’t going to pan out , which means they hop the train to Bustville right out of the gates .
Before you check to make sure that you ’ve taken the correct dosage of your medication today , I realize that the first line of this article directly contradicts the title .
That ’s because even though there is no such thing as “ can’t - miss ” prospect in the first round , this is the time of year to have a little fun by making some predictions .
Two weeks ago , I complied a ranking of the top 5 potential first round busts in this month ’s draft .
So I thought it was only appropriate that I construct another top 5 ranking , this time of players I deem to be “ can’t - miss ” prospects .
These are first round prospects that I think are low - risk , high - reward players .
Fair warning , do n’t flip out when you read names of prospects that are expected to go in the top 10 .
This is n’t a piece dedicated to first round steals – it ’s one that centers around prospects that should have the least amount of risk involved and the highest success rate .
Just as I mentioned in my top 5 first round busts piece , I realize that one or two of these prospects might slip to the second round ( see Alex Mack ) .
But on average , most pundits would agree that all five of the players are first round talents .
1. Aaron Curry , LB , Wake Forest
Some believe Curry is the best prospect in the entire draft and I ’m one of them .
What ’s impressive about the Wake Forest product is that he projects as either a middle or outside linebacker in any defensive scheme .
Some linebackers and defensive ends do n’t have a true position in the NFL because of lack of size , but Curry is projected to have multiple positions at the next level .
He ’s also a three - down player who not only can be a force against the run , but he ’s so athletic that he can stay on the field in passing situations and cover backs and tight ends in coverage .
Curry is the ultimate package and has limited weaknesses , which is why some Lions fans are holding out hope that Detroit will make him the No. 1 pick .
2. Eugene Monroe , OT , Virginia
Baylor ’s Jason Smith is rated as the best offensive tackle in this month ’s draft – and for good reason .
He has great size , athleticism and is projected to be the best pass blocker of any offensive lineman in the draft .
But while Smith might have a higher ceiling in terms of potential , Monroe is arguably the safest prospect in the entire draft .
He does n’t excel at any one facet of the game , yet is fundamentally sound in both run blocking and pass protection , and is also more athletic than what people give him credit for .
Monroe is the prototypical NFL offensive tackle in terms of size ( he ’s 6 ’ 5 ” , 309 pounds ) and has tons of experience ( he was a three - year starter and could have played as a true freshman if it was n’t for D’Brickashaw Ferguson ) .
He also has outstanding footwork , which is often the most important thing when pro scouts are looking at offensive line prospects .
Whichever team lands
Monroe will probably be able to plug him in at left tackle and forget about having to draft the position again for the next 10 to 12 years .
3. Alex Mack , C , California
Some people are going to take one look at Mack ’s position and wonder what I smoked right before sitting down to write this piece .
A center for a first round pick ?
Believe it .
The last center to be selected in the first round was Nick Mangold by the Jets in 2006 .
While he struggled a bit during his sophomore season , he ’s been a quality player in the middle of the Jets ’ offensive line and will likely continue to be for years to come .
Centers are often the most overlooked position on the field and yet they ’re responsible for getting their linemates set , calling out audibles and making pre-snap adjustments so their quarterbacks do n’t get killed .
They ’re often the most intelligent players on the field and prospects like Mack are changing the way teams view centers in the draft .
Mack does n’t come without his flaws ( he can be overly aggressive at times ) , but he ’s extremely intelligent , has great technique and he ’s an incredibly hard worker .
He also comes loaded with experience , is strong and does n’t have any durability issues .
Mack wo n’t be selected in the top 20 and could fall into the early second round , but he ’s the best center prospect to come out in several years and chances are he ’s going to be very successful at the next level .
4. B.J. Raji , DT , Boston College
Some will argue that since Raji comes with off field baggage ( i.e. he was ejected from a game in 2006 for throwing a punch , he missed the entire 2007 college season because of an academic issue and he also tested positive for marijuana before the 2008 season ) that he could be one of the bigger first round risks this year .
But back in 1995 there was a defensive tackle out of Miami named Warren Sapp that had some off field issues ( including a reported failed drug test leading up the draft ) too , yet he turned the doubts and criticisms into motivation and wound up being a seven - time Pro Bowler .
Raji has a ton of talent and if he ’s motivated , he could become one of the more dominant interior defensive linemen in the NFL some day .
He ’s big enough and quick enough to play either tackle position in a 4 - 3 , and has enough size to play nose in a 3 - 4 .
He has outstanding strength , can occupy multiple defenders and flashes good instincts and quickness at the point of attack .
If he winds up in a solid organization ( i.e. Green Bay ) , he could turn out to be one of the best first round picks in this draft .
He just needs to stay focused and motivated .
5. Rey Maualuga , LB , USC
Maualuga is n’t a three - down player .
He wo n’t be very good in coverage if he ’s left in obvious passing situations and he ’s not Aaron Curry in that he can play multiple ‘ backer positions in either a 4 - 3 or 3 - 4 .
Maualuga is a true thumper in every sense of the word and if he winds up playing inside linebacker in a 3 - 4 or middle linebacker in a 4 - 3 , he ’s going to be a force .
He has the size and strength to shed blockers and despite not having ideal speed , he ’s a solid pass rusher and decent blitzer .
The bottom line is that Maualuga has to fit into the right defensive scheme to be completely successful , but if he does , he could become one of the better young ‘ backers in the NFL in a short amount of time .
Be sure to return to The Scores Report the week of the draft as John Paulsen and I break down what positions are the safest bets in the first round .
There are several such stories of Imam Ali ( as ) where he solves the problems of the people .
He was known to solve the problems with his knowledge , eloquence , mathematical brilliance and justice .

Nerve signals that tell the brain that we are being slowly stroked on the skin have their own specialised nerve fibres in the skin .
This is shown by a new study from the Sahlgrenska Academy in Sweden .
The discovery may explain why touching the skin can relieve pain .
The specialised nerve fibres in the skin are called CT nerves ( C- tactile ) and they travel directly to the areas in the brain that are important in the emergence of feelings .
” Basically the signals that tell the brain that we are being stroked on the skin have their own direct route to the brain , and are not blocked even if the brain is receiving pain impulses from the same area .
In fact it ’s more the opposite , that the stroking impulses are able to deaden the pain impulses , ” says Line Löken , postgraduate student in neurophysiology at the Sahlgrenska Academy .
The results are being published in the distinguished scientific journal , Nature Neuroscience .
The research group examined a group of healthy subjects using a technique called microneurography .
“ By inserting a thin electrode into a nerve in the forearm we can listen in on the nerve and pick up signals from one of the thousands of nerve fibres that make up a nerve , ” explains Associate Professor Håkan Olausson , who is leading the research group behind the discovery , together with Johan Wessberg .
Each individual nerve fibre is responsible for touch signals from roughly a square centimetre of skin .
The research team used a specially - designed robot , which brushed over the exact area of skin for which a particular nerve fibre is responsible .
The subjects were also asked to rate how pleasant or unpleasant they found the brushing .
” As the nerve signals that were sent in the CT nerves became more frequent , the subjects reported the experience as being increasingly pleasant .
Of the skin nerves that we studied , it was only the CT nerves that had this strong link between the frequency of the signals and how pleasant it felt , ” says researcher Johan Wessberg .
PARIS — Across the French countryside , within sight of villages and towns , thick clouds of steam rise from giant cooling towers at 58 nuclear energy plants that provide more than three quarters of the nation 's electricity .
In this , France far outpaces other countries , with Japan second at about 34 percent of its electricity .
Nuclear power supplies about 20 percent of the electricity in the United States , where public anxieties and high costs have prevented construction of new reactors since 1979 .
This reliance has made France something of a poster child for nuclear power .
Now , around the world , nuclear power is getting a fresh look as an alternative to using oil , natural gas , and coal that produce climate - changing carbon emissions .
And the French government sees an opportunity .
It is preparing to build a new generation of reactors and to step up sales abroad of its technology .
" France has become one of the leading countries capable of exporting technology around the world , " says Luis E. Echávarri , the director general of the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
It is , he adds , " in a very strong position . "
While France 's heavy dependence on nuclear power has been popular — seen as a source of jobs and a safeguard against energy shortages — that view is being challenged .
Opponents are warning that the new nuclear plants are too costly and will produce more dangerous waste that contains significantly higher levels of radioactive material .
It 's not clear whether such opposition will hinder the government 's plans .
Public acceptance .
The lack of real debate here until recently , critics say , was less a vote of public support than a failure in the French political system .
" Nobody asked the French people what they thought , " remarks Jean - Philippe Desbordes , author of Atomic Park , a book critical of the French program .
" France is much less democratic than the United States . "
That 's not entirely true , since polls over the years consistently have shown public support , in no small part owing to the active encouragement of the government .
France 's ambitious nuclear energy program was first established by Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1958 , but it was not until the 1973 oil shock that nuclear power became a national priority .
The first plants built by the nationalized electricity company Electricité de France , known as EDF , were based on American technology under license from Westinghouse .
But France has since become a major developer and exporter of nuclear energy technology .
Today , the French nuclear program is making a new growth push .
In January , President Nicolas Sarkozy announced the construction of a new - generation European pressurized water reactor , or EPR , in Penly in northern France .
The project is expected to employ some 2,000 workers during the five - year construction period and cost $ 2.3 billion .
The new reactor will be more powerful than any currently in commercial use .
It will consume 15 percent less uranium while producing 30 percent less nuclear waste .
The waste , however , will be considerably more radioactive than that produced by older reactors .
The decision to build the Penly plant was quickly challenged by environmentalists , who say high levels ofradioactivity from the new plant will pose a serious health risk to workers and that nuclear waste will have to be stored above ground for a longer period than has been the case to date .
" Despite the French government 's global marketing of its flagship European Pressurized Reactor as cheap and safe , " the environmental group Greenpeace said in a statement , " nuclear energy is rapidly becoming the most expensive way to produce electricity , and its highly radioactive waste poses an ever - increasing problem . "
In announcing the construction of the Penly plant , the second in the series , the French government is hoping that building the reactor will persuade potential foreign clients to import the technology .
Although no EPRs are now operating , two are currently under construction , one in Finland at Olkiluoto and the other in Flamanville in France 's Normandy region .
The Finnish reactor has faced serious construction problems , including flawed pipes and waterlogged concrete , that have delayed its original April 2009 completion date by three years and led to cost overruns of 50 percent .
A world marketplace .
France is aggressively pursuing a worldwide market .
In September , EDF bought British Energy , the leading nuclear energy company in the United Kingdom , for 12.5 billion pounds ( $ 23.2 billion at the time of the announcement ) .
In December , EDF announced it would invest $ 4.5 billion to increase its share in the American firm Constellation Energy Nuclear Group from 9.5 percent to just under 50 percent .
In February , the French government - controlled engineering giant Areva , the world 's biggest nuclear power plant construction company , announced it would build at least two , and perhaps six , EPR nuclear reactors in India .
Officials say the new reactor at Penly and the other EPR plants being built take into account the disastrous explosion at the Soviet Union 's Chernobyl reactor in 1986 ( as well as the Three Mile Island incident in Pennsylvania in 1979 ) through a safeguarded system that cools the heart of the reactor .
The reactors are surrounded by a protective layer of reinforced concrete that can allegedly withstand the impact of a wide - body jetliner .
" It took years for people to realize that the lesson from Chernobyl was learned , " says Echávarri of the Nuclear Energy Agency .
" It has taken time to build that confidence . "
The French nuclear program is based on three key ideas : centralized management , close cooperation among the key industrial players and the government , and the recycling of nuclear waste .
By applying the same technology to all of its nuclear plants — as opposed to the United States , where some 80 different plant designs currently exist — France has significantly cut both construction costs and the time needed to obtain building permits .
In addition , the similarity of the design can make it easier to react to emergencies .
" An incident in any one of the plants automatically leads to verification that the same problem does not exist in all the other plants , " says Frank Carré , the deputy director in the nuclear development division of the French Atomic Energy Commission .
The drawback , he admits , is that a generic problem with the technology in any of the plants means that repairs must be made in all the plants .
The second major characteristic of the French program — close cooperation among EDF , Areva , the Atomic Energy Commission , and the government — lends itself to coordinating research and development and establishing a nuclear power strategy .
Such closely knit cooperation is , of course , much easier in France , which has a long tradition of government involvement in major industrial enterprises , ranging from the supersonic Concorde jetliner to the TGV high - speed train .
The downside , according to critics , is that in the case of the French program , the government simply decided to trivialize the risks by placing the nuclear power plants near where people live , thereby giving a false sense of security as the installations came to be seen as part of the landscape .
But it is in the area of nuclear waste treatment that Paris and Washington disagree most strongly .
The French have been recycling nuclear waste for some 25 years , a process the United States strongly opposes because it requires separating uranium from plutonium , which in theory could then be diverted to the production of nuclear weapons .
The French argue that recycling waste material is the best way to deal with the waste problem and to ensure the long - term availability of uranium .
" In France , we have confidence in the efficiency of the safety measures and in being able to control nuclear proliferation , " Carré says .
While the debate goes on , nuclear energy is poised for a global comeback .
More than 30 applications for nuclear power plants are pending with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the United States .
Italy , Britain , China , India , and even Russia , which is awash in oil and natural gas , are eager to build .
So are several Eastern European countries that are vulnerable to cutoffs of Russian natural gas .
The protest organisers relied heavily on the internet The Moldovan capital , Chisinau , was rocked by protests earlier this month amid claims that an election which returned the Communist Party to power was rigged .
The BBC's Oana Lungescu spoke to Natalia Morar , the journalist accused of masterminding Moldova 's " Twitter revolution " - so dubbed because many demonstrators were alerted to the protests by text and social networking tools .
Natalia Morar , 25 , smiled broadly when I met her on Friday night in a park in central Chisinau .
" I never felt that just a walk in the park could be such a big happiness , " she told me .
" It feels great ! "
Just hours before , she had been under house arrest .
For the previous 10 days she had had no access to internet and was not allowed to talk on the phone .
" It was really terrible because I was absolutely cut off from all sources to find out what happened to my friends , who were with me in the street . "
Officially charged with helping organise mass disturbances , she faces 15 years in prison , but strongly denies any involvement in the violence .
Spontaneous protest
None of us could imagine that such a thing could happen , but it shows there exists a very big protest inside society
Natalia Morar
The authorities , she says , have shown her no photos , videos or any other evidence to substantiate the charges against her .
It all started in a Chisinau cafe , when Ms Morar and a handful of friends decided to hold a peaceful protest against the Communist victory in what they thought was a rigged election .
" It just happened through Twitter , the blogosphere , the internet , SMS , websites and all this stuff .
We just met , we brainstormed for 15 minutes , and decided to make a flash mob [ internet - organised spontaneous public gathering ] ...
" In several hours , 15,000 people came out into the street . "
Youth ' unhappy '
Although she was amazed by the size of the protests which started peacefully on 6 April , she thinks the reason was sheer frustration pent up in Europe 's poorest country .
" None of us could imagine that such a thing could happen , " Ms Morar told me , " but it shows there exists a very big protest inside society and within young people .
" Moldovan youth are not pleased with what is happening in Moldova .
Liberty is a great thing for us and we do n't want to live in a Soviet kind of society , " she says vehemently .
The protests , which turned violent on 7 April , were dominated by young people who grew up after Moldova declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 .
Thousands have studied in neighbouring Romania , an EU member , and hundreds of thousands have had to seek work abroad .
Ms Morar dismisses allegations that either Romanian or Russian secret services were behind the protests .
Parliament was badly damaged in the protests
Two years ago , she was expelled from Russia for writing about a money - laundering scandal allegedly involving the Kremlin and Russia 's security service .
Now , she tells me , she plans to quit journalism and work full - time with a youth foundation called ThinkMoldova she helped set up last year to bring democratic change to her native country .
But does she consider herself a dangerous woman ?
The question makes her laugh .
" I 'm just a young woman with an active [ interest in my country ] , nothing else .
I 'm just a free person and I want to be free . "
Breakthrough Most of the 200 people arrested during the protests have now been freed .
Three died during the protests in suspicious circumstances .
In an apparent breakthrough , after two high - level EU visits to Chisinau this week , the EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana announced that the authorities had agreed to start a political dialogue with the opposition parties and include them , together with international experts , in a commission due to investigate the unrest .
After talks with Mr Solana , the veteran communist President Vladimir Voronin said Moldova had emerged from the political crisis .
But a senior EU diplomat described it more cautiously as " a good start . "
The EU envoy for Moldova , Kalman Mizsei , will work out the details in the next few days , together with officials from the Council of Europe .
EU foreign ministers will also discuss the situation in Moldova on Monday , in a flurry of diplomatic activity that shows Europe 's troubled eastern border remains under close watch .

On Friday , I had the opportunity to hear Glenn Greenwald speak at the Cato Institute regarding his Cato - sponsored report , Drug Decriminalization in Portugal : Lessons for Creating Fair and Successful Drug Policies .
You can read the report here and Cato also has a downloadable MP3 of the event .
The back - story here is that Portugal implemented an across - the - board drug decriminalization policy back in 2001 .
There 's been very little discussion and research regarding its impact , hence Cato recruited Greenwald ( a genius and extremely popular political blogger ) to study Portuguese drug policy .
His findings thoroughly illustrate the efficiency of decriminalization towards addressing key drug policy goals , while refuting the myth that removing harsh penalties will lead to increased consumption .
The whole thing utterly shatters most , if not all , arguments that continue to be advanced in support of tough drug laws here in the U.S. and around the world .
I found a couple points particularly interesting :
1 . When Portugal began looking at alternative policies to address a growing drug problem , they did not consider legalization because it was determined that such a policy would violate international treaties .
It 's a small country that can't afford to be belligerant .
This just goes to show , once again , the extent to which prohibition is not a consensus policy at the international level , but rather an idealogical approach that less powerful nations have been forced to accept .
2 . The decision to implement a decriminalization policy emerged through discussion of empirical data , rather than emotional arguments about morals , civil liberties and so forth .
I do n't know how representative this is of what approach would be most effective in establishing more reasonable policies here in the U.S. , but it 's certainly worth taking a look at the context in which decriminalization triumphed over other policy options .

Utah s Orrin Hatch and Wisconsin's Herb Kohl announced Wednesday that the Senate Judiciary 's antitrust subcommittee will hold hearings on the college football 's postseason format .
Yes , that means you , Bowl Championship Series .
" The BCS system leaves nearly half of all the teams in college football at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to qualifying for the millions of dollars paid out every year , " a joint statement read .
No date was given for the hearings , but the statement also said : " Sen . Hatch will introduce legislation to rectify this situation . "
Hatch , the ranking Republican on the subcommittee , called the BCS " un- American " in January .
He repeated that claim on Wednesday .

LOS ANGELES  John McTiernan , facing an expected new indictment for his role in the Anthony Pellicano Hollywood wiretapping case , is striking back  with a movie .
In an extraordinary and somewhat startling challenge to officials who have threatened him with jail time for lying to an F.B.I. agent , Mr. McTiernan , perhaps best known as the director of “ Die Hard ” and “ The Hunt for Red October , ” has completed a documentary that accuses the Bush administration of having pursued the Pellicano case as part of a far - ranging conspiracy under the direction of Karl Rove to prosecute Democrats .
Mr. Pellicano , a former private investigator who served the rich and famous in Hollywood , was sentenced to 15 years in prison in December .
Mr. McTiernan , who employed Mr. Pellicano in connection with a divorce , was earlier sentenced to four months in prison after pleading guilty to lying to a federal agent .
But he withdrew his plea with a judge ’s permission in February and is awaiting what federal prosecutors at the time said would be a new indictment .
Meanwhile , Mr. McTiernan finished work last month on “ The Political Prosecutions of Karl Rove , ” a documentary that describes what it argues is a relentless legal pursuit of Democratic political operatives under the Bush administration , with the Pellicano case in a central role .
A reader writes , " You could n't make this up : Cameras are being turned on the people paid to watch CCTV streams , to note which bits of surveillance footage they did n't see .
The system developed in Turkey uses webcams to track a person 's eye movements and can then produce an edited reel of footage that they did n't see at the end of their shift . "
Privacy campaigners may enjoy the irony if the gaze - tracking system comes to be regarded as intrusive by CCTV operators – who could fear that employers will use it to dispense with their services if they consistently miss too much on - screen skulduggery .

Rainbow Jello
I was one of the last parents to arrive at school the day the sign - up sheet went up for the Easter Party .
Never be the last mom to sign up .. the only thing left … jello .
I brought jello last time and really wanted to do cupcakes or cookies or something fun .
Reluctantly I signed up for jello , again .
But I did n’t make just jello .
Oh no , not me .
I made JELLO !
I picked up a 6 oz box of blue , yellow and red jello plus a box of knox gelatin .
To get these fabulous layers , mix the blue jello with an envelope of the knox gelatin .
Pour in two cups of boiling water .
Dissolve the gelatin .
Add 1/2 cup of ice .
Stir until thick .
Remove any remaining ice cubes and any bubbles that may have formed .
Pour into a 9×13 inch pan .
Let set in the refrigerator .
Repeat with the yellow jello and pour it over the set blue .
Repeat with the red jello and pour it over the yellow .
And there you have it , Rainbow Jello .
I wo n’t go into the whole primary and secondary color thing , but these colors , when stacked upon each other , create other colors .
There is not an orange or green layer .
It just looks like it when the red and yellow layers touch and then yellow and blue layers touch .
Pretty cool .
Oh , and these can be made and cut a day ahead .
This was a surprise !
Thanks for the tip Gretchen !

More of the same from the people who brought you the crisis in the first place
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Wednesday , Feb 11th , 2009
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s so called economic rescue plan , announced yesterday , has a three pronged approach to the financial crisis – more debt , more devaluation of the dollar and more government .
In addition to making several blatantly contradictory statements , Geithner revealed that the Treasury intends to stay routed to the same course of action that caused the crisis in the first instance and has since perpetuated and worsened it .
“ I want to make clear that I am not here today to ask for more money , ” Geithner told Senators during congressional testimony .
But , later added , “ this is going to be an expensive problem . ”
The first prong of the “ plan ” , if it can be called that , will see the financial system flooded with $ 1.5 trillion , a vast portion of which will come from the Federal Reserve printing more money out of thin air .
The inevitable devaluation of the Dollar that will follow this may be enough to force a complete collapse and spell the end of its reserve currency status .
Second , Geithner intends to spend between $ 250 and $ 500 billion of taxpayer money to buy up so called “ bad assets ” and putting them into a “ bad bank ” .
Essentially this constitutes transferring vast amounts of spiraling debt from the books of the negligent and criminal bankers to those of the taxpayer .
Does that sound like a good idea or a “ bad ” idea ?
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The third part of the “ solution ” involves a huge expansion of financing for consumer loans and bank lending programs through the Federal Reserve and the Treasury .
Essentially offering more debt to the consumer in the shape of student loans , cars and credit cards to the tune of up to $ 1 trillion .
All of this , of course , facilitates a massive expansion of the role of the federal government in the financial system .
Geithner left consumers , investors and traders alike asking ‘ what part of that plan constitutes a rescue ? ’
( Article continues below )
The stock market , propped up for weeks on the expectation that Washington would finally deliver a comprehensive rescue plan , dipped almost as soon as Mr. Geithner began speaking in the morning .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 382 points , or 4.6 percent , by the time the market closed , the New York Times reported .
Geithner chastised the Bush administration and his predecessor , Henry M. Paulson Jr. stating “ Policy was always behind the curve , always chasing the escalating crisis …
The emergency actions meant to provide confidence and reassurance too often added to public anxiety and to investor uncertainty . ”
However , Geithner has critics struggling to find any significant difference between his “ sweeping overhaul ” rescue plan and the previous Treasury Secretary ’s now much maligned TARP program , as he gave no specific details as to how the plan would work , offering only the same muddy generalizations that Paulson did three months ago .
“ Many of us were looking forward to a plan that could be presented in a straightforward , clear and detailed way .
Unfortunately , that is not what we received yesterday . ”
Republican Jeff Sessions of Alabama commented .
Geithner is very good at critiquing what went wrong in the last year , but just seems to be perpetuating it . ” said Desmond Lachman , a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute .
“ If the problem America found itself in was too much debt , then how can adding more debt be helpful ? ” asked political analyst James Pinkerton from the New America Foundation in a Russia Today report .
“ The idea of solving it by taking the same pirates who stole the first trillion dollars and saying here ’s more money .
You look up the word ‘ corrupt ’ in the dictionary and that ’s what you see , ” Pinkerton added .
Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich commented that “ the government has become an engine for taking money from the people , from their pocketbooks and purses and accelerating it to the top . ”

Comment on this article
SALEM , OR -- Oregon War Veterans Association ( OWVA ) just learned that Jeff Maxwell , the Western Oregon University ( WOU ) Student who was illegally arrested and subsequently suspended from school for carrying a concealed weapon was just told that he cannot attend ANY Oregon University .
Michelle Sandlin , admissions director of Oregon State University , told Maxwell today that he would not be allowed to attend OSU , even though they admitted him recently - after he was suspended by WOU .
Maxwell has a concealed handgun permit , and is permitted to carry a handgun according to Oregon Law , and the 2nd Amendment of the US Constitution .
Western Oregon University has since withdrawn their charge against Maxwell for carrying a handgun , but came up with a trumped charge about his carrying a knife and having an unloaded hunting rifle in his locked vehicle .
All charges were dropped by the Sheriff ’s office as inappropriate , but WOU officials stand by their ruling and punishment of Maxwell .
Jess Barton , the Salem attorney retained by OWVA to represent Maxwell , who is a veteran Marine and member of the association , told OWVA ’s executive director , Greg Warnock , that , “ Oregon law affords Jeff Maxwell a full and fair opportunity to establish that WOU wrongfully suspended him based on his mere possession of items that ordinary and constitutional law deem lawful .... ”
Barton , a seasoned appellate attorney is confident in winning the case for Maxwell .
Barton will file a petition for judicial review at the Oregon Court of Appeals this month , to force the university to redress their wrong official action taken , as well as ask for penalties and attorney fees .
Restitution will also be sought now , since Maxwell has lost his GI Educational Benefits , including housing and other expenses when he was suspended .
He also lost the tuition and fees and book charges for last semester , which he prepaid .
OWVA and their legal counsel is representing Maxwell in this case because “ we believe that the U.S. Constitution , and Oregon Statues trump the policies of the university system , and we are shocked at the humiliating treatment WOU has dished out to a responsible , veteran Marine , who broke no laws what - so - ever , ” reported Warnock to Melica Johnson , from KATU News recently .
“ WOU ’s immature , irresponsible and illegal actions will unfortunately cost the State of Oregon an enormous amount of money in damages - when they have no money to spare .
It is shameful . ”
In addition to filing a petition for a State judicial review in the Oregon Courts , OWVA and the Oregon Firearms Federation are supporting federal charges against WOU and the Oregon University System ( OUS ) , for violations against Maxwell ’s civil rights .
The Law firm of BOPP , COLESON & BOSTROM , a very successful firm out of Indiana , have been retained by OWVA and will provide counsel in this case as needed .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Americans ' first reactions to the news of President Obama 's nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court are decidedly more positive than negative , with 47 % rating the nomination as " excellent " or " good , " 20 % rating it " only fair , " and 13 % rating it " poor . "
These results are based on a one - night poll conducted Tuesday , the same day Obama officially announced Sotomayor as his choice to replace the retiring Justice David Souter on the Supreme Court .
Gallup conducted similar reaction polls immediately after former President George W. Bush 's nominations of John Roberts , Samuel Alito , and Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court in 2005 .
Although in all instances , the reactions were more positive than negative , the net positive rating ( the percentage excellent or good minus the percentage only fair or poor ) was highest for Roberts and Sotomayor , and lowest for Alito and Miers .
Given that Sotomayor 's nomination was made by a Democratic president , it is not surprising to find reactions to her selection that are much more positive among Democrats than among Republicans .
Comparing ratings of Sotomayor to those of the three previous nominees ( all chosen by the Republican President Bush ) suggests that the current partisan reaction to Sotomayor follows a fairly standard pattern .
Between 72 % and 79 % of those identifying with the party of the president making the nomination react positively to the candidates .
There is a slightly larger range in positive ratings among those identifying with the party not controlling the White House at the time of the nomination : from a high of 31 % of Democrats who supported Roberts and 29 % of Republicans who support Sotomayor , to a low of 18 % of Democrats who supported Alito .
There are two primary reasons why Sotomayor 's nomination could in theory appeal to women :
She would become the second female justice on the Court .
She has been nominated by a Democratic president at a time when women are significantly more likely to identify with his party than with the Republican Party .
Indeed , the data show a significant gender skew in reaction to Sotomayor 's appointment .
Interestingly , the gender gap in positive reactions to Sotomayor is the largest such gap for the four most recent Supreme Court nominations -- in either direction .
Alito had higher approval among men than among women ( by eight points ) , but both Miers and Roberts had essentially the same level of positive reactions across genders .
Much of the discussion about Obama 's nomination decision has focused on his clear intent to appoint a woman , given the fact that there is currently only one female justice on the Court .
Additionally , it has been widely noted that Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic on the Court if she is confirmed by the Senate .
Still , it appears Americans believe that Sotomayor 's intellectual credentials and experience were more important to Obama in his decision to nominate her than were her demographic characteristics .
The May 26 Gallup Poll asked Americans for their perceptions of the importance of five of Sotomayor 's characteristics in Obama 's thinking when he decided to nominate her .
The public downgrades the perceived importance to Obama of Sotomayor 's gender and ethnicity ; only 39 % and 34 % , respectively , call these very important to him .
Instead , majorities believe that he heavily valued her experience as a federal judge ( 61 % ) , her intellect ( 59 % ) , and her views and judicial record ( 52 % ) .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,015 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted May 26 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Polls conducted entirely in one day , such as this one , are subject to additional error or bias not found in polls conducted over several days .
The Federation for American Immigration Reform ( " FAIR " ) received a good deal of negative publicity after it was disclosed that it had received most of its start - up money from nonprofit Pioneer Fund foundation .
The Pioneer Fund has a long history of promoting eugenics and giving funding to researchers who champion white supremacist causes .
As well , the Pioneer Fund has provided money to a variety of anti-immigrant causes .
The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League have both condemned FAIR and the Pioneer Fund as promoting racist hate views .
Most critically for the present discussion is the role of eugenics and immigration .
Eugenics , notorious for its association with the enactment of the Nazi Nuremberg laws , which led inevitably to the holocaust , was largely born in the United States .
The Pioneer Fund played a large role in the promulgation of eugenics based laws in the United States .
These laws forced the sterilization of thousands and banned interracial marriage .
States ( 27 ) that had sterilization laws still on the books ( though not all were still in use ) in 1956 were : Arizona , California , Connecticut , Delaware , Georgia , Idaho , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Maine , Michigan , Minnesota , Mississippi , Montana , Nebraska , New Hampshire , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Oregon , South Carolina , South Dakota , Utah , Vermont , Virginia , West Virginia , Wisconsin .
In fact , the Nuremberg laws were largely shaped by eugenics laws and anti-miscegenation laws from the United States .
During the first decades of the century ... major political figures such as Henry Cabot Lodge had unblushingly defended Anglo - Saxonism , the superiority of the " original " American stock .
The eugenics movement flourished in these years .
Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson embraced racist theories ; Henry Adams , Henry James , the president of Harvard , and other cultural heavyweights did the same .
Many key members of the new generation of social scientists , including E.A. Ross and John R. Commons , doubted the intellectual capacity of racial and ethnic minorities .
These pioneers in sociology and economics provided additional authority to nativists ’ arguments .
As late as the early 1920s , when the prominent social psychologist William McDougall proposed a racist interpretation of history based on the results of intelligence tests , when Madison Grant ’s The Passing of the Great Race and Lothrop Stoddard ’s The Rising Tide of Color found a wide audience of college - trained readers for their racist theories , the " genetic case " for nativism remained a position that could be defended in rational discourse .
( " The Party of Fear : The American Far Right from Nativism to the Militia Bovement , " David H. Bennett ( Vintage Books 1988 ) p. 283 )
Eugenicists generally hold that certain people ( mostly northern - hemisphere Caucasians ) are superior in a variety of qualities to other people ( mostly non-Caucasians and non-Anglos such as Jews ) .
The latter are said , by eugenicists , to be innately inferior .
Eugenicists , therefore believe that the inferior members of the human species must be controlled by a variety of methods ranging from birth control to sterilization and , in extreme cases , extermination .
The superior members of the species must , in turn , be encouraged to breed and must not sully their superior genes by association with inferior members ( miscegenation or race - mixing ) .
Given that the Nazis carried these programs to their logical conclusion , the mass extermination of inferior human beings , eugenics has come to be viewed as scientifically indefensible and morally repugnant .
A natural extension of the eugenicist view is that the superior members of the species should not be outnumbered by the inferior members .
In order to prevent an influx of inferior members , eugenicists promote measures to prohibit or sharply curtail immigration .
Such measures found voice in the restrictive and racist Immigration and Restriction Act of 1924 .
The Act sharply curtailed immigration by countries with undesirable members like immigrants from Latin Countries , Eastern Europe , Russia and Jews .
" The [ Immigration and Restriction Act of ] 1924 act , following a barrage of eugenicist propaganda , reset the quotas at 2 percent of people from each nation recorded in the 1890 census ( Southern and eastern Europeans arrived in relatively small numbers before then ) ...
Cynical , but effective .
" America must be kept American , " proclaimed Calvin Coolidge as he signed the bill . "
( ( " The Mismeasure of Man , " Stephen Jay Gould , p. 262 ) As stated by one of the eugenicist social scientists who backed race and national origin restrictions on immigration :
The decline of American intelligence will be more rapid than the decline of the intelligence of European national groups , owing to the presence of the negro .
These are the plain , if somewhat ugly , facts that our study shows .
The deterioration of American intelligence is not inevitable , however , if public action can be aroused to prevent it .
There is no reason why legal steps should not be taken which would insure a continuously upward evolution .
The steps that should be taken to preserve or increase our present intellectual capacity must of course be dictated by science and not by political expediency .
Immigration should not only be restrictive but highly selective .
And the revision of the immigration and naturalization laws will only afford a slight relief from our present difficulty .
The really important steps are those looking toward the prevention of the continued propagation of defective strains in the present population .
( Brigham 1923 ) ( " The Mismeasure of Man , " Stephen Jay Gould , p. 260 )
The Pioneer Fund , which almost exclusively funded FAIR in its early years , was instrumental in promoting eugenicist views and the enactment of eugenicist laws .
Harry Hamilton Laughlin , a Pioneer Fund president , was a life - long eugenicist , who was part of the Eugenic Research Association ( " ERO " ) , a government project that promoted eugenics laws among the states .
A preoccupation with controlling migration was just one of the habits that FAIR founder , Laughlin and his fellow immigration restrictionists shared with Adolf Hitler
From the time he moved to New York in 1910 until his death in 1943 , Laughlin committed himself to a search for patterns of bad heredity or " dysgenesis . "
Even more impressive than the abundance of statistical material collected during Laughlin ’s research was his success in translating the implications of eugenical theory into law .
The ruling passions of his career as a eugenicist were immigration restriction , eugenic sterilization , and prohibition of interracial marriage .
Laughlin ’s efforts at immigration restriction included an attempt to survey every public charitable institution or mental hospital in American .
He combined those data with material on the number of foreign - born persons in jails , prisons , and reformatories to provide a basis for testimony to Congress as its appointed " Expert Eugenics Agent . "
Reflecting in large part Laughlin ’s testimony , Congress passed the Immigration Restriction Act of 1924 , which was consciously drawn to block the flow of Jews and Italians from 1900 to 1920 .
Hitler praised the racist features of American immigration legislation in Mein Kampf even before he came to power .
He condemned the automatic grant of citizenship , extended indiscriminately to " every Jewish or Polish , African or Asiatic child " born in Germany as " thoughtless " and " hare - brained . "
America , " by simply excluding certain races from naturalization , " was making " slow beginnings " toward a vision Hitler could support .
A preoccupation with controlling migration was just one of the habits that Laughlin and his fellow immigration restrictionists shared with Adolf Hitler .
" The American Breed " ( " The American Breed " : Nazi Eugenics and the Origins of the Pioneer Fund , by Paul A. Lombardo , J.D. , Ph.D. , Albany Law Review ( 2002 ) ( emphasis added ) ) .
Today ’s nativist agenda is no different than the one that animated the nativists who helped enact the restrictive 1924 immigration act .
Nor is there a difference in the latent racism inherent in such views .
" Earlier generations of Americans knew that in most cases , what are now called Third World populations , by their very nature , are temperamentally different from the European Christians who settled North America , fashioned the United States , devised its system of laws , and fathered its free institutions .
..
We must never , never , never shrink back in craven fear of the imbecilic words that our adversaries hurl at us -- " racist , " " bigot , " " fascist , " and such rubbish " Father James Thornton
Tanton had the Social Contract Press translate , publish and promote The Camp of the Saints , a starkly racist apocalyptic novel
John Tanton , perhaps more than any other person , is the architect of the modern nativist movement .
In a recent article , Tanton , who rarely grants interviews , forthrightly admitted as such :
The success of U.S. English taught Tanton a crucial lesson .
If the immigration restriction movement was to succeed , it would have to be rooted in an emotional appeal to those who felt that their country , their language , their very identity was under assault .
" Feelings , " Tanton says in a tone reminiscent of Spock sharing some hard - won insight on human behavior , " trump facts .
More than anyone , Tanton served as the liaison between the " mainstream " anti-immigration movement , whose arguments were still rooted in population and job concerns , and its natural allies on the far right , who saw an epic struggle to maintain America ’s national and racial character .
He courted mainstream conservative donors , like the Scaife family , as well as the fringe Pioneer Fund , whose current president argues that blacks are genetically less intelligent than whites .
He had the Social Contract Press translate , publish and promote The Camp of the Saints , a starkly racist apocalyptic novel about a wave of Indian immigrants overrunning France .
In 1996 , Tanton coauthored The Immigration Invasion with Wayne Lutton , who sits on the advisory board of a publication put out by the white nationalist Council of Conservative Citizens .
Editor of the Social Contract Press since 1998 , Lutton now occupies an office just a few feet from Tanton’s .
Though he plays the victim , Tanton wants it both ways : harnessing the political power that comes from tapping into nativist grievances and building bridges with outright racists , while at the same time dismissing any of the negative consequences that might come from such partnerships .
Perhaps Tanton shares the views of his allies , or perhaps he simply understands that if what people like Taylor euphemistically call " cultural " issues were taken out of the equation , there would n’t be the same flood of phone calls to senators .
" If the 12 million illegal immigrants in this country were all good - looking , English - speaking , white people , " Taylor told me , " the opposition to illegal immigration would be considerably less . "
Aside from Tanton , the other person most identified with what is euphemistically called " white nationalism " but is in reality " white supremacy " is the British expatriate , Peter Brimelow .
Brimelow penned the anti-immigrant book , Alien Nation and founded the forthrightly racist website VDare.com .
Brimelow has stated that the United States is a white Protestant country and that it must keep its whie character by sharply limiting immigration of non-whites .
Among the racists that Brimelow regularly features on his VDare and who also contribute to John Tanton , periodical , The Social Contract , are the following :

Geoffrey Sampson " There 's Nothing Wrong with Racism "
John Tanton and Peter Brimelow , despite being racist extremists , are not marginal figures in American politics .
Tanton ’s organization , FAIR , testifies often before Congress and it is regularly quoted in the mainstream press .
Brimelow has been affiliated with The National Review and was a journalist for Forbes magazine .
Both Tanton and Brimelow are regulars on the talk show circuit and their cronies are regularly featured on the right - wing cable " news " shows .
Each has made racist statements but it is Brimelow who pushes a far right agenda that explicitly embraces racism and anti-Semitism .
These extreme views have constantly challenged organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center ’s Hatewatch and the Anti-Defamation League .
SPLC ’s website , articulated their reasoning behind listing FAIR as a hate group .
The Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) is almost certainly the most - quoted immigration restriction organization in America .
...
In the past six years , FAIR officials have testified at least 30 times to Congress .
Day in and day out , FAIR is taken seriously as a mainstream commentator on the immigration debate ...
The founder , chief ideologue and long - time funder of FAIR is a racist .
Key staff members have ties to white supremacist groups , some are members , and some have spoken at hate group functions .
FAIR has accepted more than $ 1 million from a racist foundation devoted to studies of race and IQ , and to eugenics — the pseudo - science of breeding a better human race that was utterly discredited by the Nazi euthanasia program .
It spreads racist conspiracy theories .
Its political ads have caused numerous politicians , Democratic and Republican , to denounce it .
Much of this has been known for years .
But last February [ 2007 ] , underlining the way that FAIR does business , its leaders met with the leaders of Vlaams Belang — a hastily renamed Belgian party that under a prior appellation , Vlaams Blok , was officially banned by the Belgian Supreme Court as a racist and xenophobic group .
It was , for some , a final straw — the Rubicon of hate , as it were .
When FAIR officials met with Vlaams Belang leaders to seek their " advice " on immigration , we decided to take another look at FAIR .
When our work was done , it was obvious that FAIR qualified as a hate group .
The identification of FAIR as a bona fide hate group is important .
FAIR is the hub of the American nativist movement , the group that more than any other has contributed to the rancid turn the national immigration discussion has taken .
With FAIR fanning the flames of xenophobic intolerance , hate groups , hate crimes and hate speech directed at foreigners and Latinos continue to rise in America .
It cannot be gainsaid that FAIR , NumbersUSA , VDare and the coterie of anti-immigrant organizations have an agenda which is larger than merely restricting immigration .
Nativist writers such as Steve Sailer , Jared Taylor and Kevin MacDonald fervently believe that blacks are of inferior intellect , that Jews are controlling the media and that the white race should be protected from nonwhites .
Their ideology is exactly the same ideology that led to the Nazi Nuremberg laws .
They have used immigration as a gateway to the mainstream , witness Lou Dobbs , Bill O’Reilly , Glen Beck and Sean Hannity preaching their gospel of hate to millions every single night .
Unless and until these modern day eugenicists are marginalized , the way David Duke and the Aryan Nation have been marginalized , these extremists will continue to influence public policy to the peril of a great many Americans .

Rise Underground : The Rise To The Top Entrepreneur Blog
The Rise To The Top : Entertaining , Energizing and Empowering Entrepreneurs
When you say the word hustle out loud , what comes to mind ?
Go ahead , try it …
Do you have a NEGATIVE viewpoint on hustle ?
A rigged carnival game , illegal copies of DVD ’s being sold on the street , drug dealers , or a pimp in a big purple hat .
Or do you have a POSITIVE viewpoint on hustle ?
A favorite baseball player who was undersized but always hustled , giving it your all , getting out there selling , promoting , and working your head off .
The underdog , the over - achiever , the one who outworks the rest .
This past weekend I competed in my own version of “ The Amazing Race ” in New York City … .
that combined actual hustle ( running down the street ) , figurative hustle ( landing the interviews ) and lessons in hustle ( how these entrepreneurs have the hustle down to a science ) .
I had less than 48 hours to conduct a massive amount of interviews including Scott Mednick ( serial entrepreneur , founder of Legendary Pictures , executive producer on films such as 300 , Superman Returns , We Are Marshall ) , Gary Vaynerchuk ( Brand building rock star and celebrity … and personal hero of mine ) , Ankur Jain ( Student - preneur and founder of The Kairos Society ) and Ashley Cook and Danielle Dankner ( Ash & Dans Clothing Line ) .
From NYC to the dirty jersey , we have captured some incredible interviews that will be aired on The Rise To The Top and The Rise at Nite both this season and into next season .
Here are a few hustles that I ’ve encountered and have been repeatedly brought up in conversations with top entrepreneurs , rising entrepreneurs , and budding entrepreneurs .
Whether you are extroverted , introverted or mute you can master the art of the hustle and your business will grow .
Some are born hustlers and for others it is a learned technique similar to some people are born with a natural ability to do math ( not me ) while others study hard to become math whizzes .
1 . Your horn was built for tooting .
It is one thing to be humble and another thing to be a jerk , but if you are afraid to promote you and your business , you are not hustling .
This does not mean turning your Twitter into an RSS feed for your blog or telling everyone how awesome you are , but it does mean making a conscious effort to promote , tell people what you are up to , and also have confidence in your accomplishments .
Successful entrepreneurs are great self - promoters and believe in both their business and themselves .
Just do n’t blow out the horn .
2. Screw Rejection .
I remember trying to ask out a girl in 6th grade .
I had no idea what I was doing and asked her out in the middle of a class …DURING the class with lots of people watching .
Horrible idea .
It did n’t work and I was super embarrassed .
It is not that dissimilar from starting a business .
You are taking a risk and putting yourself out there .
Negabots will attack with their haterade .
Hustlers do n’t get embarrassed or upset , they answer all emails ( even the negative ones ) , respond to critics , make sales pitches , and make it happen no matter what .
If someone told me I should n’t start a TV show without going to broadcasting school and having twenty years experience , I just look them in the face and say , “ Thank you for your opinion .
I respect that and I ’m doing things a bit differently . ”
3 . Do n’t be afraid of saying “ No ” .
If you are hustling , opportunities will come your way .
In Gary Vaynerchuk ’s case , he gets hundreds of opportunities a week : Business deals , book deals , TV deals , interview requests ( Plug : Gary is the MAN for accepting mine because he went with a his gut feeling … thanks Gary ) .
If the opportunity is n’t right for you , say no .
Do n’t chase all the shiny red balls , just find the ones that work for you and your brand .
4. Knocking Down Doors .
Often times the only way to knock down the door in the entrepreneurial hustling world is to blast it down .
Cold - calling , asking friends for help , going to your family .
Yes , it takes time but building a business takes hard , sweaty time .
Ashley Cook and Danielle Dankner have an incredible story about their clothing line Ash &Dans where they went on a spree of cold calls and even showed up at shops with scarves in hand .
And guess what ?
It worked .
Now they are in four plus stores … and I ’ll cut the story right there as to not spoil all the great stuff from these ladies coming on a future episode of The Rise To The Top .
5. Fuel With Small Victories .
Building businesses takes patience and hustle .
But , I know I have patience problems ( Do you ? ) .
We all want results NOW which is the selling points of get - rich schemes , MLM’s , and other sketchy stuff .
Fuel yourself with small victories :
You were complimented on your business , a happy customer sends an email , you made one website sale .
It is easy to bask in the light of BIG victories ( million dollar deals , new clients , a gazzilion web hits , whatever ) , but a series of small victories will give you the attitude burst to keep rolling .
In a nutshell , get out there , ignore the haters , build your business , and adjust your hustling thinking and your success will be limitless ( aww warm fuzzy moment right there ) .
Upgrades are on the way !
Keep an eye out on therisetothetop.com for upcoming special features , announcement of the releases of the big interviews including Gary Vaynerchuk , some new designs to increase usability , and more about our experts .
More entrepreneurship , more tips and more fun .
There will also be some exciting announcements soon about the final “ Dinner and Discussions ” speed networking event for Season # 1 , our “ Summer Business Break ” Series and our new online programming ( good news online fans : shows will be released on ABC and online at the same time ) .
Live Passionately !

David Hume is the greatest philosopher Britain has produced and an intellectual hero to many atheists .
His arguments against religion are clear , incisive and devastating .
The only fly in the ointment is the very strong evidence that he was n't an atheist at all , but an agnostic .
There is a thread of uncertainty than runs through all Hume 's works on religion , yet this shadow of doubt does not lead Hume to pull his punches .
The Hume who I hope emerges over the next eight weeks is an exemplary model of how the most pressing and telling critiques of religion not only cannot , but should not , attempt to deliver any fatal blows .
A second recurrent theme of this series will be how Hume had a knack of getting to the heart of issues , even when he lacked a great deal of information that we have now .
For example , his arguments about the origins of the universe , which we 'll come to in week three , are just as telling post - Darwin as they were in the 18th century .
Hume 's writings on religion are scattered across several works .
Apart from his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and Natural History of Religion , we 'll also be looking at his essay
On the Immortality of the Soul and two chapters from An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding , section XI and , first , perhaps the best - known , his essay Of Miracles , which comprises section X .
" It is strange that such prodigious events never happen in our day , " Hume imagines a " judicious reader " saying of miracles .
We might think the same today , but many would evidently disagree .
From Hindus flocking to see statues of Ganesha drink milk in temples all over the world in 1995 , to the miracle of the plane crash in the Hudson river , belief in the miraculous is not confined to the " ignorant and barbarous nations " , as Hume put it .
But what makes an event a miracle ?
Hume was very precise about this .
It is " a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the deity , or the interposition of some invisible agent . "
Hume did n't seem to think this was very controversial , since he originally relegated his definition to a mere footnote .
Two hundred and fifty years later , however , this gloss is more contentious .
It should not be .
Hume was right , and any attempt to make a miracle anything less destroys the phenomenon it strives to name .
Many resist the definition because they do not see why a miracle should not operate within the constraints of physical laws .
Take the plane crash in the Hudson , for example .
For it to be miraculous , there is no need for the plane to have defied gravity , or Newton 's three laws of motion .
What made it a miracle was that , for everyone to have survived , an unfeasibly unlikely series of events had to have occurred , but all individually within the bounds of physical possibility .
This explanation will not do .
If the series of causes and effects which comprised the crash proceeded without any interference from a divine agency , then there was only a miracle in the figurative sense of an extremely unlikely and fortuitous sequence of events .
But if God did so much as even hold up a sub-atomic collision here or delay a transfer of energy there , then the laws of nature have indeed been violated , for physical events would have been prevented from having their usual causes , as physical laws say they must .
" Laws of nature " are not simply limits on how bodies can behave which leave room for them to do any number of specific things , like cosmic speed restrictors on lorries , or thermostatic switches .
They go deeper than this .
Every single physical event in the universe obeys them .
God need n't make something travel faster than the speed of light to break them ; all he need do is make it travel faster than its mass and acceleration determine it should do .
Because someone is sure to mention it , let me briefly dismiss the last refuge of the pseudo - rational mystery - monger : quantum physics .
Not all causes have determinate effects , you might think .
Some physical reactions are merely probabilistic .
Given that this is the case , could God not create miracles by exploiting this uncertainty ?
A cause could have one of two effects , and by making sure it has one rather than the other , God steers nature without changing its laws .
This answer is just as hopeless as the standard one .
If quantum effects are indeterminate , then the only way for them to occur within the laws of nature is indeterminately .
The moment God steps in , he changes the effect from indeterminate to determinate – he tears up nature 's rule book .
Hume is therefore right .
Miracles are violations of the laws of nature .
The merely extraordinary is not miraculous .
That so many find this so hard to accept reflects the fact that humans have problems with conceiving the unlikely .
That very improbable things will often happen is entirely predictable from the sheer number of opportunities each day provides for exceptions to the norm to occur .
We also tend to overestimate how improbable things are .
The miracle of the Hudson , for instance , is far less of a miracle when you think about the time , expense and expertise put into pilot and cabin crew safety training , and aircraft design .
So now we 've defined what a miracle truly is , can we say any have ever occurred , or even could occur ?
I 'll discuss Hume 's answer next week .

All Religions Lead to God? Can One Discern the True Religion ?
by Rich Deem
Introduction
Agnostics often fall into two camps - those who believe that all religions can lead to God or those who believe that true religion cannot be discerned .
This page examines both positions in an attempt to determine where the truth may lie .
Logically , there are several possibilities .
Atheists would say that no religion leads to God , since
He does n't exist .
It is possible that one , several or all religions lead to God .
This page will assume that God exists , so we will examine which , if any religions , might lead to God .
Other pages on the site examine the issue of God 's existence .
All ways lead to God
There are hundreds of religions in the world today , and many ancient religions that are no longer practiced .
It is possible , and perhaps likely , that all religions contain some truth and / or good moral advice .
However , in examining religious teaching , it is important to examine the fundamental beliefs of each religion and compare those to each other .
When this is done , it is apparent that primary religious teachings contradict each other .
Judaism says that the Messiah is coming , Christianity says that He has come , and Islam says that Mohammad provided all the information necessary for religious life .
Obviously , these truth claims cannot be simultaneously true , since they contradict each other .
Logically , we must reject the idea that all religions lead to God .
True religion - is it possible to discern ?
I believe that there are some things that we can discern about God from the nature of the universe .
The universe demonstrates some remarkable evidence of design .
What kind of God designed all this , and how can we know His true identity ?
Most people who believe God exists would agree with the argument that the God who designed the universe must be a personal God .
For God to put so much time and care into the design of the universe and life , it would seem logical to conclude that God really cared about His creation , and was personally involved in it 's creation .
A God who did not care about his creation would never be expected to spend 14 billion years of development just so that humans would have a nice place to live for a few thousand years .
Therefore , it would seem likely that the true God must be a personal God , and not the God of deism , pantheism , Buddhism , etc .
So , it would seem that these religions probably do not represent the true nature of God .
Eliminate the illogical
The powerful and personal Creator God of the universe would probably want to reveal Himself to His spiritual creatures .
So , it seems likely that God would have revealed His true nature to one or more of the peoples of the earth .
Are all the revelations of the world religions a reflection of God or just certain one (s ) ?
This is the difficult question that cannot be answered in merely one short page .
However , I believe one can come up with a best answer through much study and through the process of elimination .
For example , some religions make truth claims that are obviously false .
The LDS church ( Mormons ) claims that gods are created through procreation and that creatures created by those gods can eventually become gods themselves .
However , this religion suffers from the problem of how the first god came into existence .
Logic would dictate that God is eternal and uncreated .
All religions that claim otherwise would seem to be logically flawed .
Basic religious claims
Since many religious claims contradict one another , it would seem that not all religions could be simultaneously true .
How can we tell which religion (s ) are true ?
If you examine the world religions , most describe ethical and moral laws that are ascribed to God .
Breaking of those laws is an offense to God .
How do different religions handle that problem ?
Many religions say that if one tries to obey God 's laws most of the time , God will accept you .
However , I believe that we can eliminate that idea as being true of the Creator God of the universe .
God designed physical laws of the universe .
These laws are constant and unbreakable .
God Himself , seems to break those physical laws only rarely .
I propose that this God would not accept the breaking of His moral laws so easily .
In fact , from the nature of the physical laws , it would seem that God would not accept the breaking of His moral laws at all .
Nearly all religions claim that God will ignore our breaking of His moral laws as long as we try our best .
This is where Christianity differs from all other world religions .
Christianity says that our good works cannot erase our bad moral choices .
Think of it in terms of our legal systems .
We are convicted of crimes on the basis of breaking the law .
If we break a law , we are found guilty under the law .
It does n't matter what good things we have done in our lives , if we break the law .
We might get a lesser sentence , but we will still be convicted of a crime .
So , God can not simply ignore our crimes against Him .
We will be found guilty , despite our good works .
Christianity says that our bad deeds ( sins ) must be eliminated in order to be acceptable to God .
The elimination of sins was accomplished by the sacrifice of the Savior ( Jesus Christ ) .
Jesus Christ is God Himself , who came to earth , led a sinless life , and died on the cross as a sacrifice to take the sins of mankind .
So , God Himself provided a means of eliminating our sins against Him .
However , the elimination of sins is not automatic .
Since God will allow people into
His presence after death , they must agree to His terms .
This contract is executed through faith in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ to eliminate our sins .
By accepting God 's terms , our sins are erased and we can stand in the presence of God without any sin .
Only our good deeds will be counted for our judgment .
Those who do n't accept
God 's terms will be judged on the basis of God 's laws - and will be found guilty .
Christianity is different !
No other religion provides a provision for God 's forgiveness of sin , which is why I believe Christianity to be the only true way to God.
Jesus said
He is the only way to God and that all people must follow Him to enter heaven .
All other religions are man 's attempt to become acceptable to God.
Only Christianity says that God alone provides the only means to be acceptable to Him .
So , either Christianity is true and all other religions are false or Christianity is false and God does not hold people accountable for law breaking .
Personally , I would not want to rely upon God ignoring His own rules .
It does n't seem to be logical reasoning .
This is the choice you must make .
Conclusion
So , I encourage you to examine the world religions to see if what I am saying is true .
Do n't give up on the ability to separate the truth claims of the world 's religions .
If Christianity is true , you must make a choice or you will be judged on the basis of your sins against God .
Let me know if you have any questions .

Out of the $ 306.1 billion so far handed out under TARP since its inception , there has been an unrealized loss of $ 123 billion , compliments mostly of the big 4 : C , BAC , WFC and JPM .
“ This past week marked the largest downward slide of the Ethisphere TARP Index since its creation , losing just under $ 21 billion in value .
Ethisphere estimates that more than a third of the TARP companies have lost at least 25 percent of their value to date , " said Stefan Linssen , Managing Editor of Ethisphere Magazine and one of the lead research analysts behind the Ethisphere TARP Index .
“ More rumors surfaced that Bank of America would take the path of Citigroup and have the Treasury convert a substantial amount of its preferred shares to common stock , though CEO Ken Lewis continues to adamantly deny that the bank will need any more infusion of capital of any kind .
Aside from Citigroup , Ethisphere estimates that the rest of the calamity investments were relatively stable this past week . ”
The largest estimated losses to date under TARP are : 1 . Citigroup ( C ) – with an estimated loss of $ 35.9 billion 2 . Wells Fargo ( WFC ) – with an estimated loss of $ 12.5 billion 3 . Bank of America ( BAC ) – with an estimated loss of $ 11.3 billion 4 . JP Morgan ( JPM ) – with an estimated loss of $ 6.3 billion
The largest estimated gains to date under TARP are : 1 . Great Southern Bancorp ( GSBC ) – with an estimated gain of $ 11.1 million 2 . Community Bankers Trust Corp ( BTC ) – with an estimated gain of $ 2.0 million 3 . First Citizens Banc Corp ( FCZA ) – with an estimated gain of $ 1.5 million
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The Treasury Department is preparing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for Chrysler LLC that could come as early as next week , The New York Times reported Thursday on its Web site , citing people close to the situation .
Union pensions and retiree health care benefits will be protected under the filing , according to the Times .
Also , the Times reported that Italian automaker Fiat would complete its alliance with Chrysler during the bankruptcy .
A new study assessing the withdrawal method finds it is nearly as effective as condoms .
Should we teach it to teenagers ?
About a quarter of American high school students receive
abstinence - only sex-education , meaning they learn nothing at school
about contraception methods .
But even among American teens who are
offered comprehensive sex-education , there is one birth - control method
routinely derided : the withdrawal method — known colloquially , of
course , as " pulling out " before ejaculation .
Students are told that in addition to providing no protection
against sexually transmitted infections , withdrawal does next to
nothing to prevent pregnancy .
Pre-ejaculatory fluid contains sperm that
can lead to pregnancy , teens are taught — despite the fact that
clinical studies show this is highly unlikely .
Now a new paper ( PDF ) , published by the journal Contraception ,
culls evidence from several studies to argue that withdrawal is
actually nearly as effective as condoms in preventing pregnancy .
The
paper reports that couples who practice withdrawal perfectly over the
course of a year — meaning the male partner always pulls out before
ejaculation — have only a 4 percent pregnancy rate .
More " typical "
couples using withdrawal ( those who sometimes mess up ) have a pregnancy
rate of 18 percent .
Those numbers are very similar to the perfect and typical - use
rates for the male condom , which are 2 percent and 17 percent ,
respectively .
The typical - use numbers are based on the 2002 National
Survey of Family Growth , which sampled 848 women using withdrawal and
3,800 using condoms .

Against the back - drop of a rising teen pregnancy rate
and ongoing political fights over the Obama administration ’s decision
to cut some abstinence - only funding , public health experts are sharply
divided on the implications of the new paper , especially with regard to
sex -education .
Some believe teenagers should be encouraged to practice
withdrawal in some contexts — if they do n’t have a condom , but also if
they come from religious backgrounds that eschew hormonal birth
control .
But others caution that emphasizing withdrawal ’s success rate
ignores teen boys ’ relative lack of self - control compared to adult men ,
and downplays teen girls ’ need to share control over contraception .
Indeed , there is no reliable research on the method ’s success rate
among adolescents in particular .
And talking positively about
withdrawal takes the focus off condoms , which are the only way to
protect against most STIs .
" A common situation is one in which the
boyfriend does n’t want to use the condom , period , " says Heather
Corinna , a Seattle - based sex-educator who runs the popular sexuality
advice Web site Scarleteen .
" This is a pretty easy slippery slope . "
Corinna says she was conceived
by parents using the withdrawal method " perfectly . "
She laughs , " That ’s
one of the three things my parents agree on ! "
Yet the Contraception paper ’s lead author , Guttmacher
Institute researcher Rachel Jones , cautions against relying on
anecdotal evidence when assessing withdrawal .
" We ’re constantly told by
people in positions of authority that it ’s not effective .
‘ Do n’t use
it , it ’s like playing roulette , ’ " she says .
" But it does substantially
reduce the risk of pregnancy .
And that ’s why it should be part of
sex-education classes . "
Former public school sex-ed teacher Debra Hauser , now executive
vice president of Washington - based Advocates for Youth , could n’t agree
more .
She calls the traditional public health line on withdrawal " a
huge pet peeve .
I ’m thrilled somebody finally did an article like
this . "
During a recession , it ’s no small thing that withdrawal is
free .
What ’s more , Hauser points out , many teenagers do n’t know how to
access contraception , or are anxious about parents finding out they
have bought condoms or obtained a prescription for hormonal birth
control .
And those who hear abstinence - only messaging in church or at
school may have done little or nothing to plan for sex , believing that
to do so would be to give in to temptation .
Despite the prevalence of abstinence - only , 60 percent of all
American high school students have sex before graduation day , and about
95 percent of Americans have pre-marital sex .
Research shows teens who
take abstinence pledges delay sex , but do eventually engage in
pre-marital intercourse at the same rate as their peers .
When they do
have sex , however , they are less likely than other teens to use
protection .
" When sex is held out as forbidden fruit , young people are
not prepared for planning it .
It just sort of happens , " Hauser says .
" If at that point , all you have is withdrawal , then my goodness ,
withdraw !
Unfortunately , if withdrawal is belittled in school , you
think ,
‘ Why should I ? ’ "
A Kinsey Institute survey of 18 to 30 year old women found
that about 21 percent regularly use withdrawal , most commonly combining
it with another method , such as using condoms during the more fertile
days around ovulation .
High school sex -ed curricula rarely delve deeply
into that type of fertility awareness ; in comprehensive sex-ed , girls
are usually told to be wary of pregnancy on every day of their cycle .
But considering that more people may be relying on withdrawal than
previously assumed , some sex-educators believe teenagers ought to be
introduced to fertility awareness methods as well , which are most
commonly associated with married couples who oppose other forms of
birth control for religious reasons .
" Religious kids believe contraception is abortion , " Hauser says .
" Rhythm and withdrawal — at that point , it ’s all you have . "
TeenStar is a popular international sex-ed curriculum that
emphasizes fertility awareness alongside a pro-abstinence , pro-marriage
message .
According to Hanna Klaus , an ob - gyn and the program’s
director , TeenStar students are taught to monitor vaginal mucus in
order to avoid days of peak fertility .
The program is active in 30
countries .
Under the Bush administration , TeenStar received funding
from both USAID and PEPFAR , the President ’s Emergency Plan for Aids
Relief .
Yet because it is considered neither abstinence - only nor
comprehensive sex-ed , only a few Catholic schools are using the
curriculum within the United States .
Though TeenStar does less to promote condoms and hormonal
birth control than many comprehensive sex -ed advocates would like , some
see possibilities for cooperation with abstinence proponents like
Klaus , who will at least discuss contraception with teens .
In reality
though , the American sex-ed wars have left little space for such common
ground .
Influential groups such as the National Abstinence
Clearinghouse and National Abstinence Education Association oppose
giving teens " mixed messages " by discussing any contraceptive methods .
Both organizations ignored several interview requests for this article .
As the political consensus shifts away from abstinence - only ,
debates like this one will likely become more common .
Even those
skeptical of the reported withdrawal success rates say disagreement
over the method provides a perfect opportunity to teach teenagers the
kind of critical thinking and evidence - assessment necessary in making
health decisions .
" I think everything should be talked about with teens , " says
Martha Kempner , vice president of SIECUS , the Sexuality Information and
Education Council of America .
" The thing we often forget about
school - based information is that we ’re not just giving them the
information they need right now .
We ’re giving them the information they
need for the rest of their lives . "

The global financial crisis is a turning point for the whole world .
Across our economy , society and politics it has unleashed a new impulse for change .
When even that most market - orientated President of modern times , George W Bush , backed state intervention to bring order to financial markets , the vestiges of the old Reagan / Thatcher orthodoxy finally crumbled .
Governments , whether right or left , are dusting down powers that for decades they have felt unable to use .
We are seeing a major change in the assumptions guiding public policy .
For decades it was that the state had little role in the market .
Now the state is back .
Regulation is in .
People who are losing their homes and their jobs are struggling to understand how banks and financial institutions got it so wrong .
They are angry and looking to politicians for action .
Progressive politics needs to learn the lessons of that era of excess and to acknowledge what went wrong .
The trick is to do so without heralding a new era of economic protectionism and state interventionism .
Such an approach might be tempting in the present but it is not the answer for the future .
First , because those licking their lips at the prospect of an end to market capitalism – as distinct from the death of unfettered financial markets – risk gorging prematurely on a beast that has life still in it .
Markets need to be appropriately managed and properly regulated .
And when they are , they work .
They unleash innovation and realise potential .
They have brought people in countries like our own unprecedented prosperity and opportunity .
And globalisation – the worldwide meshing together of markets – has given millions in the poorest countries a route out of poverty in a way that nothing else has ever come close to matching .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The issue is how to get economic recovery under way and then to refashion our economy so that markets work in the interests of the majority not just the minority .
That means increasing transparency and decreasing excess .
It means changing corporate governance rules as well as regulatory regimes .
It means encouraging active shareholding and extending employee share ownership .
In other words , it means bringing a dose of democracy into the operation of our economy .
The job of progressives is not to kill capitalism but to civilise it – by making it work in the public interest .
Second , those expressing glee that financial turmoil exposes the limits of free markets need to remember there are equally limits to the role of centralised states .
Of course , only state action – including by the UK Government – could have stabilised our financial institutions and stimulated our economies .
Indeed without states agreeing to pool their actions global problems , whether economic or environmental , stand little chance of being solved .
Similarly , when it comes to social change it is inconceivable that disadvantage can be overcome without the state or politics playing its part .
Poor people are hardly able to spend their way out of poverty .
If Britain is to become truly socially mobile they need help with education , housing , training , childcare and employment .
That is why those on the new right of politics who continue to reject the role of the state represent an ideological blast from the past , not a progressive politics of the future .
So the challenges of the modern world call for the state to play its part .
They also call , however , for the state to know its place .
Government intervention to stabilise and stimulate the global economy must not become the foundation for a wider creeping programme of nationalisation in which the state assumes responsibilities that properly belong either to markets or to citizens .
It is only the state that can equalise opportunities throughout life and empower its citizens .
Equally , only citizens can seize those opportunities and realise their own aspirations to progress .
So just as the right is wrong to reject the state 's role , the left must avoid the trap of countering an argument about less state by making a case for more state .
This is not as some claim a moment for leftist politics .
It is a moment for a new form of progressive politics .
Meeting the challenges of the modern world calls for a different sort of state : one that empowers , not controls .
Faced with the new challenges of global warming and global terror , of mass migration and community insecurity the old top down approach to governance will no longer work .
It is not just that the public have reached the limits of what they will pay in taxes , although they have .
Nor is it just that in the next decade fiscal pressures will compel governments – whether of right or left – to be far clearer with their electorates which areas of state spending need to rise and which areas need to fall .
But it is also that , just as the global credit crunch and its consequences have exposed the limits of untrammelled free markets , so the new problems politics must confront – how to improve health , beat crime , regenerate communities , safeguard the environment – simply cannot happen if we have to choose between either having an active state or having active citizens .
It is not either / or that is needed .
It is both .
What made for progress in the past will not secure progress in the future .
One example .
When New Labour came to power in 1997 the most pressing health challenge was to cut what were then the appallingly long waits that patients had for treatment .
A decade on and that old NHS bugbear – long waiting times – has more or less been beaten through a mix of extra resources and top - down reforms .
The challenge today is different and altogether more complex : how to absorb a demand for services that is simultaneously both rising and changing against a dwindling supply of resources .
The NHS not only needs to cope with the pressures of an ageing society and advancing technology .
It now has to focus on how to improve health , for example by beating obesity and tackling alcohol abuse .
It now has to work out how to help the growing numbers with a chronic condition to manage their diabetes or their arthritis .
It now has to find ways not just of providing collective care but of shifting individual behaviour .
The problem today is different and so must be the solution .
We can no longer treat patients as passive recipients of care in a system that denies them both power and responsibility .
Instead they need to be more in charge and more responsible for their own health .
Interestingly evaluations from both the US and the UK show that policies which give patients greater control over their own health - care decisions – including their own state - financed health budgets – manage to combine higher levels of personal satisfaction with lower levels of public spending than traditional forms of service delivery .
The challenges of the future call for a different relationship between the state and the citizen than we have had in the past .
It is doing things with people rather than to them that holds the key to unlocking progress .
That involves governments finding new ways to engage with citizens and communities .
Changing behaviour to improve health or tackle climate change will involve governments securing the participation of citizens instead of preaching at them .
It will mean using incentives – including in the tax system – not just passing laws .
It is striking that the new generation of political leaders – whether Obama in America or Rudd in Australia – are advocating change based not just on new policies but on a new politics : one that is open , engaging and that favours dialogue over monologue .
Such a change is in keeping with the times .
In a world of rampant insecurity and constant change people are looking for greater control in their lives .
The problem is that ours remains a " them and us " political system .
It was framed in an era of elitism .
Rulers ruled – and the ruled were grateful .
Economic advance and universal education have swept aside both deference and ignorance .
Now the internet redistributes knowledge and offers us the chance of being active participants rather than passive by - standers .
Representative democracy worked for the last century .
It is a more participatory democracy that will work in this .
Equity demands that it should be so .
The sense of hopelessness that clouds the poorest communities grows out of disempowerment .
Of course beating crime , creating jobs , rebuilding estates can help .
But this cloud of despondency can only be dispelled by allowing both local communities and individual citizens to more evenly and directly share in power .
By cutting taxes for the low - paid .
By making local services directly accountable to the local community .
By making community courts and restorative justice the twin pincers that deter and prevent anti-social behaviour .
By allowing community - owned mutual organisations to take over the running of local services like children 's centres , estates and parks .
By giving parents new powers to choose schools and patients to choose treatments .
And by empowering people in old age , those with a long - term condition , families with disabled children or people in training the right to choose their own publicly - funded budgets instead of conventionally provided services .
In other words , by changing the balance between the citizen and the state .
This should be the new agenda for New Labour .
Empowering citizens and communities to take far greater control over their lives has always been at the heart of progressive values .
Just as at other points in our history an old orthodoxy has been swept away by a new , so this is an idea whose time has come .
In 1945 the new idea that ushered in the era of full employment and welfare reform was for power to be vested in the nation state and its policy expression was nationalisation .
In the 1980s the new idea that ushered in the Thatcher / Reagan era was for power to be vested in the free market and its policy expression was privatisation .
In the mid-1990s the new idea that ushered in the Clinton / Blair era was for power to be vested in reformed institutions and its policy expression was modernisation .
Now the new idea is to vest power in the citizen and the community and to make its policy expression empowerment .
Out of the debris of the global financial crash it can usher in a new era of progressive politics which fundamentally shifts the balance of power both in our society and our economy – towards the individual citizen .
This is the new progressive cause .

Various small helper functions for Lists , Maybes , Tuples , Functions .
Some of these functions are improved implementations of standard functions .
They have the same name as their standard counterparts .
Others are equivalent to functions from the base package , but if you import them from this utility package then you can write code that runs on older GHC versions or other compilers like Hugs and JHC .
All modules are plain Haskell 98 .
The package depends exclusively on the base package and only that portions of base that are simple to port .
Thus you do not risk a dependency avalanche by importing it .
However , further splitting the base package might invalidate this statement .
CTV is reporting that the goernment minister in charge of industry has confirmed that there is a " Plan B " in place for both GM and Chrysler to go into bankruptcy within the next 2 months - and that GM is seriously considering it .
About time .
The US and Canada are obviously working from the same play book - " either meet our requirements in terms of long - term viability plans or we turn off the taps and let it get worked out in bankruptcy court . "
Chrysler does n't have a real plan .
The " alliance " with Fiat does n't change much for Chrysler - no source of new funds , and " access to small - car platforms " will take years to result in any manufacturing jobs ( or worse , it just means importing rebadged Fiats , which as pointed out here does n't make economic sense because of the high Euro ) .
Additionally , Fiat does n't assume any of Chrysler 's debt .
... and then Fiat 's sales dropped 24 % at the end of the year ...
... on top of which , it does n't stop the losses over the next few years at Chrysler , which is too dependent on mini-vans and trucks .
Switching to small - car production ( with its ' lower profits per car ) is n't a formula for success for Fiat / Chrysler - the new cars would have to compete with established brands .
It 's not like Toyota , Honda , Hyundai , Ford and Nissan are going to say " here - take a piece of our market . "
And combine the perception of " Chrysler is a dead man walking " with the Fiat " Fix It Again Tony " image problem ... there is no synergy .
Fiat pulled out of North America once for a reason ... they can't compete .
Chrysler is bankrupt , and will make a formal bankruptcy filing on Friday , May 1st or Monday , May 4th , for liquidation .
And GM ?
I 'm sure a judge will have an opening on their calendar on either Friday , May 29th , or Monday , June 1st , for reorganization .
On another note , Chrysler 's bankruptcy means that Nissan gets out of their commitment to have Chrysler build a pickup for them - the last thing Nissan needs is a Nissan RamRiceroni
Without co-sponsor , Ammiano's pot bill lagging

California Assemblyman Tom Ammiano , D - San Francisco , started a national conversation by introducing a bill to legalize and tax marijuana for recreational use in California .
In the days afterward , even Fox News commentator Glenn Beck said , " It is about time we legalized marijuana . "
While Ammiano's bill , introduced in February , has sparked cable and blog chatter and supportive editorials from around the world , it has n't received a single co-sponsor .
He pulled it from a committee hearing scheduled for late March - he said it was scheduled without his knowledge - and plans to hold a hearing in late fall or early winter .
The measure is now a two - year bill , giving the freshman legislator through next year to build support .
Few doubt Ammiano 's political bravery in introducing legislation that challenges one of society 's long - standing taboos - he calls it the " wink - wink " attitude many have toward weed .
But is the former stand - up comedian and first - term legislator representing one of the most liberal parts of the country the right person to lead the fight for pot legalization ?
Can a longtime San Francisco supervisor convince his conservative colleagues from districts that do n't have dozens of pot clubs that they 're not taking a political risk by supporting a bill the state Board of Equalization says could raise more than $ 1 billion in revenue for a cash - starved state ?
" Oh , do n't underestimate me , pal , " Ammiano said .
He is n't concerned about not having co-sponsors so early in the process , especially for a highly detailed bill that could be reviewed by three different Assembly committees .
Privately , he has been having conversations with his more conservative colleagues , many of whom he said are telling him , " ' Great idea - I do n't think I can vote for it yet . '
I think they need the assurance of their constituents that they wo n't be thrown out of office , which I think would be highly unlikely .
They wo n't be thrown out of office for this . "
Economic , social benefits
So he hopes to appeal to them either with the economic benefits of legalization or with the prospect of reducing drug - related violence .
When he lobbies legislators from the more rural districts , he explains how legalization could reduce the growing operations of international drug cartels .
The bill could n't come at a friendlier time for pot legalization .
Days after it was introduced , the Obama administration 's Justice Department said states should make their own rules regarding medical marijuana - a change from the previous two administrations .
While several recent polls have shown an rise in the percentage of respondents who would support legalizing pot , GOP consultant Rob Stutzman does n't sense a grassroots hunger for legislation .
" People who want to use marijuana are finding it and not having that much trouble using it , " said Stutzman , who advises GOP gubernatorial hopeful Meg Whitman ( who he said opposes legalization ) .
But Ammiano replied , " If we 're hemorrhaging money and doing this wink - wink , nod - nod all these years , it 's about time we start harvesting this .
And admit to the fact that it 's going to be around and if we regulate and tax it , and decriminalize it , we could have not only an economic benefit but a policy benefit . "
Politically , such an effort would be challenging , Stutzman said , as Ammiano 's political pedigree " does allow the issue to be compartmentalized as a very left - wing , San Francisco idea .
If there was a legislator from Fresno or even suburban Los Angeles sponsoring it , it might be a little different . "
Vasconcellos ' early effort
Five years ago , former state Sen.
John Vasconcellos , D - Santa Clara , had similar legislation drafted .
But Vasconcellos , one of the most powerful legislators in Sacramento with nearly 40 years of service , never introduced it .
He was n't shy about taboo - shaking legislation .
He sponsored " The California Task Force to Promote Self - esteem and Personal and Social Responsibility " and proposed that 14 - year - olds be allowed to vote .
But he told The Chronicle that he pulled the pot bill because he felt critics would revive their prediction that medical cannabis - which he long championed - was merely a tactic to eventually legalize weed .
So the measure remained in the dark until a few months ago .
When Dale Gieringer , coordinator of California NORML ( National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ) heard that Ammiano 's office was considering a similar move , he shared Vasconcellos ' legislation with the staff .
Ammiano said Vasconcellos " told me to ' Just go for it . ' "
" Tom has always been a courageous spokesperson for cutting - edge issues in San Francisco , " Gieringer said .
As for whether that ability translates to a statewide stage , Gieringer said , " He may be ideologically and culturally polarizing , but personally , he 's not . "
Gieringer cautions that moving this bill forward will take time , noting that medical marijuana took several years to take hold statewide in California .
Now , 13 states have legalized medical marijuana .
" This , " he said , " goes deeper than Tom Ammiano . "

WINDSOR — A new after - school book club at Mountain View Elementary School has just a few simple rules :
Be enthusiastic ; be prepared to discuss a selected book ’s plot and characters ; and absolutely , positively no girls allowed .
Four male teachers at the school , with the help of school librarian Joann Perko , started the all - boys book club this year to give reading a boost among the guys .
Girls , according to club members , would only be a distraction .
“ They would pick a book that would be boring , and I would n’t read it at all , ” said Trevor Webb , 9 .
That seems to be the crux of a growing problem among male students in the U.S. , say some education and reading experts .
Boys like certain books — especially those featuring action and adventure — and anything else kills their willingness to curl up with a good yarn .
“ Boys often have to read books they do n’t really like , ” said Jon Scieszka , author of “ The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales , ” on his website guysread .com , aimed at getting boys to crack open a book .
“ And what they do like to read , people sometimes tell them is not really reading . ”
The written word is exalted at the Mountain View book club , where students sit on the edge of their seats discussing certain passages .
The club , which meets every other Wednesday , usually attracts about 20 boys , says organizer and teacher Evan Netzer .
In the last session , students broke into three individual groups to talk about “ Mr. Tuckett , ” “ Wild Man Island ” and “ No More Dead Dogs . ”
Perko said she got the idea for the club after attending the Northern Colorado Children ’s Literature Conference at the University of Northern Colorado .
“ Well , we had four male teachers here — which makes us very fortunate — and I thought it would be a great way to pool these resources and get boys interested in reading , ” Perko said .
Netzer has seen a difference in his male students since the club started .
“ They seem to dive into reading more and more now , ” he said .
Club selections are usually anything about adventure or survival .
“ Anything that ’s a non - girl book , ” he said .
Mountain View girls are showing signs of wanting equal time .
“ Some have said they want their own book club next year , ” Perko said .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Hillary Clinton strolled past open - air sewers in Jakarta , talked robots over tea in Tokyo with the empress of Japan and met women students in Seoul , one of whom asked how she knew her husband “ would be your love . ”
“ You know , I feel more like an advice columnist than a secretary of state today , ” a bemused Clinton replied .
Making her first trip as the United States ’ top diplomat , Clinton made one thing abundantly clear during a week - long tour of Asian capitals : she is no ordinary secretary of state .
Where most of her pinstriped - predecessors have focussed on policy , rather than people , the former presidential candidate took to diplomacy as if it was a political campaign .
Spliced in among her meetings with presidents and prime ministers , Clinton made time for an appearance on a music TV show in Indonesia , held “ town hall ” meetings with students in Japan and South Korea , and scheduled a web chat in China .
Beyond advancing U.S. interests in Asia , Clinton told reporters she viewed part of her job as trying to restore an American image tarnished by the Iraq war and other unpopular policies pursued by former President George W. Bush .
“ We ’ve got a lot of work to do , ” she said early in her trip to Japan , Indonesia , South Korea and China .
“ I have no illusions about how high ... a hill we have to climb here to inspire confidence and respect in people ’s minds again . ”
The former first lady tried to show that the United States can be a force for good in Indonesia , the world ’s most populous Muslim country , by taking a walk through a modest Jakarta neighbourhood where Washington funds development projects .
With the smell of open - air sewers in the air , Clinton took in small - scale projects to purify water , recycle trash into handicrafts and offer health care to mothers and babies .
“ This , to me , is what diplomacy is about , ” she later said .
“ It does n’t just operate ... government to government .
It operates people to people . ”
ROCK STAR RECEPTION
Clinton generally got a rock star reception when she punched through the diplomatic bubble to meet ordinary people .
“ Glorious to meet you , ” gushed a student at Japan ’s august Tokyo University , where Clinton talked about everything from baseball to her chat with the empress about whether Japanese robots may someday help the elderly to stay in their homes .
Visiting Indonesia ahead of a presidential election this year , Clinton made a point about the necessity of accepting the outcome of a fair election , even when you lose .
“ I ’ve had that experience , and I know , ” she said with ironic understatement , alluding to her defeat by U.S. President Barack Obama in the race to be the Democratic Party ’s presidential candidate and prompting a ripple of laughter and applause .
Clinton broke with diplomatic discretion at several points on her trip , openly talking about the possibility there could be a power struggle in Pyongyang over who may succeed North Korean leader Kim Jong -il .
Western diplomats seldom , if ever , speak openly about a matter of such sensitivity , in part for fear of angering the mercurial leader of the Stalinist state , which tested a nuclear device in 2006 .
“ It ’s been in the news for months , ” Clinton said when asked about her comment .
“ I do n’t think that it ’s a forbidden subject to talk about succession in the hermit kingdom . ”
“ I think that it ’s worth being perhaps more straightforward and trying to engage other countries on the basis of the reality that exists , ” Clinton added .
“ That ’s how I see it , and that ’s how I intend to operate . ”

Davis v. Google , 09 CH 15753 ( Cook County Ct. complaint filed April 9 , 2009 )
Venkat sent a very interesting lawsuit this morning that raises some complex policy issues .
The complaint alleges that Sean Healy created a blog at unknowncolumn .
blogspot.com and posted defamatory content about speedskater Shani Davis ’ mom , Cherie Davis .
[ I believe the post in question is at http://unknowncolumn.blogspot.com/2006/02/memo-to-cherie-davis.html —
I ’m not going to link to it , but it did show up as my first search result for “ Cherie Davis ” ] .
The complaint further alleges that Healy is now deceased , so he can no longer remove the content on Cherie ’s demand , and he did not have a “ probate estate ” to take over his blog .
As a result , Cherie feels like she has nowhere to turn to clean up the alleged defamation , so she is suing Google ’s Blogspot for a takedown injunction .
On the face of it , the lawsuit is clearly preempted by 47 USC 230 , and Google ought to get a quick and unambiguous win .
However , there are some lurking policy issues about dealing with online content posted by now - deceased individuals :
* Presumably the content and the account passed through Healy ’s estate .
Even if there was no “ probate estate , ” whatever that means , there is still a legal protocol for succession of Healy ’s assets –including the copyrights in his blog .
So someone now owns Healy ’s blog , and it should be possible to determine who that is .
* Even if the legal rights have been allocated , taking control over a deceased accountholder ’s account is not always easy .
The last time I recall this issue being discussed , it was in the context of taking control over deceased military personnel ’s email accounts .
Online providers have different policies about how to deal with this–and for good reason , as too loose a policy could enable account hijacking , plus there may be concerns about the deceased accountholder ’s privacy .
I wonder what Blogspot ’s policy is .
This issue wo n’t come up often , but it will definitely come up again .
* If Cherie ca n’t sue Healy ’s estate , instead of suing Blogspot , I wonder if Cherie could seek a declaratory judgment that the content is defamatory .
I would be shocked if Blogspot would n’t honor a declaratory judgment in Cherie ’s favor , and it ’s not exactly like Healy would contest it .
* If Blogspot wo n’t voluntarily remove the content , I wonder if Cherie could have more cost - effectively achieved the same net result through a reputation management service .
A good reputation management service should be able to obscure several year old content that has n’t been recently refreshed .
As 160 Innocent staff stood on the artificial grass in the " chill - out room " of their headquarters , Fruit Towers , yesterday , they were about to receive some news that not all of them found as palatable as their smoothies .
A stake in the London smoothie - maker had been sold to the world 's biggest soft drinks company and symbol of ruthless US capitalism , Coca - Cola .
For the three founders Richard Reed , Jon Wright and Adam Balon , who met at St John 's College , Cambridge , the £ 30 m funding from the US drinks giant will propel the company 's fledgling move into Europe and fight off multinational companies determined to replicate its success in Britain .
For some Innocent customers , going into business with a fizzy drinks company which puts eight teaspoons of sugar into 300 ml cans of its best - selling drink will not be the most auspicious of partnerships for a social enterprise which prides itself on its wholesomeness and independence .

By selling between 10 and 20 per cent of its business to Coca - Cola , Innocent is following a slew of niche brands into the arms of larger companies .
Since the boom in ethical consumption at the end of the 1990s , the organic soup and sauce maker Seeds of Change has been taken over by Mars , Rachel 's Organics by the US dairy giant Dean Foods and organic chocolate company Green & Black 's by the mass - market organisation Cadbury .
The premium sandwich maker Pret A Manger ( which had a dalliance with McDonald's ) , the speciality crispmakers Tyrrell 's and Kettle , and health food maker Dorset Cereals have all been gobbled up by private equity companies .
Ben & Jerry's , the quirky Vermont company whose ice cream comes with chunky political slogans , was scooped up by the conglomerate Unilever , which makes everything from Persil to Flora .
In the most famous case of all , in 2006 ethical pioneer Anita Roddick sold her Body Shop chain to the French cosmetic giant L'Oréal , which she had accused three years earlier of making women feel bad about their bodies .
In all the cases , the entrepreneurs , who received multimillion - pound payouts , argued that a big company 's money and expertise was vital to spreading their ethical message .
Yesterday , Innocent was no different , explaining that Coca - Cola 's funds and 120 years of business experience distinguished it from two other fund - raising offers on the table .
" They 're only a minority investor but we have got someone on the end of the line that we can ring for advice , " said Richard Reed .
" To have cash and expertise rather than just cash to use seemed a good move . "
Unlike other " sell - outs " , the founders will not be pocketing the cash ; instead , it will fund offices , staff and marketing across Europe to push the company 's smoothies and new veg -pots .
Only 20 per cent of the company 's £ 103 m sales last year came from the Continent , where it operates in 13 countries .
Most of the time it is second , third or fourth behind the banana giant Chiquita or Tropicana , which is owned by Pepsico , Coca - Cola 's arch rival .
" On Continental Europe , only 20 per cent of supermarkets have smoothies , " said Reed .
" But the big boys , Chiquita and Tropicana , are moving in quickly .
We could carry on doing it piecemeal ; the reality was we did n't have the luxury of time in Europe , because everyone has seen what we have done in the UK . "
With Coca - Cola 's money , Innocent will launch in Spain and Italy and seek to improve its position across Europe , and eventually the world ; it is trademarked in every country apart from those in sub-Saharan Africa .
In return for its £ 30 m , Coke will attend quarterly investment meetings but the loudest voices will still be those of the founders , who will have stakes of 20 per cent each , the staff , who have 10 per cent , and Maurice Pinto , the initial investor , who has the rest .
Britain's top smoothie maker promised to continue donating 10 per cent of its profits to good causes .
Whatever the merits of the investment , Innocent acknowledged that some customers would feel uneasy about leaping into bed with Coke , which is often vaunted as one of the brashest examples of American consumerism .
How the move will turn out in the long run remains to be seen .
Where companies have surrendered their business to a bigger partner , their fortunes have been mixed .
In an interview with The Independent last year , Ben & Jerry 's founder Jerry Greenfield acknowledged that Unilever had kept the business a separate division , but he still rued his lack of control .
Green & Black 's founder Craig Sams felt that giving the company access to Cadbury 's money and expertise had helped sell more organic chocolate bars without lowering quality .
According to Ruth Mortimer , the associate editor of Marketing Week magazine , businesses who take over smaller , niche brands are too smart to kill off their new acquisition 's attributes .
" I do n't think most shoppers will be especially concerned as long as they see no obvious differences in the way that Innocent behaves or communicates , " she said .
" Green & Black 's has gone from strength to strength since it was acquired by Cadbury and people have n't stopped buying Ben & Jerry 's now it is owned by Unilever .
Pret A Manger once had a stake taken by McDonald 's and has also gone on to flourish . "
Manchester - based Ethical Consumer magazine , however , immediately downgraded Innocent 's ethical score from 12.5 out of 20 to 6.5 , putting it towards the bottom of smoothie makers .
Editor Rob Harrison said Coke scored poorly for its record on water extraction in India , human rights in Columbia , environmental reporting and marketing of sugary drinks to children .
In a market dominated by multinationals , Richard Reed said he felt safer with Coke by his side .
" We have got an older brother .
We are still on the programme to fight the bullies but we have got this older brother to call to the school gate to sort them out , " he said .
Sold out ?
Ethical chains that lost their independence
Ben and Jerry's ( 2000 )
Founded by hippies Jerry Greenfield and Ben Cohen , the ice - cream maker famous for funky flavours like Cherry Garcia and Chubby Hubby was bought by Anglo - Dutch household products giant Unilever for £ 175 m in 2000 .
Unilever has kept the business separate and stuck to many of Ben and Jerry 's original Fairtrade ideals but did not promise to maintain forever the company tradition of giving 7.5 per cent of profits to good causes .
Pret A Manger ( 2001 )
A third of Pret A Manger , the upmarket sandwich maker opposed to " obscure chemicals , additives and preservatives " , was sold to fast food giant McDonald 's , which uses 78 E numbers in its own branded food .
Private equity company Bridgepoint bought all of Pret for £ 345 m last year , making at least £ 50 m each for its founders Julian Metcalfe and Sinclair Beecham .
Green & Black 's ( 2005 )
Green & Black's , which started life in 1991 , was named after its gourmet credentials : organic ( green ) and high - cocoa ( black ) .
Organic pioneer Craig Sams and his wife Jo Fairley felt the best way foward was by selling the company to mass market chocolate - maker Cadbury for an undisclosed sum .
Body Shop ( 2006 )
Ethical business Anita Roddick was criticised by animal welfare campaigners in 2006 for selling Body Shop , which campaigned against animal testing , to French beauty corporation L'Oréal , which admitted " a very small " number of ingredients in L'Oréal products had been tested on animals .
In 2003 , Dame Anita condemned L'Oréal in particular and the beauty industry in general , saying that it promoted " unattainable ideals and sabotages self - esteem " .
Roddick and her husband , Gordon , who founded the company in 1976 , earned £ 130 m from the £ 652 m sale .
Abel & Cole ( 2007 )
Keith Abel , founder of one of Britain 's most popular organic box schemes , started out selling potatoes door to door .
He cashed in some of his chips two years ago when he sold a multimillion - pound stake in the company to Phoenix Equity Partners .
Tyrrell 's ( 2008 )
William Chase made national headlines in 2006 for demanding Tesco stop selling his crisps .
Chase , who grew the potatoes for his crisps on his Herefordshire farm , last year sold the business to private equity company , Langholm Capital , for almost £ 40 m .
You still cannot buy Tyrrell 's in Tesco .
Will M. sent us this fascinating clip of Lil’ Wayne on Jimmy Kimmel Live .
In the clip , Kimmel asks Wayne about losing his virginity at age 11 .
Wayne reveals that he did , indeed , lose his virginity at 11 .
He lost it to a 14 - year - old girl who turned out the lights and surprised Wayne into participating , even as he had not intended doing so .
What is fascinating is , were Wayne a white female , this narrative would have been considered molestation or rape .
As a black male , doubly hypersexualized as a man ( who always wants sex ) and a black man ( who really always wants sex ) , it ’s just considered a joke .
This is really nice evidence of the social construction of men , especially Black and Latino men , as hypersexual and , therefore , incapable of being sexually assaulted .
The discussion of his virginity loss begins at about 2:40 .
Just one excerpt :
Land-use regulation caused the housing bubble .
Now , in at least one city , other regulations have forced a bank to demolish brand - new homes .
It would be easy to say that this shows that builder constructed a surplus of homes .
But the truth is that these houses , like their builder and our entire economy , are simply victims of overzealous regulation .
Among the many rules in the city of Victorville is one that imposes daily fines on the owners of homes not brought up to code within so many months after construction begins .
The builder of these homes nearly completed them , then went bankrupt .
Given a choice between paying the fines , bringing the homes up to code , or tearing them down , the bank decided to bulldoze them .
According to one of the comments on this site , the “ code violation ” was some windows broken by local vandals .
Another story says it was due to the builder ’s failure “ to finish roads , walls , and other improvements that bring the community into code . ”
Whatever the details , this waste — from beginning to end — can be blamed solely on stupid land - use rules .
When Elif 's father told her she had to kill herself in order to spare him from a prison sentence for her murder , she considered it long and hard .
" I loved my father so much , I was ready to commit suicide for him even though I had n't done anything wrong , " the 18 - year - old said .
" But I just could n't go through with it .
I love life too much . "
All Elif had done was simply decline the offer of an arranged marriage with an older man , telling her parents she wanted to continue her education .
That act of disobedience was seen as bringing dishonour on her whole family – a crime punishable by death .
" I managed to escape .
When I was at school , a few girls I knew were killed by their families in the name of honour – one of them for simply receiving a text message from a boy , " Elif said .
So - called " honour killings " in Turkey have reached record levels .
According to government figures , there are more than 200 a year – half of all the murders committed in the country .
Now , in a sinister twist , comes the emergence of " honour suicides " .
The growing phenomenon has been linked to reforms to Turkey 's penal code in 2005 .
That introduced mandatory life sentences for honour killers , whereas in the past , killers could receive a reduced sentence claiming provocation .
Soon after the law was passed , the numbers of female suicides started to rocket .

Elif has spent the past eight months on the run , living in hiding and in fear .
Her uncles and other relatives are looking to hunt her down , for dishonour is seen as a stain that can only be cleansed by death .
One of the women 's shelters where Elif has stayed has been raided by armed family members .
Elif is from Batman , a grey , bleak town in the south - east of Turkey nicknamed " Suicide City " .
Three quarters of all suicides here are committed by women – nearly everywhere else in the world , men are three times more likely to kill themselves .
" I think most of these suicide cases are forced .
There are just too many of them , it 's too suspicious .
But they 're almost impossible to investigate , " said Mustafa Peker , Batman 's chief prosecutor .
Wearing tight clothes or talking to a man who is not a relative is sometimes all it takes to blacken the family name .
Mr Peker said women who are told to kill themselves are usually given one of three options – a noose , a gun or rat poison .
They are then locked in a room until the job is done .
A woman 's fate is usually decided during a " family council " , when the extended family meets to discuss breaches of honour .
In these meetings , it is agreed how the victim must be killed .
If it is not to be a forced suicide , a killer is chosen .
The youngest member of the family is often ordered to kill , in the belief they will be treated more leniently if caught .
Mehmet was 17 when he was handed a gun and told he would have to kill his stepmother and her lover .
" I did n't want to do it .
I was so young and so scared , " he said .
Mehmet ran away , but his family tracked him down and warned him his own life would be in danger if he refused to kill .
He shot dead his stepmother 's lover , but his stepmother survived the attack .
He was given a two - and - a - half - year prison sentence .
" There were many other ' honour killers ' in prison and we were treated with respect , even by the prison guards , " Mehmet said .
Most honour killings happen in the Kurdish region , a barren land ravaged by years of war and oppression .
Rural communities here are ruled under a strict feudal , patriarchal system .
But as Kurds have fled the fighting between separatist rebels and Turkey 's government , the crime is spreading across the country into its cities and towns .
According to a recent government report , there is now one honour killing a week in Istanbul .
" Families who move here are suddenly faced with modern , secular Turkey , " said Vildan Yirmibesoglu , the head of Istanbul 's department of human rights .
" This clash of cultures is making the situation worse as the pressure on women to behave conservatively is become more acute .
And of course there are more temptations . "
Ms Yirmibesoglu believes that the entrenched belief in the notion of honour – at all levels of society – is impeding any progress .
" Honour killings are n't always properly investigated because some police and prosecutors share the same views as the honour killers , " she said .
" For things to change , police , prosecutors and even judges need to be educated on gender equality . "
Killing for Honour will be shown on Channel 4 tonight at 7.35 pm
For millions of undernourished North Koreans , the notion of eating at a restaurant belongs strictly to the world of fantasy .
And so there is only the grimmest humour in the news that , for the country 's ruling elite , Pyongyang 's dining options just got a little more impressive : the country now has its first - ever pizzeria .
An obsession with pizza stretching back at least 10 years prompted the isolated nation 's dictator , Kim Jong - il , to authorise North Korea 's first Italian restaurant , which opened in December , according to a pro-Pyongyang newspaper published in Japan .
" General Kim Jong-il said that the people should also be allowed access to the world 's famous dishes , " the restaurant 's manager , Kim Sang - Soon , was quoted as saying in Choson Sinbo , a Tokyo - based newspaper seen as a mouthpiece for the regime .
Those dining at the restaurant are reportedly treated to pizza and pasta made with wheat flour , butter and cheese flown in from Italy .
They are also presumably reaping the benefits of a years - long effort by Kim Jong - il to bring the perfect pizza to his famine - plagued totalitarian state .
In the late 1990s , he summoned a team of Italian pizza chefs to Pyongyang to instruct army officers .
One of the chefs , Ermanno Furlanis , later recounted how the Italians underwent x-rays , brain scans and urine and blood sampling on arrival , before being sequestered in a marble palace .
One of the officers Furlanis was training asked him to specify the precise distance at which olives should be spaced on a pizza , he recalled .
Kim seems to have taken a personal interest : while the pizza - making sessions were under way , on a ship anchored offshore , he was apparently witnessed arriving to inspect his officers ' progress .
" I am not in the position to say whether it really was him , " Furlanis later said .
" But our chef , who had no reason to fib , was , for the space of several minutes , utterly speechless .
He said he felt as if he had seen God , and I still envy him this experience . "
The training seems not to have met Kim 's expectations .
According to Choson Sinbo , subsequent efforts to reproduce Italian pizza in North Korea were a process of " repeated trial and error " , and last year the dictator sent chefs to Naples and Rome to learn more .
Finally satisifed , he authorised the restaurant .
North Korea , one of the world 's poorest countries , was hit by devastating famine in the mid-1990s , with up to 2 m people dying , primarily from pneumonia , tuberculosis and diarrhoea .
But Kim 's passion for fine food is legendary : he is said to be a connoisseur of cognac , French wine , shark - fin soup and sushi .
One of his former chefs , writing under a pseudonym , recalled travelling to Iran and Uzbekistan to fetch caviar , flying to Denmark for bacon and China for melons and grapes .
He defected , he wrote , by offering to source sea urchins from Japan , from where he never returned .
Quoting North Korean defectors , the South Korean news website Daily NK said Kim " does not eat much , but enjoys picking at various kinds of food , as if just to taste " .
Just when we thought we heard the last of Monster trademark litigations , they ’ve defied all logic by attacking one of the last few American companies that actually manufacture their own products - Monster Transmission .
In these economic times , it is a struggle for everyone to keep afloat .
Whether you work for a company , or own one .
Monster Transmission , a Florida company that builds and sells transmissions for cars and trucks is the newest target of Monster Cable ’s litigation team .
After a recent lawsuit with the Monster Mini Golf franchise and receiving tons of negative publicity , the owner of Monster Cable , Noel Lee decided to back off and re-think their Trademark strategy .
This sounded like the end of Monster Cable ’s bully type behavior , but behind the scenes it is apparently still business as usual with their legal department .
If anyone were to Google the phrase “ Monster Cable sues ” , you would find over 72,000 search results filled with stories about their terribly aggressive trademark tactics .
“ It is believed by many that the reason their products are so overpriced , is to pay for all their legal fees .
I wonder how many tax payer dollars have been wasted over the years to fill the court system with their ridiculous law suits . ” says Achilles Thomas of Monster Transmission .
Now their latest attack focuses against Monster Transmission , a family owned company that specializes in high performance transmissions for hot rods & muscle cars .
They are one of the last few American companies that does NOT import , but actually re-manufactures its products right here in the good old U.S.A .!
In contrast , most if not all Monster Cable products are imported from foreign countries such as China , which is definitely not a help to our economy or the working man .
After Monster Transmission refused to hand over their name , Monster Cable filed suit and the attorneys are now going to battle .
Who knows how long this new case will be dragged out , and how many more will follow .
After attacking Disney ’s film “ Monsters Inc. ” , Monster.com , Monster Energy Drink , Timex , Monster Mini-Golf , Discovery Channel and countless others , one has to wonder when will it stop ?
We believe the public and companies that deal with Monster Cable need to be aware of such behavior .
Says Achilles .
Possibly even a boycott of Monster Cable products would be appropriate .
Monster Cable must be brought to justice , and we ask that you send this article to anyone and everyone you know .
I had a brief phone conversation with Achilles Thomas of Monster Transmission and asked him the following questions .
Have any of your customers ever associated your business with Monster Cable products ?
Absolutely Not .
Were you aware of Monster ’s litigious nature prior to being issued this lawsuit from them ?
No , in fact , I had never heard of them before .
Have they offered you an amicable resolution outside of the courtroom ?
No .
Here are a few links to the history of Monster Cable ’s bad litigious nature ..

Social networks : Data recorded - but not content Communications firms are being asked to record all internet contacts between people as part of a modernisation in UK police surveillance tactics .
The home secretary scrapped plans for a database but wants details to be held and organised for security services .
The new system would track all e-mails , phone calls and internet use , including visits to social network sites .
The Tories said the Home Office had " buckled under Conservative pressure " in deciding against a giant database .
Announcing a consultation on a new strategy for communications data and its use in law enforcement , Jacqui Smith said there would be no single government - run database .
Communications data is an essential tool for law enforcement agencies to track murderers and paedophiles , save lives and tackle crime
Jacqui Smith
Home Secretary
But she also said that " doing nothing " in the face of a communications revolution was not an option .
The Home Office will instead ask communications companies - from internet service providers to mobile phone networks - to extend the range of information they currently hold on their subscribers and organise it so that it can be better used by the police , MI5 and other public bodies investigating crime and terrorism .
Ministers say they estimate the project will cost £ 2bn to set up , which includes some compensation to the communications industry for the work it may be asked to do .
" Communications data is an essential tool for law enforcement agencies to track murderers , paedophiles , save lives and tackle crime , " Ms Smith said .
" Advances in communications mean that there are ever more sophisticated ways to communicate and we need to ensure that we keep up with the technology being used by those who seek to do us harm .
" It is essential that the police and other crime fighting agencies have the tools they need to do their job , However to be clear , there are absolutely no plans for a single central store . "
' Contact not content ' Communication service providers ( CSPs ) will be asked to record internet contacts between people , but not the content , similar to the existing arrangements to log telephone contacts .
REASONS TO CHANGE WHAT CAN BE KEPT
More communication via computers rather than phones Companies wo n't always keep all data all the time Anonymity online masks criminal identities
More online services provided from abroad Data held in many locations and difficult to find Source : Home Office consultation But , recognising that the internet has changed the way people talk , the CSPs will also be asked to record some third party data or information partly based overseas , such as visits to an online chatroom and social network sites like Facebook or Twitter .
Security services could then seek to examine this data along with information which links it to specific devices , such as a mobile phone , home computer or other device , as part of investigations into criminal suspects .
The plan expands a voluntary arrangement under which CSPs allow security services to access some data which they already hold .
The security services already deploy advanced techniques to monitor telephone conversations or intercept other communications , but this is not used in criminal trials .
Ms Smith said that while the new system could record a visit to a social network , it would not record personal and private information such as photos or messages posted to a page .
" What we are talking about is who is at one end [ of a communication ] and who is at the other - and how they are communicating , " she said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is a waste of time and money on an unprecedented scale Sean , Manchester Existing legal safeguards under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act would continue to apply .
Requests to see the data would require top level authorisation within a public body such as a police force .
The Home Office is running a separate consultation on limiting the number of public authorities that can access sensitive information or carry out covert surveillance .
' Orwellian ' Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " I am pleased that the Government has climbed down from the Big Brother plan for a centralised database of all our emails and phone calls .
" However , any legislation that requires individual communications providers to keep data on who called whom and when will need strong safeguards on access .
" It is simply not that easy to separate the bare details of a call from its content .
What if a leading business person is ringing Alcoholics Anonymous , or a politician 's partner is arranging to hire a porn video ?
" There has to be a careful balance between investigative powers and the right to privacy . "
DATA CONSULTATION

Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said : " The big problem is that the government has built a culture of surveillance which goes far beyond counter terrorism and serious crime .
Too many parts of Government have too many powers to snoop on innocent people and that 's really got to change .
" It is good that the home secretary appears to have listened to Conservative warnings about big brother databases .
Now that she has finally admitted that the public do n't want their details held by the State in one place , perhaps she will look at other areas in which the Government is trying to do precisely that . "
Guy Herbert of campaign group NO2ID said : " Just a week after the home secretary announced a public consultation on some trivial trimming of local authority surveillance , we have this : a proposal for powers more intrusive than any police state in history .
" Ministers are making a distinction between content and communications data into sound - bite of the year .
But it is spurious .
" Officials from dozens of departments and quangos could know what you read online , and who all your friends are , who you emailed , when , and where you were when you did so - all without a warrant . "
The consultation runs until 20 July 2009 .

Many people consider the CPAN the shining gem of Perl 5 .
As of this writing , it contains more than 53,000 modules in more than 17,400 distributions with 7316 registered authors .
That 's a lot of code .
Many people outside of the Perl community do n't realize the implications for a centralized infrastructure which allows people to upload , install , read documentation , annotate , report bugs , request features , submit patches , and collaborate on improvements to every one of these distributions .
The CPAN is n't just a repository of freely - installable libraries .
It 's the hub which makes so many of modern Perl 's amenities possible .
First , a brief history lesson .
1987
Larry released Perl 1 in 1987 .
If you download Perl 1 source code ( you can build it today ) , you 'll see that it contained a rudimentary but working core test suite .
The separation of concerns evident between running tests and interpreting the results is still useful today in the form of the Test Anything Protocol .
1994
Perl versions 2 through 5 continued the language testing culture .
The core language had a self - hosted test suite ( and still does ) .
Many CPAN modules at that time used a program called h2xs to generate that boilerplate -- and part of the boilerplate was a program called test.pl which contained some " scary black magic -- do not edit " to set up a testing infrastructure .
1998
In 1998 , Chris Nandor and Graham Barr created a CPAN Testers project to run the test suites of CPAN distributions and report their results .
Remember this .
The 21st Century Testing Revolution
After the Perl 6 announcement in 2000 , Michael Schwern agreed to lead the QA working group .
He resolved to improve the coverage of the core test suite and the coverage of the core libraries ( which was less than optimal ) .
As part of this process , he wrote Test : : More and Test : : Simple to hide the black magic from users and to make tests easier to write .
This started a revolution , but the world changed when he refused to add features to Test :: More , claiming that it was more important for people to write their own testing modules .
At his suggestion , I extracted the reusable logic from Test :: More and created Test : : Builder , which for the first time allowed multiple test modules to run in the same process and collaborate to produce TAP .
The revolution had begun .
Perl QA spent the next couple of years teaching people how to write good and comprehensive and working and useful test suites .
We quadrupled the number of tests in the Perl 5 core from the release of Perl 5.6.0 to 5.8.0 , and that number has only increased .
Can Your Language Community Do This ?
That brings us to the present day .
The CPAN Testers project is almost eleven years old .
According to the monthly CPAN Testers statistics , there have been over three and a half million reports posted .
Activity was low until late 2006 , when the number of test reports submitted exploded ( see CPAN Testers Statistics Graphs ) .
Though 3.5 million reports over eleven years does n't sound like a lot , the current testing rate produces well over a million reports a year ( perhaps closer to two ) .
There are even plugins for the CPAN and CPANPLUS distribution installation libraries to report any test failures when you try to install a distribution -- testing those distributions you need the most .
Anyone who uploads a distribution to the CPAN will have it tested on several hardware platforms , on multiple versions of Perl , and on multiple operating systems .
These reports are gathered and aggregated and displayed on the CPAN Search page for that distribution .
A related project also analyze the probability of a given distribution installing on your platform ( taking into account the reports for all of its dependencies , recursively ) .
Imagine knowing that your code works on platforms you can't access , because people who know those platforms have set them up to give you frequent and accurate feedback .
The Perl 5 language itself has daily smoke reports ( though not produced through CPAN Testers ) , as does the Parrot virtual machine and the Rakudo Perl 6 implementation .
All of the infrastructure and experience from testing Perl 5 effectively is going into the specification tests for Perl 6 .
Granted , the usefulness of all of this infrastructure depends on people using it and writing good tests , but I know of no other language community which has even attempted a project of this size .
Do you ?
The woman spent five days in Malaga after the row A mother who jetted off to Spain on holiday leaving her daughters home alone has been sentenced to 26 weeks in prison , suspended for 18 months .
The woman , 38 , from Pontypridd in Rhondda Cynon Taf , flew to Malaga after a row with her children , aged 11 and 14 , leaving them £ 30 for food .
She previously pleaded guilty to exposing the children to unnecessary suffering or injury to health .
She was sentenced at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court .
Judge Eleri
Rees told the woman , who can not be named for legal reasons , she could not " opt in and out of being a parent " .
The court heard she left her children for the impromptu holiday with the money and a cupboard full of food but with no arrangements for their care .
As it turned out , their grandmother stepped in to help and after five days paid for the mother to return from Spain .
Police were waiting for her at the airport .
Struggling
The mother said she was fed up with her children 's moaning and had become depressed .
Rhondda magistrates had previously heard she was a single mother struggling to bring up her family while working long hours .
The court was told the children were never in danger because she had two older daughters living nearby .
But the court heard she had made no specific arrangements for the care of the girls .
In an interview after the first hearing , the woman said she had apologised to her children .
" When I arrived home , the children were angry that I 'd left them .
I did my best to explain , " she said .
" But ultimately , how could I justify myself ?
How can you explain to a child why I had left them ? "
She said she had now asked for help , and her sister and mother had stepped in to lend a hand bringing up the two girls .
" My family are caring for them while I get my head together .
I 'm trying really hard , " she said .
" I 'm going to spend however long it takes making it up to my children .
I hope eventually they 'll forgive me . "

“ Who - cooks - for - you , ” cried the voice in the distance .
“ Who - cooks - for - you - all ? ”
My father and I , both standing in the road near the front of his pickup , pivoted in the direction of the call and leaned toward it , cocking our heads , straining to listen against the silence of the night in case the call came again .
“ Who - cooks - for — ”
“ Over there , ” my dad whispered , indicating with a slight nod of his head the stand of evergreens on the far shore of the lake .
Though it was two - thirty in the morning , I could see him clearly .
The full moon made the night iridescent .
From the opposite direction came another call , this one even farther off in the distance .
“ There ’s another one , ” I said in a hush .
My father tilted his head in the new direction but could n’t hear the second owl .
Overhead , the power lines sizzled in a vaguely insect - sounding way .
Something in the bushes across the road rustled .
The first owl called again .
More sizzling .
The soft clap of boots on pavement as my father walked across the road in the direction I ’d indicated .
We both strained to listen harder .
The second owl called again .
All the tension melted out of my father as he heard it , as though relieved that he was n’t losing his hearing and I was n’t losing my mind .
The barred owl , common through much of Maine , has a distinct pattern : “ Who - cooks - for - youuuu . ”
Our job , conducted for the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife in conjunction with the Audubon Society , was to make eight stops along a prescribed route through rural Penobscot and Hancock counties .
At each stop , we set up a large boom box on the hood of the pickup and played a CD of owl calls .
We then had to listen to see if any owls responded .
By making notes about which owls , and how many of each , we heard , we were collecting data for a longitudinal study of owl populations in the state .
Our CD featured the calls of barred owls , great horned owls , and long - eared owls .
Long - eared owls get their name from tufts of feathers that look more like tall eyebrows or horns than ears .
There might not even be any in this part of the state .
“ Over the years , I ’ve only heard one , ” my dad says , “ but this year some of the other owl surveys across the state have reported quite a few . ”
Saw - whets turn out to be the most common owls we hear this night .
They ’re migrating at this time of year .
“ The woods are full of them , ” my dad says .
We find our first one along another lake .
Its vocalizations sound like squeaky wheels going ‘ round in circles or a tiny chimpanzee going through Lamaze class .
Saw - whet owls are the smallest on our list — each is only about the size of a human fist — while great horned owls are the largest .
Full grown , a great horned owl can stand over two feet tall .
I also hear the warble of a loon come from somewhere out on the obsidian water .
“ First one of the year , ” my dad whispers .
From the corner of my eye , I catch movement on the lake .
“ What is it ? ” I ask .
My dad has trouble seeing it , which surprises me because he has owl - like night vision .
“ Probably just a stick , ” he says .
But then the moving thing makes a splash .
Could ’ve been a muskrat .
Or maybe the loon .
At another stop , we hear the preent of a woodcock — the thrumming call it makes as it spirals into the air as part of its mating dance .
For being mid-April , with temperatures in the low 40s , it amazes me how full of sounds the night is out in the middle of nowhere — and the insects are n’t even out yet .
They ’ll turn the night into a cacophony when they finally emerge .
We never see a single car , and we hear only a single truck , far off in some valley to the east of us as we sit astride the crest of a ridge .
But beyond human sounds , the woods are alive with noises — cracks and snaps and rustles and hoots and calls and loon cries and splashes .
At two stops , we hear the distant sound of a waterfall from one of eastern Maine ’s best trout streams .
At one of the stops , we also hear what ’s probably a coyote .
“ Yodel dog , ” my dad whispers ; I can hear the smile in his voice as he says it .
At home , with a highway just a half a mile east of my house , there ’s always a reminder of human company .
But I also live on the border of a huge state park , and there I can occasionally retreat to find the kind of noisy solace I find in the Maine woods .
There I can still listen the gurgle of a brook and the creaking of the trees and the hoots of an owl in relative solitude .
There are still plenty of quiet spots in my own neck of the woods .
Our owl expedition does n’t end until nearly sunup .
Our final tally : eleven owls — five saw - whets , five barred owls , and a single great horned monarch of the night forest .
When we get back to my dad ’s farm , we head off to our respective burrows for a few hours of sleep — the peace and quiet of bed a marked difference from the spectacular peace and quiet of the owl - filled night .
SANTA BARBARA , California ( Reuters ) - A wildfire that has destroyed dozens of multimillion - dollar homes and injured 10 firefighters burned unchecked through the central California foothills at the edge of Santa Barbara for a third day on Thursday .
Already 13,500 people have fled their homes in the hillsides surrounding seaside Santa Barbara , as 1,400 firefighters fought the fire , which was being investigated as an arson .
By mid-afternoon on Thursday , the so - called Jesusita fire had charred an estimated 1,300 acres , authorities said , and crews contending with nearly 100 - degree F ( 38 C ) temperatures and hot , dry Santa Ana winds made little headway in controlling the flames .
Authorities were concerned that the flames were edging toward the more populated downtown area and were keeping a wary eye on the winds , which typically pick up at sundown .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , who has spent recent days promoting wildfire safety throughout the state , visited the site of the first major fire of the year and said dozens of homes have been destroyed .
Another 3,500 remained threatened and authorities ordered 13,500 people to evacuate their homes , he said .
A few homeowners ignored warnings to flee and stayed behind in a bid to help save their houses and belongings .
“ I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO DIE ”

“ I did n’t want to lose my home .
It ’s that simple , ” homeowner Albert Lindemann told KTLA - TV news , adding that his house ultimately was saved by firefighters who arrived just in time .
“ I thought we were going to die , ” he said .
“ Until I started seeing those firemen coming in there , I did n’t think any human being could be out there . ”
The Los Angeles Times reported that search and rescue teams were able to save a group of middle - school students who had been camping in the backcountry and found themselves cut off by the fire .
Authorities said rugged terrain , thick brush and gale - force winds made it difficult to gain an upper hand on the blaze .
Winds died down overnight , allowing an aerial assault by water - dropping helicopters to continue round - the - clock .
As of Thursday , 10 firefighters have been injured , including three whose engine was overrun by flames on Wednesday while they struggled to save a home .
The three men were reported to be in serious condition at a Los Angeles burn center but expected to recover .
Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency for Santa Barbara County on Wednesday , a move that frees up additional funds and equipment .
The firefighting force also was beefed up overnight , growing from more than 900 personnel to about 1,400 , with additional helicopters and airplanes joining the battle .
In southern Arizona , fire teams said they were working to contain a blaze that torched three homes and burned 4,000 acres of mountainous grass and woodlands southeast of Tucson in recent days .
“ The fire is not advancing , ” Jonetta Holt , a spokeswoman for the incident management team said of the blaze near the city of Sierra Vista .
“ We have a line around it and we are working to secure it . ”
In November , more than 200 homes were destroyed in Santa Barbara and the surrounding communities in a brush fire that was blamed on a bonfire started by local students .

PARKLAND , Florida ( CNN ) -- Yorelle Haroush fled a million - dollar South Florida home this week , chased out , she said , by drywall made in China that 's emitting vapors that smell like rotten eggs .
Amy Massachi hugs her pregnant niece , Yorelle Haroush , as she prepares to move this week .
" It 's making me sick .
Physically , mentally and emotionally , making me sick , " said the 18 - year - old , who is pregnant with her first child .
Haroush lives with her aunt Amy Massachi and her four siblings and cousins in the house .
They believe a year 's worth of upper respiratory infections , antibiotics , bloody noses and sickness have been caused by the walls .
Their doctor said they need to get out of the $ 1.2 million estate in Parkland , Florida , northwest of Fort Lauderdale .
" I said , ' you ca n't stay there anymore , because you 're sick every minute , ' " the family 's longtime physician , Dr. Ross Nochimson , told CNN .
" They 're sick on a weekly basis .
Earaches , sore throat .
I give them something , and they 're sick again . "
Massachi and her family are among homeowners in more than a dozen states who allege Chinese drywall has emitted corrosive gases they believe have given them health problems .
Homeowners also allege the gases corrode metal components including copper wiring , causing air conditioners and other household systems to fail .
Read about homeowners ' allegations »
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says most of the complaints have come from Florida , where the concerns emerged last year .
But consumers also have filed complaints in Louisiana , Virginia , Wisconsin , Ohio , Alabama , Mississippi , California , Washington , Wyoming , Arizona , Tennessee and Washington , D.C .
The Florida Department of Health says complaints it received -- more than 330 as of Tuesday -- generally involve homes built between 2004 and 2007 .
A study done for the Florida health department by private laboratory Unified Engineering Inc. found that samples of certain Chinese drywall gave off a sulfurous odor from " volatile sulfur compounds " when exposed to extreme heat and moisture .
It also found that vapors " in the residential atmosphere created a corrosive environment in the presence of moisture . "
The health effects of those vapors are still the subject of several scientific studies .
Odors and corrosion are clearly evident in the Massachi house .
The pungent , rotten - egg - like smell permeates the two - story home .
Throughout the house , electrical outlets are open to reveal black corrosion on the copper wiring .
The air conditioning unit 's air handler , inside the house , is blackened .
" This is disgusting .
It 's so corroded .
I can't even believe it , " Amy Massachi said in a raspy voice .
" I can't breathe .
Every morning , I wake up with sinus allergies , my voice is hoarse .
Watch Massachi explain what 's happening in her house »
" My mother , when I call her up on the phone , she says , ' Amy , what 's wrong with your voice ? ' and I say , ' allergies . '
" ' What are you allergic to ? ' I do n't know .
Well , now I know .
I 'm allergic to my house .
My house is making us sick . "
The doctor recommends they vacate their 18 - month - old home .
" Before they bought this house , they were n't calling every week with allergies and sore throats and ear aches and coughing , " Nochimson said .
" I do n't know what more I can do for them . "
Haroush , who after giving birth faces heart surgery for an unrelated condition , is moving in with her grandmother .
" I 'm graduating this year , and I 'm having a baby , and I do n't need to be thinking about anything else going wrong , and any more stress that is on me , " she told CNN .
Chinese drywall was imported into the U.S. during a different economic era , at the height of a housing boom .
Prices were sky high , and the country was hit by two active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 , increasing the demand for home repairs .
Suppliers were forced to look elsewhere for their drywall supply .
Drywall , made from gypsum , is regularly imported from Mexico and Canada , according to the U.S. Department of Commerce , but during this time frame , the U.S. looked to China to make up for the shortage .
The Gypsum Association told CNN that enough drywall was imported from China to build 30,000 complete homes .
Most of the Chinese drywall , they say , ended up in southwest Florida during the housing boom , where it was used in new housing developments .
Some was also used in remodeling projects all over the country , so the number of homes affected is difficult to calculate .
The Consumer Product Safety Commission hopes to have more answers in the coming months .
They continue to test the Chinese drywall , including controlled tests in chambers and real - world air sampling tests in homes , to determine how the drywall interacts with other elements in an average house .
" We do n't deny there 's a problem , " spokesman Joe Martyak said .
But there has been no positive link to adverse health effects .
" We do n't know what it is that 's causing the sore throats or bleeding noses .
We have to find out what 's causing the problem , " he said .
The Environmental Protection Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are doing studies on the health effects , but those examinations are some time away from completion .
The Consumer Product Safety Commission is having ongoing conversations with Chinese officials , who will be sending a representative to the United States to study the problem .
" They appreciate the seriousness of the issue here and trying to be cooperative , " Martyak said .
A handful of Chinese companies have been sued by homeowners and home builders .
In the meantime , homeowners like Massachi face financial hardship .
" Now , because they have to move out for health reasons , they 're taking on a whole second ( rent ) payment , " said Massachi 's attorney , Michael Ryan .
Ryan said he's had no luck trying to convince Massachi's home lenders to suspend mortgage payments until the house can be made livable again .
He told CNN his clients are " having to make choices about their credit , and whether they are going to lose their home .
But they 're always going to pick their health first . "
Massachi agrees .
A good look at her blackened air conditioning coil was all she needed .
She 's looking to rent a new place .
" That 's what I 'm breathing in .... I'm a little freaked out now , honestly , " she said , her raspy voice cracking with tears .
" It ca n't be good , if that 's what that looks like and it 's pumping throughout my entire house , " she said .
Eighteen months ago , Massachi says , she moved into her dream house , surrounded by family and friends .
Now the dream is a nightmare .
" It 's worth nothing , " she said of the home .
" It 's exclusive .
It 's pricey , and now it 's worth nothing . "

DEPOSED PALESTINIAN prime minister and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh yesterday called for an immediate halt to the Israeli attack on Gaza , lifting of the siege and opening of all crossings .
" This war does not target just Hamas and the government , it is targeting Palestinians and their cause , " he stated in a televised address as Gaza 's death toll rose to 417 .
Some 2,070 Gazans have been wounded since Israel 's offensive began on Saturday .
Among the latest targets were the Palestinian legislative council building and a complex housing the ministries of health , education and transport , all facilities belonging to the Palestinian National Authority and built with donations from Europe and elsewhere .
Dr Ziad Abu Amr , an independent legislator from Gaza , said he and colleagues had made fruit - less protests against the " total destruction " of Gaza but there is international " complicity " with Israel .
He said these institutions will have to be rebuilt before governance can be restored .
A doctor who lives in Gaza city asserted , " We have never , never , never heard such explosions . "
His family survives by staying home .
They eat rice and vegetables .
Meat can not be stored because there is no electricity : " I managed to get a small bag of bread because the lady [ at the bakery ] had promised me a few loaves . "
His specialised clinic does not have equipment to treat wounded .
" They all go to the [ government ] Shifa hospital .
But it does not have the means to deal with all the casualties . . .
Many doctors and nurses cannot reach the hospital because of the bombing , " he said .
He planned to walk to his clinic to conduct emergency surgery , although he was uncertain whether anaesthetic was available .
Dr Mads Gilbert , a Norwegian physician who reached Gaza on Wednesday , said Gaza is a " complete man -made disaster .
It 's cold , there 's no food , no fuel .
At the main hospital [ Shifa ] all the windows have been blown out . "
At the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza , he saw two field hospitals and 30 tonnes of medical supplies waiting to enter Gaza .
He said the Israelis are using outlawed fuel air bombs and depleted uranium warheads .
Many bodies are shredded and burnt .
While women and children comprise 25 per cent of the fatalities , they make up 40 per cent of the wounded .
" Civilians are the targets , they are the victims , " said Dr Gilbert .
Although the UN yesterday opened ration distribution centres for refugees for the first time in two weeks , humanitarian co-ordinator Maxwell Gaylard warned , " Without the violence stopping , it is extremely difficult to get food to people who need it .
We cannot assess where the most urgent needs are .
And it is too dangerous for civilians to leave their homes to seek urgent medical treatment , buy supplies and assist people in distress . "
Israel has to open goods crossings for wheat , grain and other basic foods to feed the 1.1 million civilians dependent on food aid and to allow fuel to flow .
" Gaza 's hospitals are facing their largest - ever trauma caseloads . . .
They must have reliable power . "
( CNN ) -- Google 's ambitious plan to offer a 3 - D street level view of communities across three continents hit a snag when angry residents of a UK village blocked the search engine 's camera car from photographing their homes .
Broughton , can be seen from the air on Google Earth , but not from the ground .
Fearing the appearance of their well appointed properties on the Web site would attract criminals scouting for burglary targets , villagers in Broughton , north of London , summoned the police after spotting the car .
" I was upstairs when I spotted the camera car driving down the lane , " resident Paul Jacobs told The Times of London .
" My immediate reaction was anger :
How dare anyone take a photograph of my home without my consent ?
I ran outside to flag the car down and told the driver he was not only invading our privacy but also facilitating crime .
" This is an affluent area .
We 've already had three burglaries locally in the past six weeks .
If our houses are plastered all over Google it 's an invitation for more criminals to strike .
I was determined to make a stand , so I called the police . "
Google 's Street View project to map 360 - degree images of roads and homes across the world has generated numerous complaints over privacy , despite automated software that blurs faces and car licence plates .
A Google spokesman , quoted by the UK Press Association , said : " Embarking on new projects , we sometimes encounter unexpected challenges , and Street View has been no exception .
" We know that some people are uncomfortable with images of their houses or cars being included in the product , which is why we provide an easy way to request removal of imagery .
Most imagery requests are processed within hours . "
The spokesman added : " We take privacy very seriously , and we were careful to ensure that all images in our Street View service abide by UK law . "
Hill of Crosses in Lithuania
The Hill of Crosses , Kryzių Kalnas , located 12 kilometers north of the small industrial city of Siauliai ( pronounced shoo- lay ) is the Lithuanian national pilgrimage center .
Standing upon a small hill are many hundreds of thousands of crosses that represent Christian devotion and a memorial to Lithuanian national identity .
The city of Siauliai was founded in 1236 and occupied by Teutonic Knights during the 14th century .
The tradition of placing crosses dates from this period and probably first arose as a symbol of Lithuanian defiance of foreign invaders .
Since the medieval period , the Hill of Crosses has represented the peaceful resistance of Lithuanian Catholicism to oppression .
In 1795 Siauliai was incorporated into Russia but was returned to Lithuania in 1918 .
Many crosses were erected upon the hill after the peasant uprising of 1831 - 63 .
By 1895 , there were at least 150 large crosses , in 1914 200 , and by 1940 there were 400 large crosses surrounded by thousands of smaller ones .
Captured by Germany in World War II , the city suffered heavy damage when Soviet Russia retook it at the war ’s end .
From 1944 until Lithuania ’s independence in 1991 , Siauliai was a part of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic of the USSR .
During the Soviet era , the pilgrimage to the Hill of Crosses served as a vital expression of Lithuanian nationalism .
The Soviets repeatedly removed Christian crosses placed on the hill by Lithuanians .
Three times , during 1961 , 1973 and 1975 , the hill was leveled , the crosses were burned or turned into scrap metal , and the area was covered with waste and sewage .
Following each of these desecrations local inhabitants and pilgrims from all over Lithuania rapidly replaced crosses upon the sacred hill .
In 1985 , the Hill of Crosses was finally left in peace .
The reputation of the sacred hill has since spread all over the world and every year it is visited by many thousands of pilgrims .
Pope John Paul II visited the Hill of Crosses in September of 1993 .
The size and variety of crosses is as amazing as their number .
Beautifully carved out of wood or sculpted from metal , the crosses range from three meters tall to the countless tiny examples hanging profusely upon the larger crosses .
An hour spent upon the sacred hill will reveal crosses brought by Christian pilgrims from all around the world .
Rosaries , pictures of Jesus and the saints , and photographs of Lithuanian patriots also decorate the larger crosses .
On windy days breezes blowing through the forest of crosses and hanging rosaries produces a uniquely beautiful music .

Update : Please also check the second part of Most Dangerous Roads in the World
It ’s hard to imagine how many dangerous roads there are .
When working on this post I studied about 10 resources to find out that there are over 50 dangerous and scary roads and these are just the most famous we ’ve heard of .
There are different factors of danger so it ’s really hard to say what roads are the most dangerous of all the dangerous roads in the world .
In our post today you will see the roads that are considered the most dangerous and that caught my attention because of the fact that the roads should n’t naturally be in those places .
What I mean here is that it looks like the Nature has created the borders that should n’t be crossed using huge rocks , steep slopes , stones , volcanoes but the human beings were so stubborn that they finally erected the roads and trails , but what we still ca n’t do is ensure the safety .
There ’s always the risk that something will happen but the risk has never stopped the human yet .

White Township resident Colleen McDonald heard a scream and in the next moment saw a coyote running off with her 6 - pound chihuahua , Mindy , in its jaws .
The incident occurred April 24 .
There are roughly 3,000 coyotes in New Jersey and the population is growing .
Fatal dog attacks are rarely reported ; coyotes are more likely to attack cats .
Coyotes also prey on livestock , particularly sheep .
A spokeswoman for the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife said conservation officers looked for , but were unable to locate , the coyote or Mindy .
She said McDonald was advised to hire someone to trap the coyote that wandered onto her property .
On Tuesday , a black bear was spotted roaming around Alpha and Pohatcong Township .

Michigan : 16 - year - old dies after police Taser shooting
By Tom Eley
16 April 2009
Last week , a 16 - year - old Michigan boy died after police fired a Taser “ stun gun ” on him .
Robert Mitchell fled police after a routine traffic stop Friday morning , in Warren , Michigan , an industrial suburb adjacent to Detroit .
Although Mitchell posed no danger , police pursued him on foot to an abandoned building in Detroit , where they claim they Tasered him once .
Mitchell was pronounced dead shortly afterward .
On Tuesday night at a meeting of the Warren City Council , family members and residents expressed outrage over the incident .
“ A nonviolent child is dead , ” said Charlotte McGlory , Mitchell ’s grandmother .
“ There was no crime committed .
He does n’t have a driver ’s license .
All he did was run .
We need to stop the use of Tasers . ”
Mitchell ’s family has approached an attorney and may sue the city for damages .
“ We ’re sick and tired of our young people dying at the hands of these policeman who are supposed to be professional , ” said Sandra Hienes of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality .
Warren Mayor Jim Fouts indicated the city would review the way the Taser gun is used by police .
“ Any time there is a tragic death you need to reevaluate .
We want to make sure we have a safe , crime - free city and balance that with no tragic , needless death , ” Fouts said .
Police and media accounts of the death have raised the question of why Mitchell , who was black , fled police .
Police , according to the Detroit Free Press , “ are left with a burning question : Why did he run ? ”
Mitchell was a passenger in the car , which police say had expired license plate tags , and had committed no crime .
Police violence , however , is a fact of life for black youth in the Detroit area .
It is possible Mitchell , who has been described as a “ special education student , ” ran out of fright .
For their part , the police have not explained why they felt it necessary to pursue him so aggressively when he posed no threat .
Warren Police Commissioner William Dwyer claimed Mitchell “ was violently resisting arrest , ” but did not explain how .
According to another police spokesman , the youth “ came down the stairs ” of the abandoned house and “ assaulted the officers . ”
Police have acknowledged that Mitchell was unarmed .
He was small , standing about five foot two inches tall ( 157 centimeters ) and weighing 110 pounds ( 50 kilograms ) .
McGlory ’s description of her grandson casts further doubt on the unlikely scenario provided by police .
“ Robert was shy .
He was learning disabled , ” she was quoted in candgnews.com as saying .
“ His chronological age was 16 but he was operating at like a 10 - or an 11 - year - old , so who knows ?
He was a little guy .
He was n’t a threat .
They seen he was n’t a threat . ”
“ I do n’t know how you handle a 110 - pound teenager when you have multiple officers , trained in defensive tactics , ” said Ron Scott , also of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality .
“ I think the question is whether or not there was even probable cause to chase the teenager into Detroit . ”
The police who chased Mitchell and fired the Taser were placed on two - day administrative leave and have since returned to work .
Mitchell is the second Michigan teen killed after being hit by a Taser in less than one month .
On March 22 , in the small town of Bay City , Michigan , 15 - year - old Brett Elder died after police fired a Taser on him .
Elder , who was white , was likely handcuffed at the time .
Like Mitchell , Elder was small of stature and suffered from a learning disability .
( See “ Bay City , Michigan : Fifteen - year - old dies after Taser shooting ” )
The Taser gun , also called an “ electrical control device , ” delivers a high - voltage shock to the victim ’s body through wires connecting it to a pistol .
The weapon overrides the body ’s nervous system , causing uncontrollable skeletal muscle spasms , disabling the victim .
The electrical current is supposed to last for five seconds .
The pain , victims say , is agonizing .
Police and advocates of the Taser claim that it averts police use of handguns .
However , evidence suggests that police may be tempted to use Tasers when no weapon or police violence is needed — for example , firing them into the backs of fleeing suspects , using them on those already arrested or otherwise under police control , and using them on allegedly “ uncooperative ” suspects , such as Mitchell .
In Mitchell ’s case , whether there might have been complicating medical factors may only be revealed by an autopsy .
Mitchell had asthma and was on medication for attention deficit disorder .
It is clear that Tasers can be lethal weapons .
A web site that keeps track of Taser - related deaths now counts 403 fatalities in North America since 2001 .
Amnesty International , along with a number of civil rights organizations , has called for a moratorium on the use of Tasers pending further scientific study of their effects .
One thing we ’ve been most excited about here at the Sunlight Foundation is the concept of Data.gov .
Due later this year , new federal CIO Vivek Kundra will release a new central repository for government data and research .
And while in this series we traditionally re-design federal websites , we thought we ’d actually take the opportunity to design data.gov right off the bat to show you all what we ’d like to see happen .
Here ’s what we came up with :
Why we did it :
Providing access to government data is one of the clearest ways to be more transparent — and it is our hope that Kundra and team nail this with Data.gov .
In order to do so , we ’re looking for these things :
Bulk access to data Accountability for Data Quality Clear , understandable language Service and developer friendly file formats Comprehensiveness
Only raw access bulk data can be completely transparent .
So we ’re looking for a http://bulk.data.gov akin to Carl Malamud ’s bulk.resource.org .
This will allow developers to browse through a raw directory listing of the judicial , executive , legislative branches as well as independent / miscellaneous / joint agencies and get compressed , bulk files of data via direct download .
Getting FEC data , for example should be as easy as clicking on “ Other ” ->” FEC ” ->” Contributions ”->2008_summary.tar.gz .
This first and arguably most important part of Data.gov does n’t need any design .
It needs to look like this :
Secondly , we want the ability for the public to comment and rate the quality of data government provides .
The public should be able to rate , review or comment on the data sets Data.gov publishes just like it does books on Amazon.com .
This will help Vivek Kundra and his team find slow patches and erroneous data faster than any form of government quality assurance process could .
So take an Amazon.com style approach to data :
Cataloging the data sources inside the Federal Government is not good enough .
Some data sources are simply just not up to par .
Data sets like FARAdb are simply unusable as they ’re being provided by the government to citizens .
But we also understand that change cannot happen overnight .
In order to make this the most efficient process possible , Government should rely on the customers of its data to pinpoint where the problems are .
A reviewing system for the provided data sets does just that .
We also do n’t think that Data.gov can exist without an editorial staff .
You need people to write about the data and explain the data that ’s being provided .
Let ’s face it , traditionally the federal government has mostly written in a voice that lawyers and government officials can understand , but take a look at Data. gov ’s closest equivalent right now : Fido .
In looking at the different data samples here , can you tell what any of them actually do ?
Could your mother ?
Of course not .
The very language that government uses is the antithesis of transparency , so use something like this to make it more friendly and understandable :
Data.gov should build real , practical descriptions for the data that data.gov provides .
It should speak to why each data set is important and beyond relying on the non-transparent federal - speak that is so often used .
It should feature data , blog about data , and perhaps even link off to interesting things that other people are doing with the data that comes from Data.gov .
But at the heart of this , at bare minimum , Data.gov has to do a better job of explaining the data than Kundra ’s first attempt at this , the DC Data Catalog .
Human understanding is n’t enough though , the data that is provided also needs to be understood by machines in formats that are common not only to developers but also to outside services like Google Earth or Microsoft Excel .
Data.gov should make it easy for everyone to get to its data in the format that they want .
That ’s the hardest part about building a real data catalog for the Federal Government .
You have databases out there that range from the 30 year old COBOL format at the FEC to the binary access databases that the FCC has been providing !
But in order for Data.gov to truly be successful , it has to take these different data sources and make them available in modern data formats that developers and machines can make sense of .
If Government makes these file formats standardized , and makes the forms that request them standardized too , then groups like Sunlight Labs can create helper classes that help developers automatically browse and interact with the data on a programmatic level rather than just browsing through a web interface .
Imagine if this is how you , the developer , interact with Data.gov :
Data.gov has to be comprehensive and timely .
While the Constitution calls for separation of powers , we do not believe that Data.gov , run by the Executive Branch of Government , should be limited to only Executive Branch information .
It should encompass all branches of Government and every independent agency .
( p.s. an OPML based list of all government agencies represented in the natural hierarchy of Government should be a data feed ! )
And it should constantly be growing .
When data is n’t available , people should be able to ask for it straight off the website .
And obviously those requests should be a data feed in and of itself .
Because this is a government site , we also had to think about how the regular public would interact with the site as well .
We made the navigation and search simple , hiding the more complicated asks under an advanced search button , and made the home page consumer friendly by adding a description and a dashboard of the newest and most recently - updated data available .
By having these things on the home page , it makes the site browsable and might help users discover data , even if they were n’t searching for anything in particular .
In the end , the purpose of the site should predominantly be about the data itself , and not about conclusions that may be drawn from it .
It should be clear , organized , and easy to use for anyone visiting the site .
So , here you have it , the big reveal of Data.gov :
The design of efficient systems for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen , driven by sunlight is among the most important challenges facing science today , underpinning the long term potential of hydrogen as a clean , sustainable fuel .
But man -made systems that exist today are very inefficient and often require additional use of sacrificial chemical agents .
In this context , it is important to establish new mechanisms by which water splitting can take place .
Now , a unique approach developed by Prof.
David Milstein and colleagues of the Weizmann Institute ’s Organic Chemistry Department , provides important steps in overcoming this challenge .
During this work , the team demonstrated a new mode of bond generation between oxygen atoms and even defined the mechanism by which it takes place .
In fact , it is the generation of oxygen gas by the formation of a bond between two oxygen atoms originating from water molecules that proves to be the bottleneck in the water splitting process .
Their results have recently been published in Science .
Nature , by taking a different path , has evolved a very efficient process : photosynthesis – carried out by plants – the source of all oxygen on Earth .
Although there has been significant progress towards the understanding of photosynthesis , just how this system functions remains unclear ; vast worldwide efforts have been devoted to the development of artificial photosynthetic systems based on metal complexes that serve as catalysts , with little success .
( A catalyst is a substance that is able to increase the rate of a chemical reaction without getting used up . )
The new approach that the Weizmann team has recently devised is divided into a sequence of reactions , which leads to the liberation of hydrogen and oxygen in consecutive thermal - and light - driven steps , mediated by a unique ingredient – a special metal complex that Milstein ’s team designed in previous studies .
Moreover , the one that they designed – a metal complex of the element ruthenium – is a ‘ smart ’ complex in which the metal center and the organic part attached to it cooperate in the cleavage of the water molecule .
The team found that upon mixing this complex with water the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms break , with one hydrogen atom ending up binding to its organic part , while the remaining hydrogen and oxygen atoms ( OH group ) bind to its metal center .
This modified version of the complex provides the basis for the next stage of the process : the ‘ heat stage . ’
When the water solution is heated to 100 degrees C , hydrogen gas is released from the complex – a potential source of clean fuel – and another OH group is added to the metal center .
‘ But the most interesting part is the third ‘ light stage , ’’ says Milstein .
‘ When we exposed this third complex to light at room temperature , not only was oxygen gas produced , but the metal complex also reverted back to its original state , which could be recycled for use in further reactions . ’
These results are even more remarkable considering that the generation of a bond between two oxygen atoms promoted by a man-made metal complex is a very rare event , and it has been unclear how it can take place .
Yet Milstein and his team have also succeeded in identifying an unprecedented mechanism for such a process .
Additional experiments have indicated that during the third stage , light provides the energy required to cause the two OH groups to get together to form hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) , which quickly breaks up into oxygen and water .
‘ Because hydrogen peroxide is considered a relatively unstable molecule , scientists have always disregarded this step , deeming it implausible ; but we have shown otherwise , ’ says Milstein .
Moreover , the team has provided evidence showing that the bond between the two oxygen atoms is generated within a single molecule – not between oxygen atoms residing on separate molecules , as commonly believed – and it comes from a single metal center .
Discovery of an efficient artificial catalyst for the sunlight - driven splitting of water into oxygen and hydrogen is a major goal of renewable clean energy research .
So far , Milstein ’s team has demonstrated a mechanism for the formation of hydrogen and oxygen from water , without the need for sacrificial chemical agents , through individual steps , using light .
For their next study , they plan to combine these stages to create an efficient catalytic system , bringing those in the field of alternative energy an important step closer to realizing this goal .
Participating in the research were former postdoctoral student Stephan Kohl , Ph.D. student Leonid Schwartsburd and technician Yehoshoa Ben-David all of the Organic Chemistry Department , together with staff scientists Lev Weiner , Leonid Konstantinovski , Linda Shimon and Mark Iron of the Chemical Research Support Department .
Prof. David Milstein ’s research is supported by the Mary and Tom Beck - Canadian Center for Alternative Energy Research ; and the Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for Molecular Design .
Prof. Milstein is the incumbent of the Israel Matz Professorial Chair of Organic Chemistry .
MPAA chairman Dan Glickman is currently searching for another job .
The Clinton - era cabinet minister has been head of the MPAA for the last four and a half years , but will be replaced in 18 months time because of his lacking performance .
By contrast , Glickman 's predecessor , Jack Valenti held the office for 38 years .
Glickman , head honcho at the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) , is in an unenviable position .
As head of the MPAA he helped lead the organization into a crusade against millions of people around the world , pushing strategies which can , and often were described as draconian .
Glickman ’s departure comes as many see current MPAA tactics starting to backfire .
In the important teen and twenties demographics the MPAA ’s messages are not getting through , and in many cases are driving resentment against them .
The negative PR generated by The Pirate Bay case , initiated after intense pressure was put on the Swedish government by the MPAA ( via the White House ) has also worked against them , as have various pushes globally to get ISPs to agree to a 3 - strikes ( or ‘ graduated response ’ ) policy .
Others claim that Glickman ’s leadership has been lackluster , his public speaking gigs ‘ bad ’ and ‘ boring ’ , and hint that the short contract extension is because of this .
MPAA ’s Dan Glickman speaking ( yawn )
Of course , there is also precedent for the head of the MPAA being let go after embarrassing or damaging public relations activities .
Glickman ’s predecessor , Valenti , retired not long after a showdown between the MPAA and studios over an MPAA screener ban in late 2003 .
In that case the MPAA backed down after a court injunction went against them , and before a massively damaging antitrust lawsuit could be brought .
In the last few years , the MPAA has become the source of much derision .
In choosing a successor for Glickman , the selectors will have to look hard to find someone able to bring the industry into the 21st century ( or even the latter half of the 20th ) and recapture the trust and credibility of the general populace .
Meanwhile , to Glickman , we utter the words made famous by MPAA member NBC , “ You ’re Fired ! ”
First I would like to introduce the notation that I use here .
The pointfree notation is good to see a program ( functions ) data flow and as composition of functions , combination of functions , if you prefer .
This style is characterized by not using variables in declaration of functions .
Haskell allow us to implement that notation natively .
The dual of the pointfree notation is the pointwise one .
A simple example of a function in pointwise style :
f n = ( n+2 ) * 10 -- pointwise
The dual in pointfree would be :
f = ( * 10 ) . ( +2 ) -- pointfree
Clarifications
First of all to define a function , for example , i can say :
, or .
I will assume that you are familiarized with infix notation , , and composition functions .
Types
For this post I need to explain the data type we will going to use .
In Haskell we define it by :
data Tree a = Node a [ Tree a ]
Let ’s create the same , but more convenient .
Consider the following isomorphic type for :
data Tree a = Node ( a , [ Tree a ] )
We could see as a the following function :
Node :: ( a , [ Tree a ] ) ->
Tree a
So typologically we have .
We use to define that two things occurs in parallel , like tuples do , so we can redefine it :
Now we can say that is isomorphic to .
This is something to say that and keep the same information without any change .
We represent that formally as : .
Anamorphisms
Let , , , be Inductive data types ( sets ) and , , functions .
is the anamorphism of if the diagram commute .
We use the notation to say that function in not generic , but only works for data .
The same happens with and .
We will write using the composition of , and functions .
That way we are breaking our problem in small ones .
So , in the end we will have the following definition for :
The function that we want is , and that function is over so we have :
ana :: ( A -> B ) -> A ->
Tree c
Type is .
Maybe this is n’t clear yet , let ’s start with function
function in
The function is responsible to create the isomorphism between and , so the code could be something like this :
inTree :: Tree a -> ( a , [ Tree a ] ) inTree = Node
In Haskell we represent the type as .
So , type is .
So by now , we already know the following unifications and .
So now our graphic is :
function
The function is also known as * gen* , here is where we said the step that pattern do .
This is the only function we need to take care , if this function is good , our problem is solved .
Now image that our problem is :
Suppose that the pair of positive integers ( v , p ) denotes the number of red balls ( v ) and black ( p ) that is inside a bag , the balls which are taking randomly , successively , until the bag is empty .
This is the point - wise version of the function we want to convert to pointfree using anamorphisms .
This function represent as a tree , all possible states of the bag over these experiences .

Tree ( Int , Int ) state ( 0,0 ) = Node ( 0,0 ) [ ] state ( v,0 ) = Node ( v,0 ) [ state ( v - 1,0 ) ] state ( 0 , p ) = Node ( 0 , p ) [ state ( 0 , p - 1 ) ] state ( v , p ) = Node ( v , p ) [ state ( v - 1 , p ) , state ( v , p- 1 ) ]
If we want that “ latex state $ became an anamorphism , we have to say that our type unify ( ) with , and became more restrict , and unify with .
A consequence of changing the co-domain of is changing the domain of it to .
We represent as .
Now we can be more specific with our graphic :
function rec
Here we have to get a function that co-domain is .
Probably the best is to pass the first part of the tuple ( part with type ) and the rest ( part with type ) is just a of the function .
So , now our graphic is :
As you can see , the second part of the co-domain of is the type of function :
So our final graphic became :
Now , we just have to define the function and apply them to our anamorphism of .
h :: ( Int , Int ) -> ( ( Int , Int ) , [ ( Int , Int ) ] ) h( 0,0 ) = ( ( 0,0 ) , [ ] ) h( v,0 ) = ( ( v,0 ) , [ ( v - 1,0 ) ] ) h ( 0 , p ) = ( ( 0 , p ) [ ( 0 , p - 1 ) ] ) h( v , p ) = ( ( v , p ) , [ ( v - 1 , p ) , ( v, p - 1 ) ] )
And this is it !
Now we can say that :

Cuttlefish make a tasty meal , but getting rid of all that nasty bone and ink can be tricky .
Not so for dolphins , who have been nicknamed the chefs of the sea after Australian researchers discovered them using elaborate preparations to turn the fish into a soft , chewy snack .
The scientists observed a wild Indo - Pacific bottlenose dolphin repeatedly performing a complex set of manoeuvres in the Spencer Gulf off South Australia .
First , on spotting her prey , the female flushed a cuttlefish out of the dense weeds where they generally hide , into an open area with clear visibility .
Adopting a vertical pose , head down and tail up , she pinned it to the sandy sea floor with her snout .
With a flick of her powerful tail , the dolphin then killed the fish with a rapid downward thrust that broke the cuttlebone .
Divers who were watching heard a " loud click " as the bone snapped , the research team reported in the online science and medical journal PLoS ONE .

Next , the dolphin expelled the toxic black ink that cuttlefish squirt at predators when attacked , lifting the dead fish high in the water and repeatedly whacking it with her snout to release thick clouds of ink .
Finally , it was time to get rid of the large , hard bone .
The dolphin dived back down to the sea floor , where she scraped the fish along the sand , stripping off the skin until the bone popped out .
And hey presto : an appetising morsel akin to calamari was ready to be tucked into .
During two underwater visits four years apart , the researchers watched the female – identified by a circular scar on her head – follow the same procedure no fewer than seven times .
And , having observed a number of pods from above the water , they believe this method of preparing the perfect cuttlefish meal is widely used by dolphins in the area .
" It 's a sign of how well their brains are developed , " a member of the team , Mark Norman , told The Canberra Times .
Dr Norman , the curator of molluscs at the Museum Victoria , added : " It 's a pretty clever way to get pure calamari without all the horrible bits . "
In the journal , he and his co-author , Tom Tregenza , of the University of Exeter , reported seeing clean cuttlebones bob to the surface as pods of dolphins passed , which suggested that " some or all of this behavioural sequence is not restricted to a single individual dolphin " .
Moreover , divers in the area – a cuttlefish spawning ground – had noticed other dolphins performing the same sequence of actions , described by the researchers as " impressive behavioural flexibility for a non-primate animal " .
An earlier study in 2005 in Western Australia provided the first evidence that dolphins are capable of group learning and using tools .
A mother was seen teaching her offspring to break off sea sponges and wear them on their snouts , like protective gloves , while foraging for food on the sea floor .
Other researchers have observed dolphins remove the spines from flathead fish before eating them , and break 3 ft - long golden trevally into bite - sized pieces .
Last year , a wild dolphin near Adelaide was seen teaching fellow pod members to walk on their tails – behaviour normally picked up only after training in captivity .
One of the group had spent a brief period in a dolphinarium 20 years ago and may have learnt the trick there .
However , scientists were struck by the way the mammals appeared to have developed a shared " tail - walking culture " .
How good are you at getting something to good enough ?
It turns out that , in many cases , learning to get their creations to good enough is what separates people who thrive in Project World from those who do n’t .
Imagine that the quality of ideas or products is laid on a continuum .
On one end of the continuum is crap .
Not just bad ideas , but genuine crap .
On the other end of the continuum is perfection .
No one wants to produce crap and few actually do ; everyone wants to produce a perfect creation and no one actually does .
Here ’s what I ’m starting to see , both in my own creations and by reading about the creative processes of others : it ’s impossible to get an idea to the excellent stage in a vacuum .
The best we can get to on our own is good enough .
I ’ll take a second to describe the points along this continuum .
First , there ’s the Okay point .
Creations at the Okay level are just that – they ’re neither good nor bad .
For one reason or the other , they need more work .
What separates this point from the next is that it ’s often clear what needs to be done to make the creation better .
Unfortunately , this is where most half - done projects get stuck , and since they ’re stuck here , they do n’t get to …
The Good Enough point .
This is the point at which you ’ve pushed past okay and you know the creation is not quite there , but either you have no idea how to get it there or you ’re not sure which path you should take to get it there .
The Good Enough point may manifest itself in the intro that wo n’t write itself .
It may be a function in the code that causes some problem on the backend that makes your program run slower .
It may be a color combination that seems close enough but not exactly complementary .
And sometimes it ’s just a jingle that we spend time on that , in the end , does n’t matter .
Most creative people do one of two things at this point : quit out of frustration or fiddle with the creation continuously .
Excellent creatives , though , are good not solely because they are particularly creative but also because they push the project through the creative red zone .
And they surround themselves with other creative peers , who then help them take that good enough creation to …
The Excellent point .
A creation at this level is the best it can be ; any more work on the product does n’t make it better – it just makes it different .
Most good creatives know when they ’ve reached this point with the product , though they still may have insecurities and creative doubt that prevent them from sharing the product with the broader world .
Or they ’re grappling with their perfectionism and do n’t realize that there ’s no such thing as the perfect creation .
( At least that mere mortals can create ; I ’m willing to keep theological options open . )
Why Stop At Good Enough ?
Since there is an Excellent point , and I ’ve told you how to get there , you may be confused about why I ’m stressing getting your work to good enough rather than to excellence .
Why stop there ?
Because that ’s the last point that we have within our own control .
Outside of that , we rely on friends , peers , and other people to push it along further .
Getting to good enough also lets you focus on surrounding yourself with creative friends who are focused on helping each other get better .
The terror of looking stupid in front of other people is far outpaced by the exhilarating thrill of connecting with people through what you ’ve created .
The truth is that the success that many creatives push for is gained only by embracing the prospect of failure and getting used to sharing our Good Enough stuff with people .
So , what can you do to get your projects to good enough ?
How many projects do you have at that stage , and whom can you share them with ?
Are you fiddling with a project – making it different but not better ?
Whatever you do , internalize this saying : “ Good enough and done is better than perfect and pending . ”
( Tweet this . )
Get it to good enough , let it go , and just get it done .
Power and Gender
Many years ago I took a sociology course which really turned out to be about anthropology .
Indeed the two disciplines are so close that Carleton U used to offer a 100 level course called “ Introduction so SocioAnthropology ” or something fairly similar to that .
Anthropologists roughly divide societies into basic groups by how they extract a living from the environment .
The basic groups are hunter / gatherers , horticultural ( take a stick , push it in the ground , drop a seed in ) , agricultural ( plows ) and industrial ( nomads exist off to one side ) .
What ’s interesting about this is that that with very few exceptions ( the Inuit are one ) hunter gatherer bands are the most egalitarian societies , by far – even more egalitarian than modern industrial societies .
Agricultural societies , on the other hand , are the least egalitarian societies in general .
My Prof at the time posited the following : the more a gender contributes the more powerful they are .
In typical hunter gatherer bands women account for 60 % to 70 % of the food – while the men are out hunting , they gather , and they gather , in fact , more food than the hunters bring in .
In agricultural societies , on the other hand , men do the plowing , and women are generally relegated to the home .
But this begs an obvious question , one I immediately asked .
If power is based on contribution , why are n’t hunter gatherer bands matriarchal ?
After all , the women are actually contributing not an equal amount of food – but much more than the men !
The answer was interesting , and I think , has a lot of truth to it .
Gatherers do n’t work in tight teams .
Hunters , as a rule , did ( remember , these guys did n’t have guns . )
So the men had stronger social ties than the women .
And it is true , in general , that wherever you see women with low status , they are kept from interacting much – from forming ties with other women , or even more so , with men outside their families .
In our own society , it is striking that when things go really bad it is often with women who have become practically house bound .
And it is also notable that the 50’s had women practically confined to the house .
None of this , really , should come as a surprise .
If you have the ability to produce more money , you ’ll be more powerful .
And who you know is one of the biggest determinants of how influential and powerful you are .
Simply mentioning that you are friends with a noted lawyer , or being known to hang out with powerful people , can make you money or scare off potential predators .
Not to mention give you leverage against an abusive spouse .
The housebound period then , that many modern women go through when they have their children , reduces their power both directly by reducing their earning power , and indirectly because it is often accompanied by a collapsing social circle .
Likewise the tendency of many to lose friends once they become married is something to be guarded against .
The general principles , however , suggest hope for those who prefer more egalitarian societies .
Because , in general information societies , should we manage to attain such , will increase the ability to maintain and extend social ties despite physical circumstances , and upper body strength will be even less necessary than it is now to earning a living .
The hangover of old attitudes , the glass ceiling and so on will still be there , but there should be more cracks in that ceiling , and more power and influence to use in combating those attitudes .
Originally published at the Agonist , or maybe BopNews .
One evening in late February 2008 , the famously steady winds of west Texas began to wane until , at last , hundreds of giant wind turbines were becalmed – their enormous blades slowed or stilled .
In just three hours , grid operators at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas watched wind power output fall by 1,400 megawatts – power needed to supply roughly 600,000 homes .
Following emergency procedures , a blackout was avoided by quickly cutting power to several industrial customers .
But the incident highlighted renewable energy ’s Achilles ’ heel : Intermittent solar and wind power requires backups .
It ’s not a big problem today with solar , wind , and other renewable energies supplying less than 3 percent of the energy needs in the United States .
Yet it could be a big problem in the not - so - distant future .
If wind power supplies 20 percent or more of the nation ’s power by 2020 , as a US Department of Energy study last year said it could , storing backup electricity becomes critical to grid stability , experts say .
“ Little attention has been given to massive electricity storage that is a key to making the use of renewable energy possible on a broad scale , ” wrote the authors of an American Institute of Chemical Engineers ( AICE ) report on mass power storage for the grid last year .
“ In America today , there is an almost total absence of public awareness of the need . ”
While the Obama administration presses to expand renewable energy with emphasis on growing wind farms and utility - scale solar , these efforts could vastly increase the need to build new backup power plants – much of which today involves firing up natural - gas turbines when the winds die down .
The only way to avoid using fossil fuels is to develop grid storage .
Without the ability to store massive amounts of energy , “ renewable power can only be piggybacked onto the US grid to supply not more than 15 percent of the power at best , ” the AICE study says .
Yet the potential costs of building the storage necessary to allow renewable energy to expand to supply just 20 percent of US energy needs would be enormous – more than $ 340 billion to develop some 912 billion watt - hours of storage capacity , the AICE study found .
“ How you store energy from wind at times when it ’s not needed – and what you do when the wind stops blowing – is emerging as something that must be discussed and studied , ” agrees William Smyrl , a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who is studying the issue .
Need for batteries rises
Storing cheap power on the grid and then selling it at peak times , when power is more expensive , is hardly a new idea .
A handful of grid - power storage facilities across the country , including battery banks , have been set up .
But the cost performance of such facilities has never been good enough for them to take off .
Yet recognition of the need is growing quickly among utilities .
“ Storage will need to be part of our portfolio if going to 15 to 20 percent wind at a national level , otherwise it wo n’t be efficient at a lower level , and it wo n’t get us where we want to go environmentally , ” says Arshad Mansoor , vice president for power delivery and utilization for the California - based Electric Power Research Institute , the research arm of the utility industry .
The grid has more than 22,000 megawatts of “ pumped hydro ” storage capacity to capture excess energy from hydro- electric dams , Dr. Mansoor says .
But with environmental concerns and limited sites to build them , few see pumped hydro as a major new alternative , he says .
Conventional lead - acid batteries are too costly and have poor durability .
Instead , researchers are turning to batteries with unusual chemical combinations , such as sodium - sulfur as well as the more familiar lithium - ion .
Energy experts are also eyeing other energy technologies such as compressed - air energy storage , flywheels , and molten salts that store power generated by solar - power plants .
“ What we need is large - scale storage in the gigawatt range – and you do n’t get there using double - A batteries , ” Mansoor says .
Until recently , relatively little funding has flowed to grid - storage development .
In 2007 , the industry overall spent a relatively tiny $ 2 billion on energy storage at the utility level , according to a report last year by Climate Change Business Journal .
That ’s starting to change .
Before the recent financial crisis , venture investing in utility - energy storage had risen from about $ 300 million in 2004 to nearly $ 700 million in 2007 , according to Lux Research , a market research company .
“ It ’s still an incredibly hot market right now , ” says Brad Roberts , chairman of the Electricity Storage Association , a trade group in Morgan Hill , Calif .
He expects at least $ 200 million in new federal funding to accelerate development that languished with just $ 4 million to $ 10 million annually over the last 10 years .
Individual companies are accelerating their work , he says .
They include A123 , a company now producing lithium - ion batteries on trailers to supply ancillary power to utilities , as well as Beacon Power , another Massachusetts company developing flywheel - based systems to store grid power , he says .
The big utility American Electrical Power has deployed a sodium - sulfur battery system , too .
A few researchers and utility executives are also creating and deploying some of the world ’s most powerful batteries and other grid - backup systems to pick up the slack when energy generated by wind or solar wanes .
“ What I ’m talking about are batteries the size of a double - decker bus , ” says David Bradwell , a battery expert working on grid - scale batteries with new chemistries at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
While sodium - sulfur is a proven technology , it is still too expensive for mass power storage at around $ 400 per kilowatt hour , experts say .
Mr. Bradwell hopes to get costs down to about $ 100 .
“ These batteries could be deployed in a large - scale system over several square miles – or individually , maybe at the base of a wind turbine or at a wind farm , ” he says .
A working prototype in Minnesota
Dr. Smyrl , federal researchers , and utility executives are looking at the same renewable storage problem in Luverne , Minn. , where the nation ’s first wind - to - battery setup is using a small wind farm to charge batteries that release that power onto the grid .
These are n’t your ordinary flashlight batteries – but rather high - temperature , sodium - sulfur batteries the size of two semi-trailers that soak up 7.2 megawatt hours of power generated from seven nearby wind turbines owned by MinWind , a Minnesota wind - power developer .
Overseeing the project is Xcel Energy , the big Minneapolis - based utility that bought the battery from NGK Insulators , a Japanese battery supplier .
Smyrl and the others are focused on how much power the sodium - sulfur system can absorb , how quickly , at what cost – and then deliver it to the grid .
Xcel ’s interest is much more than academic .
Wind power already accounts for 6 percent of the power flowing on its system .
A year ago , Xcel ’s wind capacity was at 2,700 megawatts compared with about 3,000 megawatts today – it hopes to double that amount by 2020 .
Congress is also widely expected to pass legislation requiring utilities to derive perhaps 20 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2021 .
Even without federal legislation , however , state mandates in nearly half of the states already require a significant percentage of renewable power .
In Minnesota , where Xcel sells a lot of power , the state ’s renewable portfolio standard calls for 25 percent renewable power by 2025 .
“ The direction we ’re heading [ with the battery test ] is to meet these state mandates and hopefully going beyond them , ” says Frank Novachek , Xcel ’s director of corporate planning .
“ This will help put us in a very good position to meet whatever happens on a federal basis . ”

Scientology sued over human trafficking and coerced abortions
From a ANONYMOUS press release :
On April 2 , 2009 , Laura DeCrescenzo filed a complaint against the Church of Scientology International , claiming :
1. rescission of unlawful and fraudulent instruments ;
2. unpaid wages and breaches of labor laws ;
3. discrimination and invasion of privacy , including illegal use of lie- detectors on staff ;
4. human trafficking ;
5. intentional infliction of emotional distress ; and
6. obstruction of justice .
At age 10 , Laura was a full - time staff member .
At 12 , she left her home in New Mexico , without her parents , and moved to California to join Scientology 's elite Sea Organisation , signing a contract to serve for one billion years .
At 17 , Laura was coerced into having an abortion .
She was told that to have the child she was pregnant with would be " out - ethics " , a Scientology term meaning " unethical " , because it would interfere with her work for the Church .
Finally , in 2004 , Laura swallowed bleach to make the Scientologists think she was suicidal .
The ploy worked , and allowed Laura to escape without undergoing the lengthy and tortuous procedure of " routing out " .
The suit comes as a further blow to the Church of Scientology following suits alleging labor law violations issued in January 2009 by Marc and Claire Headley .

The poll found Brits want a referendum on further integration .
On the day of the Daily Politics ' Europe special broadcast live from Brussels , an exclusive poll for the programme found a majority would like Britain to leave the European Union .
When asked in the poll if Britain should leave the EU but maintain close trading links , 55 % agreed with 41 % disagreeing .
Despite the strength of the Euro against the pound there was little appetite for Britain joining the single currency .
When asked if the current economic crisis has made people more likely to join the Euro , only 31 % agreed with 64 % disagreeing .
On the question of whether Britain benefits overall from membership of the European Union in terms of jobs and trade only 44 % agreed with 51 % disagreeing .

Someone in the #haskell IRC channel mentioned the “ reverse state monad ” explaining that it used the state from the next computation and passed it to the previous one .
Well , I just had to try this !
First , a demonstration : we will compute the fibonacci numbers by starting with them and mapping them back to the empty list .
-- cumulativeSums [ 1,2,3,4,5 ] = [ 0,1,3,6,10,15 ] cumulativeSums = scanl (+) 0 computeFibs = evalRState [ ] $ do -- here the state is what we want : the fibonacci numbers fibs <- get modify cumulativeSums -- now the state is the difference sequence of -- fibs , [ 1,0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13 , ... ] , because the -- cumulativeSums of that sequence is fibs .
Notice -- that this sequence is the same as 1 : fibs , so -- just put that to get here .
put ( 1:fibs ) --
And here the state is empty ( or whatever else -- we want it to be , because we just overwrite it on -- the previous line -- but we defined it to be -- empty on the evalRState line ) return fibs
And sure enough :
>>> take 15 computeFibs [ 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377 ]
And now the implementation :
newtype RState s a = RState { runRState :: s -> ( a , s ) } evalRState s f = fst ( runRState f s ) instance Monad ( RState s ) where return x = RState $ ( , ) x RState sf >>= f = RState $ \s -> let ( a , s ' ' ) = sf s' ( b , s ' ) = runRState ( f a ) s in ( b , s ' ' ) get = RState $ \s -> ( s , s ) modify f = RState $ \s -> ( ( ) , f s ) put = modify .
const
The important part is the definition of ( >>= ) .
Notice how the data ( a , b ) flows forward , but the state ( s , s ’ , s ” ) flows backward .
Today , President Obama formally unveiled his “ comprehensive , new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan . ”
While outlying little in the way of specifics , the president declared his intentions to continue the war ’s escalation and to continue to throw money at the problem .
The European Union appears to have been quite impressed with the vague posturing , declaring it “ very close to the European ideas about the mission , ” and pledge to increase the amount of money they ’re throwing at nation - building in the nation .
In the remarks , Obama took a page from the previous administration ’s book , in declaring the insurgents in the mountains of southern Afghanistan a threat to “ the safety of people around the world , ” and insisting that only his comprehensive new strategy can save everyone .
But , as is so often the case , the “ new ” nature of the strategy seems very much in question .
More troops , more money , more praise for the mission .
The president pinned the prior failures on lack of resources “ because of the war in Iraq , ” and even though that war is far from over , he remains optimistic that the latest so - called comprehensive strategy will succeed where all the other comprehensive strategies have failed .
Sometimes , nature 's best images are not taken with the best cameras and the largest objectives .
Sometimes all it takes is a load of elephant dung .
The results are cute , frightening , majestic , and always stunningly beautiful .

That 's what wildlife photographers Anup and Manoj Shah did in the heart of Masai Mara — a natural park in southern Kenya — for six months :
Disguise their digital cameras with elephant dung and grass to take these intimate , peeping Tom views on the life of twenty lions .
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
The rest of the mechanism was almost as low tech as the elephant dung used as camouflage :
An infrared beam that , when broken , fired up two digital cameras .
It seems simple , but according to them the important part was not the technology itself .
The key here was anticipating the movement of the lions as they roamed Masai Mara in order to prepare the photo traps .
As their work shows , they succeeded in both the technology and strategy parts , proving that technology — any technology — works at its best thanks to the intelligence of the people who use it .
You will be able to enjoy their amazing work in a new book coming in 2011 called The Lions of Mara .
Yes , books .
Those things made out of paper .

ACTIVISION AND BIZARRE CREATIONS TO REVOLUTIONIZE RACING GENRE WITH BLUR
Activision Publishing is set to revolutionize the racing genre with the debut of Bizarre Creations ’ newest project , Blur™ – the ultimate wheel - to - wheel racing action experience .
The game drops players into heart - pumping , electrified racing action with 20 cars on a track all targeting the finish line and [ shal ] battling [ / shal ] each other as they trade paint and collect intense power - ups , including the ability to blast other cars out of the way with huge bursts of energy , boost their speed , and more .
While controlling photo realistic [ shal ] cars [ / shal ] , gamers can use offensive and defensive attacks as they battle for the lead and careen through real - world track locations ranging from L.A. and San Francisco to the streets of Hackney , UK and the treacherous roads of Barcelona , Spain .
“ We did our homework and saw a huge opportunity to move beyond traditional racers and create a game completely focused on making racing ‘ fun ’ again , ” said Martyn Chudley , creative director , Bizarre Creations .
“ Blur delivers a new style of racing experience for all gamers , regardless of their experience , skill or genre preferences .
Everything the player does , both in their cars and with their cars , is a dramatic adrenaline rush ; it ’s a real blast ! ”
“ We know that racing can be fun for everyone , and we are excited to enter this genre with a game that keeps players in the pack and combines fun with intense racing battles , ” said Maria Stipp , EVP and GM of Owned Properties , Activision Publishing .
“ Bizarre Creations is one of the most creative studios in the industry with a rich heritage of top - rated racing games and we are excited to partner with them on Blur , which is set to break the mold of traditional racing games . ”
Beyond the action - packed racing filled with fast curves , sneaky alternate routes , hair - raising jumps and fully realised damage models that provide for spectacular crashes , Blur ’s narrative is presented through Bizarre ’s innovative new community - based interface , reaching far beyond the game itself .
This unique story - driving social network evolves dynamically as players compete in different races , make new friends , rivals and fans , and connect with other racers both in - game and in real life .
Looking beyond Blur ’s single player story , gamers can engage in competitive and team - based multiplayer races with up to 20 players online , or on a single console via 4 - player split - screen .
Bizarre is especially excited to introduce Blur ’s original social gaming experience – custom groups , where anyone can create unique multiplayer modes based on their favourite ways to play the game .
These new modes are immediately shared through Blur ’s social network , expanding the game in ways that are only limited by the gaming community ’s creativity .
Blur is planned for release this autumn for the Xbox 360® video game and entertainment system from Microsoft , PLAYSTATION®3 computer entertainment system , and the PC , and is yet to be rated by the BBFC and PEGI .
For more information on Blur , please visit the official game web site located at : www.blurthegame.com.
But despite the success in Ciudad Juarez , officials estimate that the Mexican cartels are already established in 230 American cities .
The gangs have been blamed for killings as far afield as Anchorate , Alaska , and Atlanta , Georgia , as well as 366 kidnappings in Phoenix , Arizona , last year alone .
Apple is more likely to bring the iPhone to Verizon once the cellular company deploys its fourth - generation network , claims Verizon 's chief executive .
That 's because Apple was never very interested in Verizon 's current CDMA
cellular standard , which is less popular among cellphone networks outside North America , Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg told The
Wall Street Journal .
Therefore , Verizon 's upgrade to 4G
in 2010 should rectify the issue .
Verizon will adopt a standard called Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) , which many domestic and international carriers plan to use for their next - generation networks as well .
For Apple , that should mean more potential iPhone customers and fewer troubles in terms of hardware production .
But wait .
Did n't Verizon say in 2007 that it rejected Apple 's iPhone , rather than the other way around ?
Then , Verizon complained about
Apple 's control over distribution , which is a non-issue now that iPhones are being sold in Wal - mart , Best Buy and AT&T stores .
Verizon also moaned about Apple 's desire to handle all the customer care — but that should n't be a problem anymore , either , since Apple is the big leader in the latest customer satisfaction survey .
Still ,
Verizon spurned Apple .
And Apple could lose face if it warms up to Verizon so easily after such an emphatic rejection .
We 're not satisfied that scoring the iPhone will be so easy for Verizon , but we definitely think it would be a wise , crucial move for Apple .
Below is a list of reasons why we think a deal makes sense .
If you agree , we encourage you to add your own reasons .
If you disagree , well , we welcome those comments , too .
Verizon 's Reputation for Its Superior Network
Let 's start with the obvious : Everyone will agree that Verizon generally has better call and data quality than AT&T .
Surveys say so , too .
Many Verizon customers resist the iPhone because they do n't wish to sacrifice reliable call reception and consistently zippy downloads .
We 're not taking sides here , but AT&T has the opposite reputation .
" Dropped calls " and " no signal " are phrases commonly heard when discussing AT&T 's service quality .
By expanding to Verizon , Apple will undoubtedly further its iPhone penetration in the United States .
__Sharing Is Caring
__AT&T will never , ever admit this , but its current 3G networks are evidently overloaded , due in large part to the iPhone 's booming success .
In August , Wired.com conducted a global study showing that iPhone data speeds were suffering on the U.S .
AT&T network , when compared to Europe 's fine - tuned 3G networks .
And several iPhone customers have been so dissatisfied with network issues that they filed lawsuits accusing Apple of making false advertisements about the iPhone 3 G 's performance .
Why not share the responsibility of carrying the iPhone ?
It 'll amount to less money for AT&T , but less trouble for Apple and less anguish for customers .
Better service equates to more satisfied customers and fewer lawsuits .
It 's your basic win-win .
Polygamy = More Control , Power
For manufacturers , working with multiple partners is strategically wiser than working with only one .
Take the iPhone 's components , for example .
Apple does n't rely on a sole supplier for each part of the iPhone ; it buys from various suppliers so one does n't have too much bargaining power .
If one partner is asking for too much money , you threaten to ditch it because you have multiple partners .
Simple , right ?
So here 's where a ménage à trois with AT&T and Verizon would be great .
Apple could potentially ask for a bigger slice of the pie when it comes to iPhone revenues , because it could threaten to leave either of them for the other .
Ultimately , this gives Apple more control over how it handles the iPhone .
And we all know how much Apple loves control .
Competition Is Good
Economics
101 : Throw Verizon into the boxing ring with AT&T , and both companies will likely reduce monthly costs for the iPhone for the sake of competition .
I 'm tired of paying $ 80 a month for my minimal iPhone plan , are n't you ?
And , again , cheaper monthly plans will attract more customers to the iPhone .
Even the naysayers might be tempted .
We 're going to leave you to continue this conversation .
Do you think Apple should work with Verizon to carry the iPhone ?
Whether it 's yes , no or maybe so , add your thoughts in the comments below .

E' ancora difficilissimo reperire una CPU Intel Core i7 920 nel rinnovato stepping D0 .
L'attesa comunque non dovrebbe scoraggiarci nè far crollare le nostre aspettative .
Dai risultati raccolti di seguito , prelevati dalla rete , avrete modo di saggiare le notevoli doti di overclock del nuovo stepping .
La seguente foto mostra in dettaglio l'etichetta della scatola contenente la CPU Core i7 920 nel rinnovato stepping D0 .
Possiamo notare la data ( 26 Febbraio 2009 ) e il Paese ( Costa Rica ) di produzione del sample .
Intel continua a menzionare una frequenza del QPI pari a 4.8 GT/s , anche se , come abbiamo avuto modo di notare in QUESTO articolo , in realtà le CPU 920 e 940 ( i modelli non " extreme " ) non engineering sample consentono di selezionare differenti velocità per la QuickPath Interface .
Possiamo facilmente identificare una CPU Nehalem i7 920 dalla dicitura " sSpec Number " , altrimenti nota come batch , riportata sia sulla confezione che sull ' IHS della CPU .
Lo stepping D0 è identificato dal batch SLBEJ , che consente di non confondere la nuova revision della CPU con quelle precedenti .
Secondo molte fonti le nuove CPU 920 con revision D0 si comportano molto meglio in overclock .
In particolare una percentuale maggiore di CPU D0 consente di raggiungere frequenze superiori a 4GHz .
A quest ' ultima velocità operativa , inoltre , sono necessarie tensioni di alimentazione spesso di gran lunga inferiori a quelle adottate in overclock sullo stepping precedente .
In parole povere , maggior overclock e minor overvolt : una proporzionalità inversa altamente desiderata dai clocker .
Abbiamo già accennato qualche tempo fa su InformaticaEasy i parametri tecnici principali forniti da Intel relativamente ai nuovi sample D0 : date un'occhiata QUI .
E' davvero difficile procurarsi , ad oggi , CPU i7 920 nel rinnovato stepping D0 .
Intel non ha infatti immesso ufficialmente tali CPU sul mercato , o comunque la loro rintracciabilità è davvero scarsa .
Per questo motivo online sono trapelate solamente pochissime prove di overclock relativamente al nuovo processore quad core a 45 nanometri .
Analizziamo di seguito alcuni interessanti screen di CPU - Z che mostrano di quanto è possibile portare fuori specifica , più o meno stabilmente , un sample D0 .
Il primo screen mostra il raggiungimento di una velocità molto prossima ai 4GHz in abbinamento ad una tensione di alimentazione pari a soli 1,184V .
Per raggiungere tale velocità di clock è stato abbassato il moltiplicatore a x17 , mentre la velocità del BClock ha raggiunto livelli stratosferici : ben 234 MHz .
La scheda madre adoperata per raggiungere questo risultato è stata una DFI UT X58 .
Altro risultato ottenuto : sempre con la stessa tensione di alimentazione utilizzata precedentemente , raggiungendo stavolta i 4GHz tondi .
A quanto pare i D0 consentono di andare ben oltre i 4GHz con Vcore irrisori .
Lo screen seguente mostra il raggiungimento dei 4,3GHz con una tensione di alimentazione pari a 1,344V .
Aspettiamo a stupirci : il bello arriva adesso !
Osservate la schermata inserita di seguito e noterete come sia possibile raggiungere i 4400MHz ( 4,4 GHz ) con BClock a 210MHz e Vcore pari a 1,376V :
Un secondo risultato molto simile ( 8MHz in più ) , stavolta però con Vcore portato a 1,4V :
L'ultimo screen è il più sbalorditivo : poco meno di 4,8 GHz " solamente " con 1,496 volt e BClock @ 227,5 MHz .
I possessori di un Core i7 sanno bene che i 130W di TDP sono destinati ad aumentare sensibilmente in caso di overclock , soprattutto una volta superati i 3.8 GHz .
Per questo si rende necessario un ottimo sistema di raffreddamento , affidandosi ad un dissipatore ad aria high - end oppure ad un sistema a liquido .
Con Nehalem è necessario spuntare alte frequenze ma al più basso
Vcore possibile , per ridurre i costi energetici e soprattutto le temperature : per questo è molto importante valutare , per un overclocker , la CPU anche in base alla tensione di alimentazione media necessaria per raggiungere la frequenza di overclock desiderata .
Sul forum XtremeSystems.org un fortunato utente è riuscito ad ottenere ben 16 sample di Core i7 920 stepping D0 evidenziando tensione di alimentazione necessaria , per ognuno di questi esemplari , necessaria affinchè vengano raggiunti stabilmente i 4GHz .
Si parte da un minimo di 1,192V ad un massimo di 1,28V ; il range è piuttosto accettabile : i valori di tensione ad una data frequenza di overclock hanno una bassa varianza .
Non preoccupiamoci molto quindi all ' atto dell ' acquisto di un 920 D0 : saremo quasi certamente fortunati nel raggiungere i 4 Ghz ad un Vcore accettabilissimo , sempre che il grafico riportato sia veritiero ...
Sugar Labs has launched the first beta release of Sugar on a Stick , a new version of the open source Sugar Learning Platform that is designed to boot on conventional desktop computers and run directly from USB flash memory devices .
The Sugar software environment was originally created for the One Laptop Per Child project 's XO laptop .
It offers a unique child - friendly user interface and includes an assortment of applications that are geared towards education and collaboration .
The platform is currently maintained by Sugar Labs , a nonprofit organization that was founded by former OLPC software director Walter Bender .
The organization is building a more inclusive and community - driven culture around Sugar development and is working to bring the platform to a broader audience of students .
The Sugar on a Stick ( SoaS ) initiative is part of a broad effort to simplify deployment of the Sugar platform and make it more accessible to students .
The developers aim to boost compatibility with off - the - shelf hardware and conventional desktop computers .
The goal is to provide a self - contained Sugar environment that students can boot from USB thumb drives and run easily at school or at home .
The SoaS beta , which was released on Wednesday , includes version 0.84 of the Sugar environment on top of the recent Fedora 11 beta .
It can be run from a 1GB USB thumb drive , which is also used to store the user 's data .
This allows the student to have a complete computing environment that is both persistent and portable .
" Sugar is perfectly suited for children in the classroom with its simple , colorful interface , built - in collaboration , and open architecture .
Sugar on a Stick lets you start a computer with Sugar and store a child 's data on the stick without touching the host computer 's hard disk , " said Bender in a statement .
The beta includes several new activities , such as the InfoSlicer tool , which can be used by teachers to assemble bundles of Web content that can be edited and packaged for offline use .
The beta also includes a new integrated IRC client and a command terminal .
I loaded the SoaS image in VirtualBox to test the new Sugar features .
It ran flawlessly and performed reasonably well during my tests .
I 'm particularly impressed with the new source viewing utility which will allow students to see and modify the Python code of the Sugar shell .
For advanced students , this could significantly reduce the barriers to getting started with Sugar activity development .
The platform offers several other very impressive tools to introduce young students to the basic principles of computer science .
The turtle graphics visual programming environment reminded me of my own childhood experiences with Logo and Basic .
I 'm also very impressed with the collaboration features , which are practically ubiquitous throughout the entire platform .
Sugar has matured significantly since the latest time that I tested the software .
The journal system , which serves as a replacement for a conventional filesystem , has also improved dramatically since prior versions .
Although the enhanced journal system is beginning to look promising , I still find it to be too unintuitive .
Sugar Labs is encouraging parents and teachers to start testing the beta with children .
Linux enthusiasts who want to contribute to the project are also invited to help with hardware compatibility testing , bug reporting , and many other tasks .
Developers can participate by contributing to the core platform or creating new Sugar activities .
Sugar Labs has launched a new website ( modeled after addons.mozilla.org ) for hosting activities .
Refer to the Sugar Labs wiki for instructions on how to download , install , and boot the SoaS environment .
( I overhear this odd exchange while shopping at a local used music store .
It takes place between the clerk and a woman with a heavy accent . )
Customer : “ I am looking for a CD of band called Wet Noodle . ”
Clerk : “ Wet Noodle ?
I do n’t think we have anything like … ”
Customer : “ You have it !
My grandson says he wants the CD of band Wet Noodle ! ”
( The clerk searches for the band on his computer , to no avail . )
Clerk : “ I ’m sorry , we do n’t have any record of any products by a band called Wet Noodle . ”
( I put one and one together and interject . )
Me : “ Ma’am , do you mean Limp Bizkit ? ”
Customer : “ Yes !
Some band like Wet Noodle or Limp Bizkit or some food ! ”

Google Chrome is using a client id variable in the file Local State which can be found in the user data folder of the Chrome installation .
This identification number is unique for every Chrome installation .
Privacy advocates are already warning users that the id can be used to create exact user profiles of a user 's actions when the Google Chrome is used .
Google has -- theoretically -- the option to look up that ID whenever necessary to link actions on the web or in the browser to a particular user .
It did not take long though before some users figured out ways to remove or alter the client id so that the collected data was useless for Google .
This article is going to highlight three different methods to edit or remove the Google Chome user id to make sure that no permanent data can be collected when the web browser is being used .
Users can check if the following methods work by viewing the contents of the Local State file when Google Chrome is running .
The client id should not be visible in the file if a program has been used to remove it .
Google Chrome portable :
The portable version of Google Chrome was developed by a long term reader of Ghacks .
Caschy is running his own ( German ) blog at Stadt Bremerhaven .
The current version of portable Google Chrome can be downloaded at his blog .
All that needs to be done is to unpack the contents of the download and run Chromeloader .exe .
A positive effect besides portability is the fact that every user will have the same id as long as they are starting Google Chrome using Chromeloader .
The client id in the Local State file should read FA7069F6 - ACF8 - 4E92-805E-2AEBC67F45E0 .
Google Chrome Anonymizer :
Google Chrome Anonymizer is a tool that has been specifically designed to remove the client id from the Local State file so that the submitted data cannot be used to identify a user over several surfing sessions .
The software program can be started from any location on the hard drive and alters the Local State file directly before starting Google Chrome afterwards .
This means that no client id is transferred to Google when using Google Chrome .
Update : Google Chrome Anonymizer is no longer available .
You can use a program like Chrome Privacy Protector instead which serves the same purpose .
Manual Edit of Local State :
If you do not want to use the portable version of Google Chrome nor the Anonymizer , then you can edit the Local State file directly and remove the client id entries manually from the file .
The problem with this approach is that Google is creating new client id entries if the entries have been deleted previously .
This means that you would have to edit the file manually every time before you are starting or closing Google Chrome .
The Local State file can be found in Documents and Settings \Profle Name \Local Settings \Application Data\Google \Chrome \User Data\ .
Update : Another alternative is to use browsers based on Chrome .
You can use Chromium for example , the open source core of Chrome , or a browser like Iron that has been specifically designed for that purpose .

The principal cause of man 's unhappiness is that he has learnt to stay quietly in his own room .
If our needs are not met , if justice is not done , it is because we are not prepared to leave our homes and agitate for change .
Blaise Pascal ( " the sole cause of man 's unhappiness is that he does not know how to stay quietly in his own room " ) could n't have been more wrong .
We do not starve , we are not arbitrarily imprisoned , we may vote , travel and read and write what we wish only because of the political activism of previous generations .
Almost all MPs will acknowledge this .
Were it not for public protest they would n't be MPs .
Yet , though the people of this country remain as mild and as peaceful as they have ever been , our MPs have introduced a wider range of repressive measures than at any time since the second world war .
A long list of laws – the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act , Terrorism Act 2000 , Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 , the 2005 Serious Crime and Police Act and many others – treat peaceful protesters as if they are stalkers , vandals , thugs and terrorists .
Thousands of harmless , public - spirited people now possess criminal records .
This legislation has been enforced by policing which becomes more aggressive and intrusive by the month .
The police attacks on the G20 protests ( which are about to be challenged by a judicial review launched by Climate Camp ) are just the latest expression of this rising state violence .
Why is it happening ?
Before I try to answer this , let me give you an idea of just how weird policing in Britain has become .
A few weeks ago , like everyone in mid-Wales , I received a local policing summary from the Dyfed - Powys force .
It contained a ­section headed Terrorism and Domestic Extremism .
" Work undertaken is not solely focused on the threat from ­international terrorists .
Attention has also been paid to the potential threat that domestic extremists and campaigners can pose . "
I lodged a freedom of information request to try to discover what this meant .
What threat do ­campaigners pose ?
I 've just been told by the police that they do n't intend to reply within the statutory period , or to tell me when they will .
I 'll complain of course , and ( in 2019 or so ) I 'll let you know the result .
But Paul Mobbs of the Free Range Network has found what appears to be an explanation .
Under the heading " Protect[ing ] the country from both terrorism and domestic extremism " , the Dyfed - Powys Police website repeats the line about domestic extremists and campaigners .
" In this context , the Force was praised for its management of the slaughter of what was felt to be a sacred animal from the Skanda Vale religious community in Carmarthenshire . "
You might remember it : this Hindu community tried to prevent Shambo the bull from being culled by the government after he tested positive for TB .
His defenders sought a judicial review and launched a petition .
When that failed , they sang and prayed .
That 's all .
Mobbs has also found a bulletin circulated among Welsh forces at the end of last year , identifying the " new challenges and changes " the police now face .
Under " Environmental " just two are listed : congestion charging and " eco-terrorism " .
Eco-terrorism is a charge repeatedly levelled against the environment movement , mostly by fossil fuel lobbyists .
But , as far as I can discover , there has not been a single recorded instance of a planned attempt to harm people in the cause of environmental protection in the UK over the past 30 years or more .
So what do the police mean by eco-terrorism ?
It appears to refer to any environmental action more radical than writing letters to your MP .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) now runs three units whose purpose is to tackle another phenomenon it has never defined : domestic extremism .
These are the National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit ( Netcu ) , the Welsh Extremism and Counter - Terrorism Unit and the National Public Order Intelligence Unit .
Because Acpo is not a public body but a private limited company , the three bodies are exempt from freedom of information laws and other kinds of public accountability , even though they are funded by the Home Office and deploy police officers from regional forces .
So it 's hard to work out exactly what they do , apart from libelling peaceful protesters .
I wrote a column in December about the smears published by Netcu , which described villagers in Oxfordshire peacefully seeking to prevent a power company from filling their local lake with fly ash as a " domestic extremist campaign " .
It also sought to smear peace campaigners , Greenpeace and Climate Camp with the same charge .
Netcu 's site went down on the day my column was published and has n't been restored since .
But we have only patchy evidence of what else these three unaccountable bodies have been up to .
They appear to have adopted the role once filled by Special Branch 's counter - subversion campaign , which spied on Labour activists , including Jack Straw and Peter Mandelson ( sadly the spooks failed to bump them off while there was still time ) .
But as Paul Mobbs points out in his new report on Britain 's secretive police forces , today the police appear to be motivated not by party political bias but by hostility towards all views which do not reflect the official consensus .
Mobbs proposes that mainstream politics in Britain cannot respond to realities such as global and national inequality , economic collapse , resource depletion and climate change .
Any politics that does not endorse the liberal economic consensus , which challenges the concentration of wealth or power , or which does n't accept that growth and consumerism can be sustained indefinitely , is off - limits .
Just as the suffragettes were repressed because their ideas – not their actions – presented a threat to the state , the government and the police must suppress a new set of dangerous truths .
By treating protesters as domestic extremists , the state marginalises their concerns : if people are extremists , their views must be extreme .
Repression , in a nominal democracy , cannot operate accountably , so the state uses police units which are exempt from public scrutiny .
I am sure Mobbs is right .
There is no place for dissenting views in mainstream politics .
I was told recently by a Labour backbencher – a respected MP untainted by the expenses scandal – that " if the door was open just an inch to new ideas , I would stay on .
But it has been slammed shut , so I 'm resigning at the next election . "
Our grossly unfair electoral system , which responds to the concerns of just a few thousand floating voters and shuts out the minor parties ; the vicious crackdown on dissent within parliament by whips and spin doctors ; the neoliberalism forced upon governments by corporate power and the Washington consensus ; the terror of the tabloid press – all combine to create a political culture which cannot respond to altered realities without collapsing .
What can not be accommodated must be suppressed .
The police respond as all police forces do ; protecting the incasts from the outcasts , keeping the barbarians from the gate .
The philosophy of policing has not changed ; they just become more violent as the citadel collapses .

Military allegedly pressured medical personnel to downgrade soldiers ' diagnoses John Byrne
Published : Wednesday April 8 , 2009
Print This Email
This US military officers pressured Army medical personnel not to diagnose soldiers with post traumatic stress disorder in an apparent effort to save money and reduce benefits , according to an investigation published Wednesday .
Interviews conducted by Mark Benjamin and Michael de Yoanna for Salon revealed that at least two Army medical personnel say they 've been pressured by higher - ups to avoid giving wounded soldiers post traumatic stress diagnoses .
Concerned that he had been misdiagnosed , an unidentified Army sergeant surreptitiously recorded his military psychologist as he told him " in a moment of candor " that he'd been advised to give him a lesser diagnosis .
" OK , " Fort Carson psychologist Douglas McNinch told the sergeant .
" I will tell you something confidentially that I would have to deny if it were ever public .
Not only myself , but all the clinicians up here are being pressured to not diagnose PTSD and diagnose anxiety disorder NOS [ instead ] . "
McNinch said Army medical boards were " kick[ing ] back " PTSD diagnoses , saying soldiers had not seen enough trauma .
" Unfortunately , " McNinch continued , according to the recording , " yours has not been the only case ... I and other [ doctors ] are under a lot of pressure to not diagnose PTSD .
It 's not fair .
I think it 's a horrible way to treat soldiers , but unfortunately , you know , now the V.A. is jumping on board , saying , ' Well , these people do n't have PTSD , ' and stuff like that . "
McNinch answered questions when contacted by the reporters but when told that they 'd obtained the tape , said he 'd deny that the conversations ever occurred .
Unfortunately for McNinch , they published the tape .
A second Army psychiatrist , recently retired but still employed by the government , also told Benjamin and de Yonna that he'd been told not to inform soldiers they had PTSD and instead diagnose them with disorders that " would reduce their benefits . "
" The psychiatrist said he would be willing to say more publicly about the cases and provide specific names , but only if President Obama would protect him from retaliation , " Benjamin and De Yonna wrote .
Why is the Army writing off PTSD diagnoses ?
A former Army psychologist who now chairs a Texas university psychology department explained :
" Each diagnosis is an acknowledgment that psychiatric casualties are a huge price tag of this war , " David Rudd was quoted as saying .
" It is easiest to dismiss these casualties because you can't see the wounds .
If they change the diagnosis they can dismiss you at a substantially decreased rate . "
Benjamin and de Yonna said they 'd contacted the Army and the Senate Armed Services Committee about the recording in which McNinch admitted he was being pressured by military brass .
Both declined to investigate .
More details , including that of the attack that left the anonymous sergeant traumatized , are available at Salon .

An Australian airliner was grounded after four baby pythons escaped from their container in the aircraft 's hold .
The snakes , just six inches long , were among 12 Stimson 's pythons being flown from Alice Springs to Melbourne .
At first it was thought the reptiles may have been eaten by the other snakes , but this was discounted after they were weighed on landing .
Passengers were transferred to other aircraft .
The jet was fumigated but the snakes ' bodies are yet to be found .
" They 're not endangered so a decision was made to fumigate ... if these snakes turn up they will be very much dead snakes , " David Epstein of Qantas said .
It is not known how the snakes - which can grow up to a metre in length - escaped from their container .
They were being transported in the cargo hold of the aircraft in a bag inside a plastic foam box with air holes .
The passenger aircraft returned to service on Wednesday .

The recent news that Regions Bank scored the worst of the nation 's 19 largest banks on the federal government 's stress tests reflected its bad loan decisions made during the economic boom .
Regions ' subsequent acceptance of TARP money , whether done willingly or not , meant that taxpayers would be involuntarily assuming that troubled bank 's risk when a free society would have required it to internalize these self - inflicted costs .
All told , it makes for a shameful episode for Birmingham 's last remaining Fortune 500 company .
Nonetheless , while wondering how things got this way , I came across an article by Regions ' chief economist , Bob Allsbrook , that might explain the nadir of this benighted bank .
In a Birmingham News op - ed on April 26 , Allsbrook wrote ,
Saving — in a general sense — can be a good thing .
It 's something consumers should have been doing anyway .
The problem today is money that is added to savings is money which is not spent .
This scenario is what we economists call the " paradox of thrift . "
Or what is good for the individual may not be good for the entire economy .
This money that is saved is not being spent on new clothes , furniture or other noncritical goods .
Or , if the money is spent , it is spent on cheaper , often lower - quality goods or services .
The decline in credit and the increase in savings are squeezing what small amount of after - tax income is available to consumers .
To stretch this amount , while consumers can't always stop spending , they can become thriftier about how they spend .
People still buy coffee , but they get it at McDonald 's instead of Starbucks , or they make it at home .
They are driving revenues at Wal - Mart , but not at department stores .
Such old - school Keynesian sentiment from a major bank 's chief economist is surprising , and it makes one wonder about the quality of economic advice Regions received in the earlier part of this decade , when much of the damage was being done .
If Allsbrook believes that savings is just something that " can be a good thing , " then I wonder where he thinks investment comes from .
It comes from saving , and saving is essential if the economy is ever going to recover and embark on a period of sustainable economic growth .
" The ' paradox of thrift ' is actually an essential liquidation process that characterizes economic corrections . "
One wonders how Allsbrook would explain the last real recession experienced in the United States .
That was in the early 1980s .
Like today , this was a recession that many were likening to a depression .
Like today , it followed several years of unrestrained Fed- injected credit .
The unemployment rate was in the double digits , as today 's would be if the government measured it according to the same standards .
The stock market was tanking .
Again , there were news stories emphasizing the end of capitalism and the need to reinvent America .
The Paul Volcker–led Fed responded by sucking liquidity out of the banking system , and forcing an increase in interest rates — a policy that is exactly opposite to that of today , resulting in what Allsbrook would call a paradox of thrift .
People certainly responded in ways expected by economists who know something about incentives .
They saved , and as it turned out , this was a very good thing , resulting in a pool of real savings that lead to long - term economic growth over the following two decades .
Much of this was sustainable growth because it funded investment that produced output that people saved to purchase .
This is in marked contrast with the unsustainable growth that results when the Fed simply injects money created out of thin air into the banking system .
This also promotes business investment , but since such investment is not savings - induced , the resulting output is not purchased .
The result is a boom followed by a bust that causes many economists — including many in the banking industry — to call for another round of new money , again created out of thin air , to start the process over again .
" Would the world have been a better place if a TARP - like entity allowed Enron to live to see another day ? "
Such is the process of boom and bust .
It explains why the dollar is constantly losing value — over a third during Alan Greenspan 's reign as Fed chairman alone .
What Allsbrook calls a paradox of thrift is actually an essential liquidation process that characterizes economic corrections .
This is a painful time as firms deleverage , abandon unprofitable product lines , reduce prices to sell off goods that were oversupplied during the boom , and reallocate capital from those uses not desired by consumers to those that are .
This also happened in the early 1980s and had it not , that decade would be remembered today as a replay of the economically sorry one it followed .
It does not bode well for our economic future that government today has been thwarting this process , motivated by equally outmoded Keynesian sentiments .
By bailing out industries , including key players in the financial industry , it needlessly prolongs the correction process , which is why I agree with Allsbrook 's sense , expressed later in his op - ed , that any economic recovery we might see will be anemic at best , and not likely until the end of 2009 , if then .
The economy is not sounder when extramarket force causes firms to survive when market forces would have otherwise shut them down .
Would the world have been a better place if a TARP - like entity allowed Enron to live to see another day ?
There is no paradox of saving !
We know better , which explains much of the public anger rightly directed at the corporate state today .
But this is mercantilism , not capitalism .
It is another example of the unintended consequences that follow economic planning , which in this episode centered on Congress and the Fed 's manipulation of the housing and credit markets .
While Regions will survive , its directors need to understand why credit - induced growth brings more long - term damage both to the economy and to its balance sheets than savings - induced growth .
The banks that understood this during this decade 's unsustainable boom are in better shape today , with more secure customers , happier investors , and no socialized risk .
It is a paradox , and a better one worth pondering .
The unfinished workprint of ' X - Men Origins : Wolverine ' that leaked just a few days ago has already made its way to the computers of more than a million BitTorrent users .
Unsurprisingly , the film leads our weekly chart of the ten most downloaded movies on BitTorrent .
Less than a week after 20th Century Fox ’s ‘ upcoming ’ blockbuster first appeared online , and three long weeks before the official premiere in the movie theaters , over a million people have already downloaded X - Men Origins : Wolverine via BitTorrent .
At the time of writing the film is also topping The Pirate Bay ’s Top 100 most popular torrents and is listed among the most popular search terms on other torrent sites .
In an attempt to keep the damage to a minimum , Fox has been sending out takedown notices to various torrent sites .
Most site operators are kind enough to take down the links , but new ones are already uploaded before the requests are processed .
Interestingly , most people think that the leak will actually do the movie good , as a poll among our readers indicates that 40 % would be more excited to see it in the movie theater or on DVD , even if they had downloaded it .
Only 6 % of the respondents believe that the leak will be detrimental to the film ’s success .

After capturing an expanded audience of senior citizens and adults that love Wii Sports you have to wonder who Nintendo plans on targeting next .
A patent filed today in the USA shows one scenario .
This patent is for a system of games designed for young children , defined by Nintendo as toddlers and pre-kindergartners , and / or people with disabilities .
Nintendo plans on capturing this market with a series of easy to control edutainment software that emphasizes skills like number recognition , color identification , reading / writing , and sound recognition .
Let ’s take a look at some of the example games Nintendo has in the application .
These are by no means final .
They are concepts Nintendo may modify , expand on or never use .
An animal matching game which teaches children about animals and how to interact with them .
Players click on the shadows and try to discern which sound which animal makes .
A number matching game designed to teach kids to count .
Mario actually speaks in this game with sound bytes to announce the numbers .
A letter matching game designed to teach children the basics of spelling .
In this example the apple , ant , and alligator all start with “ A ” so the player should pick A .
A variation of this game might have players pick a letter for the object that does not belong in a group .
A memory or concentration game .
The example has Pikachu cards that say his catch phrase “ Pika Pika ” connecting the TV show with the game .
Match two Pikachus and you win .
In you match Pikachu with a non-Pikachu tile he gets shocked !
A maze game that could have puzzles as roadblocks leading to the exit .
A matching game designed to teach children the shape of objects .
The sailboat has a triangular mast so it links with the triangle .
The dump truck has circular wheels and the jack - in - the - box is made of square faces .
Nintendo also wants to use their system to educate children about daily tasks .
The player character , in this case Mario , is on his day off from saving the Mushroom Kingdom in his house doing ordinary tasks .
This game acts as a life simulation of sorts where a player helps Mario as he ’s waking up to make his bed .
Motion control will be used to emulate grabbing the sheet and smoothing wrinkles with a slow horizontal motion .
Nintendo emphasizes they want to use familiar characters and specifically mention familiar Nintendo characters , television and / or licensed cartoon characters like Pikachu , Dora the Explorer , and Bob the Builder as examples .
A personal care mini - game where you learn about hygiene and help Mario brush his teeth .
This mini - game sounds rather elaborate since Nintendo wants to record the inclination angle of the remote and the speed to determine which teeth you ’re brushing and how effective you are .
A family interaction game where players walk into a library and “ meet ” their parent to read a book .
In theory , parents will play this game with their kids and read the “ book ” when text appears on the screen .
In this animal care game you interact with a virtual pet by feeding it with the right food , petting it , bathing it , checking for ticks , etc .
A gardening game with horticultural lessons .
Look out Gardening Mama !
A game centered around a family outing like going to a zoo to learn about animals .
Another outing takes players to an amusement park to learn about safety gravity .
A camping game teaches wilderness survival skills with mini - games like making a fire .
Nintendo believes these games or learning tools will help young children develop skills .
Forget the “ Nintendo abandoned core gamers ” mantra for a second and think if this plan will work .
A long time ago Sega tried to grab the young children demographic with the Pico which had a drawing board .
That did n’t work so well , but Nintendo has an elaborate edutainment plan with multiple concept games .
Can they capture another audience for the Wii with this strategy ?
A military jury has acquitted a US marine sergeant on charges of murdering an unarmed detainee during battle in Fallujah , Iraq .
The jury at Camp Pendleton , California , also acquitted Sergeant Ryan Weemer today of dereliction of duty in the November 2004 death .
The panel of eight marines who served in Iraq or Afghanistan returned the verdict after more than four hours of deliberations .
The marine from Illinois could have faced a maximum sentence of life in prison and dishonourable discharge if convicted of murder .
The maximum sentence for dereliction is six months in prison and a bad conduct discharge .
In closing arguments yesterday , a defence attorney said the 26 - year - old Weemer acted in self - defence .
A prosecutor recounted that Weemer said in recorded interviews that he shot the man and told a squad mate that he would have to live with that for the rest of his life .

WITH loudhailers hitched to the tallest palmyrah trees , Tamil - speaking soldiers of the Sri Lanka army had for weeks been urging civilians inside a dwindling strip of territory held by the rebel Tamil Tigers to break through their cordon and flee .
But since April 20th , when the army burst an embankment at Putumattalan , the authorities have been overwhelmed by the thousands pouring out .
The Tigers ' defences were less to keep the army out than to fence the civilians in .
The government had expected an exodus far smaller than the one which came , bringing 114,520 civilians in the next nine days .
Since January an estimated 190,000 have fled .
The UN's assessment that there were originally around 250,000 trapped civilians , dismissed as exaggerated by the government , now looks roughly right .
By the middle of this week , the UN was maintaining that 50,000 non-combatants remained in the Tiger - held areas , though the government said 15,000 - 20,000 .
The army , which after two years of pitched battles has cornered the rebels into a 5 km ( three - mile ) stretch of land , says it has slowed down the offensive because of the difficulty of distinguishing rebels from civilians .
They wear similar clothes .
As one soldier in Putumattalan puts it , the only difference is the terrorist 's weapon .
On April 27th Mahinda Rajapaksa , Sri Lanka 's president , said he had told the security forces to stop using heavy - calibre guns , combat aircraft and aerial weapons that might cause civilian causalities .
This followed the announcement by the Tigers the previous day of a unilateral ceasefire , promptly dismissed by Mr Rajapaksa as a ploy .
TamilNet , a pro-Tiger website , accuses the army of continued fierce shelling despite the claims of a halt .
The Tigers have tightened their net around the remaining civilians , as their only hope of escaping a full - scale military assault .
But some are still wriggling through .
Struggling to cope with a flood of weak , traumatised and often injured people , the government has called for urgent international assistance .
The UN , which launched a $ 155 m appeal for Sri Lanka in February , will raise its target higher .
Most of the displaced are crammed into 32 internment camps in Vavuniya , with some sent to Jaffna and Trincomalee .
On April 28th a spokesman for the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees said people at these sites had reached “ breaking - point ” .
Some unfortunates are staying out in the open , in sweltering heat .
Overcrowding is acute , and the UNHCR has asked the government to make more room available .
Conditions are certainly better than the hellish ones the civilians were enduring in the supposed no - fire zone .
But Mahinda Samarasinghe , the minister for disaster relief , has admitted shortcomings in the government 's response .
He said the real challenge was to resettle people in their villages as soon as possible .
Children are among the worst hit by the fighting .
An internal UN document reports that of 6,500 civilians killed since February , over 500 were children .
It estimates the injured at 14,000 , including more than 1,700 children .
The UN does not apportion blame for the deaths .
Survivors have confirmed that the Tigers executed or maimed some of those who tried to escape .
But activists argue that this does not absolve the army of its duty to try to spare civilians .
As one puts it , a democratically elected government is judged by higher standards .
Foreign aid is coming , but not without strictures .
While the army continues its relentless advance , the government is facing international calls for a ceasefire , even a temporary one , to allow trapped civilians to leave .
It is also battling criticism over its refusal to let a UN team enter the no-fire zone to make an assessment , and fending off charges of breaking humanitarian law .
Some of the fiercest criticism is coming from India , where Sri Lanka is an issue in the ongoing , month - long general election , especially in the Tamil - majority state of Tamil Nadu .
M. Karunanidhi , the chief minister there , this week called off a brief hunger strike when the Sri Lankan government announced the end of combat operations .
Heretically for a leading Indian politician , his predecessor and main rival , Jayalalitha , has called for a separate Tamil homeland , to be “ carved out ” of Sri Lanka .
Military victory for the Sri Lankan government seems tantalisingly close .
But it may pay a heavy diplomatic price .
One of the lean startup techniques I ’ll be discussing at this week ’s session at the Web 2.0 Expo is called continuous deployment .
It ’s a process whereby all code that is written for an application is immediately deployed into production .
The result is a dramatic lowering of cycle time and freeing up of individual initiative .
It has enabled companies I ’ve worked with to deploy new code to production as often as fifty times every day .
Continuous deployment is controversial .
Most people , when they first hear about continuous deployment , think I ’m advocating low - quality code or an undisciplined cowboy - coding development process .
On the contrary , I believe that continuous deployment requires tremendous discipline and can greatly enhance software quality , by applying a rigorous set of standards to every change to prevent regressions , outages , or harm to key business metrics .
( This criticism is a variation of the “ time , quality , money – pick two ” fallacy )
Another common reaction I hear to continuous deployment is that it ’s too complicated , time - consuming , or hard to prioritize .
It ’s this latter fear that I ’d like to address head - on in this post .
While it is true that the full system we use to support deploying fifty times a day at IMVU is elaborate , it certainly did n’t start that way .
By making a few simple investments and process changes , any development team can be on their way to continuous deployment .
It ’s the journey , not the destination , that counts .
Here ’s the why and how , in five steps .
Continuous integration server .
This is the backbone of continuous deployment .
We need a centralized place where all automated tests ( unit tests , functional tests , integration tests , everything ) can be run and monitored upon every commit .
There are many fine free software tools to make this easy – I have had success with BuildBot .
Whatever tool you use , it ’s important that it be able to run all the tests your organization writes , in all languages and frameworks .
If you only have a few tests ( or even none at all ) , do n’t despair .
Simply set up the CI server and agree to one simple rule : we ’ll add a new automated test every time we fix a bug .
Following that rule will start to immediately get testing where it ’s needed most : in the parts of your code that have the most bugs and , therefore , drive the most waste for your developers .
Even better , these tests will start to pay immediate dividends by propping up that most - unstable code and freeing up a lot of time that used to be devoted to finding and fixing regressions ( aka “ firefighting ” ) .
If you already have a lot of tests , make sure that the total time the CI server spends on a full run is a small amount of time , 10 - 30 minutes at the maximum .
If that ’s not possible , simply partition the tests across multiple machines until you get the time down to something reasonable .
For more on the nuts - and - bolts of setting up continuous integration , see Continuous integration step - by - step .
Source control commit check .
The next piece of infrastructure we need is a source control server with a commit - check script .
I ’ve seen this implemented with CVS , subversion or Perforce and have no reason to believe it is n’t possible in any source control system .
The most important thing is that you have the opportunity to run custom code at the moment a new commit is submitted but before it is accepted by the server .
Your script should have the power to reject a change and report a message back to the person attempting to check in .
This is a very handy place to enforce coding standards , especially those of the mechanical variety .
But its role in continuous deployment is much more important .
This is the place you can control what I like to call “ the production line ” to borrow a metaphor from manufacturing .
When something is going wrong with our systems at any place along the line , this script should halt new commits .
So if the CI server runs a build and even one test breaks , the commit script should prohibit new code from being added to the repository .
In subsequent steps , we ’ll add additional rules that also “ stop the line , ” and therefore halt new commits .
This sets up the first important feedback loop that you need for continuous deployment .
Our goal as a team is to work as fast as we can reliably produce high - quality code – and no faster .
Going any “ faster ” is actually just creating delayed waste that will slow us down later .
This feedback loop is also discussed in detail elsewhere .
Simple deployment script .
At IMVU , we built a serious deployment script that incrementally deploys software machine - by - machine and monitors the health of the cluster and the business along the way so that it can do a fast - revert if something looks amiss .
We call it a cluster immune system .
But we did n’t start out that way .
In fact , attempting to build a complex deployment system like that from scratch is a bad idea .
Instead , start simple .
It ’s not even important that you have an automated process , although as you practice you will get more automated over time .
Rather , it ’s important that you do every deployment the same way and have a clear and published process for how to do it that you can evolve over time .
For most websites , I recommend starting with a simple script that just rsync ’s code to a version - specific directory on each target machine .
If you are facile with unix symlinks , you can pretty easily set this up so that advancing to a new version ( and , hence , rolling back ) is as easy as switching a single symlink on each server .
But even if that ’s not appropriate for your setup , have a single script that does a deployment directly from source control .
When you want to push new code to production , require that everyone use this one mechanism .
Keep it manual , but simple , so that everyone knows how to use it .
And , most importantly , have it obey the same “ production line ” halting rules as the commit script .
That is , make it impossible to do a deployment for a given revision if the CI server has n’t yet run and had all tests pass for that revision .
Real - time alerting .
No matter how good your deployment process , bugs can still get through .
The most annoying variety are bugs that do n’t manifest until hours or days after the code that caused them is deployed .
To catch those nasty bugs , you need a monitoring platform that can let you know when things have gone awry , and get a human being involved in debugging them .
To start , I recommend a system like the open source nagios .
Out of the box , it can monitor basic system stats like load average and disk utilization .
For continuous deployment purposes , we want to be able to have it monitor business metrics like simultaneous users or revenue per unit time .
At the beginning , simply pick one or two of these metrics to use .
Anything is fine to start , and it ’s important not to choose too many .
The goal should be to wire the nagios alerts up to a pager , cell phone , or high - priority email list that will wake someone up in the middle of the night if one of these metrics goes out of bounds .
If the pager goes off too often , it wo n’t get the attention it deserves , so start simple .
Follow this simple rule : every time the pager goes off , halt the production line ( which will prevent checkins and deployments ) .
Fix the urgent problem , and do n’t resume the production line until you ’ve had a chance to schedule a five whys meeting for root cause analysis , which we ’ll discuss next .
Largest Helicopter in the World
I like your article about the world 's biggest plane but wonder about helicopters too .
How are they ranked ?
By weight , length , or rotor size ?
Is the CH - 53 the biggest in the world or something else ?
- question from Henry Ott
1. Mil V - 12 : 231,485 lb ( 105,000 kg )
The largest helicopter ever built was a massive aircraft developed in the Soviet Union during the 1960s called the Mil V - 12 .
The V - 12 was a rather unusual test vehicle that featured two rotors mounted side by side at the ends of a large wing .
Each rotor had a diameter of nearly 115 ft ( 35 m ) .
The helicopter was so enormous that the distance from the edge of one rotor disk to the other was almost 220 ft ( 67 m ) , even wider across than the wingspan of a Boeing 747 !
Mil V - 12 , largest helicopter in the world
Even more remarkable was the lifting capacity of this powerful craft .
The V - 12 had a maximum takeoff weight of 231,485 lb ( 105,000 kg ) , nearly twice that of the second largest helicopter , and set a record in 1969 for carrying a payload of 88,635 lb ( 40,205 kg ) .
So massive was the V - 12 that this payload weight alone is greater than the maximum takeoff weight of the third biggest helicopter in the world !
These impressive figures have earned the V - 12 the record as the world 's largest helicopter according to the FAI and the Guinness Book of World Records .
Only two V - 12 prototypes were built , yet despite its amazing size and lifting power , the design was considered a failure by its manufacturer and Soviet authorities .
The V - 12 was simply too big and difficult to maneuver to be a practical machine .
A production model would have been called the Mi-12 , but these plans were cancelled following evaluation of the two test vehicles .
One of the V - 12 prototypes was retired to the Russian Air Force Museum in Monino while the second is kept at the Mil factory near Moscow .
2. Mil Mi-26 : 123,455 lb ( 56,000 kg )
Because the V - 12 had been judged unsatisfactory , Mil was again tasked with designing a large heavy - lift helicopter for military and civil use .
The resulting Mi-26 was far more compact than the V - 12 due to advancements in propulsion technology , making the Mi-26 much less cumbersome to operate .
With a maximum takeoff weight of 123,455 lb ( 56,000 kg ) , the Mi-26 is the world 's second largest helicopter overall and the largest ever to go into production as well as the largest flying today .

Though substantially smaller than the V - 12 , the Mi-26 carries a considerable payload up to 44,000 lb ( 20,000 kg ) .
The Mi-26 has proven much more powerful and efficient than its predecessors thanks in part to its eight - bladed main rotor .
This rotor is only 106 ft ( 32 m ) in diameter compared to the 115 ft ( 35 m ) diameter rotors used aboard other giant Russian helicopters but can lift greater loads due to improvements in engines and blade design .
Over 200 examples of the Mi-26 were built and the type remains in use throughout Russia .
Several have also been sold to civilian firms and foreign nations .
3. Mil Mi-6 : 97,000 lb ( 44,000 kg )
The third and fourth largest helicopters are also Mil designs that helped prepare the way for the V - 12 and Mi-26 .
The Soviet 's first attempt to create an enormous heavy - lift helicopter came during the mid-1950s with the introduction of the Mi-6 .
Designed for many of the same duties as the improved Mi-26 some 25 years later , the Mi-6 had a maximum takeoff weight of 97,000 lb ( 44,000 kg ) and could carry up to 24,250 lb ( 11,000 kg ) of payload .
The rotor used on the Mi-6 was the same 115 ft ( 35 m ) diameter rotor system that would also be used on the V - 12 .
Mil Mi-6 lifting a large payload
The Mi-6 was the world 's largest helicopter when it was first built and retained the title for many years until the appearance of the V - 12 .
The Mi-6 proved quite successful for its time as illustrated by the large number built .
Some 860 were manufactured between 1960 and 1981 primarily for the Soviet Air Force and the civil airline Aeroflot .
Additional models were also exported to several Soviet allies .
These helicopters remained in use for over 40 years but are finally being phased out .
In spite of its age , the Mi-6 still remains a remarkable vehicle and one of the largest helicopters ever conceived .
4. Mil Mi-10 : 83,775 lb ( 38,000 kg )
Yet another member of this related family of giant helicopters was the Mi-10 .
The Mi-10 was a specialized variant of the Mi-6 called a flying crane .
The Mi-10 borrowed the engine and dynamic systems of the Mi-6 but these were mounted within a new fuselage .
Unlike the wide Mi-6 fuselage that featured hinging doors for loading cargo internally , the Mi-10 fuselage was instead configured for passengers .
This fuselage stood atop four widely spaced , extended - length landing gear legs designed to straddle large , bulky payloads carried below the helicopter .

Both the Mi-6 and Mi-10 shared the same 115 ft ( 35 m ) diameter rotor that was also used aboard the V - 12 .
Compared to the Mi-6 , however , the Mi-10 had a reduced maximum takeoff weight of 83,775 lb ( 38,000 kg ) ranking it as the fourth largest helicopter ever built .
Only about 55 Mi-10 helicopters were made and the type saw relatively little use .
Both its flying crane mission and the transport duties of the Mi-6 have since been taken over by the far superior Mi-26 .
5. Sikorsky CH - 53E : 73,500 lb ( 33,340 kg )
Coming in as the fifth largest helicopter in the world is the biggest ever built in the United States , the Sikorsky CH - 53E Super Stallion .
The CH - 53E is an enlarged model of the earlier CH - 53 Sea Stallion .
Both vehicles were originally developed as heavy - lift helicopters for the US Marine Corps , and they have also been used by the Navy , Air Force , and allied countries .
The largest variant of the CH - 53 family developed so far is the CH - 53E with a maximum takeoff weight of 73,500 lb ( 33,340 kg ) .
Though comparable in physical dimensions to other H - 53 models with a main rotor 79 ft ( 24.1 m ) in diameter , the CH - 53E and related MH - 53E are equipped with an extra engine of increased power to lift a significantly greater payload .

Approximately 115 examples of the CH - 53E and MH - 53E Sea Dragon variant were built , and these remain the largest helicopters in military service in the West .
However , a new version of the venerable H - 53 design is currently under development .
Known as the CH - 53 K , this improved model will carry more powerful engines and new rotor blades to increase maximum takeoff weight to 84,700 lb ( 38,420 kg ) .
Once this enhanced variant becomes available , the CH - 53 K should narrowly beat the Mi-10 to become the world 's fourth largest helicopter .
6. Boeing Vertol MH -47E/G : 54,000 lb ( 24,495 kg )
The next largest helicopter is the Boeing Vertol CH - 47 Chinook also developed in the United States .
The H - 47 family began development during the late 1950s as an enlarged variant of the CH - 46 Sea Knight and has proven to be one of the most successful series of military heavy - lift helicopters .
The design features a long , spacious fuselage powered by two engines driving a pair of tandem rotors 60 ft ( 18.3 m ) in diameter .
The type is widely used for transporting troops , carrying heavy military equipment like artillery slung underneath the fuselage , and resupply missions .
Though the primary users are the US Army and British Royal Air Force , the CH - 47 has been sold to over 20 nations as well as civilian operators .
Tandem rotor design of the MH - 47E Chinook
The single largest versions of the H - 47 developed to date are the MH - 47E and MH - 47G special operations models .
While most CH - 47 variants have a maximum takeoff weight around 50,000 lb ( 22,680 kg ) , the MH - 47E/ G have been upgraded to 54,000 lb ( 24,495 kg ) .
Over 1,000 Chinooks have been built to date and production of newer CH - 47 F , MH - 47G , and HH - 47 models continues today .
7. Hughes XH - 17 : 50,000 lb ( 22,680 kg )
Coming in as the seventh largest helicopter is a unique prototype called the XH - 17 Sky Crane .
The Sky Crane was the first helicopter built by Hughes Aircraft , the same company that had also built the behemoth Spruce Goose flying boat during the 1940s .
Shortly thereafter , Howard Hughes became interested in helicopter technology and purchased a design for a giant transport helicopter from the Kellett company .
Similar to the Russian Mi-10 , the Sky Crane was equipped with four long landing gear legs to straddle large oversized payloads carried underneath the fuselage .
The H - 17 was lifted by a massive two - blade rotor system 134 ft ( 40.8 m ) across , still the record for the largest rotor ever flown .

Construction of a single XH - 17 prototype began during the late 1940s for use as a research vehicle .
The craft was completed by 1952 when it began a three - year testing period .
The maximum takeoff weight ever attempted aboard the Sky Crane was over 50,000 lb ( 22,680 kg ) during a flight in 1953 .
However , the research program concluded the design was too large and cumbersome to be useful and no further models were built .
Hughes also designed an enlarged variant called the H - 28 that would have doubled the maximum weight to nearly 104,000 lb ( 47,000 kg ) , but further development was cancelled following experience with the XH - 17 .
8. Sikorsky CH - 54 : 47,000 lb ( 21,320 kg )
Rounding out this list of large helicopters is another American design called the Sikorsky CH - 54 Tarhe .
Like the Mi-10 and XH - 17 , the CH - 54 was a flying crane helicopter designed to haul large payloads slung below the fuselage .
The unusual looking helicopter featured an upper spine containing the engines driving the 72 ft ( 21.9 m ) diameter main rotor .
At the front of this spine was the cockpit with windows facing both forward and aft allowing crew to monitor the payload .
This minimal fuselage structure made the CH - 54 a very efficient design compatible with various cargo modules that could be hoisted into position behind the cockpit for low drag .

With a maximum takeoff weight of 47,000 lb ( 21,320 kg ) , the CH - 54 was designed primarily for transporting military cargoes like artillery , ground vehicles , and other bulky supplies .
Its lifting capabilities were frequently used during the Vietnam War to move aircraft or recover downed planes and helicopters .
A civil model called the S - 64 Skycrane was also developed and became popular with the logging industry and for firefighting .
About 105 of these helicopters were built , and though retired from military service , several remain in civilian use .
Summary
Further illustrating just how large the helicopters described above are is the fact that no other helicopter exceeds a maximum weight of 35,000 lb ( 15,875 kg ) .
The majority of helicopters are indeed quite small next to these giants since there is relatively little demand for such enormous vehicles compared to more moderately sized designs .
Yet even among these giants , the size differential between them is hard to comprehend .
Relative size comparison of the V - 12 , Mi-26 , and CH - 53E
The above diagram compares the Russian V - 12 and Mi-26 to the American CH - 53E .
Despite its enormous size relative to any other Western helicopter , the Super Stallion almost seems a toy next to the two largest helicopters ever built .

The Spanish Revolution : 70 Years On
" The atmosphere then , the feelings were very special .
It was beautiful .
A feeling of -- how shall I say it -- of power , not in the sense of domination , but in the sense of things being under our control , of under anyone 's .
Of possibility .
We had everything .
We had Barcelona :
It was ours .
You 'd walk out in the streets , and they were ours -- here , CNT ; there , comite this or that .
It was totally different .
Full of possibility .
A feeling that we could , together , really do something .
That we could make things different . "
Anarchist militant Enriqueta Rovira [ 1 ]
The 19th of July , 2006 , marked the 70th anniversary of the start of the Spanish Revolution .
On this day in 1936 , the people of Spain took to the streets to fight a fascist coup started by reactionary Generals two days previously .
Across two - thirds of the country , they were successful .
After defeating the coup , they took the next step and started the most profound and far reaching social revolutions the world had ever seen :
" In Spain , during almost three years , despite a civil war that took a million lives , despite the opposition of the political parties . . . this idea of libertarian communism was put into effect .
Very quickly more than 60 % of the land was very quickly collectively cultivated by the peasants themselves , without landlords , without bosses , and without instituting capitalist competition to spur production .
In almost all the industries , factories , mills , workshops , transportation services , public services , and utilities , the rank and file workers , their revolutionary committees , and their syndicates reorganised and administered production , distribution , and public services without capitalists , high - salaried managers , or the authority of the state .
" Even more : the various agrarian and industrial collectives immediately instituted economic equality in accordance with the essential principle of communism , ' From each according to his ability and to each according to his needs . '
They co-ordinated their efforts through free association in whole regions , created new wealth , increased production ( especially in agriculture ) , built more schools , and bettered public services .
They instituted not bourgeois formal democracy but genuine grass roots functional libertarian democracy , where each individual participated directly in the revolutionary reorganisation of social life .
They replaced the war between men , ' survival of the fittest , ' by the universal practice of mutual aid , and replaced rivalry by the principle of solidarity . . .
" This experience , in which about eight million people directly or indirectly participated , opened a new way of life to those who sought an alternative to anti-social capitalism on the one hand , and totalitarian state bogus socialism on the other . " [ 2 ]
All across non-fascist Spain traditional social relationships between men and women , adults and children , individual and individual were transformed , revolutionised , in a libertarian way .
C.N.T. militant Abel Paz gives a good indication of this :
" Industry is in the hands of the workers and all the production centres conspicuously fly the red and black flags as well as inscriptions announcing that they have really become collectives .
The revolution seems to be universal .
Changes are also evident in social relations .
The former barriers which used to separate men and woman arbitrarily have been destroyed .
In the cafes and other public places there is a mingling of the sexes which would have been completely unimaginable before .
The revolution has introduced a fraternal character to social relations which has deepened with practice and show clearly that the old world is dead . " [ 3 ]
The social transformation empowered individuals and these , in turn , transformed society .
The Collectives
Across Spain , workers and peasants formed collectives and communes .
Industrial collectives were organised , based on " general assemblies of workers decided policy , while elected committees managed affairs on a day - to - day basis . " [ 4 ]
Augustin Souchy writes :
" The collectives organised during the Spanish Civil War were workers ' economic associations without private property .
The fact that collective plants were managed by those who worked in them did not mean that these establishments became their private property .
The collective had no right to sell or rent all or any part of the collectivised factory or workshop , The rightful custodian was the C.N.T. , the National Confederation of Workers Associations .
But not even the C.N.T. had the right to do as it pleased .
Everything had to be decided and ratified by the workers themselves through conferences and congresses . " [ 5 ]
Thus the individual collective was based on a mass assembly of those who worked there which nominated administrative staff who were mandated to implement the decisions of the assembly and who had to report back to , and were accountable to , that assembly .
A similar process occurred in agriculture .
Jose Peirats describes collectivisation among the peasantry as follows :
" The expropriated lands were turned over to the peasant syndicates , and it was these syndicates that organised the first collectives .
Generally the holdings of small property owners were respected , always on the condition that only they or their families would work the land , without employing wage labour .
In areas like Catalonia , where the tradition of petty peasant ownership prevailed , the land holdings were scattered .
There were no great estates .
Many of these peasants , together with the C.N.T. , organised collectives , pooling their land , animals , tools , chickens , grain , fertiliser , and even their harvested crops . . " [ 6 ]
Peirats also notes that in conducting their internal affairs , all the collectives scrupulously and zealously observed democratic procedures .
Gaston Leval summarises :
" Regular general membership meetings were convoked weekly , bi-weekly , or monthly .
. . and these meetings were completely free of the tensions and recriminations which inevitably emerge when the power of decisions is vested in a few individuals -- even if democratically elected .
The Assemblies were open for everyone to participate in the proceedings .
Democracy embraced all social life .
In most cases , even the ' individualists ' who were not members of the collective could participate in the discussions , and they were listened to by the collectivists . " [ 7 ]
Regional federations of collectives were formed in many areas of Spain .
The federations were created at congresses to which the collectives in an area sent delegates .
These congresses agreed a series of general rules about how the federation would operate and what commitments the affiliated collectives would have to each other .
The congress elected an administration council , which took responsibility for implementing agreed policy .
Martha A. Ackelsberg sums up the experience well :
" The achievements of these collectives were extensive .
In many areas they maintained , if not increased , agricultural production [ not forgetting that many young men were at the front line ] , often introducing new patterns of cultivation and fertilisation .
. . collectivists built chicken coups , barns , and other facilities for the care and feeding of the community 's animals .
Federations of collectives co-ordinated the construction of roads , schools , bridges , canals and dams .
Some of these remain to this day as lasting contributions of the collectives to the infrastructure of rural Spain . " [ 8 ]
She also points to inter-collective solidarity , noting that the " collectivists also arranged for the transfer of surplus produce from wealthier collectives to those experiencing shortages . "
From a purely economic viewpoint , production increased but , more importantly , this improvement in the quality of life included an increase in freedom as well as in consumption .
To quote the member of the Beceite collective in Aragon " it was marvellous . . . to live in a collective , a free society where one could say what one thought , where if the village committee seemed unsatisfactory one could say .
The committee took no big decisions without calling the whole village together in a general assembly .
All this was wonderful . " [ 9 ]
The revolution complete ?
The collectivisations allowed the potential creative energy that existed among the workers and peasants to be unleashed , an energy that had been wasted under private property .
The popular assemblies allowed social problems and improvements to be identified and solved directly , drawing upon the ideas and experiences of everyone and enriched by discussion and debate .
Self - management in collectives combined with co-operation in federations allowed an improvement in quality of rural life .
Unsurprisingly , anarchists are very proud of these achievements .
However , the formation of these worker - managed enterprises has sometimes led people to misconceptions about anarchism .
According to one group of libertarian Marxists " a popular idea amongst the Spanish working class and peasants was that each factory , area of land , etc. , should be owned collectively by its workers , and that these ' collectives ' should be linked with each other on a ' federal ' basis . . .
This basic idea had been propagated by anarchists in Spain for more than 50 years " and in 1936 people " seized the opportunity to turn anarchist ideal into reality . " [ 10 ]
Some even dismiss the whole experience as little more than " self - managed capitalism . "
The truth of the matter is somewhat different as CNT policy and social anarchist theory was not in favour of workers owning their individual workplaces .
Instead both argued for socialisation of the means of life by a system of federations of workplaces .
The idea of converting the worker - managed workplaces into co-operatives , operating in a market economy , had never been advocated by the Spanish anarchists before the Civil War , but was now seen by some as a temporary stop - gap that would solve the immediate question of what to do with the workplaces that had been seized by the workers .
As one CNT militant recalled :
>" Up to that moment , I had never heard of collectivisation as a solution for industry -- the department stores were being run by the union .
What the new system meant was that each collectivised firm would retain its individual character , but with the ultimate objective of federating all enterprises within the same industry . " [ 11 ]
The idea of collectives had not been advocated by most anarchists .
Rather , self - managed workplaces were seen as one step in a process of socialisation , the basic building block of a federal structure of workers ' councils .
They were not seen as an end in themselves no matter how important they were as the base of a socialised economy .
The collectives , then , were a product of the objective circumstances the CNT found itself in rather than anarchist theory .
This was recognised by anarchists before the Civil War. D. A. de Santillan , for example , had argued for " free experimentation , free show of initiative and suggestions , as well as the freedom of organisation , " recognising that " [ i ] n each locality the degree of [ libertarian ] communism , collectivism or mutualism will depend on conditions prevailing .
Why dictate rules ?
We who make freedom our banner , cannot deny it in economy . " [ 12 ]
In this he echoed Kropotkin and Bakunin .
For the former , it was " a whole insurrectionary period of three , four , perhaps five years that we must traverse to accomplish our revolution in the property system and in social organisation . " [ 13 ]
For the latter , the divergence of an actual revolution from the precise theory of anarchism expresses the nature of a social revolution :
" I do not say that the peasants [ and workers ] , freely organised from the bottom up , will miraculously create an ideal organisation , confirming in all respects to our dreams .
But I am convinced that what they construct will be living and vibrant , a thousands times better and more just than any existing organisation .
Moreover , this . . . organisation , being on the one hand open to revolutionary propaganda . . . , and on the other , not petrified by the intervention of the State . . . will develop and perfect itself through free experimentation as fully as one can reasonably expect in our times . . .
The development of each commune will take its point of departure the actual condition of its civilisation . . . " [ 14 ]
In other words , the anarchists recognised that its end goal libertarian communism would not be created overnight and different areas will develop at different speeds and in different directions depending on the material circumstances they faced and what their population desired .
Social revolution is a dynamic process and things rarely develop exactly as predicted or hoped in pre-revolutionary times .
The " collectives " in Spain are an example of this .
To denounce such developments in favour of ideal solutions means to misunderstand the dynamic of a revolutionary situation .
From Collectivisation to Socialisation
Initially , there were very few attempts to co-ordinate economic activities beyond the workplace .
This is hardly surprising , given that the overwhelming need was to restart production , convert a civilian economy to a wartime one and to ensure that the civilian population and militias were supplied with necessary goods .
Many anarchists were aware of the short - comings of what Gaston Leval , in his justly famous study of the collectives , later described it as " not . . . true socialisation , but . . . a self - management straddling capitalism and socialism , which we maintain would not have occurred had the Revolution been able to extend itself fully under the direction of our syndicates . " [ 15 ]
Leval in fact terms it " a form of workers neo- capitalism " but such a description is inaccurate ( and unfortunate ) simply because wage labour had been abolished and so it was not a form of capitalism -- rather it was a form of mutualism ( i.e. while wage labour , capitalism , was abolished the wages system -- payment for work done -- remained ) .
This dilemma of self - managed individual workplaces and lack of federations to co-ordinate them was debated within the CNT and a number of unions went beyond " collectivisation " and took over all the facilities in their industries , eliminating competition between separate firms .
This was considered to be a step in the direction of eventual socialisation .
The actual process in Spain towards socialisation was dependent on the wishes of the workers involved -- as would be expected in a true social revolution .
For example , the department stores were collectivised and an attempt to federate the stores failed to win support in the general assemblies of the collectives .
Joan Ferrer , the secretary of the CNT commercial union , considered it natural as " [ o ] nly a few months before , the traditional relationship between employer and worker had been overthrown .
Now the workers were being asked to make a new leap -- to the concept of collective ownership .
It was asking a lot to expect the latter to happen overnight . " [ 16 ]
Elsewhere , the debate went the other way .
Gaston Leval gives the example of Hospitalet del Llobregat :
" Local industries went through stages almost universally adopted in that revolution . . . [ I ] n the first instance , comites nominated by the workers employed in them [ were organised ] .
Production and sales continued in each one .
But very soon it was clear that this situation gave rise to competition between the factories .
. . creating rivalries which were incompatible with the socialist and libertarian outlook .
So the CNT launched the watchword : ' All industries must be ramified in the Syndicates , completely socialised , and the regime of solidarity which we have always advocated be established once and for all .
" The idea won support immediately " [ 17 ]
This process went on in many different unions and collectives and , unsurprisingly , the forms of co-ordination agreed to lead to different forms of organisation in different areas and industries , as would be expected in a free society .
A failure of Anarchism or Anarchists ?
As is well known , the C.N.T. co-operated with the other anti-fascist parties and trade unions on the Republican side ( ultimately joining the government ) .
This co-operation , more than anything , helped ensure the defeat of the revolution .
How did this happen ?
The key decision was made on July the 21st to not speak of Libertarian Communism until after Franco had been defeated , to collaborate with other anti-fascist parties and unions in a common front against fascism .
This , initially , involved the C.N.T agreeing to join a " Central Committee of Anti-Fascist Militias " proposed by the leader of the Catalan government , Louis Companys .
From this it was only a matter of time until the C.N.T joined an official government as no other means of co-ordinating activities existed .
The question must arise , why did the C.N.T collaborate with the state , forsaking its principles and , in its own way , contribute to the counter - revolution and the loosing of the war ?
Does the failure of the C.N.T to implement anarchism after July 19th mean that anarchist politics are flawed ?
Or , rather , does the experience of the Spanish revolution indicate a failure of anarchists rather than of anarchism , a mistake made under difficult objective circumstances and one which anarchists have learnt from ?
The latter answer is the correct one .
Rather than being the fault of anarchist theory , its roots can be discovered in the situation facing the Catalan anarchists on July 20th .
The objective conditions facing the leading militants of the CNT and FAI influenced the decisions they took , decisions which they later justified by mis-using anarchist theory .
What was the situation facing the Catalan anarchists on July 20th ?
According to the report made by the C.N.T to the International Workers Association :
" The CNT showed a conscientious scrupulousness in the face of a difficult alternative : to destroy completely the State in Catalonia , to declare war against the Rebels , the government , foreign capitalism , and this assuming complete control of Catalan society ; or collaborating in the responsibilities of government with the other antifascist fractions . " [ 18 ]
Jose Peirats notes that :
" According to the report , the CNT was in absolute control of Catalonia in July 19 , 1936 , but its strength was less in Levante and still less in central Spain where the central government and the traditional parties were dominant .
In the north of Spain the situation was confused .
The CNT could have mounted an insurrection on its own ' with probable success ' but such a takeover would have led to a struggle on three fronts : against the fascists , the government and foreign capitalism .
In view of the difficulty of such an undertaking , collaboration with other antifascist groups was the only alternative . " [ 19 ]
While the supporters of Lenin and Trotsky will constantly point out the objective circumstances in which faced the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution , they rarely mention those facing the anarchists in Spain on the 20th of July , 1936 .
It seems hypocritical to point to the Russian Civil War as the explanation of all of Bolshevism 's crimes against the working class ( indeed , humanity ) while remaining silent on the forces facing the C.N.T - F.A.I at the start of the Spanish Civil War .
Stuart Christie indicates the dilemma facing the leadership of the CNT at the time :
" The higher committees of the CNT - FAI - FIJL in Catalonia saw themselves caught on the horns of a dilemma : social revolution , fascism or bourgeois democracy .
Either they committed themselves to the solutions offered by social revolution , regardless of the difficulties involved in fighting both fascism and international capitalism , or , through fear of fascism ( or of the people ) , they sacrificed their anarchist principles and revolutionary objectives to bolster , to become , part of the bourgeois state . . .
Faced with an imperfect state of affairs and preferring defeat to a possibly Pyrrhic victory , the Catalan anarchist leadership renounced anarchism in the name of expediency and removed the social transformation of Spain from their agenda .
" But what the CNT - FAI leaders failed to grasp was that the decision whether or not to implement Libertarian Communism , was not theirs to make .
Anarchism was not something which could be transformed from theory into practice by organisational decree . . . [ the ] spontaneous defensive movement of 19 July had developed a political direct of its own . " [ 20 ]
This is not , we stress , to justify the decision but rather to explain it and place it in context .
Isolation , the uneven support for a libertarian revolution across Spain and the dangers of fascism were real problems , but they do not excuse the leaders of the libertarian movement for their mistakes .
The biggest of which were forgetting basic anarchist ideas and rejecting an anarchist approach to the problems facing the Spanish people ( unlike the rank - and - file of the CNT , who organised collectives , communes and militias in line with anarchist theory ) .
The fact is that the circumstances in which the decision to collaborate was made are rarely mentioned by Marxists , who prefer to quote CNT militant Garcia Oliver 's comment from over a year later :
" The CNT and the FAI decided on collaboration and democracy , renouncing revolutionary totalitarianism which would lead to the strangulation of the revolution by the anarchist and Confederal dictatorship .
We had to choose , between Libertarian Communism , which meant anarchist dictatorship , and democracy , which meant collaboration . " [ 21 ]
As Abel Paz notes , " [ i] t is clear that the explanations given . . . were designed for their political effect , hiding the atmosphere in which these decisions were taken .
These declarations were made a year later when the CNT were already far removed from their original positions
It is also the period when they had become involved in the policy of collaboration which lead taking part in the Central Government .
But in a certain way they shed light on the unknown factors which weighted so heavily on these who took part in the historic Plenum . " [ 22 ]
Most obviously , when the decision was made , the revolution had not started yet .
The street fighting had just ended and the Plenum decided " not to speak about Libertarian Communism as long as part of Spain was in the hands of the fascists . " [ 23 ]
The revolution took place from below in the days following the decision , independently of the wishes of the Plenum .
In the words of Abel Paz :
" When the workers reached their workplaces . . . they found them deserted . . .
The major centres of production had been abandoned by their owners . . .
The CNT and its leaders had certainly not foreseen this situation ; if they had , they had , they would have given appropriate guidance to the workers when they called off the General Strike and ordered a return to work .
What happened next was the result of the workers ' spontaneous decision to take matters into their own hands .
" Finding the factories deserted , and no instructions from their unions , they resolved to operate the machines themselves . . . the union leaders of the CNT committees were confronted with a revolution that they had not foreseen . . . the workers and peasants had bypassed their leaders and taken collective action . " [ 24 ]
As the revolution had not yet begun and the CNT Plenum had decided not to call for its start , it is difficult to see how " libertarian communism " ( i.e. the revolution ) could " lead to the strangulation of the revolution " ( i.e. libertarian communism ) .
In other words , this particular rationale put forward by Garica Oliver could not reflect the real thoughts of those present at the CNT plenum and so , in fact , was a later justification for the CNT 's actions .
Similarly , Libertarian Communism is based on self - management , by its nature opposed to dictatorship and , by definition , it is far more " democratic " than the capitalist state Oliver describes as " democracy . "
Juan Gomaz Casas ( an active F.A.I. member in 1936 ) makes clear :
" How else could libertarian communism be brought about ?
It would always signify dissolution of the old parties dedicated to the idea of power , or at least make it impossible for them to pursue their politics aimed at seizure of power .
There will always be pockets of opposition to new experiences and therefore resistance to joining ' the spontaneity of the unanimous masses . '
In addition , the masses would have complete freedom of expression in the unions and in the economic organisations of the revolution as well as their political organisations in the district and communities . " [ 25 ]
As such , the dilemma of " anarchist dictatorship " or " collaboration " raised in 1937 was fundamentally wrong both logically and in terms of why the decision to collaborate was made .
That Marxists repeat Garcia 's words shows how superficial their critique of anarchism and their knowledge of the Spanish revolution really are .
Unity from below
As can be seen , the rationales later developed to justify the betrayal of anarchist ideas and the revolutionary workers of Spain were created to justify a non-anarchist approach to the struggle against fascism .
Instead of a genuine confederal body ( made up of mandated delegates from workplace , militia and neighbourhood assemblies ) the C.N.T. created a body which was not accountable to , nor could reflect the ideas of , ordinary working class people expressed in their assemblies .
The state and government was not abolished by self - management , only ignored .
Collaboration with the state ensured that a federation of workers ' associations could not be created to co-ordinate the struggle against fascism and the social revolution .
As Stuart Christie argues , " [ b ] y imposing their leadership from above , these partisan committees suffocated the mushrooming popular autonomous revolutionary centres -- the grass - roots factory and local revolutionary committees -- and prevented them from proving themselves as an efficient and viable means of co-ordinating communications , defence and provisioning .
They also prevented the Local Revolutionary committees from integrating with each other to form a regional , provincial and national federal network which would facilitate the revolutionary task of social and economic reconstruction . " [ 26 ]
Without such a federation , it was only a matter of time before the C.N.T joined the bourgeois government .
Only a federation of delegates from the fields , factories and workplaces could have solved the problems facing the revolution , as argued by Bakunin :
" the Alliance of all labour associations . . . will constitute the Commune . . . there will be a standing federation of the barricades and a Revolutionary Communal Council . . . [ made up of ] delegates . . . invested with binding mandates and accountable and revocable at all times . . . all provinces , communes and associations . . . [ will ] delegate deputies to an agreed place of assembly ( all . . . invested with binding mandated and accountable and subject to recall ) , in order to found the federation of insurgent associations , communes and provinces . . . and to organise a revolutionary force with the capacity of defeating the reaction . . . it is through the very act of extrapolation and organisation of the Revolution with an eye to the mutual defences of insurgent areas that the universality of the Revolution . . . will emerge triumphant . " [ 27 ]
Indeed , such an organisation already existing in embryo in the CNT 's barrios defence committees which had led and co-ordinated the struggle against the military coup throughout the city .
In combination to a federation of occupied workplaces based on direct delegation irrespective of existing unions , these could have ensured the success of the revolution .
Ironically , the mistake made by the CNT , while understandable , cannot be justified given that their consequences had been predicted by numerous anarchists beforehand .
For example , Kropotkin critique of the Paris Commune refutes the two assumptions of the CNT leadership -- first , of placing the war before the revolution and , second , that the struggle could be better waged by means of the state . [ 28 ]
Moreover , it seems difficult to blame anarchist theory for the decisions of the CNT when that theory argues the opposite position .
Particularly given that the Council of Aragon exposes as false the claim that anarchism failed in during the Spanish Civil War .
In Aragon , the CNT did follow the ideas of anarchism , abolishing both the state and capitalism by means of a federation of communes .
This principled stand for revolutionary social and economic change stands at odds with the claims that the Spanish Revolution shows the failure of anarchism .
After all , in Aragon the CNT did act in accordance with anarchist theory as well as its own history and politics .
Conclusion
It is clear that the defeat in Spain was due to a failure not of anarchist theory and tactics but a failure of anarchists to apply their theory and tactics .
Instead of destroying the state , the C.N.T.-F.A.I. ignored it .
For a revolution to be successful it needs to create organisations which can effectively replace the state and the market ; that is , to create a widespread libertarian organisation for social and economic decision - making through which working class people can start to set their own agendas .
Only by going this route can the state and capitalism be effectively smashed .
Thus the most important lesson gained from the Spanish Revolution is simply the correctness of anarchist theory on the need to organise the " social power " of the working class by a free federation of workers associations to destroy the state .
Beyond doubt , these months of economic liberty in Spain show not only that libertarian socialism works and that working class people can manage and run society ourselves but that it can improve the quality of life and increase freedom .
Given the time and breathing space , the experiment would undoubtedly have ironed out its problems .
Even in the very difficult environment of a civil war ( and with resistance of almost all other parties and unions ) the workers and peasants of Spain showed that a better society is possible .
They gave a concrete example of what was previously just a vision , a world which was more humane , more free , more equitable and more civilised than that run by capitalists , managers , politicians and bureaucrats .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Job losses continued to mount in March and unemployment hit a 25 - year high , according to the government 's latest reading on the battered labor market Friday .
Employers trimmed 663,000 jobs from their payrolls last month , roughly in line with forecasts of a loss of 658,000 jobs , according to economists surveyed by Briefing.com .
For the first three months of the year , 2 million jobs have been lost , and 5.1 million jobs have been lost since the start of 2008 .
To put the three - month loss in context , if no more jobs are lost over the next nine months , 2009 would still be the fourth worst year for job losses since the government started tracking the number of workers in 1939 .
March 's monthly loss is up slightly from the loss of 651,000 jobs in February , although it 's less than the number of jobs lost in January .
That figure was revised up to a loss of 741,000 jobs -- which now stands as the biggest monthly drop in 59 years .
More big job losses likely lie ahead , said Tig Gilliam , chief executive of Adecco Group North America , a unit of the world 's largest employment staffing firm .
He said many of the layoffs announced in recent months have yet to be implemented .
He predicted that between 600,000 and 700,000 more jobs will be lost in April , and that the best people can hope for is that the pace of job losses starts to slow down heading into summer .
" What we have to hope is as we get to May and June , the losses can be limited to only 300,000 or 400,000 range , " Gilliam said .
The unemployment rate climbed to 8.5 % from 8.1 % in February , in line with economists ' forecasts .
It was the highest since November , 1983 .
Labor Secretary Hilda Solis issued a statement citing steps that the Obama administration has taken to address the problems in job market , including the economic stimulus bill passed earlier this year , as well as steps taken to get credit flowing to small businesses .
" Today 's numbers show that we have more work to do , " she said .
The job losses were felt throughout all areas of the economy , with the manufacturing and construction sectors as well as business and professional services industries all cutting more than 100,000 jobs each in March .
Retailers and leisure and hospitality companies also trimmed jobs , as did the government .
The only industry to post a gain in jobs during the month was the education and health care services group -- and that sector only added a modest 8,000 jobs in the month .
John Silvia , chief economist with Wachovia , said that the widespread nature of the job losses may only make the recession worse .
Rising unemployment could batter consumer confidence and spending , which could lead to businesses cutting more down the road .
Silvia also expressed concern that the typical length of time people are out of work continued to climb and now stands at an average of 20.1 weeks .
" Such increases suggest that the impact on those losing jobs will be longer and more severe .
Therefore we expect greater financial stress , credit delinquencies and foreclosures , " he said .
Employers cut back the number of hours for their workers as well .
The average hourly work week fell to 33.2 hours , the lowest level on record going back to 1964 .
There also was an increase in the number of people working part - time jobs who want to get a full - time job .
A record 9 million Americans were " underemployed " in March .
Including those people along with discouraged job seekers no longer counted in the main unemployment rate , the government 's so - called underemployment rate stood at 15.6 % in March .
Employers also cut the number of temporary workers by 72,000 in the month , taking the percentage of temporary workers in the overall work force down to the lowest level since 1994 .
Employers have cut 20 % of temporary workers in the last six months .
Gilliam said the fact that employers are cutting temporary workers and hours are signs that some are trying to find creative ways to cut labor costs without laying people off .
He added that when the length of the average work week and the number of temporary workers start to rise once again , it will be an indication that the labor market is getting ready to turn around .
Between 1973 and 76 , writer and producer Geoff MacCormack accompanied David Bowie on the Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane tours as a backing vocalist / percussionist .
He then went on to work as a dance / mime artist on the Diamond Dogs and Young Americans tours .
Geoff also hung out on the sets of The Man Who Fell To Earth as a stand - in for Bowie .
A collection of photographs MacCormack took during his time with Bowie are on display at the Rockarchive Gallery , Chelsea , London , from 23 January until 6 February .

WASHINGTON Amid the panic of the hour , with governments creating , borrowing and spending money like drunken sailors , German Chancellor Angela Merkel has emerged as the conscience of the developed world .
Perhaps because she was raised in communist East Germany , or maybe because the memory of the 1920s and the evil political consequences thereof is so ingrained in the psyche of her fellow Germans , she is standing like a rock in the tempest , urging people to be prudent .
Of all the leaders participating in this weeks G - 20 meeting in London , she is the only one who has reminded us of the origins of the current troubles and why the remedy favored by most governments is dangerous .
 It happened ,  she recently told the Financial Times , because we were living beyond our means .
. . .
After the Asian crisis and after 9/11 , governments encouraged risk taking in order to boost growth by dumping ever - cheaper money into the financial system .
In response to the pressure to boost public spending , the German chancellor offers this devastating logic :
 This crisis did not come about because we issued too little money but because we created economic growth with too much money , and it was not sustainable growth . 
One would think that Merkel is speaking from the comfort of a country that is being spared much of the punishment that others are receiving .
Actually , as the worlds No. 1 exporter , Germanys economy is on course to contract by 4.5 percent this year .
No economy will be more affected than Germanys , in absolute terms , by the 9 percent drop in international trade forecast by the International Monetary Fund .
Under pressure from the Social Democrats who are part of her Grand Coalition , Merkel has already had to spend much about 4.5 percent of the countrys GDP over two years in order to sustain demand .
But she is saying enough is enough .
Her opposition was crucial , for instance , in preventing the European Union from adopting a rescue package of $ 229 billion for Eastern Europe .
She has steadfastly resisted the proposal to loosen the tight fiscal rules that govern the common currency , the euro .
And she has withstood pressure from the Social Democrats to rescue Opel , the German subsidiary of General Motors , suggesting that bankruptcy might be in order .
Her skepticism is warranted not only by her countrys history but also by that of other nations .
Japan spent more than $ 2 trillion trying to lift itself out of recession after the bursting of its real estate bubble in the 1990s .
But real estate prices and indeed the economy did not pick up until the following decade .
By then , government debt amounted to two years  worth of Japans economic production .
It is not uncommon , in moments of financial and economic panic , for governments to lose their nerve .
They are , after all , subject to the ire of their people .
Nobody likes to face the kind of mob scenes we saw during Frances recent strikes , with livid workers accusing President Nicolas Sarkozy of doing nothing .
And we are talking about a government that has been so interventionist and protective of its people that it recently conditioned aid to Frances automakers on a commitment to establish plants at home , rather than in countries such as the Czech Republic .
In this kind of environment , Merkels stance is especially courageous .
It is particularly noteworthy that she is taking this position just months away from Germanys general election , in which she will attempt to renew her tenure .
Good luck .
American leaders have derided European socialism for years .
But , following a trend started by George W. Bush , President Obama is now set to push federal spending to 28.5 percent of GDP , the highest level ever if we exempt World War II .
In a little twist of history , it has now fallen on Germany , Europes leading nation , to warn America against the siren song of socialist - level spending .
Promisingly , Merkels message seems to have been heard at the grass roots on both sides of the Atlantic .
Figures released in Britain this week show that , much like in the United States , the savings rate tripled in the last quarter .
Despite monetary and fiscal efforts to the contrary , people are relearning to live within their means .
Albert Einstein is said to have described insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results .
The German chancellor is the one Western leader bearing this piece of wisdom in mind these days .

In the late sixteenth century , the Ottoman Empire was hit by an economic crisis precipitated by a massive devaluation and resultant inflation .
As the historian Dan Diner tells the story in his new book “ Lost in the Sacred , ” in order to reassure the people ( and , above all , the army ) that he had matters under control , Sultan Murad III “ saw no other way to guarantee his authority than by sacrificing the official in charge of the mint …as well as the head of the state treasury . ”
Of course , “ sacrificing ” back then was not really a metaphorical term .
The head of the mint and the state treasurer were not fired .
They were executed .
Which is certainly one way to deal with the threat of moral hazard .
Congrats to that lucky boy .

Senate Democrats are negotiating with banking industry lobbyists on legislation that would allow for bankruptcy judges to “ cram down ” ( or rewrite ) mortgage loans .
Judges currently have the authority to do this for mortgages on second homes , yachts , and luxury automobiles , but not for primary residences .
Bank lobbyists ( whose salaries are paid by banks receiving billions in taxpayer bailout funds ) are hoping that Senate Republicans can either stop the bill outright or force limits on who would be covered by the bill , as well as a time limit ( or sunset period ) .
The House passed a version earlier this month .
Advocates for troubled homeowners are pushing for legislation that would allow bankruptcy judges the authority to change the terms of interest rates and loan principle to reflect current market rates .
This would help stop the flood of houses going into foreclosure , maintain value for the banks , and prevent neighborhoods from being overwhelmed with vacant properties .
The bill would not only benefit homeowners who are able to convince judges that they have the means and will to pay a mortgage brought down to reflect the current value of their homes , but also renters — a group that represents 40 % of all people at risk of eviction because of foreclosure .
Banks had no qualms about extending loans on overvalued properties in good times ( and then leveraging them many times over in credit default swaps and other derivatives ) .
Their current policy is to foreclose , evict everyone , and let the government deal with the resulting mess of abandoned property and growing homelessness .
Even those current on their mortgages lose out as their property values continue to plummet amid the glut of bank - owned properties on the market .
With profits rising thanks to government handouts , why should banks be allowed to duck their share of responsibility for the mortgage mess ?

Students See Schools Inhibiting Their Use of New Technologies
Students are using personal technology tools more readily to study subject matter , collaborate with classmates , and complete assigments than they were several years ago , but they are generally asked to “ power down ” at school and abandon the electronic resources they rely on for learning outside of class , according to findings from a national survey released last week .
Teachers , for the most part , are not taking advantage of the tools that middle and high school students have widely adopted for home and school purposes , the sixth annual survey from the Speak Up National Research Project shows .
Those students should be given a more formal role in determining how new technology — such as mobile devices and social - networking sites — can be tapped to improve schooling , a report on the survey findings says .
“ Our nation ’s students are in fact a ‘ Digital Advance Team ’ illuminating the path for how to leverage emerging technologies effectively for teaching and learning , ” the report says .
Students , the report argues , are trendsetters in using technology in their personal lives and , more recently , to organize and complete schoolwork .
“ Today ’s students are early adopters and adapters of new technologies , creating new uses for a myriad of technology products to meet their sophisticated needs , ” it says .
“ They can be predictors or at least harbingers of how technology could be used to transform education . ”
Administrators and teachers see the potential value in using mobile technology in lessons , the report points out .
But many districts have restricted or prohibited students from using personal technology devices because of concerns that they will be misused , such as for socializing during class or cheating on tests .
Many educators and learning experts warn that simply because students are adept at using new technologies , schools need n't feel compelled to adopt them .
They say the primary goal of technology adoption for K - 12 classrooms should be to enhance learning .
“ A lot of IT directors and others are concerned about their networks being overrun ... so they say we ca n’t let these [ personal tech devices ] in because we ca n’t regulate them , ” said Ann Flynn , the director of education technology for the National School Boards Association in Alexandria , Va .
“ There ’s interest in protection out of tech management and liability concerns , and for some of the teachers they just are n’t comfortable with using the devices . ”
School districts , however , need to start listening to their ultimate customers , she added .
“ Young people really can give us some incredibly insightful and thoughtful information related to technology , ” Ms. Flynn said .
Selected findings from the extensive survey project were released March 24 by Project Tomorrow , the Irvine , Calif . - based nonprofit organization that sponsors the survey .
More than 280,000 K - 12 students across the country took part in the 2008 online poll , along with 28,000 teachers , 21,000 parents , and 3,000 administrators .
The group plans to issue several follow - up reports later this year on specific topics , such as online learning .
The reports will summarize survey findings related to those topics as well as information drawn from case studies and interviews .
“ We ’ve been polling students ... on how they are using technology for school work , but that ’s not necessarily in school or directed by the teacher , ” said Julie Evans , the chief executive officer of Project Tomorrow .
The 13 - year - old organization receives funding through grants from foundations and technology companies .
“ We see how creatively and innovatively students are taking the technology tools available for them and leveraging them for learning . ”
Students Suggest Changes
Most of the high school students surveyed , however , do not believe that they are being well prepared for the technology demands of the marketplace .
Large proportions of the middle and high school respondents say they are inhibited from using technology effectively in school because of restrictions on computer time , blocks on access to Web sites , or a prohibition against mobile devices .
The findings may be particularly useful this year , Ms. Evans said , given that schools and districts will be looking for effective ways to use federal economic - stimulus aid from the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act to expand the use of technology in schools .
The report outlines some of the suggestions student participants have offered for improving the use of educational technology in their schools , including : greater access to Web tools and lessons in electronic formats , such as PowerPoint presentations and podcasts ; use of educational games and simulations ; and links to videoconferences with subject - area experts .

EXCLUSIVE :
President Obama dispatched two separate teams of Navy commandos to carry out last week ’s rescue of a merchant ship captain held hostage by Somali pirates but left the operational details and rules of engagement to military commanders , National Security Adviser James .
L. Jones said Tuesday .
“ I can tell you from a White House and presidential standpoint , there was no conflict , no gnashing of teeth , or excessive influence in trying to manage this thing , ” Mr. Jones , a retired Marine Corps four - star general , told The Washington Times in an interview .
He and other military officials gave the most detailed account to date of how Navy SEAL forces were dispatched - first from a base in Africa and later from the United States - to carry out the mission , and how Pentagon officials communicated with the White House .
They sought to dispel Internet reports that the military was delayed from taking action by indecision inside the White House .
“ I do n’t recognize ” the information being circulated on the Internet , Mr. Jones said .
Pentagon officials said the owners of the merchant ship Maersk Alabama controlled the scene in the early hours after the hostage - taking on April 8 .
As soon as the Pentagon took charge on April 10 with its warship the USS Bainbridge on the scene , Mr. Obama first authorized a few Navy SEALs from a base in Africa to deploy to the Bainbridge and take necessary action .
The team was flown by transport aircraft and parachuted to waters near the warship , officials said .
“ It took awhile to get facts and then to get the military on scene , ” said one senior military official , who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of discussing special forces operations .
“ As the picture got more clear and commanders ’ requests went back down the chain , the guidance was : ‘ We would like a peaceful resolution .
However , if Captain Phillips ’ life is in danger you can take appropriate action . ’ ”
The arrival of the first SEAL team gave the military an emergency capability if the pirates holding the ship ’s captain became violent .
Mr. Jones said the Pentagon requested that a second , more complete SEAL team be dispatched from the United States and Mr. Obama approved that request as well .
“ This was , from my perspective , a textbook operation , ” Mr. Jones said in the interview .
“ There were two things [ the president ] was asked to approve and he did .
And the military executed flawlessly . ”
Among the reports disputed by Pentagon officials was a widely circulated Internet critique - purportedly from an anonymous source close to the SEAL community - saying Navy SEALs missed a chance to shoot the pirates on April 10 when Richard Phillips , the captain of the hijacked freighter , jumped out of a lifeboat where he was being held in a failed escape attempt .
However , military officials at the Pentagon involved in the operation said Navy SEAL snipers had not arrived on board the Bainbridge at that time and therefore could not have fired on the pirates .
Contrary to the critical report , the president did not reject two proposed rescue attempts by U.S. forces prior to the sniper attack , Mr. Jones said .
Navy SEAL commandos based in Norfolk , from the Naval Development Group , part of the Naval Special Warfare Center based in Coronado , Calif. , were dispatched to the region .
On April 12 , snipers on the team killed the three Somali pirates holding Mr. Phillips with what military officials said was a difficult , simultaneous rifle attack .
They fired from the fantail of the guided missile destroyer while it was towing the lifeboat to seas that were less choppy .
A fourth man captured during the incident , Abdiwali Abdiqadir Muse , was brought back to the United States and charged with piracy in federal court in New York on Tuesday .
He appeared in New York with a bandaged hand , smiling at times as he was escorted by federal agents .
The rescue operation was delayed because of the time it took to deploy the second SEAL team of more than 20 commandos , along with boats and special equipment , from the United States to the area about 300 miles off the coast of Somalia , Pentagon officials said .
At the Pentagon , military officials said the rules of engagement were set by military commanders at Central Command and were more limited than combat rules because the Navy regarded the operation as countering criminal activity , namely piracy .
Mr. Jones said the hostage rescue was “ a real - world test ” for the White House National Security Council crisis system that he heads , as well as a test for the Pentagon .
“ I think everybody played their part well and there was n’t any overstepping on anybody ’s equities , ” he said .
“ The right questions were asked and the right actions were taken . ”
After the rescue was over , Mr. Jones said , he called Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm .
Mike Mullen and asked for a postmortem on the operation .
“ The response I got was that everything was done professionally and calmly , ” he said .
The president and several advisers in Washington held several secure video conferences to discuss the rescue during the five - day standoff , military officials said .
No details of the conferences were made public by the officials .
Mr. Jones said he has firsthand experience of being on the military end of civilian involvement in a merchant ship seizure .
He was a former Marine Corps officer in 1975 when his battalion was involved in the communist Khmer Rouge ’s capture of the merchant ship Mayaguez at the end of the Vietnam War .
Fourteen Marines were killed in an assault to free the Mayaguez , whose crew had been released from the vessel earlier .
“ I ’ve been on the end of an 8,000 - mile [ - long ] screwdriver , ” he said .
“ I was really happy how this thing played out .
All the operatives had all the top cover they needed .
The risk assessment was done .
The execution was spot on . ”
Any delays in moving the forces that ultimately took action were not the result of obtaining authorization from the White House or Pentagon but the time it took to move SEALs , their vessels and other equipment from the East Coast to the Horn of Africa , a flight distance of about 7,800 miles , the senior official said .
The SEAL team in Norfolk is normally made up of more than 120 commandos .
For the Somalia rescue , the team was trimmed down and involved more than 20 troops , including vessels .
The team mobilized as rapidly as possible and moved out within hours of the White House approval .
The senior official said the request to use the forces was approved in a matter of hours .
“ Once what we asked for had been approved , the long pole in the tent was getting them there , ” the official said .
“ That took … roughly a day , to get loaded and wheels up , then aerial refueling to get them there . ”
Vice Adm. William Gortney , commander of Navy forces in the Middle East , told reporters on Sunday that “ there were standing orders that if [ Mr. Phillips ] was at risk and we on scene determined that he was under imminent danger , to go ahead and take decisive action . ”
Authorities went through “ a deliberate , slow deliberate process to let the negotiation process work itself out to a nonviolent end , ” he said .
“ And unfortunately , that did not occur . ”
A defense official said one reason for any hesitation in taking action was the less - than - successful raid on a pirated yacht in the Gulf of Aden on April 10 .
That raid by French military forces killed two Somali pirates and freed four hostages but led to the death of one other hostage .
The anonymous SEAL source stated in the Internet posting that was attributed to “ some SEAL pals in Virginia Beach ” that the president would not authorize the SEALs to deploy for 36 hours despite requests from the on -scene commander .
The senior military official said that assertion was false .
The posting also stated that rules of engagement imposed by the president prevented action unless the hostage ’s life was in imminent danger .
The military official said the commander had authority to take action at all times because Mr. Phillips was being held at gunpoint , but that he was balancing his authority with Washington ’s request to seek a peaceful outcome .

Report : Polygamist sect girl , 14 , told to manipulate caseworkers Report : FLDS child told to manipulate caseworkers
A 14 - year - old thought to be the youngest bride of jailed polygamist leader Warren Jeffs was advised through text messages to “ please stay angry ” and to “ keep crying , pout , sleep in ” in an attempt to manipulate Texas caseworkers , according to a report filed with a San Angelo court .
The girl is the only one of 439 children taken in last year ’s raid of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ranch in Eldorado who remains in foster care .
In a report to state District Judge Barbara Walther , filed Jan. 27 in San Angelo , the girl ’s guardian ad - litem reported that a prepaid cell phone was given to the girl by her biological mother , Barbara Jessop .
The foster family notified Texas Department of Child Protective Services that she had the phone and it was confiscated by the agency after several text messages were discovered on it , seemingly coming from the girl ’s mother and others .
“ Please stay angry , ” read one incoming message .
“ We need you to keep crying , pout , sleep in , ” read another .
“ CPS needs to see that you are miserable there . ”
Records seized from the FLDS ranch in Eldorado , including excerpts from Jeffs ’ journals , indicate the girl was married to Jeffs when she was 12 .
Jeffs is the jailed leader of the FLDS , a breakaway Mormon sect that practices polygamy .
Court officials in San Angelo confirmed this week that a report on the cell phone incident and its messages was filed last week by the Children ’s Advocacy Center , the girl ’s guardian ad - litem .
Walther has ordered the district clerk 's office not to release the report .
Jessop has asked Walther to seal the document and a hearing on that request is scheduled before Walther on Friday , court officials confirmed Tuesday .
The judge will also be hearing a motion from the girl ’s attorney ad litem , Carmen Dusek , to withdraw from the case .
It is not known why Dusek has asked to withdraw .
She declined to comment on Tuesday .
A copy of the report , bearing the district clerk ’s stamp , was emailed Tuesday afternoon to the Houston Chronicle from a source who asked to remain anonymous .
The Chronicle asked the Children ’s Advocacy Center in San Angelo to verify that it was the document filed in Walther ’s court .
Debra Brown , the agency ’s executive director , verified Tuesday night that it was her agency ’s document filed with the court last week .
The report also stated that there 36 incoming messages and 88 outgoing ones .
Four phone numbers were recorded on the phone .
Two of the numbers originated from San Antonio , one from Adkins , Texas and a fourth from Utah .

一年くらい前から git を使い始め、ここ半年くらいは毎日の開発に git を使っています。昨日 git stash という機能を使っている時に失敗してしまい、何人かの方にアドバイスいただくことによって無事回復することが出来たので、感謝の印として、そして運悪く同じ問題に遭遇してしまった人たち( 私もまたやるかも)へのメモとして記しておきます。
長く開発していると、結構多く候補が出てきます
いきさつ
私の作業のやりかたでは、 タスク毎にブランチを切って、タスクが終了したら master ( svn の trunk のような立ち位置のブランチ ) 、もしくはその時の開発の mainline ( 開発の中心となっているブランチ ) にマージします。つまり、git 上で開発している時間 の 95 % くらいは、ブランチ上で過ごすことになります。多い日には一日に
4 本くらいのブランチを作成してはマージしています。master 上で開発は行わず、 master からは主に完成した機能のリリースのみを行います。
git stash という機能は、まだコミットするまでには至らない変更が手元にあるものの、別ブランチで緊急作業( 例えば再リリース)が必要になったときなどに、手元の変更を一時退避しておき ( git stash save ) 、別の仕事が終わったときに退避した作業状態を復元できる ( git stash pop ) というかなり便利な機能です 。
詳しくは、これらのリンクをどうぞ。
で、昨日も git stash を使いました。git stash を使うときは、たいてい急いでいるときです。昨日は master からのリリースに軽微な間違いがあり、すぐ修正しつつリリースしてからまた作業に戻ってきたいという局面でした。git stash save して手元の作業を退避してから master に戻ってリリースを行い、タスクブランチに戻ってきたときに git stash pop するつもりが ( ヒストリから保管したからかもしれませんが ) git stash clear してしまいました 。
思わず Twitter にポストしたら、直後に @walf443 さんから救いのポストが。
git gcとかしてなければ、git fsckで頑張れば発掘できたような気もす る
http://twitter.com/walf443/status/1461741919
おおっと思い、git fsck stash でググってみたら、私と同じうっかりものが何人かいました。
上記リンクや man git - fsck などを見ていくつかの方法を検討しました。途中で @n_iwamatsu さん、@a_matsuda さんからもアドバイスをもらいました。ありがとうございます。
結果として、私は以下の方法で復旧を行うことが出来ました。(なお、この復旧方法は「まだ git gc していなければ 」 という条件つきのようです )
$ git fsck | awk ' / dangling commit / { print $ 3} ' 候補の sha1 がいくつか出てくる ( 長く開発していると、結構多く候補が出てきます ) $ git show -- summary 候補のsha1 一つ一つの sha1 の内容を確認 $ git cherry - pick -n - m1 見つけたsha1
git fsck で宙ぶらりんになっている変更の sha1 をリストアップし、 git show でその変更の中身を確認し、目的の sha1 を見つけたら git cherry - pick で適用する、という流れです 。
A server used by notorious BitTorrent tracker site The Pirate Bay that was seized by police has been added to Sweden ’s National Museum of Science and Technology ’s collection .
The museum said today it has bought the server from The Pirate Bay for 2,000 kronor ( $ 243 ) .
It ’s understood the artefact has been added to the Stockholm - based museum ’s “ Inspiration Imitation ” display , which aims to to stimulate interest in finding out more about the area of intellectual propety rights . " [ sic ]
The copyright infringement trial against the four men behind The Pirate Bay took place in Sweden in February .
Charges were first brought against the defendants - Carl Lundström , Peter Sunde , Frederik Neij and Gottfrid Svartholm Warg - in January 2008 .
Police raided server locations connected with the website in May 2006 , where computer equipment was confiscated .
Swedish authorities recently returned servers that had been used as evidence in the trial to The Pirate Bay .
Meanwhile , the verdict in the landmark Pirate Bay versus the entertainment industry trial is expected tomorrow .
Many are predicting that regardless of the outcome , the losing side will appeal the decision . ®

The NZ Govt strongly supported Clark 's nomination for the job , and John Key lobbied other leaders as well as insisting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade did everything within its means to carry the message of support in its chain of diplomatic missions abroad .
Earlier , Clark gained a place on the shortlist of three but then major donors to the UNDP threw their support behind her .
Clark 's credentials include not only her experience as Prime Minister but her leadership on many international issues and the recognition of her role in the evolution of NZ 's anti-nuclear policy .
It is expected she will take up the post later this year .
Her departure will signal the need for a by - election in the Mt Albert electorate which she has held since 1981 .

Prox Dynamics ' PD - 100 " Black Hornet " nano - copter has already gone through a number of different prototypes and test flights , but it looks like things have really started to come together with the last few models , and the company has taken advantage of the opportunity to show off their progress in a couple of videos .
One of those shows a " simulated " indoor mission , in which the 15 gram copter scouts out a nondescript office building whilst some suitably dramatic music plays in the background .
The other , slightly more interesting video demonstrates how the two latest models are able to handle themselves in flight , and hold up against some obstacles , like the always problematic flapping clip board .
Head on past the break to check 'em out for yourselves , and hit up the link below for some more information about the copter itself .
Oh , and watch the skies , people .

* Proposed cuts a small percentage of total deficit
* Budget details to guide spending bills in Congress
* Republicans say they have their own savings plan
WASHINGTON , May 6 ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama , facing criticism from Republicans as well as fellow Democrats over huge budget deficits , will propose on Thursday shaving $ 17 billion from a 2010 budget that will still hover around $ 3.5 trillion , an administration official said on Wednesday .
Even with the proposed spending cuts , the White House ’s own estimates suggest the deficit will be $ 1.17 trillion next year .
Congressional analysts believe the gap could be $ 1.4 trillion .
The administration official , who asked not to be identified , did not detail where the $ 17 billion in reductions would be sought for the fiscal year that starts on Oct.
1 .
Obama , who has vowed to cut the country ’s ballooning deficit in half by 2013 , was widely panned last month when he challenged agencies to find $ 100 million in savings .
Critics pointed out that was about equal to what the government spends in 13 minutes .
Congress has already passed a $ 3.4 trillion budget blueprint that will guide tax policy and government spending for the upcoming fiscal year .
It embraces many of Obama ’s top priorities .
But the budget details the White House will release on Thursday , which build on a bare - bones outline the new president submitted to Congress on Feb. 26 , could have an impact on those individual spending bills that will wind their way through Congress in coming months .
Asked by Reuters whether the budget document would contain other major new policy initiatives , the official said the $ 17 billion was “ pretty much the news . ”
Congressional Republicans , who are a minority in the House of Representatives and Senate , gave tepid praise for the new round of proposed funding reductions .
“ While we appreciate the newfound attention to saving taxpayer dollars from this administration , we respectfully suggest that we should do far more , ” House Republican leader John Boehner said in a statement .
A Boehner spokesman said House Republicans would offer their own set of savings .
During his eight years in office that ended in January , Republican President George W. Bush presided over a huge run-up in federal spending , with record budget deficits and ballooning debt that reversed a few years of budget surpluses .
Congressional Republicans signed off on Bush ’s budgets when they controlled Congress , until 2007 .
The White House has already revealed that Obama will include in the 2010 budget a $ 63 billion , six - year health initiative to help people in the world ’s poorest countries , largely bolstering existing programs .
Obama ’s budget was widely seen as sketching out an ambitious agenda that includes healthcare reform , big increases in education spending and a controversial environmental initiative to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases associated with global warming .

Prime Ministers usually enjoy their visits to Washington .
As the President is a head of state , his visitors receive quasi-regal treatment ; you do not have to be Margaret Thatcher to relish all that .
Gordon Brown used to insist that he did not enjoy such events , but that was in the days when they were reserved for Tony Blair .
Since Mr Brown inherited the top job , he has become more appreciative of its perquisites .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This is a good time for him to be in Washington .
Mr Obama still seems to be on honeymoon with his electorate .
Mr Brown will hope that some of the glamour rubs off on him .
In advance , the Labour spinners have been working hard .
We are told that the Brown / Obama meeting will be a progressive coalition against the forces of international conservatism .
Every American leftist who was involved with the Obama campaign , however peripherally , will be wheeled out to conflate David Cameron and the Republicans who opposed the Obama fiscal measures .
This will not have much resonance , partly because it does not reflect the President 's views .
It is unlikely that Barack Obama is even aware of these manoeuvres .
Around Christmas , there was a report that Mr Obama regarded David Cameron as " lightweight " .
This is believed to have originated with Peter Mandelson : not implausible .
A member of Mr Cameron 's staff contacted a core member of the Obama team who is now a senior figure in the White House .
He e-mailed a one - word comment : " horse - shit " .
Despite everything that the spin- doctors can do – and for this trip , nothing will be left undone – it is hard for foreign politicians to extract domestic political credit from dealings with the States .
There is a recurrent problem .
The Americans always have their own agenda , their own preoccupations .
So the friendliest of allies can encounter difficulties in dealing with the best - disposed President .
That was even true in the great days of Reagan and Thatcher .
Certainly , the background music was romantic .
At gatherings of heads of government and foreign ministers , it is customary for the foreign minister to sit next to his boss .
But Mr Reagan always moved the name - cards , so that he got to sit next to Maggie .
It was a Hollywood love story – but as in all the best ones , the plot had complexities .
The course of true love never did run smooth .
As is documented in John Nott 's memoirs and John Campbell 's life of Lady Thatcher , there were disagreements .
On a number of occasions , the President was more favourable to the British position than some of his advisors would have liked .
But Mrs T could never take him for granted .
Still less could Churchill rely on Roosevelt 's acquiescence .
Indeed , history may well conclude that it was Tony Blair who enjoyed the least troubled relationship that a modern Prime Minister has ever had with an American President .
If so , there is a simple explanation .
At various stages , Churchill and Thatcher both found it frustrating that the balance of forces condemned them to be the junior partner .
But there was no reason for that to have troubled Tony Blair .
He never wanted to express disagreement .
Geopolitics guarantees American superiority ; geography reinforces American difference .
It is easy for Europeans to forget that the US can look West as well as East and that Americans have concerns on their continent as well as in our one .
Back in the Eighties , even when Maggie Thatcher was in her prime , Foreign Office ministers would express exasperation at the way in which the Americans would act first and consult later .
It was ever thus .
When George Bush senior succeeded Ronald Reagan , he told his foreign affairs advisors that it was time for Margaret Thatcher to realise that she was not the leader of the Western alliance .
He was .
But this was not only perilously close to being ungallant .
It was unnecessary .
The public displays of deference by President Reagan may have irritated Vice - President Bush .
In practice , they amounted to little more than a gentleman holding open the door for a lady .
There is a further reason why Gordon Brown 's hopes for this week 's visit greatly exceed Barack Obama's .
Reagan and Thatcher : Bush two and Blair : in both cases , there was an incentive for the US politician to display his friendship with a British leader who was wildly popular in the States ( much more so than at home ) .
The same would have been true , no doubt , of Bush one if Mrs T had still been in office when he was running for re-election .
But Mr Obama must now find it inconceivable that the day will ever come when he feels the need for electoral lustre from a British politician .
So despite all the fanfares and the grandeur , Gordon Brown goes to Washington as a supplicant , not an equal , and he suffers from a further disadvantage .
He is not Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair .
Americans cannot be expected to take more than two British Prime Ministers to their hearts at any one time .
Gordon Brown will address both Houses of Congress .
He will , no doubt , make the speech of his life , which is not saying much .
But the best that he can hope for is that by the end of the day , every American Congressman will know the name of Tony Blair 's successor .
Mr Brown will be more concerned that the average British voter should conclude that the world is safer as a result of his efforts .
This is improbable .
Poor Mr Brown is gloomy enough already , so it is just as well that he cannot comprehend the degree of public scepticism which now confronts him .
Even if he deserved one , he would find it hard to obtain a fair hearing .
As he is undeserving , the matter does not arise .
His attempt to pray Mr Obama in aid is a characteristic piece of intellectual dishonesty .
In the first place , the two men's approach is divergent .
Mr Obama decided that the US needed a fiscal stimulus and has provided one at enormous cost , much of it expended on projects of doubtful value .
Even if Mr Brown wanted to imitate this , he could not have done so , for which we should all be grateful .
Had he tried , there would have been a gilt - buyers ' strike , the value of the currency would have collapsed and the government would have been preparing for another visit to Washington : to the IMF .
The Prime Minister did produce his own fiscal stimulus : the cut in VAT , one of the largest tax cuts in British history , which was also one of the most irrelevant .
It was based on a misdiagnosis .
The British problem is not fiscal .
It is monetary .
There is plenty of cash around , but it is not circulating because the banks are not lending , causing a sharp contraction in the effective money supply .
The Tories have come up with a solution : a loan guarantee system , under which the Government would insure a large proportion of the banks ' new commercial lending .
The Government has vaguely promised a scheme of its own , but nothing has happened .
Perhaps ministers were too busy negotiating Fred Goodwin 's pension .
Everything is drifting while Gordon Brown dithers over the detail .
The PM can now forget all that for a couple of days , while he enjoys himself .
But he will not be flying home to a second honeymoon .
Evidence continues to mount that Homo floresiensis , the controversial hominids better known as hobbits , were a distinct member of our ancestral family , rather than pathologically shrunken misfits .
According to analyses published Wednesday in Nature , the big toes of * H. floresiensis * are disproportionately longer than those of either modern humans , formally known as Homo sapiens , or * Homo erectus , * the original out - of - Africa hominid .
The exceptionally tiny brain of * H. floresiensis , * which some researchers thought could not be explained by natural evolutionary pressures , also fits with brain development seen in ancient species of hippos who evolved in island isolation , just like the hobbit .
The papers are the latest salvos in a battle that 's raged since 2003 , when anthropologists found one semi-complete skeleton and fragments of six others in an Indonesian island cave .
The skeletons appeared to come from hominids who stood just three feet tall and were anatomically distinct from * H. sapiens . *
Anthropologists who believed the fossils represented a new species named it after its home island of Flores , where local folk tales described a race of diminutive jungle dwellers .
They hypothesized a direct - line descent from H. erectus , the last common ancestor of all human species , who left Africa 2.5 million years ago .
But other researchers were unconvinced .
They said the hobbits ' brains were too small to have made the sophisticated stone tools found with their skeletons .
The skeletons probably belonged to pathologically stunted locals who'd been ritually buried by their fully H. sapiens tribe , said the skeptics .
Since 2003 , researchers on both sides of the divide have produced interpretations supporting their arguments .
But as described in a recent * New York Times * article , " The research community is definitely trending towards the hobbits . "
Richard Leakey , a preeminent anthropologist who originally refused to take sides in the debate , told the Times that recent research “ greatly strengthened the possibility ” that * H. Floresiensis * was real .
The latest studies strengthen the possibility even more .
In the first , State University of New York at Stony Brook biomechanicist William Jungers reports that H. floresiensis could move its big toes from side - to - side , just like modern humans , but the toes are so disproportionately long that they resemble the toes of apes rather than our own .
This suggests that H. floresiensis may belong to an as - yet - unknown branch of the human family tree , possibly even an evolutionary brother of Homo erectus .
" These new findings raise the possiblity that the ancestor of H. floresiensis was not Homo erectus but instead some other , more primitive hominin whose dispersal into southeast Asia is still undocumented , " wrote Jungers ' team .
In the second paper , Eleanor Weston and Adrian Lister of London 's Natural History Museum looked at fossil skulls from several species of long - extinct hippos that evolved into dwarfish form on the island of Madagascar .
The brains of the hippos were unexpectedly small , even given the diminution of their bodies .
" Our findings ... suggest that the process of dwarfism could in principle explain small brain size , a factor relevant to the interpretation of the small - brained hominin found on the island of Flores , " they wrote .
The papers raise interesting possibilities for the hobbit , writes Harvard University anthropologist Daniel Lieberman in an accompanying commentary .
Perhaps it comes from a pre-H. erectus species , such as * Homo habilis .
* Or maybe * H. erectus * was " more diverse and anatomically primitive than we thought . "
Lieberman suspects the latter , he wrote , " But the only way to test these and other hypotheses is to find more fossils , especially in Asia .
Get out your shovels !"

Cracking 150 mph is n't a big deal these days , but back in 1926 it was enough to make a Sunbeam Tiger called Ladybird the quickest car on the planet .
A British design student has paid tribute to that remarkable car by reimagining it as an all - electric roadster .
The concept car envisioned by Ryan Skelly would commemorate the 100th anniversary of the car Henry Seagrave drove to a record - setting 152.33 mph on March 21 , 1926 .
It 's purely a styling exercise , but we like what he 's done with it .
" From the outset of the project , I wanted to create a successor to a small car from a dormant British car company , " Skelly told Wired.com .
" It was n't until my friend pointed out the Tiger that I fell in love with it and restarted my project on the original 1925 vehicle .
It 's such an amazing little vehicle with so much heritage and a testament to the British motor industry . "
The futuristic Tiger designed by the Coventry University student would be as quick as it is cool .
Seagrave made his record - setting run at Southport Beach , England , in a supercharged V - 12 Tiger .
Skelly updates the drivetrain in Tiger Tribute Concept , envisioning a car capable of 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of 160 mph .
The 342 - horsepower ( 255 kilowatt ) motor would be powered by a lithium titanate battery with a four - hour recharge time and a range of 800 miles .
As we said , it 's a concept .
But if you 're gonna dream , dream big .
" Originally I was going to build the vehicle with a flex - fuel V - 12 engine harking back to the original 's petrol V12 , " Skelly said .
" But after rethinking the idea , I chose electric , not due to the current climate surrounding petrol vehicles , but more down to the fact that this vehicle is a tribute from a modern perspective that needed raw power . "
Skelly specs eco-friendly materials for building the Sunbeam Tiger Tribute Concept .
The frame is recycled aluminum , the seats are soy foam , the brake pads are natural fiber and the body panels use veggie oil resin .
The Tiger Tribute Concept will be featured in the Coventry University Art and Design Show on May 30 .

Canada threatens to appeal to WTO after move aimed at drastic reduction in annual seal cull
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Europe moved today to halt the clubbing to death of hundreds of thousands of seals every year , when MEPs voted overwhelmingly to ban trading in seal products , hoping that the collapse of the market will drastically reduce the massacre .
The decision to outlaw virtually all trade in seal products was directed mainly at Canada , where the yearly cull kills around 300,000 seals , a practice condemned by many as barbaric .
Canada , which exports several million dollars worth of seal products to the EU , is threatening to take Brussels to the World Trade Organisation because of the ban , which still needs to be endorsed by the EU 's 27 national governments .
But that support is guaranteed as EU governments agreed the text with the European parliament .
While 90 MEPs voted against the ban or abstained , 550 voted in favour .
The trade will be stopped next year .
" This is a political issue that now has its time , " said Arlene McCarthy , the Labour MEP .
" After a 40 - year campaign , Europe has a chance to introduce a ban in all 27 states . "
National bans on commercial trading in seal products are already in place in 30 countries including the US , the Netherlands and Italy .
Italy is still said to be one of the biggest European importers of seal pelts .
Seal products are also found in Omega 3 ' fish oil ' pills , leather goods and meat from the Arctic .
The vote came as an EU - Canada summit convened in Praguewhere the Ottawa government was expected to complain about the ban .
Norway has also threatened to take the EU to the WTO .
" The ban does nothing to improve the welfare of hunted seals but sets a dangerous precedent by ignoring WTO rules , " said the International Fur Trade Federation .
Its chairman , Andreas Lenhart , said : " MEPs have rushed through bad legislation to garner what they think will be public appeal just before they are up for re-election [ next month ] . "
But opponents of the ban are relatively rare in Europe .
" Cruel and inhumane seal hunting is unacceptable and an EU measure is the best way we can help to end it around the world , " said Caroline Flint , the minister for Europe .
" It also shows how we can achieve more acting together than alone . "
Almost one million seals are culled every year worldwide .
McCarthy said the Canadians had slaughtered less than a quarter of the number of seals this year compared to last because trading bans were destroying the market for seal products .
Inuit communities in the Arctic were exempted from the new rules .
The marketing of seal products would still be allowed from " hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities and which contribute to their subsistence " .
Lesley O'Donnell , the EU director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare , said today 's vote " hammered the final nail in the coffin of the sealing industry 's market in the EU .
The world is uniting in opposition to commercial sea hunts .
A complete collapse of Canada 's commercial seal hunt may now be inevitable . "
“ Uncle Tom . ” Among African - Americans there is no bigger insult .
Originally used to denote a black man all too willing to submit to campaigns of racial terrorism in order to save his own skin , today the term is most often used to smear those deemed “ unauthentic ” in their “ blackness . ”
The silliness of the former charge notwithstanding , the real absurdity of the term today is that the historical figure most often cited as a living symbol of this epithet is a man who ’s “ authentic blackness ” cannot be seriously questioned ” and who ’s refusal to play by the rules of the State often spat in the fate of the sweeping progressivism so dominant among many whites of his era .
A former slave , Southern patriot , neo-agrarian capitalist , and founder of the famed Tuskegee Institute , Booker T. Washington is perhaps the most unfairly maligned figure in American history .
In an age where revisionist history has become the norm , and consensus accounts are usually viewed critically , the standard appraisal of Washington has largely stayed the same .
Heavily influenced by Washington ’s primary ideological rival W.E.B. Du Bois ( a man Washington once offered a job ) , these histories always seem to paint Washington as an accommodationist of the worst aspects of the post - Civil War South ” and often as an outright opponent of his people .
The recent book “ Up From History ” by Robert Norrell attempts to fill this void , and to a large degree , is successful .
Though Norrell is clearly sympathetic to Washington , he does not pull punches that need to be thrown and his overall assessment provides the reader with a detailed and rich portrait of a complex and decidedly conservative figure , who for nearly twenty years was the unquestioned “ leader ” of his race in the United States .
Outlining the life of the often - controversial Washington is not easy and there are many gaps .
There is very little on young Booker and his personal experiences as a slave .
Norrell does an admirable job making what he can of Booker ’s personal life , but Washington ’s admirable trait of keeping private matters private does not lend itself to a thorough treatment of his personal relationships .
But in not conforming to the tired pattern of many pop biographies , Norrell largely avoids the armchair psychologist routines that have ruined histories written by bigger names .
More to the point in establishing a framework through which one may analyze the actual Washington , the mythical anti-hero morphs into a titan of “ economic independence and self - help . ”
Though it would be unfair to call the leading proponent of “ industrial education ” a Luddite , there is no question that Washington saw land ownership as the key to uplifting blacks .
A harsh opponent of unionization , in the soil Booker saw a path to independence that could not be achieved if one was confined by factory walls .
One can only imagine what he would have thought of the cubicle .
Still the popular perception that the Tuskegee Institute was primarily an agricultural school is false .
Though Washington often let his donors assume this was true , the real purpose of the school was to provide teachers for communities in desperate need of grassroots economic development .
As a firm believer that economic interdependence would require whites to act in moral and mutually beneficial ways toward blacks , Washington was right to promote a communal approach to racial uplift .
Contemporary globalists would be appalled , but his contemporaries were not .
In actuality , the Tuskegee Institute was arguably the most magnificent expression of the Do - It - Yourself ethic one could find anywhere at the turn of the 20th century .
Few other schools were as self - sufficient , and no other campus was built from the ground up by its students .
While its bigness would pose problems later on , the value of Tuskegee can in part be revealed in its enrollment , which at various points dwarfed that of Auburn and the University of Alabama ” combined .
In building such a successful alternative institution , Washington was playing with fire .
Race antagonists surrounded him and Norrell ’s favored term for them ” 
“ White Nationalists ” ” hardly seems inappropriate .
Washington ’s refusal to fuel the fires of the Klan or demagoguing , race - obsessed white politicians , was an attitude that guaranteed his vision for “ race improvement ” ”  based on broadly materialist grounds ” would at least have a chance of getting off the ground .
Not surprisingly this drew the fire of critics from within “ the race , ” a large number of whom coveted the status and supposed influence of Washington and “ The Institute . ”
Symbolically represented in the cruel visage of the Leninist and faux - black nationalist W.E.B.
Du Bois , those who opposed Washington worked night and day to portray the man as a slave - like buffoon , completely beholden to his white masters .
In turning his wildly successful Atlanta Exposition speech into a quasi- endorsement of segregation , these propagandists willfully missed the point of Washington ’s now infamous line :
In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the five fingers , yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress .
Denizens of modern day New York City live in arrangements that closely fit those sketched by Washington above , and no one bats an eye .
More importantly however , is the fact that Booker was not calling for a State - enforced segregation policy .
He was not calling for segregation at all .
Washington was simply noting that blacks did n’t need whites to define their lives or black worth .
The lives of African - Americans , and their quality , should be defined by black men , for black men , and integrationist schemes that would dilute this integral independence were counter - productive .
It is true that Booker was ultimately an integrationist of sorts , but he was not an “ accommodationist . ”
While the difference is a matter of degree ”  that difference is a chasm ” too large to ignore and worthy of its own category .
It is true , as Norrell writes , that “ few men in an open society get to set the terms for the historical memory of their avowed enemy , but W.E.B. Du Bois was one who did , ” and we are all the worse for it .
In denigrating Washington ’s name , Du Bois and his allies sought to wreck the traditional view of post - Civil War blacks ” a view that was diametrically opposed to that of the white paternalists that ran Du Bois precious NAACP from the outset .
According to Du Bois , these professional liberals were to form a vanguard with a “ talented tenth ” of the black population , in order to “ improve the race ” through trickle - down bureaucratic management ” and these phony radicals did far more to slow down the progress of poor blacks than any speech given by Mr. Washington or his thousands of followers and supporters .
Conservative critics that cite Washington ’s willingness to utilize government on behalf of his self - help agenda are standing on shaky ground as well , as these instances were rare .
The Tuskegee Institute was funded primarily through private donations and philanthropy .
Despite the fact that the school ’s heyday was in the midst of the Progressive Era , Washington never asked for federal favors .
Much to the annoyance of the “ talented tenthers , ” Washington eschewed forced integration schemes , and purchased the land the school owned rather than relying on the favored eminent domain tactics of the period .
At times , the activities of the school and Washington were so radically anti-Statist , today they would recognized as libertarian .
Lots of contemporary anarcho - capitalists theorize about private roads .
Washington actually built them .
When and where Washington did promote government expansion , it was always as a defense of black taxpayers who were getting little or nothing for their “ contributions ” to the State .
And while it is true that Washington made expanding public education for American blacks a major facet of his cause , it is hard to imagine the man from Tuskegee advocating for consolidated school districts , let alone the Department of Education .
Ironically , Washington ’s greatest fault was the same of that of so many self - identified conservatives today ” a blinding faith in a Republican Party , led by a messianic warmonger , totally uninterested in the desires of his constituency .
By trading political favors and advising the truly awful Teddy Roosevelt , Washington corrupted his name during an era when his message was needed most .
And yet an excess of loyalty is not something one can condemn without a hint of admiration .
In staying true to his friends Booker made his biggest errors , but also showed he was human , in a time when the emerging elites were defined by their inhumanity .
One can find many faults with Washington , to be sure , but does the punishment fit the crime ?
Clearly not .
The relegation of Washington to pariah of his race is a gross injustice , which , thankfully , Norrell does much to correct .
There is much to Norrell ’s book that is not favorable to Washington , but to focus on that would miss the broader point .
Just as the black capitalist , Afro-nationalist Marcus Garvey became a “ fraud ” and the Second Amendment practitioner Robert Williams became a “ communist , ” their authentically black conservative forefather became the quintessential “ Uncle Tom . ”
Not because he kowtowed to terror or because he was not sufficiently black ”  but because he challenged real power in the name of those who were black .
FOREIGNERS have long been attracted to Sapa and its surrounding mountains in the far north of Vietnam .
First it was the French colonists , who built a hill station there .
More recently it has been tourists , who come to enjoy the stunning landscape of terraced rice paddies and the colourful world of the Hmong tribes , with their distinctive red , black or “ flower ” dress .
But now , it seems , another type of visitor is finding this territory attractive : gangs of kidnappers who snatch young Hmong women for sale as brides across the border in China .
The kidnapping has been going on for some time , and locals talk of a number of cases so far this year .
The abductions follow a pattern : a Hmong girl is wooed by an out - of - towner — whether from Vietnam or China is not clear — who speaks her language .
She is lured to a rendezvous to be drugged and smuggled into China , probably near Lao Cai , about an hour 's drive from Sapa .
Tall , pretty girls are said to be particular targets .
One 18 - year - old recently managed to get back home to tell her tale after a four - day ordeal .
Held captive in China , she escaped through a window and contacted the Chinese police , who returned her to Vietnam .
Most do not escape .
One of those kidnapped last month was a married woman with a son ; friends fear her family may never see her again .
There is some tradition of bride - kidnapping among the Hmong themselves , but this gangsterised , cross - border variety is especially cruel .
Village girls with little knowledge of the outside world tend to be trusting .
And the kidnappers seem to operate with impunity — even , according to one account , seeking a reward for returning two underage girls whom they had failed to sell in China .
Within China itself , the abduction and sale of women has long been recognised as a prevalent social evil .
Three decades of strict family - planning policies have exacerbated a traditional preference for boy children and contributed to a shortage of marriageable women .
Relations between Vietnam and China along their 1,300 km ( 800 - mile ) border have improved : last month officials from the two countries , which fought a brief but bloody border war in 1979 , completed a seven - year effort to demarcate the frontier .
This , they hope , will open the way for increased links of various sorts .
Stepped - up police co-operation to stamp out an evil little trade in Hmong women would be a good start .
State of the Browsers
There ’s some browser news to discuss , and I thought I ’d bundle it all in one entry .
Maybe I ’ll even do this more often ; it seems a good feature for this blog .
But I ’m not promising anything !
This weekend I started testing some new browsers , and meanwhile I ’ve updated the HTML and CSS tables .
There were no surprises .
I ’m continuing with the Events tables , but they ’re so large and sometimes so complicated that I ’m not sure when I ’ll finish .
In this installment we ’ll take a look at IE8RC1 and some reactions to it , Safari 3.2 , Chrome ’s lack of a “ Check for updates automatically ” feature and Opera ’s antitrust complaint .
IE
In case you ’ve been brain - dead for a while , IE8 Release Candidate 1 has been released .
Plenty of bugs have been solved , but a few are left , and finding them is the reason this RC1 has been thrown into the wild .
Plenty of people are bug reporting , and that ’s of course good .
Unfortunately , there are some people who take certain bugs in IE8RC1 to mean that the browser should n’t be released at all ( and they even get airtime on Ajaxian ) .
I could n’t disagree more ; in fact I feel this is the ancient “ Microsoft is Evil ” meme all over again , and I ’m sick of it .
Is IE8 perfect .
No , it is n’t .
But neither is any other browser .
Is IE8 better than IE7 ?
You bet !
To me , that ’s enough reason to release it .
I do n’t doubt that the bugs mentioned in the Ajaxian article exist , and that they ’re extremely annoying when they hold up your project , but none of them strikes me as reason enough to defer IE8 ’s release .
In fact , the Element.prototype.cloneNode.call( ) bug strikes me as decidedly non-real - world .
Sure , it should be solved , but it does n’t have a very high priority .
Ca n’t we just forget about the holier - than - thou attitude ?
Please ?
It does n’t solve anything .
Besides , a similar case can be made against other browsers .
Recently , when working on my as - yet - unpublished political pages , I found a very annoying Firefox float bug .
An open / close link that ’s floated inside a block in the main content suddenly reacts to the floated elements in the right bar , and as a result it can be miles away from the block it ’s supposed to open and close .
Maybe I ’ll delve deeper into this bug , maybe I ’ll accept it and move on .
What I will not do , however , is suggest that Firefox 3 “ should n’t have been released ” with this bug ; that ’s just plain nonsense .
All browsers have bugs .
Report them , by all means .
Insist on speedy solutions , if you like .
But do n’t write ideology - driven drivel like this .
It does n’t solve anything .
IE8 final ?
By the way , surprisingly often people ask me when IE8 final will be released .
I must disappoint them : I do n’t have the faintest idea .
In fact I believe even the IE team itself does n’t yet know .
The plan was to release IE8 when it ’s ready , and how quickly it ’s considered to be ready depends on the number of bugs found in RC1 .
The goal is full CSS 2.1 support , and once that goal is met we ’ll see a final version .
Not before .
Safari 3.2
One browser I decided not to study is Safari 3.2 .
As far as I can tell this is a pure security update that does not have any new CSS or JavaScript features .
Apple is working on Safari 4 , and I assume that ’s the branch that will contain new goodies .
It was hard to find information about 3.2 , though , so maybe I ’m wrong .
If you know of a list of 3.2 features , please leave a comment .
Chrome
When I started my testing , it turned out that Chrome 1.0 had been automatically installed on both of my systems , so the new Tables now mention Chrome 1.0 only .
Now I hate automatic updating .
I ’m taking considerable effort to keep older versions of browsers around on my systems , because I often want to re-check a bug in order to compare it with a new version .
Chrome makes that impossible for me ; in fact I have no control over the process at all .
I do n’t doubt for an instant that automatic updating is a blessing for end users , but for browser compatibility testers it ’s hell .
So I wondered if a future Chrome version could contain a checkbox for “ Check for updates automatically . ”
Obviously it should be checked by default , but I really really want to be able to protect my older Chrome versions by unchecking it .
Pretty please , Chrome team ?
Browser Wars update
Two weeks ago I wrote a post about some unexpected consequences of Opera ’s current antitrust complaint against Microsoft .
If IE is unbundled from Windows , which browser should be installed instead ?
My conclusion was that any new computer would contain either zero or five browsers .
Opera employee Haavard responded that the hardware vendors ( which are apparently called OEMs ; funny name ) would add one browser of their choice to new computers .
Several commenters here on QuirksMode saw the same solution .
I ’m not convinced this is the right thing to do .
When it comes to influencing hardware vendors , Microsoft still has a considerable edge over all other browser vendors , because the hardware people need several Microsoft products ( such as Windows ) to make their machines worthwhile .
So I doubt this is going to change anything in the short run .
Let ’s for a moment suppose that Microsoft genuinely repents of its evil ways and does not pressure hardware vendors to include IE .
Despite this , some hardware vendors will choose IE , and whether that ’s out of habit or because they truly think it ’s the best browser available is unimportant .
Now we still have some new computers that come with IE .
How are we going to distinguish between IE being installed because Microsoft puts pressure on the hardware vendors and IE being installed because the vendors genuinely think it ’s the best browser ?
In the logic that Opera ’s complaint is setting up , a hardware vendor that genuinely believes in IE would be accused of “ bowing down ” to the Redmond monopolist , even if this accusation is baseless .
And that could be the beginning of a lot of ideology - driven nastiness .
I do n’t like the way this is heading .
I do n’t like it at all .

RIYADH , Saudi Arabia —
The refusal of a Saudi judge to annul a marriage contract that weds an 8 - year - old girl to a man in his late 40s has brought into sharp relief the tribal and religious forces complicating this country ’s march to modernity .
Judge Habib A. Al Habib in the Saudi city of Onaiza said the girl can petition for a divorce once she reaches puberty .
And although he also stipulated that no sexual relations take place before the girl is 18 , his ruling has set off a firestorm of national controversy .
The judge ’s decision , issued April 11 despite an appeals court request to reconsider his earlier approval of the contract , also showcases the deep splits in Saudi society between traditionalists and those favoring social and political reforms .
Outraged rights activists and newspaper columnists have condemned the judge ’s stance and demanded an end to the still widespread practice of child marriage .
“ The trafficking of child brides — a most reactionary practice that takes us back to the days of concubines [ and ] slave girls ” should be outlawed “ with absolutely no exceptions , ” wrote columnist Amal Al Zahid .
By “ allowing such crimes against childhood , ” she added , “ we are incurring upon our own society ... behavioral abnormalities and problems of which only Allah knows . ”
Zuhair al - Harithi , spokesman for the government - run Human Rights Commission , told the Saudi press that child marriages “ violate international agreements the kingdom has signed . "
Saudi Arabia has ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child , which defines a child as someone under 18 .
But a large and politically significant section of Saudi society adheres to long - held tribal customs and sees nothing wrong with fathers marrying off their young daughters to sometimes much older men , often in the belief that they are protecting the girls from extra-marital relationships .
The practice is also sanctioned by many among the country ’s ultra-conservative religious authorities , including Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al Sheikh , the kingdom ’s grand mufti .
" If a girl exceeds 10 or 12 then she is eligible for marriage , and whoever thinks she is too young , then he or she is wrong and has done her an injustice , '' Al Sheikh told a Riyadh university audience in January as reported by the newspaper Al Hayat .
“ Our mothers and before them our grandmothers married when they were barely 12 , ” he added .
“ Good upbringing makes a girl ready to perform all marital duties at that age , " and those who say women should not marry before 25 years are following a " bad path . "
Popular attitudes also play a role in the acceptance of child marriage , according to women ’s rights activist Wajiha Al Huweidar , who has called for banning child marriage .
People often refer to girls being in their “ full moon age ” when they are 14 and 15 , meaning they are then most physically desirable .
Poets “ are always talking about a girl at that age of the ‘ full moon , ’ ” Al Huweidar said , adding that “ deep inside , both men and women , believe this is the best age to be married . ”
Such attitudes are reinforced by the “ myth ” among elderly men that when they " get married to a very young girl they will get their youth back , ” she added .
But perhaps more importantly , many people “ think they are following the Prophet ’s footsteps ” because Muhammad is said to have married a 9 - year - old girl named Ayesha , Al Huweidar said .
“ That ’s why it ’s hard to change . ”
Actually , child marriage violates Islamic law , or shari’a , on two counts , critics of the practice say .
First , a marriage contract is only valid if husband and wife voluntarily consent , which a minor is unable to do .
Secondly , the dowry paid by a husband is the property of the wife , not her father , who would control it in the case of a minor .
Ayman A. Abu Laban , UNICEF ’s
Gulf area representative , said in a recent interview that the silence about child marriage “ is now being addressed ” in the Saudi media .
“ As UNICEF , we are for having children enjoy their right of childhood before they get married , meaning they enjoy their rights in education , in health , in maturity , in recreation ... and then they move into responsibility and be ready for marriage . ”
Some Arab countries , including Tunisia , Jordan and Syria , have already set a legal minimum marriage age , Abu Laban noted .
So far , Saudi Arabia has not followed suit , despite a recommendation from the state - run Human Rights Commission to fix 15 as the legal marriage age .
The case has also drawn international criticism .
“ Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework , the marriage of a child is a violation of that child ’s rights , ” UNICEF Executive Director Anne M. Veneman said in an April 13 statement expressing her concern .
Two days later , a U.S. State Department spokesman said that “ child marriage is a clear and unacceptable violation of human rights in our view ... and we ’ve made that point clear to the Saudi Government . ”
Amid this week ’s crescendo of criticism , Justice Minister Mohamed al - Issa told the paper Al Watan that his ministry intends to issue regulations that will " put an end to arbitrariness by parents and guardians in marrying off minor girls . "
The rules will seek " to end the negative aspects of underage girls ' marriage , " the minister said , implying an outright ban is not in the works .
Bandar Al Hajjar , vice president of the Shura Council and past chairman of the National Society for Human Rights , said in an interview that he was “ expecting in the future probably there will be a law organizing this matter ” of child marriage .
But if the government sets a legal age for marriage “ a lot of people wo n’t obey this law , ” Al Hajjar added .
“ First you need to educate people about the negative impacts of getting married [ at an age younger ] than 18 or 16 . ”
While marriage contracts involving minors do not always lead immediately to sexual relations , which are often delayed until the girl attains puberty , the increased press spotlight on the practice has underlined the role of money in such contracts .
The father of the 8 - year - old Onaiza girl contracted to marry his daughter to his friend , who is 47 , in order to repay a debt , according to attorney Abdullah Al Jutaili , who represents the girl ’s mother .
In a phone interview , Al Jutaili said the girl is now living with her mother , who first raised the alarm by petitioning Judge Al Habib to void the 2007 marriage contract , which was concluded without the mother ’s knowledge .
She intends to appeal the judge ’s latest ruling , Al Jutaili added .
The girls ’ parents are separated , he said .
The lawyer said he hoped the Onaiza case would spark reforms and galvanize those who seek change in this matter .
" Before this , many young girls were settling for their fate and suffering silently , ” Al Jutaili said .
“ But this mother chose to fight back and I am very optimistic about that , especially with the attention this case is getting . ”

ALLEN PARK --
The Detroit Lions were determined not to go into the NFL draft today without their No. 1 target signed , sealed and delivered .
They finally got their man .
The Lions signed Georgia quarterback Matthew Stafford to a six - year contract late Friday and , according to a league source , Stafford will receive $ 41.7 million in guaranteed money and $ 72 million overall .
Stafford will earn about $ 12 million per season over his six - year deal , while Matt Ryan , who was the No. 3 pick last year to the Atlanta Falcons , had inked a deal worth about $ 11 million per season .
Negotiations between the Lions and Stafford turned up in intensity Wednesday after Detroit had reached an agreement on contract terms with Wake Forest linebacker Aaron Curry .
The Lions wanted to have a Plan B in place in case contract talks with Stafford -- their No. 1 target -- broke down .
The Lions wanted to get a deal done with their top draft pick before the start of the draft at 4 p.m. Saturday .
This week , Lions general manager Martin Mayhew said he liked Detroit 's chances of getting their potential No. 1 pick signed early .
" I think very good , " Mayhew said .
" That was our plan -- we talked about that back at the combine -- and it 's very important .
We plan on getting something done prior to making that selection . "
Under league rules , the Lions are the only team allowed to sign a potential draft pick to a contract before the start of the draft .
" I think you have that opportunity to get that done .
You know you have that player through the entire offseason , you do n't have a contentious situation with the player , you do n't have a holdout , " Mayhew said .
" The upside is that you definitely want to get that done when you 've got the opportunity early . "
Two years ago , the Oakland Raiders took quarterback JaMarcus Russell with the top overall choice and he was a holdout through the offseason and all of training camp .
He started one game as a rookie .
Mayhew said some players handle a holdout better than others , but the Lions are in a position where they do not have to deal with that issue .
" It varies from player to player .
I think some guys are more affected by it than others , " Mayhew said .
" Some guys can miss two days and they 'll be so far behind it 'll be hard for them to catch up .
Some guys can miss a week and jump right now .
" I think it 's important to know we 've got a player signed and he 'll be here whenever the rookies come back , he 'll be here throughout training camp .
It 's just one less thing for that player to have to worry about it . "
After the Lions get the situation at No. 1 settled , they still have a lot of work to do .
They have five total picks in the top 82 : No. 1 , 20 , 33 , 65 and 82 .
The Lions have had the NFL 's worst - ranked defense in each of the past two seasons , and while Mayhew wants to fill some roster holes on that side of the ball , he said the team will draft for value -- even if that means taking offensive players .
Detroit , which did not receive much action in terms of trading down from the No. 1 pick , will entertain offers to move down with its other picks .
Mayhew said his philosophy would be to trade down and acquire more draft picks instead of trade up and lose them .
Gilly , the unfunniest returning SNL character…ever
Truth be told , when fellow Premium Hollywood writer David Medsker filleted several Kristin Wiig characters in his mid-February post , “ Kristen Wiig must be stopped , ” I thought he might have been a little hard on her .
I generally like her stuff , but I ’ll admit that Penelope and Target Lady are wearing a little thin .
Then I saw a brutal skit in which Wiig debuted a new character , Gilly .
It ’s one thing when a skit is repetitive and funny , but when it ’s repetitive and unfunny , it ’s just annoying .
Thinking that this skit went over like a lead balloon , I figured that would be the last we ’d see of Gilly , but last Saturday , there was another skit — this time Gilly sabotaged her school ’s science fair .
The only thing mildly funny about this skit is Kenan Thompson ’s “ do n’t make a kid ride a horse with crazy eyes ” bit .
Otherwise it was the same , unfunny shtick as the first Gilly skit .
Some people laughed in the audience , but I have no idea why .
Maybe Lorne Michaels pumps the place full of laughing gas , I do n’t know .
Now I ’m starting to think that Mr. Medsker really is onto something — has Wiig run out of funny characters ?
So Gilly is my choice for the unfunniest returning SNL character — who else makes the list ?

Civilians could be seen streaming away from the scene of the fighting on Sunday
Pakistani security forces have clashed with Taleban militants in the troubled north - west of the country , close to the Swat Valley .
A militant commander was among a number of militants killed in gun battles in the Lower Dir district of North West Frontier Province , the military said .
A member of the security forces was also killed when a convoy of troops passed through the area .
The area is west of Swat , where a peace deal was recently agreed .
See a map of the region
The government agreed peace with the Taleban there in return for the enforcement of Islamic law .
Government spokesman Fartullah Barbar said the government was determined to root out militants but insisted that the Swat deal was still intact .
The new fighting occurred in the same area where on Saturday 12 children died after a bomb , which they mistook for a toy , went off .
' Enough is enough ' Helicopter gunships and tanks were reportedly used in the fighting .
There was no immediate word of casualties from the Taleban and independent sources have not been able to verify the army 's claims .
Pakistani interior ministry chief Rehman Malik has repeated his call for the Taleban to disarm .
" Enough is enough , " told a TV channel on Sunday .
" We have decided to flush them out .
The peace accord was linked to peace .
When there is no peace , there is no use for that accord . "
The clashes seem to suggest that the government has finally decided to try to stop the spread of the Taleban across northern Pakistan , the BBC's Mark Dummett reports from the Pakistani capital , Islamabad .
Fighters have moved into several districts since the government agreed to the Swat peace deal .
Critics of the agreement say it allows the Taleban to consolidate their grip on Swat , which is home to 1.5 million people , and then to use it as a base to take over neighbouring areas .

It ’s bound to set off yet another political fight , but the Iowa Supreme Court today declared that state ’s ban on gay marriage unconstitutional :
DES MOINES — Iowa became the first state in the Midwest to approve same - sex marriage on Friday , after the Iowa Supreme Court unanimously decided that a 1998 law limiting marriage to a man and a woman was unconstitutional .
The decision was the culmination of a four - year legal battle that began in the lower courts .
The Supreme Court said same - sex marriages could begin in Iowa in as soon as 21 days .
The case here was being closely followed by advocates on both sides of the issue .
While the same - sex marriage debate has played out on both coasts , the Midwest — where no states had permitted same - sex marriage — was seen as entirely different .
In the past , at least six states in the Midwest were among those around the country that adopted amendments to their state constitutions banning same - sex marriage .
“ The Iowa statute limiting civil marriage to a union between a man and a woman violates the equal protection clause of the Iowa Constitution , ” the justices said in a summary of their decision .
And later in the ruling , they said : “ Equal protection under the Iowa Constitution is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike .
Since territorial times , Iowa has given meaning to this constitutional provision , striking blows to slavery and segregation , and recognizing women ’s rights .
The court found the issue of same - sex marriage comes to it with the same importance as the landmark cases of the past . ”
It did n’t take long , though , for the political games to start :
Opponents of same - sex marriage criticized the ruling .
“ The decision made by the Iowa Supreme Court today to allow gay marriage in Iowa is disappointing on many levels , ” State Senator Paul McKinley , the Republican leader , said in a statement on The Des Moines Register ’s Web site .
“ I believe marriage should only be between one man and one woman and I am confident the majority of Iowans want traditional marriage to be legally recognized in this state . ”
He added : “ Though the court has made their decision , I believe every Iowan should have a voice on this matter and that is why the Iowa Legislature should immediately act to pass a Constitutional Amendment that protects traditional marriage , keeps it as a sacred bond only between one man and one woman and gives every Iowan a chance to have their say through a vote of the people . ”
Advocates of same - sex marriage said they did not believe opponents had any immediate way to overturn the decision .
A constitutional amendment would require the state legislature to approve a ban on same - sex marriage in two consecutive sessions after which voters would have a chance to weigh in .
So , for the moment at least , there ’s been a victory for marriage equality in the Mid-West .
Whether it will stand , and whether it will lead to changes elsewhere , remains to be seen .
Interest rates are at their lowest in the ECB 's 10 - year history The European Central Bank ( ECB ) has cut interest rates in the eurozone to a record low of 1 % , down from 1.25 % .
The central bank also agreed a plan to pump about 60bn euros ( £ 53.5 bn ; $ 80.6 bn ) into the eurozone economy by buying up debt .
The ECB's UK and US counterparts have taken similar unconventional monetary policy measures to boost growth .
It is the seventh time the ECB has lowered its key rate since October 2008 , when it stood at 4.25 % .
ECB president Jean - Claude Trichet said the ECB had decided in principle to buy euro - denominated covered bonds , a safer type of corporate debt , and such purchases would total about 60bn euros .
Clearly this ' credit easing ' could start to open the door for fully fledged quantitative easing from the summer
Julian Callow , European economist
Barclays Mr Trichet said more details would be given when the central bank next meets on 4 June .
" It 's a significant departure from previous ECB policy , " Gilles Moec , senior economist at Bank of America - Merrill Lynch , told Bloomberg News .
" But other central banks have been a lot more aggressive . "
Mr Trichet was not clear on how the bond purchases would be funded , but analysts said that the move could pave the way for quantitative easing , which has the same effect as printing money .
" Clearly this ' credit easing ' could start to open the door for fully fledged quantitative easing from the summer , " said Julian Callow , chief European economist at Barclays capital .
See graph of eurozone interest rates Further steps
He also said that the ECB would provide banks with longer - term refinancing and did not rule out lowering rates further .
Mark Gregory , Europe Business Reporter , BBC News , Brussels
With interest rates already at very low levels the ECB was under intense pressure to come up with some bolder measures to tackle Europe 's economic crisis .
It has but its policies are still more cautious than those of other major central banks .
It is probable the bank intends to start " printing money " to finance the purchase of bonds .
But even this is unclear .
The ECB has n't confirmed how it will finance the extra stimulus it giving to the financial system .
That will only become known when the ECB announces details of its scheme next month .
It has taken a step along the road of quantitative easing pioneered by other central banks , but only a tentative one .
" We have not decided today that the new level of our policy rates was the lowest level , " Mr Trichet said .
But he added that rates were at an appropriate level for now .
The ECB said it would lend banks unlimited funds for up to 12 months , up from six months .
The ECB 's plans bolstered the euro , which rose to a one - month high against the dollar of $ 1.3420 .
Mr Trichet also said that the European Investment Bank , the EUs long - term lending bank , would be allowed to gain access to ECB funding by taking part in the central bank 's money market operations .
The ECB 's decision followed the Bank of England 's announcement that it would keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5 % .
The Bank of England also said it would pump an extra £ 50 bn ( $ 75.5 bn ; 56.5 bn euros ) into the UK economy by buying government and corporate debt , extending its planned spending to £ 125 bn .
Unlike the US and the UK , the ECB cannot buy European government debt because it would have implications for the deficits of individual countries and thus go against the ECB constitution .
Central banks around the world are using more unconventional monetary policy methods to support their economies , with interest rates at record low levels .
Several other central banks decided to cut rates on Thursday .
Iceland 's central cut rates from 15.5 % to 13 % in its third cut this year .
Denmark cut rates from 2 % to 1.65 % and the Czech central bank cut rates from 1.75 % to 1.5 % , which was the lowest level since the country was formed by the division of Czechoslovakia in 1993 .

Are you under control ?
Avoid unnecessary risk exposure
In June 2003 , the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) published its final rule to implement Section 404 of the the Sarbanes - Oxley Act 2002 .
Section 404 requires management ’s annual assertion that internal controls over financial reporting are effective .
S404 specifies a series of minimum requirements to be contained in management ’s report , such as : A statement of management ’s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the registrant ;
A statement identifying the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of the registrant ’s internal control over financial reporting ;
Management ’s assessment of the effectiveness of the registrant ’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the registrant ’s most recent fiscal year , including a statement as to whether or not internal control over financial reporting is effective ; and
A statement that the registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in the annual report has issued an attestation report on management ’s assessment of the registrant ’s internal control over financial reporting .
I recently returned from an engagement where I was helping a client improve his internal control environment in order to achieve Sarbanes - Oxley s404 compliance .
I do n’t advocate that operators subscribe to SOX - levels of control , unless required to do so .
However , I do strongly believe in the benefits of a strong internal control environment .
As defined by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ( COSO ) , internal control provides management and the board of directors with reasonable assurance over the :
effectiveness and efficiency of operations
compliance with applicable laws and regulations
reliability over financial reporting
Given that CEO ’s and CFO ’s can be held accountable for faults spanning from the above 3 categories , it ’s clear that internal control plays a key business role .
Yet , the benefits go beyond limiting management exposure to risk .
For example , improvements in internal control may yield some of the following benefits :
Decrease in revenue leakage
Reduction in , and enhanced detection of fraud incidents
Increase in management ability to trace issues
Reduction of audit burden ( internal & external )
The following teaser on mmC GROUP ’s approach to strengthening internal control provides further details .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - U.S. auto parts makers Visteon Corp VSTN.PK and Metaldyne Corp filed for bankruptcy on Thursday , becoming the latest casualties of the global auto industry crisis and adding to the pressure on cash - strapped automakers .
Visteon , the former parts unit of Ford Motor Co F.N , said the No. 2 U.S. automaker had made a commitment to support bankruptcy financing for its restructuring efforts to ensure continued supply of parts .
The filing comes at a time when Ford , the only U.S. automaker operating without emergency government loans , is struggling to survive the worst auto sales in nearly three decades which has sent Chrysler into bankruptcy and pushed General Motors Corp GM.N to the brink of failure .
GM had moved closer to filing the largest - ever bankruptcy for a U.S. industrial company , but GM and the U.S. Treasury had made a new offer for a crucial debt exchange that is backed by a committee for bondholders .
Ford , still Visteon ’s biggest customer and which accounted for about 31 percent of its $ 1.35 billion of sales last quarter , did not detail the size of its bankruptcy financing for Visteon .
Ford spun off Visteon in 2000 .
“ We have committed to support debtor - in - possession financing , but we anticipate others will also be involved , ” Ford spokesman Todd Nissen said .
Kirk Ludtke , senior vice president at CRT Capital Group , said depending on the size , the bankruptcy financing may not have a significant impact on Ford ’s liquidity .
“ But Visteon is not the only troubled supplier .
This could well start to add up , ” Ludtke said .
Earlier this month , Ford assumed a $ 163 million secured revolving credit facility from Visteon ’s lenders .
The health of the U.S. auto parts supply base has been a priority for Ford with Chrysler in bankruptcy and GM close to a government - imposed deadline of June 1 to restructure or follow Chrysler down that road .
“ Ford ’s top priority is to ensure we have sufficient parts and material to protect our production , ” Ford global purchasing chief Tony Brown said in a statement .
“ Ford has no intention of changing our fundamental business relationship with Visteon , including not buying back businesses or manufacturing operations , ” Brown said , adding that Ford had not experienced any production issues as a result of Visteon ’s business issues .
A disorderly failure of large suppliers would be costly to all major automakers manufacturing in North America , including Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Honda Motor Co 7267.T , due to the interlocking chain of the U.S. supply base .
METALDYNE SALE PLANNED
Both Visteon and Metaldyne Corp , a unit of Japan 's Asahi Tec 5606.T , said the bankruptcy filings do not include their non-U.S. entities or operations .
Visteon , which filed for court protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware , said it would continue its operations throughout the reorganization process .
The first bankruptcy hearing is expected to take place on Friday in Delaware .
Visteon will be seeking approval of regular motions to continue operations during the reorganization .
Visteon listed total assets of $ 4.58 billion and total debts of $ 5.32 billion .
Its unsecured creditors include a unit of Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N holding bond debt , the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp and IBM IBM.N .
Metaldyne , a supplier of metal - based auto components , said it would sell a majority of its assets as going concerns under a court - supervised process .
Plymouth , Michigan - based Metaldyne filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York .
RHJ International SA RHJI.BR , which owns a 60 percent stake in Asahi Tec , and private equity firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL separately submitted letters of intent to purchase different portions of Metaldyne assets , Metaldyne said .
Metaldyne said Asahi
Tec will not continue its economic support for the company .
RHJ said it would buy a majority of Metaldyne ’s assets .
Carlyle has proposed a purchase of certain of Metaldyne ’s Chassis business assets in the United States , Mexico and Spain , Metaldyne said .

Wal - Mart Stores is striding into the market for electronic health records , seeking to bring the technology into the mainstream for physicians in small offices , where most of America ’s doctors practice medicine .
Wal - Mart ’s move comes as the Obama administration is trying to jump - start the adoption of digital medical records with $ 19 billion of incentives in the economic stimulus package .
The company plans to team its Sam ’s Club division with Dell for computers and eClinicalWorks , a fast - growing private company , for software .
Wal - Mart says its package deal of hardware , software , installation , maintenance and training will make the technology more accessible and affordable , undercutting rival health information technology suppliers by as much as half .
“ We ’re a high - volume , low - cost company , ” said Marcus Osborne , senior director for health care business development at Wal - Mart .
“ And I would argue that mentality is sorely lacking in the health care industry . ”
The Sam ’s Club offering , to be made available this spring , will be under $ 25,000 for the first physician in a practice , and about $ 10,000 for each additional doctor .
After the installation and training , continuing annual costs for maintenance and support will be $ 4,000 to $ 6,500 a year , the company estimates .
Wal - Mart says it had explored the opportunity in health information technology long before the presidential election .
About 200,000 health care providers , mostly doctors , are among Sam Club ’s 47 million members .
And the company ’s research showed the technology was becoming less costly and interest was rising among small physician practices , according to Todd Matherly , vice president for health and wellness at Sam ’s Club .
The financial incentives in the administration plan – more than $ 40,000 per physician over a few years , to install and use electronic health records – could accelerate adoption .
When used properly , most health experts agree , digital records can curb costs and improve care .
But many , especially physicians in small offices , doubt the wisdom of switching to electronic health records , given their cost and complexity .
Only about 17 percent of the nation ’s physicians are using computerized patient records , according to a government - sponsored survey published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine .
The use of electronic health records is widespread in large physician groups , but three - fourths of the nation ’s doctors work in small practices of 10 physicians or fewer .
Wal - Mart , however , has the potential to bring not only lower costs but also an efficient distribution channel to cater to small physician groups .
Traditional health technology suppliers , experts say , have tended to shun the small physician offices because it has been costly to sell to them .
Taken together , they make up a large market , but they are scattered .
“ If Wal - Mart is successful , this could be a game - changer , ” observed Dr. David J. Brailer , former national coordinator for health information technology in the Bush administration .
In the package , Dell is offering either a desktop or a tablet personal computer .
Many physicians prefer tablet
PCs because they more closely resemble their familiar paper notepads and make for easier communication with the patient , since the doctor is not behind a desktop screen .
EClinicalWorks , which is used by 25,000 physicians , mostly in small practices , will provide the electronic record and practice management software , for billing and patient registration , as a service over the Internet .
This “ software as a service ” model can trim costs considerably and make technical support and maintenance less complicated , because less software resides on the personal computer in a doctor ’s office .
Dell will be responsible for installation of the computers , while eClinicalWorks will handle software installation , training and maintenance .
Wal - Mart is using its buying power for discounts on both the hardware and software .
Wal - Mart ’s role , according to Mr. Osborne , is to put the bundle of technology into an affordable and accessible offering .
“ We ’re the systems integrator , an aggregator , ” he said .
The company ’s test bed for the technology it will soon offer physicians has been its own health care clinics , staffed by third - party physicians and nurses .
Started in September 2006 , 30 such clinics are now in stores in eight states .
The clinics use the technology Wal - Mart will offer to physicians .
“ That ’s where the learning came from , and they were the kernel of this idea , ” Mr. Osborne said .

In what could be a major pharmaceutical breakthrough , research published online in The FASEB Journal ( http://www. fasebj. org ) describes how scientists from St George 's , University of London have devised a one - two punch to stop HIV .
First the report describes a new protein that can kill the virus when used as a microbicide .
Then the report shows how it might be possible to manufacture this protein in quantities large enough to make it affordable for people in developing countries .
" We desperately need to control the spread of HIV , particularly in developing countries , " said Julian Ma of the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at St. George 's and the senior researcher involved in the work .
" A vaccine is still some way off , but microbicides could provide a more immediate solution , provided we can overcome major hurdles of high efficacy , low cost , and wide availability -- all of which we address in this study . "
In the research paper , Ma and colleagues describe how they combined two protein microbicides ( b12 monoclonal antibody and cyanovirin - N ) into a single " fusion " molecule and showed that this molecule is more active against HIV than either of its individual components .
They designed synthetic DNA for producing this molecule and introduced this DNA into plant cells .
After regenerating transgenic plants that produce the fusion molecule , they prepared the microbicide from a plant extract made by grinding the leaves .
" This study is nothing short of a breakthrough - - not only does it yield a new drug to fight the spread of HIV , but it also shows us how we can produce it on the scale necessary to get it into the hands of those who need it most , " said Gerald Weissmann , M.D. , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
" Unlike their unregulated counterparts in the dietary supplement industry , these scientists are using the engines of nature to manufacture pharmaceuticals that must undergo extensive safety and efficacy testing long before the first gel or cream is administered . "

Three weeks after losing his job as a help - desk employee , David Ernest Everett Jr. launched an attack against his former employer , Wand Corporation , which designs and manages back - office and point - of - sale systems for fast - food franchises .
Without even entering the company 's headquarters in Eden Prairie , Minnesota , Everett was able to wreak havoc on the family business and its clients .
His weapon ?
A so - called logic bomb , malicious software code designed to disrupt a company 's IT infrastructure or destroy its data .
Companies have long been on guard against the threat of outside hackers , but recent attacks from insiders have some business owners nervously eyeing their own IT workers .
An IT contractor who had been fired from Fannie Mae was indicted in January .
He allegedly used his company - issued laptop to insert bad code into one of the company 's programs on the day he was let go .
According to FBI investigators , the logic bomb would have wiped out all of Fannie Mae 's servers had it not been discovered in time .
" These types of insider attacks happen to businesses of all sizes , from small companies to very large corporations , " says Dawn Cappelli , an insider - threat expert at the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute .
For Wand Corporation , the warnings about insider threats came too late .
Using his old employee login , Everett got access to Wand 's computer system and uploaded malicious files to about 1,000 of the company 's restaurant management systems across the country .
The files , which Everett set to launch when a computer was restarted , were designed to corrupt a restaurant computer 's operating system until it was unusable .
" When we saw so many systems going down with the same set of circumstances in such a short period of time , we knew it was too big to be a coincidence , " says Dave Perrill , Wand 's vice president .
Perrill contacted the FBI .
" They were at our facility within hours , " he says .
The bureau helped Wand repair its systems and preserve evidence for a criminal prosecution .
All told , Everett 's attack destroyed 25 computers .
Fixing the mess , including sending new computers to customers via overnight delivery , cost about $ 49,000 .
Everett pleaded guilty in federal court in January and faces up to 10 years in prison .
How can companies reduce the likelihood of such inside jobs ?
" Password management is critical , " says Cappelli .
After layoffs , companies should immediately eliminate password access for ex-employees and have all remaining employees change their passwords , she says .
Cappelli also recommends changing passwords created for training sessions or test accounts .
" We 've seen disgruntled employees use those kinds of accounts to get back at a company , " she says .
At least one person typically needs full access to a company 's systems .
But experts recommend separating duties when possible .
Instead of giving the entire IT staff free rein , clearly define and limit who has access to each system .
For example , an engineer who has been hired to maintain your e-mail servers should not have access to the accounting systems .
Given that many insider attacks are a response to what the employee feels is unfair treatment , such as being passed over for a promotion , keep an eye out for behavioral changes , suggests Arnette Heintze , principal of Hillard Heintze , a Chicago - based security advisory firm .
Tip - offs might include frequent arguing with co-workers , making hostile statements about the company 's owner , or even eating lunch alone after previously preferring to eat with the group .
Tech - heavy companies that work with sensitive information may find it worthwhile to invest in software designed to detect logic bombs .
Applications from companies such as Solidcore Systems and Tripwire will monitor a company 's IT systems and flag any suspicious changes .
Prices start at about $ 75 per license for Solidcore and $ 2,000 per license for Tripwire .
If an employee discovers what appears to be a logic bomb , contact the FBI right away , says Cappelli .
Unless your business has a computer forensics specialist on board , company staff members trying to investigate insider sabotage could damage key evidence needed to identify and prosecute the culprit .
After its bad experience , Wand Corporation has gotten more savvy .
Now , for instance , passwords of ex-employees are deleted immediately , and several of the company 's employees perform periodic system audits to look for vulnerabilities .
" We 've undergone a bit of a paradigm shift in terms of focusing on internal threats , " says Perrill .
" Obviously , we 've learned from this experience . "
Gingrich warns that GOP could trigger third - party conservative movement Jeremy Gantz and David Edwards
Published : Sunday April 5 , 2009
Print This Email This Newt Gingrich is not happy with the GOP .
" If the Republicans can't break out of being the right - wing party of big government , then I think you would see a third party movement in 2012 , " Gingrich said during a speech Wednesday in Missouri .
While Gingrich  who helped craft the GOP's " Contract with America " in 1994 , the year his party gained majorities in both house of Congress  said he wo n't participate in any third - party movement , he spoke harshly of the party 's current identity on Fox News Sunday .
" Republicans need to understand that there 's a country which did not like the big spending of the [ Bush ] administration , did n't like the interventionist policies of [ that ] administration , " Gingrich said .
" And the country at large would like to see a genuine alternative to the Obama strategy of basically trying to run the entire economy from the White House and basically trying to increase government , I think , by 36 percent this year , which is the largest single increase outside of war in American history . "
Gingrich , now chairman of the think tank American Solutions , which he helped found in 2007 , said that Republicans must stop insisting on earmarks and big spending , and must begin paying attention to the " vast majority of Republicans . "
" People are not trapped into a system , " he said , referring to the current landscape of political parties .
But Gingrich complimented GOP
House leaders John Boehner ( R - OH ) and Eric Cantor , saying their recent effort on the budget has been " helpful . "
Late last month , Boehner unveiled " The Republican Road to Recovery " at a press conference at which he was expected to announce his party 's alternative to President Barack Obama 's proposed federal budget .
The document turned out to be a blueprint of conservatives values , lacking any budget numbers .
Democrats and their allies have taken to calling the GOP " the Party of No " in recent months , with White House spokesman Robert Gibbs saying that the GOP has " become the party of no new ideas . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House on Thursday passed a $ 6.4 billion school modernization bill that would commit funds for the construction and update of more energy - efficient school buildings .
Solar electric panels likes these on a California building could soon come to schools across the country .
The measure passed 275- 155 in a largely party - line vote , and will now move to the Senate for further review .
Among other things , the bill allocates substantial funds for improvements along the Gulf Coast , where many school districts are still struggling to repair buildings damaged by hurricanes Katrina and Rita .
The legislation , according to the House Education and Labor Committee , also makes schools part of the effort to revive the U.S. economy and fight global warming by " creating clean energy jobs that will help put workers in hard - hit industries back to work . "
The committee says the bill would require that 100 percent of the funds go toward green projects by 2015 , which is the final year of funding under the bill .
" All students and teachers deserve safe and healthy learning environments , but too often , their schools are literally falling apart , " said Rep. George Miller , D - California , who is the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee and one of the bill 's sponsors .
" This legislation is a victory for students , workers and our planet .
It will help improve educational opportunities and boost student achievement , it will help transition us toward a green economy by making our classrooms more environmentally friendly , " he said .
Opponents of the legislation , nearly all Republicans , criticized the high cost and the increasing role of the federal government .
" The federal government has always maintained a limited role in education , focusing on key academic priorities such as closing achievement gaps between disadvantaged students and their peers and ensuring services for children with disabilities , " said Rep. Howard P. " Buck " McKeon , R- California , the Education and Labor Committee 's top Republican .
" The construction and renovation of schools are among the most fundamental rights and responsibilities belonging to states and local communities . "
McKeon added : " Federalizing this role is a stunning Washington power grab ; something that has become all too familiar in recent months . "
The nation 's schools are hundreds of billions of dollars short of what it would take to bring them into good condition , according to recent estimates cited by the House committee .
In fact , the American Society of Civil Engineers gave schools across the country a " D " on its national infrastructure report card for this year .
Read the report
The American Federation of Teachers also estimates it would cost almost $ 255 billion to fully renovate and repair all the schools in the country .
Rachel Gutter , of the U.S. Green Building Council , says the benefits of an eco-friendly school will pay off economically .
" The typical green school saves $ 100,000 a year on direct operating expenses .
In school terms , that 's enough to hire two new teachers , purchase 200 new computers or 5,000 textbooks , " Gutter said .
" So these are major savings .
And that 's just one year .
The typical school lasts 40 years .
And when you do the math , it starts to become some serious savings .
...
It pays for itself after a few years of operation . "
The council , on its Web site , lists several benefits of green buildings , such as improving air and water quality , conserving natural resources , reducing operating costs and improving employee productivity .
But Gutter says that part of the concern over green schools is the fear over construction costs .
" The research shows the greatest barrier to getting more green schools built is the perception that they cost more up front to build , " she said .
" The fact of the matter is that they do n't .
...
Building green does n't have to cost more , and then everything else , all the savings over the lifetime , are just savings you get to put back in your community 's pocket . "
The legislation , if signed into law , would also help to create new jobs -- around 136,000 positions , according to calculations by the Economic Policy Institute .
But much more is at stake , Gutter says .
" It 's about raising a new generation of leaders who inevitably are going to inherit the problems we will leave behind , " she said .
" So when you 're actually able to use the school itself as a teaching tool , as an opportunity for learning , that 's when the connections with curriculum really start to happen . "

As a designer , I think we all have experienced the hard time of finding new ideas and inspirations .
That ’s why I ’ve chosen to talk about this topic in my presentation at the FOWD conference .
In this post , I want to do a recap of my slides – Finding Inspiration From Your Environment .
Read on to find out how my work habits and environment influence my design .
Working at Home = Killing Your Creativity
My work habits and environment have a big influence on my work .
So , I ’m going to talk about my work environment first .
Being a freelancer , I get the freedom to work anywhere I want as long as there is internet connection .
Most freelancers would prefer to work at home or in a small / shared office .
Personally , I find it very boring working at home .
To think about it , how can you find new ideas if you are constantly facing your work and computer .
Yes , you can browse the web or CSS gallery sites such as Best Web Gallery to find inspiration .
But since my work is web design , I prefer to find inspiration offline ( this way I can avoid being overly inspired by other websites ) .
My Office = Starbucks
To keep my creative juices flowing , I like to take my laptop and work out of my home or office .
My favorite places are coffee shops such as Starbucks and book stores .
Do n’t worry , I ’m not suggesting you setup a home office at Starbucks like this photo .
I only use a tiny table that is enough room for my laptop .
You may wonder : is n’t that annoying when people bump into you ?
Actually , I like that sort of distraction .
I like to see fresh faces walk in and out .
Sometimes I even get inspired by the clothes they wear or the tattoos on their skin .
If I need a break or design feedbacks , I will talk to the Starbucks employees or the regular customers .
For design feedbacks , I like to ask non-designers because they often give me comments from a different perspective .
I like to see fresh people and things around me , so I do n’t go to the same location all the time .
I hop around , sometime 2 to 3 different locations in one day .
Book Stores
The other place I like to go to is book stores such as Chapters or Indigo .
Book stores are like a massive inspirational depot filled with a wide range of books , magazines , gift products , posters , and print ads .
Whenever I have a brain block , I like to walk around the book store and scan the magazines , book covers , and post cards .
Shopping Mall
Shopping center is another inspirational depot .
You can get inspired by so many things – from clothing to print ads , from window display to mall decoration , etc .
By looking at the fashion design , you can tell what are the current trends .
I look at the fashion trends and adapt it in my design .
For example , when I was designing Web Designer Wall , I noticed a lot of apparels were designed with floral patterns , so I adapted it into my design .
Art Supply Stores
Although I do n’t create traditional art nor need art supply any more , but I go to art supply stores from time to time to check out the craft papers .
Below are some nice art papers I found in an art supply store .
Art Galleries
To find new art styles and trends , I visit comtemporary and private art galleries .
Sometimes I may even spot inspiring street art while walking on the street in downtown Toronto .
Inspired by Nature
Now I would like to present to you two of my latest illustrations : Abstract Phoenix and Peacock .
I will show you where I drew inspiration from and how I incorporated them into my design .
# 1 : Phoenix Illustration
I started this illustration by drawing a basic shape of the phoenix in an abstract form .
As I moved along , I added many elements that you can find in nature : DNA helix , dandelion , tree leave and butterfly wing patterns .
# 2 : Abstract Peacock
This illustration entitled Abstract Peacock because the main idea was inspired by the peacock ’s back and feathers .
If you take a closer look at the illustration , you may find elements like : flower petals , rooster feathers , snake tail , and fireworks .
How to Avoid Copying
It happens sometime :
You get inspired by something , become too focused on it and ended up creating something that is too similar to the original source .
So , how can you avoid being a copycat ?
I have two techniques which work really well for me :
Zoom into the subject and pick up the details .
Mix and match different sources .
1. Look Into The Details
For example : let ’s say you want to create something that is related to the octopus .
You can :
Zoom in and focus on the tentacles .
Use the shape of the sucker to form a tentacle .
Create in abstract form .
Zoom in further and focus on the suckers .
Manipulate the sucker in different forms .
Form a shape with shapes .
Design a pattern with the shape .
2. Mix and Match
The following example shows how I gathered different design patterns and create my own pattern .
I zoom in and find the partial patterns that I like and then put them together to form a new pattern .
Conclusion
Next time you are outside , try to pay more attention to you environment , you may find a lot of interesting things that you can incorporate into your design .
I do n’t purposely go around to find inspiration .
The places I mentioned in this article are part of my life and daily routine .
I always have my iPhone or camera handy .
Whenever I see something nice , I will take a photo to document it .
Hope you find this post useful .
Enjoy your life and design more beautiful things !

The Obama liberals hate this kind of stuff .
Rep. Michele Bachmann , interviewed by Sue Jeffers on KTLK FM in Minnesota recently , warned about the “ Kennedy Serve America Act ” and Obama ’s plan to indoctrinate America ’s children .
“ Rep. Michele Bachmann , who has levied the most bizarre and outlandish critiques against President Obama since before he came into office , did not disappoint this weekend , ” writes Sam Stein for the Huffington Post .
Appearing on Minnesota radio station KTLK - AM , ( h/t Minnesota Independent ) the Republican congresswoman expressed her concern that White House was trying to put in place “ re-education camps for young people , where young people have to go and get trained in a philosophy that the government puts forward . ”
Furthering the Obama - as - autocrat theme , Bachmann said the youngsters would “ then they have to go to work in some of these politically correct forums . ”
Bachmann ’s crazy , Sam seems to think , because the “ bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act ” is “ widely popular and bipartisan , ” that is to say a preponderant number of Congress critters agreed to press gang the youth of America into government mandated indentured servitude .
“ The Obama White House did not immediately return request for reaction .
The Kennedy Serve America
Act passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 275 to 149 and the Senate , by a vote of 79 to 19 . ”
Bachmann is right about Obama , but beware : she is a Republican neocon who received support from the likes of Bush , Karl Rove , and the man who does work in the shadows , Dick Cheney .

An incendiary blog post is lighting up cyberspace this morning .
Steve Gillmor of TechCrunch has written an article titled , " Rest in Peace , RSS " , in which he says that " it 's time to get completely off RSS and switch to Twitter " .
To you non-computer geeks out there , RSS is a technology that , over the past few years , has revolutionized how people get information on the Web .
Before RSS , people had to type in the URL of every website they wanted to visit just to see if there was any new material posted .
What RSS did was retrieve the headlines on your favorite sites for you , allowing people to harness all of their Web headlines automatically , and then organize them in one central place .
In other words , it offered a way to " stop looking and switch to receiving " .
To see working examples of this , check out The Nerfherder 's Technology Blogroll and Political Blogroll - which are RSS pages I created long ago on Netvibes .
So , to RSS devotees such as myself , Gillmor 's requiem is quite a shock to the system .
I imagine this is what it felt like for our parents ' generation after they had spent years assembling beloved record collections , only to hear that now everything was about to shift to cassettes or CDs .
Can it be true ?
Is RSS really on death 's doorstep ?
The answer , it 's hard to admit , might indeed be yes .
For starters , and as I 've written about before , RSS never quite caught on with the mainstream public .
Why that 's the case is a matter of debate , but one thing is clear - it does n't exactly help in preventing RSS 's extinction .
Meanwhile , Twitter , by contrast , seems on the verge of breaking through into the mainstream consciousness .
But perhaps the most thought - provoking assessment that Gillmor provides is his framing of recent Web evolution .
He conceptualizes it by tracing the historical path fromAs a result , he argues that RSS has become " a shell of its former self , casually subsumed " into the social stream .
This narrative is a fascinating interpretation on recent history , and the blogosphere has been firing on all cylinders today debating its merits .
I , for one , believe it to be fairly accurate , as my own experience seems to mirror Gillmor 's ( although I have some lingering skepticism as to whether Twitter can be a viable replacement ) .
However , does my continued use of RSS suddenly make me a backwards - looking technologist ?
That seems , somehow , awfully disturbing .
Each year , hundreds of thousands of people suffer medical complications from hypodermic needles that penetrate too far under their skin .
A new device developed by MIT engineers and colleagues aims to prevent this from happening by keeping needles on target .
The device , which is purely mechanical , is based on concepts borrowed from the oil industry .
It involves a hollow S - shaped needle containing a filament that acts as a guide wire .
When a physician pushes the device against a tissue , she is actually applying force only to the filament , not the needle itself , thanks to a special clutch .
When the filament , which moves through the tip of the needle , encounters resistance from a firm tissue , it begins to buckle within the S - shaped tube .
Due to the combined buckling and interactions with the walls of the tube , the filament locks into place " and the needle and wire advance as a single unit , " said Jeffrey Karp , an affiliate faculty member of the Harvard - MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology ( HST ) and co-corresponding author of a recent paper on the work in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The needle and wire proceed through the firm tissue .
But once they reach the target cavity ( for example , a blood vessel ) there is no more resistance on the wire , and it quickly advances forward while the needle remains stationary .
Because the needle is no longer moving , it cannot proceed past the cavity into the wrong tissue .
Karp believes that the device could reach clinics within three to five years pending further pre-clinical and clinical testing .
First author Erik K. Bassett , now at Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , developed the device for his MIT master 's thesis .
He did so under Alexander Slocum , the Neil and Jane Pappalardo Professor of Mechanical Engineering , with guidance from Karp and Omid Farokhzad of HST , Harvard Medical School ( HMS ) and Brigham and Women 's Hospital ( Karp is also affiliated with the latter two ) .
Additional authors are also from HMS and MGH .
The work was funded by the Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation at MIT and the Center for Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology ( CIMIT ) .

T- Mobile is planning to use Google 's open source operating system " Android " on devices that blur the line between cellphone and home PC .
In addition , Samsung says they will also produce Android phones , but need to work out the kinks , first .
Both announcements come shortly after HP revealed that it is investigating the idea of using Android to power some of its low - cost netbook computers in place of Windows .
Home Phone to get Data Features
According to the New York Times , T - Mobile is working on two home devices using Android , an open source rival to systems such as Windows Mobile and the Apple operating system .
The first is a cordless phone which will carry some data features .
These are n't detailed in the report , but they could include a phonebook or access to text messages on the user 's cellphone account .
The device will update its data at the same time as it recharges in a special docking station .
( Source : nytimes.com )
The second device will be a tablet computer with a 7 " touch screen .
It would n't be designed as a main computer but , with built - in wireless Internet , it would be used for household tasks such as finding and downloading recipes from an online source .
T- Mobile has long been committed to the Android project : it was the first firm to market a cellphone using the system .
Officially known as the G1 , it was widely dubbed the G - phone in recognition of the Google involvement .
Samsung On Board ...
Eventually
The T - Mobile announcement follows news that Samsung will launch three Android - based phones this year , two of them aimed at the U.S. market .
That 's something of a surprise given that Samsung deals heavily with network carrier Sprint , which has criticized Android in the past .
Samsung says it has had its own concerns about the system , particularly the idea that it might be seen as ' Google - centric ' .
It 's likely the Samsung phones will have few Google applications or any other obvious links to the search giant .

Gio was shuttling between the kitchen and the family room , serving food and wine as the cast became acquainted with the family .
“ Marlon Brando loved my mom ’s eggplant parmigiana , ” Gio says .
“ I remember sitting with him on the basement steps and watching this little drip of olive oil going down his chin and him telling my mother , ‘ Jean , this is the best eggplant I ’ve ever eaten ! ’
[ See the food page of Gio ’s Web site , sexfoodrockandroll.com , for the recipe . ]
It was a wonderful , relaxed , and casual evening — I danced with James Caan all night . ”
She laughs .
“ I ’m sure the Fed who was parked up the block­ — this guy that was always tailing my father — got a big kick out of it . ”
A few weeks later , Gio ’s mother made linguine with clam sauce for another special guest : the impoverished young actor Al Pacino .
“ I remember he was very quiet , and we had to pay his cab fare , ” says Gio .
The role of Michael Corleone required the New York–born Pacino to speak Italian in several scenes , and he had come to the Eboli house with Lettieri to work on his Italian for the famous sequence in which Michael guns down the double - crossing Sollozzo and the crooked police captain , McCluskey , played by Sterling Hayden .
“ My dad and Uncle Al spoke Italian fluently , ” Gio says .
“ They drank plenty of wine that night .
My brother joked at the time , ‘ How ’s this kid going to get the lines down after they go through six bottles ? ’ ”
That brother , Pat Eboli , was on the set later for the pivotal scene .
“ Pacino was definitely struggling with the Italian , ” says Pat .
“ I remember Hayden saying , ‘ If I have to eat any more of this spaghetti , I ’m going to explode . ’
Eventually , they decided to rework the scene . ”
Michael looks over at the cop — who ’s busy with his spaghetti and obviously not paying attention — before turning to Sollozzo and breaking into English to tell him : “ What I want , what ’s most important to me , is that I have a guarantee : no more attempts on my father ’s life . ”
Pacino , Sterling Hayden , and Lettieri in the famous scene at Louis ’s Italian restaurant in the Bronx .
From the Everett Collection .
As movie audiences all across America thrilled to the saga of the Corleone family , a real - life drama unfolded in the Eboli family .
At one a.m. on July 16 , 1972 , four months after the premiere of The Godfather , Gio ’s uncle Tommy Eboli was found dead on a Brooklyn street , having been struck by five bullets to the head and neck .
The police said that he had probably been shot in or near his car and that he had staggered to the sidewalk before collapsing .
“ When I heard about it , I pictured the scene in The Godfather when Don Corleone got shot , ” Gio says .
As for her father , Patsy Eboli , he disappeared in 1976 and was never heard from again .
The only trace he left behind was “ a bill for long - term parking at Kennedy Airport , ” where his Cadillac was found abandoned with the keys in the glove compartment .
In addition to losing her father and her Uncle Tommy in the 1970s , Gio also lost her Uncle Al .
The actor died of a heart attack in 1975 , at age 47 .
Like so many of his co-stars , he contributed to the greatness of The Godfather not only with his performance but also with his connections .

INTRODUCTION
PREPARATION
Items used in the preparation of Chimora include a blender , an 8 - quart cooking pot , a spoon or wooden spatula , two empty potato salad containers ( equal size ) and some clean cloth used for straining .
The process starts with a one - foot section of a Trichocereus pachanoi cactus and yields a single dose .
The end of the cactus is shaped like a star , usually with four to nine ribs .
The one - foot section of cactus is sliced like a cucumber into star sections .
The star sections are then further cut into quarters so they will fit in the blender .
The spurs ( spines , needles ) can be left on the cactus as the boiling process softens them into string - like pieces of material that can be discarded .
A portion of the cactus chunks are put in one container and an equal amount of water is put into another .
The cactus chunks and water are poured into a blender .
This mixture is blended until the cactus bits and water expand to the top of the blender .
After it is blended , the resulting mixture is poured into a large 3 - 5 quart pot .
This process is repeated until the whole cactus has been liquefied and poured into the pot .
The blended cactus / water mixture is cooked slowly on low heat until the mixture is even , approximately 30 minutes .
Initially , the cactus pulp separates from the water and sits on top of the liquid .
As the mixture cooks , the pulp will rise to the top of the pot , forming a foam that may spill over .
A gas stove is preferred as it allows better regulation of the cooking temperature .
As the mixture continues to cook , it re-combines into one liquid and begins to turn green like the skin of the cactus .
During this time , it needs to be stirred .
Low heat and stirring are especially important during this first half hour of cooking .
Slowly over time , the pulpy green goop remixes with the water until it reaches the consistency of glue or snot .
After the water and pulp have rejoined , the heat can be increased slightly allowing the liquid to simmer ( a light boil ) continuously but without boiling over onto the stove .
The mixture is allowed to boil lightly for two to four hours until 12 to 16 ounces of goo left are left in the bottom of the pan .
During the 2 - 4 hour period of boiling the mixture needs to be monitored closely to avoid burning .
Another 12 to 16 ounces of water or more may be added to prolong the boiling period .
Eventually the mixture becomes a messy glob of gooey gluey goop .
A clean piece of natural - fiber cloth ( a piece of a t - shirt is being used in the photo ) is placed over the top of the blender , forming a pocket that acts as a filter .
The mixture is poured from the pot into the cloth .
The liquid slowly seeps through the cloth and drips into the blender .
The pulp material is caught in the cloth pocket .
This process is repeated until all of the pulp has been poured into the filter cloth .
A piece of string is used to tie the top of the cloth closed around the pulp .
The bag of pulp is suspended over the blender allowing the juice to drain from the pulp , through the cloth , into the blender .
After fifteen minutes , when the cactus pulp has cooled down considerably , the remaining liquid is squeezed by hand from the bag into the blender .
The liquid is cooled for a short time until it reaches a temperature that wo n't burn the mouth or throat .
Opening the t- shirt reveals the remaining pulp .
Since the psychoactive components have already been extracted from this material , it is discarded .
Finally , the juice from the blender is poured into a cup .
CONCLUSION
Years ago in the early 1970s I became friends with the employees of a plant shop in the Seattle University District .
What was really cool is that I found out that the owner of this plant shop was also the author , as well as the editor of several fine books such as " How to Grow the Finest Marijuana Indoors under Halides " and " How to Grow Pot Hydroponically " .
They also published " How to Identify and Grow Psilocybe Mushrooms , " by Jule Stevens and Rich Gee .
One of the employees and I went to the Seattle Arboretum in 1975 and were playing Frisbee when I dropped the Frisbee to the ground at the Woodlawn Park section of the Seattle Arboretum .
As I bent down to pick up the Frisbee I noticed some interesting mushrooms in the field in which we were playing .
I then lifted one shroom out of the ground and realized it was Psilocybe semilanceata .
That really blew my mind .
I showed my friend this shroom and he mentioned to me that since I showed an interest in these special mushrooms , maybe I would be interested in trying a San Pedro Cactus , which he told me , contained mescaline .
At that time in the early to middle 1970s , I learned that this cactus was from Peru and Ecuador and was used ritualistically in ceremonies similar to those associated with the ritualistic use of Peyote .
I soon read a few papers and learn that the natives of these countries prepared their cacti as a drink that they knew as The native peoples of Peru who used this cactus for medicinal purposes would slice , dice and chop up the sliced star shaped pieces and then boil the material for hour after hour to get the alkaloids to mix in with the water .
Sometimes the cooking preparation took from 8 - 24 hours .
After that the drink would be passed through a cloth and the liquid collected in clay drinking vessels , which enabled the Indians to partake of the sacred juice for a most rewarding experience .
In 1976 , the cost of such a cactus in the United States was $ 3.00 for a one to two pound cutting ( see San Pedro Figure 1 ) and that such size would be equal to or equivalent to the dosage of 4 to 6 buttons of fresh peyote ( See Peyote , Figure 2 ) .
In chemical terms that amount of the 1 - 2 pounds of San Pedro cactus was the equivalent and / or equal to 300 to 500 milligrams of pharmaceutical mescaline sulfate .
This 1 - 2 pound San Pedro cacti dose was the same as a dose of 4 - 6 fresh buttons of peyotl consumed by members of the Native American Church .
My friends at the plant shop told me I would have to slice and cook the cactus for about four hours or so and then drink the remaining liquid .
So I purchased about ten of the cacti and planted all but one of them in my home .
Several of them I kept at a now out - of - business used bookstore in the University district of Seattle .
Well I chopped up the cactus and placed it into a small 4 quart cooking pot and began to boil the chopped pieces .
I let this goop boil for a few hours and then strained off the pulp from the cactus and waited for it to cool off to drink it .
And I did .
After two hours I felt only a little tingle and I could not sleep the whole night but I never got high from it .
At that time , High Time Magazine was just one and half years old , with about six issues published , and now they were going monthly .
In the first year of 12 issues , there were many ads for 6 " cuttings of San Pedro Cactus for ten dollars each per cutting .
I imagined that hundreds of interested people had bought this cactus , cooked it , drank the liquid ( not enough to affect anyone ) , and then when nothing psychoactive occurred , went on thinking that they had royally been ripped off for their ten dollars .
What a shame .
I learned a few days later from my friends that I had not prepared the cactus in the right manner and was apparently in too much of a hurry in my method of preparation .
I recalled that the Indians of Peru and Ecuador who use these cacti ( 13 different species contain mescaline ) have to boil the preparation in a black cauldron ( kettle ) for at least 12 to 24 four hours .
However , I of the Western World , know the secret of the blender .
Something the Indian does not have access to in his jungle .
The magical Electrical Blender .
So here is one of many proper methods for preparing and cooking this cactus .
And yes , I have used this method since the late 1970s and found it to be the best method I employ .
The Photographs in this article and the preparation of this cactus were prepared on the Island of Koh Samui where there are no laws against the consumption of this magical drink known as Chimora .
After I returned from SE Asia I wrote the text and now I will present here a step - by - step photo pictorial on the preparation process for cooking this beautiful wonderful exotic magical entheogenic gift from the gods .
A shot of cactus juice is much easier to swallow than chewing bitter - tasting fresh cactus or peyote buttons .
Each swallow of the mixture can be accompanied by a drink of water or other beverage to counter the mildly bitter taste of the san pedro juice .
Eliminating the chewing of the cactus material also helps attenuate feelings of nausea commonly associated with ingesting cactus .
Swallowing this juice slowly over a half - hour or so ( rather than rapidly drinking it down ) can help acclimate the body to the material gently and avoid shocking the nervous system .

I had an epiphany last night on the way home from work , it just came to me in a flash .
The solution to all of our economic worries is to legalise canabis .
Just think of all the tax the government could bring in from canabis sales !
We ’d be rolling in it ( pardon the pun ) .
OK so the streets might be awash with pink - eyed , paranoid teenagers giggling and munching bags of Walkers Sensations but that seems like a small price to pay for economic stability .
It ’s a little controversial but you know it makes sense !
A watershed , also known as a catchment or drainage basin , is the area of land where water from precipitation ( either rain or snow ) drains downhill into a body of water , such as a stream , river , reservoir , wetland , sea or ocean .
Protecting these watersheds from pollution , erosion , and runoff of agricultural or industrial contaminants is essential for our survival .
Photo by nicholas_t
The watershed includes both the bodies that convey the water ( rivers , streams , etc. ) as well as the land area from which water drains .
Watersheds are separated from adjacent catchments by a drainage divide .
The following video is a great introduction to the idea of a watershed :
httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofTdglXriug
No matter where you live , you are in a watershed .
If we do n’t manage our watersheds wisely , we risk losing access to clean water , and everything downstream from us will also be affected by our actions ( or non-action ) .

At the Linux Collaboration Summit in San Francisco , Intel Open Source Technology Center director Imhad Sousou discussed the company 's plans for the next major version of its Linux - based open source Moblin platform .
The aim of Moblin , Sousou says , is to improve the quality of the Linux user experience on Atom - based devices .
For Intel , this is a broad mandate that reaches deep into the platform and will require improvements at many different layers of the stack .
One especially important aspect of Intel 's platform improvement agenda is to reduce overall startup time .
Tests of the latest Moblin 2 alpha release show that the major components of the stack , including the graphics system , can start up in mere seconds .
Intel intends to build on this effort and hopes to eventually reduce total startup time to two seconds .
Achieving this ambitious goal while still retaining the full software stack will be an important step for making Moblin an appropriate platform for embedded car computers and many other embedded applications where the software needs to be seamless and instantly accessible .
" We think that two second boot is possible , " Sousou declared during his presentation .
Boot performance improvements of that magnitude would surely boost Linux 's viability in the mobile space , but it will not be an easy task .
Parallelizing components of the boot process is often viewed as the most practical way to reduce the total boot duration , but Sousou cautions that parallelization should be viewed as a means to an end and not an end in itself .
" Parallelized bloat is still bloat , " he remarked .
He also discussed Intel 's new partnership with the Linux Foundation , which was announced last week .
The Linux Foundation will take over stewardship of the Moblin project 's governance and move it forward in a manner that will increase the accessibility of the project to third - party developers and other Linux vendors .
Intel chose this path because they wanted to shift the project to a vendor - neutral environment .
" Big corporations are not good shepherds of open source projects , " Sousou said .
He cites IBM 's establishment of the Eclipse Foundation as an example of the right approach .
Rather than starting a new nonprofit organization , however , he says that Intel thinks that the community 's interests would be best served by collaborating with the Linux Foundation , which already has strong relationships with many Linux stakeholders .
The move was broadly welcomed by Linux distributors .
A big question that has emerged from this transition is what kind of governance model to adopt .
Sousou says that Intel had not previously put much consideration into that issue , because the development of Moblin has been focused so extensively on upstream development .
Intel says that they are tentatively planning to create a body that they refer to as the Moblin steering committee to direct development through the Linux Foundation .
Sousou also spoke about Intel 's vision for improving mobile user interfaces .
Conventional widget toolkits and standard UI frameworks lack the flexibility needed to build truly rich user experiences , he said .
Intel thinks that canvas and scene graph frameworks provide a more powerful way to build next - generation interfaces that are intuitive , effective on touchscreen devices , and aesthetically pleasing .
Last year , Intel acquired OpenedHand , the company behind the open source Clutter canvas framework .
Intel plans to leverage Clutter to build dynamic user interfaces that have smooth animations and accelerated graphics .
With these animation frameworks , he stated , widgets and windows are replaced with scenes and actors .
Intel wants to make it easy for application developers to build such interfaces in their own software .
Intel clearly has high hopes for Moblin and an ambitious vision for the platform 's future .
The company 's strong commitment to upstream development and collaboration with other vendors is a promising sign that Intel is interested in achieving its goals in an inclusive way that will benefit the entire Linux platform and the desktop stack as well as the mobile ecosystem .
The real test will be the level of third - party involvement that converges around the Moblin project .
If Intel can gain sufficient mindshare and build bridges with the large number of companies that are committed to using Linux with competing hardware , then Moblin has the potential to become the nexus of mobile Linux development .
It would not surprise me , given that we already have semi-secret zionists mobbing organizations like MEGAPHONE , HelpUsWin.org , GIYUS.org , text messaging , etc ... to organize Jewish participants in activities such as attacking those who criticise Israel , both physically and through the Internet , that we could have an Irgun - type organization operating within the United States .
NAIROBI , Kenya , Feb. 27 , 2009  --
Scientists have discovered footprints in northern Kenya that prove human beings have been walking our walk for at least 1.5 million years .
The footprints belonged to a Homo ergaster , one of the earliest ancestors of modern humans , believed to have lived throughout southern and eastern Africa .
Scientists have been digging in northern Kenya , near the Turkana basin , looking for fossils and other clues to how human beings evolved .
Matthew Bennett , a professor of environmental and geographical sciences at Bournemouth University in the United Kingdom , was the lead scientist on the excavation team .
The discovery of the footprints is an exciting breakthrough , he said .
" It 's filling in a real gap in our knowledge about when people developed a modern foot anatomy , " Bennett told ABC News .
" It brings back the age of when essentially a modern footprint was in operation . "
The footprints themselves have all the characteristics of human feet today : short toes , a big toe parallel to the others and a high arch .
The prints also indicated that the Homo ergaster walk was similar to the human walk of today , with weight being transferred from the heel of the foot to the ball and then to the big toe .
After uncovering the prints in separate rock layers near the village of Ileret , Bennett and his team scanned the prints to compare them to the last discovery of footprints 30 years ago .
Those prints were found at the Laetoli site in Tanzania and belonged to the Australopithecus , a more primitive human ancestor from 3.5 million years ago that exhibited characteristics closer to apes than modern - day humans .
Comparing the new prints with both the Laetoli footprints and the footprints of today , the team of scientists concluded in an article in the journal Science that " The Ileret prints show that by 1.5 million years , hominids had evolved an essentially modern human foot function and style of bipedal locomotion . "
Bennett said that the excavation process and results are about more than just science .
Knowing that the last time someone was at the site was more than 1 million years ago " provides a very strong emotional linkage to our former ancestors , " he said .
" It 's a slow process , but it 's a very emotional process . "
Understanding Past and Future
To preserve the site for future excavations , the prints have been reburied and will not be uncovered until the next dig scheduled for this summer .
The project is an international collaborative effort , drawing scientists and students from all over the world .
Bennett and his team are working with the Kenya National Museum to ensure that the area continues to be a place where scientists can dig for discoveries that show just how universal the human species is .
" It helps us understand our past , " he said .
" And it helps us understand our future too . "
According to the Times Online , British scientists have developed a therapy to cure the most common form of blindness , ( macular degeneration , updated per request from comments ) using embryonic stem cells .
Under the new treatment , embryonic stem cells are transformed into replicas of the missing cells .
They are then placed on an artificial membrane which is inserted in the back of the retina .
Make that " the back of the retina of heathenistic Godless pagans " , because I feel 100 % certain that no Godfearing right wing types are going to allow these innocent dead baby parts to be injected into their eyeballs !

The barreleye ( Macropinna microstoma ) has extremely light - sensitive eyes that can rotate within a transparent , fluid - filled shield on its head .
The fish ’s tubular eyes are capped by bright green lenses .
The eyes point upward ( as shown here ) when the fish is looking for food overhead .
They point forward when the fish is feeding .
The two spots above the fish ’s mouth are are olfactory organs called nares , which are analogous to human nostrils .
In the second image , you can see that , although the barreleye is facing downward , its eyes are still looking straight up .
This close - up “ frame grab ” from video shows a barreleye that is about 140 mm ( six inches ) long .
Image : © 2004 MBARI
Crazy does n’t even come close to how freakin’ wierd this fish is .
At my old stomping grounds , MBARI , Bruce Robison and Kim Reisenbichler now know why .
Desribed in 1939 , Macropinna microstoma , the barreleye fish , is n’t exactly new to science .
All the species in the Opisthoproctidae family are known for having ultra-sensitive tubular eyes that face upward , well adapted for collecting light .
Slight problem .
If the eyes constantly face upward , looking forward to capture prey with their wee little mouths is impossible .
Using MBARI ’s remote operate vehicles Robison and Reisenbichler were able to view the barreleyes in the ocean between 600 and 800 m .
The found that the eyes of Macropinna can rotate within transparent shield that covers the fish ’s head , allowing it to look at whatever it wants .
This transparent , fluid - filled shield that covers the top of the fish ’s head was unknown to science , i.e. existing descriptions and illustrations do no show it .
Likely , when previous specimens were caught in deep - sea trawls there were damaged or lost .
But the craziness of this fish does n’t stop with the clear skull or pivoting eyeballs …
In addition to their amazing “ headgear , ” barreleyes have a variety of other interesting adaptations to deep - sea life .
Their large , flat fins allow them to remain nearly motionless in the water , and to maneuver very precisely ( much like MBARI ’s ROVs ) .
Their small mouths suggest that they can be very precise and selective in capturing small prey .
On the other hand , their digestive systems are very large , which suggests that they can eat a variety of small drifting animals as well as jellies .
In fact , the stomachs of the two net - caught fish contained fragments of jellies .
And now for the video …

AMD and Seagate will demonstrate a next - generation 6 - Gbit/s SATA interface Monday in New Orleans , the companies said .
Neither company is announcing products based on the technology yet , Seagate executives said .
The 6 - Gbit/s SATA technology will be part of a future AMD south bridge chip , and may appear in solid - state - disc drives before it becomes part of a conventional hard drive .
The target markets will be gaming PCs and servers , executives said .
Currently , SATA uses a 3.0 - Gbit /s interface , which should satisfy the throughput requirements of hard drives until 2011 , when that channel will become saturated and the 6.0 - Gbit /s interface will truly be needed .
But the SATA - IO Working Group and the industry has traditionally built in enough overhead into the interface to allow the industry time to prepare , said Marc Noblitt , senior marketing I/O development manager for Seagate .
On a rotating drive , the optimum location for storing data is on the outside tracks , where the throughput is highest as the disk spins .
But that data rate will reach 250 Mbytes /s in 2011 , saturating the current 3 - Gbits /s channel .
“ You always want to keep the I/ O spec in front of the data rate to ensure you do n’t run up against it , ” Noblitt said .
Although Seagate was founded on rotating disk - drive technology , OEMs have told Seagate that the 6 - Gbit /s interface is needed for flash - based solid - state drives ( SSDs ) which stream data instantly from flash memory .
“ Flash will take advantage [ of the new interface ] , in applicable markets , sooner than you think , ” Noblitt said .
“ Six - gig is a perfect interface .
OEMs tell us that they want to have the same SATA interface for flash as for a 1.8 - inch rotating drive , so they can swap in a drive for flash , or vice versa . ”
The 6.0 - Gbit/s also contains improved streaming characteristics that 3.0 - Gbit /s drives with Native Command Queuing lacked , Noblitt said .
In addition , a new power management spec allows the always - on SATA interface to power on and off , like older Parallel ATA drives , he said .
The 6.0 - Gbit /s portion of the External SATA specification is not yet complete , Noblitt said .
She said the account had been provided by a staff member who attended the briefing .
She did not speak out at the time due to secrecy rules , and so was not complicit in any abuse of detainees , she said .
“ The speaker ’s comments continue to raise more questions than provide answers , ” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , the Republican leader .
“ It ’s pretty clear that they were well aware of what these enhanced interrogation techniques were ; they were well aware that they ’d been used ; and it seems to me that they want to have it both ways .
You ca n’t have it both ways . ”
Other Republicans have sought to drive the point home , suggesting that Ms. Pelosi tacitly supported the interrogation techniques in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks but sought to back away when disclosures about mistreatment of detainees shifted public opinion .
“ We know that if the C.I.A. proposes something that we believe is wrong , we could do something about it , ” Senator Christopher S. Bond , Republican of Missouri , a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said Thursday .
“ We ’ve done things about it and it ’s no excuse to say that I was powerless . ”
Ms. Pelosi said she had supported a letter opposing the tactics sent in 2003 by Representative Jane Harman of California , who replaced Ms. Pelosi as the top Democrat on the panel when Ms. Pelosi took over as Democratic leader .
But she said that she realized a letter would not change administration policy and that she instead set about to win Democratic control of Congress .
“ It was clear we had to change the leadership in Congress and in the White House , ” she said .
“ That was my job  the Congress part . ”
To resolve the dispute about what was said during the September 2002 meeting , Ms. Pelosi has urged the C.I.A. to disclose the contents of that session .
But that appears doubtful because the agency has rebuffed a request by former Vice President Dick Cheney for two memorandums that Mr. Cheney says would demonstrate the effectiveness of harsh interrogation methods in obtaining information from captured operatives of Al Qaeda .
I woke up at 3 AM last night with my mind racing .
The extremely important question that jolted me awake : How big is the Enterprise 's viewscreen ?
So I did the math .
Advertisement
First off , it depends on which Enterprise you 're talking about .
The original Enterprise of the '60s , which I 've been watching Season 1 of on Blu-ray ( quite a good restoration , btw ) , had what seemed like a tiny ass screen when compared to the IMAX - like experience of the new movie Enterprise .
But it 's not actually that small .
Advertisement
Using the combined knowledge of the Star Fleet Technical Manual and some screenshots of the episodes , I was able to determine that the screen is a 136 - inch display with a 1.73:1 aspect ratio .
That 's actually smaller than the retina - searing 150 - inch Panasonic plasma that we played with before .
Yes , Adam Frucci and various captains of industry that have way too much money have viewed things in their own home on a larger display than a captain of a STARSHIP .

But Picard is n't going to be showed up by 21st century technology .
His glorious Enterprise D has a 212 - inch screen with a 1.92:1 aspect ratio , which is big enough for Riker to jam chairs through while Picard 's off in a fantasy land with Whoopi Goldberg .
Nice job , Riker .
Advertisement
Not only is this screen gigantic , it supposedly displays stuff in three - dimensions , shifting views or something so Jean - Luc can put a face to Troi 's feelings of " he 's hiding something " .
The Star Trek Wiki explains thusly :
While it is a subtle effect , the viewscreen seen throughout Star Trek : The Next Generation clearly displayed 3 - D images .
This effect was created in some scenes by providing multiple angles on the viewer , with the image on screen displayed at a corresponding angle , rather than a flat , single angle shot .
Advertisement
But what about the newest technology ?
What have we learned from years of actual consumer electronics development that the tech - consultants on the movie set could incorporate into the latest iteration of the Enterprise ?
" Bigger is better . "
Advertisement
The display on new - Kirk 's ship looks massive , but only because it 's so wide .
If you 're measuring the screen diagonally in display - talk , it 's around 326 - inches , which is larger in absolute terms than even Picard 's screen .
It also has a 3.25:1 display ratio , making it wider than most film ratios .
But if you 're talking pure width , it measures about 26 feet across .
Quite impressive .
If they ever do remake TNG , I suspect that the viewscreen will wrap entirely around the side of the bridge all the way to the back where neo -Worf and neo -Geordi will be able to see what 's going on behind the Enterprise .
It 's easier to turn your head to see a display than to tell someone to press a button to change the view .

So yes , this is our dream for when we go into space .
Not only will we be able to be in space , we 'll have really , really big screens to watch stuff on .

Perry :
No thanks on $ 555 million in U.S. jobless aid Perry rejects $ 555 million in federal stimulus money
From the center of a Houston hardware store , Gov. Rick Perry ignited a debate about Texas job cuts , business taxes and President Barack Obama ’s so - called economic stimulus program Thursday by rejecting the federal government ’s offer of $ 555 million in aid to the unemployed .
The action now moves to the Legislature , which can bypass Perry and take the offer as long as it changes state laws and blocks Republican Perry ’s potential veto .
Democratic lawmakers said Thursday they will try .
Perry said the money would come with too many strings attached .
Taking the half billion would require the state to assist qualified out - of - work residents seeking part - time jobs , an idea that Perry said the state has rejected before , partly because it could discourage them from seeking full - time employment .
The federal money injection would also make Texas extend benefits to more low - paid workers , and Perry said the overall expansion would force business to make higher unemployment insurance payments .
He announced his stance near the Galleria at Bering ’s Hardware , where descendants of the founder said they would have to pay about $ 12,000 more a year into the unemployment insurance fund to cover their 170 full - and part - time workers .
“ Employers who have to pay more taxes have less money to make their payroll ” and would have to raise prices on their products , the governor said .
“ The calls to take the ( stimulus ) money and sort out the consequences later are quite troubling to me . ”
What the critics say
Opponents said Perry was spurning workers hurt by the plummeting national economy .
Taking the federal money would save on taxes and prices in the long run , they said .
“ Texas families are hurting and are worried about how they are going to keep their homes and pay their bills , ” said state Sen.
Rodney Ellis , D - Houston .
“ Today , Gov. Perry told them : ‘ good luck with that . ’
If the governor wo n’t do his job , we ’ll go around him . ”
Republican Jim Pitts of Waxahachie , chairman of the Texas House Appropriations Committee , seemed prepared to join forces .
He voted to accept the federal unemployment aid .
He was joined by four Democratic state representatives at an Austin meeting of a legislative committee studying the stimulus aid .
Rep. Myra Crownover , R - Denton , voted no .
Waco - based economist Ray Perryman had just told the committee , “ We ’re probably better off taking the money . ”
Without the funds , Perryman said the state ’s unemployment fund is projected to run dry this year , possibly triggering higher unemployment insurance levies on employers even without the state ’s acceptance of federal funds .
The latest figures
With a rising unemployment rate of 6.4 percent , well below the rate of other big states , Texas reported a record loss of 77,800 jobs in January .
In 2008 , 20 percent of out - of - work Texans were eligible to collect benefits , according to the U.S. Labor Department .
Only South Dakota , at 18 percent , had a lower eligible portion .
U.S. Sen . Kay Bailey Hutchison , primed to face Perry in the 2010 Republican primary for governor , warned about consequences like the one mentioned by economist Perryman — without saying whether Perry made the wrong decision :
“ With the state unemployment fund dangerously close to falling below the legal threshold , it is imperative ( he ) does nothing that potentially burdens small businesses with higher taxes in tough economic times or pushes those who have recently become unemployed and their families into further economic peril . ”

The everyday tasks in our lives are being revolutionized by technology .
One task that technology is helping to simplify is shopping : the task of buying products in stores is just not as convenient as online shopping .
With that in mind , it is becoming more and more important to pay attention to the usability of e-commerce websites .
When customers want to buy a product , they want the process to be quick and easy , without any hassles .
Here are 10 tips to help you create usable e-commerce checkouts and shopping carts .
1 . Full page and mini carts
Shopping carts often come in two forms , a fully functional cart that is contained within a page of its own and a “ mini ” shopping cart , usually located in the sidebar , or above the page fold .
The best practice is to include both .
Mini shopping carts show information within a small area that does n’t take away from the rest of the layout .
Here is an excellent example of a usable mini shopping cart .
When a product is selected , the item is immediately shown in the mini cart .
After you continue shopping , the details minimize and only the number of items and total price is shown .
Also , there is a link from the mini cart to view the full page cart .
With the full page cart you can provide more information and more options than a mini cart .
For example , information such as product details , remove / edit items , tax prices and shipping options can all be included in a full page cart .
The full page cart example below also displays a mini cart in the upper right corner .
2. Checkout : Step - by - step or one page
Using a step by step method makes the checkout process easy for the customer to follow .
Take a look at the Apple.com checkout page below .
The checkout procedure is performed in four different steps : Sign In , Billing & Shipping , Payment and finally Verify / Edit .
This is a well structured process and you should certainly consider using something similar to this when designing step - by - step checkouts .
Besides a step - by - step process , another option is to include the shopping cart , personal information and shipping / billing information on a single page .
This can work nicely if done with a good layout .
The following site uses a good single page checkout process .
There is a table at the top which contains the cart , with the purchase information forms below .
3 . Link from mini cart to full cart with an icon
When building a shopping cart , there are subtle features that impact the customer ’s experience .
Clicking on the mini cart should link to the full cart and an icon should appear alongside the mini cart to draw the customer ’s attention to the mini cart and this link .
The following website is a perfect example of this .
These buttons are in a foreign language , but the shopping cart icon can easily be recognized by anyone .
4 . Make checkout / add to cart buttons obvious
When designing an e-commerce checkout and shopping cart , it ’s important to include easily accessible links to guide the customer through the checkout process .
It ’s best to use large obvious buttons .
Make sure that the buttons contain clearly legible and understandable text , such as ‘ Add To Cart ’ or ‘ Continue to checkout ’ .
The buttons below are well styled and well placed directly under the information of each product .
If the customer ca n’t find the checkout button , they ca n’t buy your product !
5 . Use a readable table based layout
When designing a full shopping cart , it ’s always best to use a table based structure .
The layout should efficiently display the information without interruption .
Use standard fonts and avoid using complex backgrounds .
Always be sure to use strong borders to separate cells , but do n’t style the borders .
Information in a shopping cart table should be easy to see without distraction from other elements , or complex styling .
This is a very clean cart .
The table is easily readable and it contains all the necessary elements .
More importantly , note the image .
The image of the product gives the customer a good visual of what they are buying , which can help customers confirm that they are indeed purchasing the product that they intended .
6. “ Continue Shopping ” link
One more feature is a “ Continue Shopping ” link .
When clicked , the link should bring the customer back to the store and catalog .
This is generally placed under the table of the full shopping cart , where the customer can easily find it .
The example below shows the “ Continue Shopping ” and the “ Go to Checkout ” links .
Notice how easy it is to find these .
7 . Avoid too many fields
There ’s nothing more annoying to the average consumer than having to fill out an unnecessary amount of input fields in a form .
You want the checkout process to be as easy as possible , because if the customer does not find it convenient , they will most likely not buy from the site again .
Keep the number of input fields to the minimum , place similar input fields into groups and provide headers for each section .
An appropriate amount of white space will also help to make the form feel more organized .
The following form is minimal and contains a small number of input fields .
8. Provide plenty of help elements
There are many places that help elements should be included within the shopping cart and checkout process .
In the shopping cart , include quick tips on how to best use the cart ’s features and explain the checkout process .
Labels in the cart and on the checkout form can be explained using tooltips .
On the checkout page , you can include sample text as to what should be included in each input field as well as examples of specific billing information , such as an image showing where the CVD number on the back of a credit card is located .
In the form below , the input fields have explanatory sample text and the middle column includes additional helpful information .
9. Give Visual Support
Visual support can be anything from diagrams to simple icons .
An image showing the location of an account number on a credit card helps customers through the process of entering their billing information .
Icons to support text are helpful to make the form easier to scan through .
The following image shows a very convenient click and drag cart .
The image of the cart icon tells customers that they can drag items into the cart .
The cart also has a label above it which says “ Drag Stuff Here . ”
10 . Always Include a Verify Page
The most important feature of any checkout process is certainly a verify and edit page as the final step .
Usually customers would like to confirm that they are buying the correct items .
Every good checkout process has this feature as a last chance for the customer to review his or her order before they commits to it through the payment process .
On the verify page , you should include all the information about the product in a table , similar to the full page checkout .
The customer should be able to cancel their order , or be able to use a “ Continue Shopping ” link to add more items .
Make the button to complete the process very evident , eliminating even the slightest confusion .

I stipulate that for purely secular reasons I still admire Tony Blair for standing by the peoples of Afghanistan and Iraq and Sierra Leone against the various combinations of tyranny and aggression with which they were confronted .
( The refusal to “ do God ” , as we are apparently stuck with this irritating phrase , neither enhanced nor inhibited the execution of those admirable policies . )
But far more irritating is Blair ’s new banality , which rises almost to Queen ’s Christmas broadcast level – “ science has given us great power for good or ill ” – combined with his addiction to junk statistics , and his unexamined assumption that there must be some natural connection between faith and rectitude .
Of his supposed two billion Christians , for example , how many belong to congregations that are at each other ’s throats , or that rant about the imminence of the “ end times ” ?
The leader of Blair ’s own Christian sect cannot decide which is worse – Aids or condoms – and has just readmitted a neo - fascist bishop who thinks that the “ deicide ” committed by the Jews against Jesus is a historic fact , but that the genocide practised by the Nazis on the Jews is a fiction .
Speaking of the Jews , does Blair really believe that 13 million of them go anywhere near a synagogue ?
They ( we ) , the inventors of monotheism , have become the most secular population in human history and have flourished mightily since throwing off rabbinical rule .
And does n’t he know the first thing about that supposed tsunami of new converts in Africa , many of whom are animists in another guise ?
Just ask the luckless Archbishop of Canterbury ( that feckless and sheeplike advocate of sharia ) , whose own pathetic little Anglican faction is being riven by cruel and fanatical African bishops who think that homosexuality is a mortal sin .
Or consult the dissenting Christians of Russia , now faced by the emergence of a full - dress Putin dictatorship , garbed in the clerical robes of a state - sponsored Orthodoxy .
One and a half billion Muslims ?
Possibly , if you take the claims of Muslim propagandists at their face value .
But be careful of standing too near the “ wrong ” mosque in Iraq or Pakistan , lest the soldiers of Allah be intent on murdering their Sunni or Shia brethren and heedless of those who get in the way .
And so it goes on .
There is something crass and nasty as well as something vulgar in Blair ’s quantitative triumphalism ( “ more than 900 million Hindus ” : such good news for those who think like the sectarian Bharatiya Janata Party ) .
Those of us who have our doubts about the God delusion have never been under the impression that it is under - supported .
But the way that Blair talks , it seems that religion ’s chief pride is its availability in bulk and wholesale form .
Why does n’t he mention Mormonism , the crackpot Joseph Smith - oriented faith that is said to be the fastest - growing of them all ?
One ’s qualms are not quelled by the suffocatingly boring five - point agenda that is tacked lamely on to the quantitative proclamation .
I think we have all , already , declared ourselves to be against malaria .
With only very slightly less enthusiasm , we can perhaps find a pulse that interests us in interfaith “ interaction ” .
Could I hint that “ globalisation ” has been a big subject for some time ?
And could I also suggest that the notion of an ethical imperative in the world of economics is not primarily or only a religious one ?
On the fifth proposition , that of an “ Abrahamic ” coalition , I can only give way humbly , to those who think it moral and exemplary for mythical tribalists to circumcise themselves at the age of 90 and to offer their sons as human sacrifices when they hear voices in their heads .
As our former prime minister phrases it so smoothly : “ While in office , it was best , in my view , not to shout that too loudly from the roof­tops . ”
So shout it out loud now , Tony , and see if it makes those demons go away .
But why were n’t you so brave before ?
With the exception of the last of the five initiatives , then , there would be nothing that any secular charity could not undertake .
This still leaves a good deal of ground untilled .
There remains an urgent need for campaigns that would , inter alia :
Fight against the genital mutilation of children of both sexes ;
Fight against dowry and bride - price for underage girls ;
Campaign for the right of men and women to employ contraception ;
Call for an Islamic ruling against suicide bombing ;
Call for a rabbinic ruling against the theft of non-Jewish land .
This list is suggestive rather than exhaustive , but it is at least as relevant as the menace of malaria and it also serves to demonstrate that the religious are not morally brave , as they like to brag , but are instead quite unable to face the fact that they are the cause , and not the cure , of so much suffering and stupidity and misery .

A mobile computer classroom powered by solar panels atop a modified SUV is providing computer training to 100 students a day in the east African country of Uganda .
The Maendeleo Foundation , which runs the Mobile Solar Computer Classrooms ( MSCC ) , hopes the project will help to launch a local computer services industry , creating jobs by outsourcing the new computer skills , boost the local economy and alleviate poverty .
Each day , the modified Toyota RAV4 is carefully packed with the Mobile Solar Computer Classroom , before setting out to visit rural schools around Uganda .
At each destination , the RAV4 is unloaded .
Out come three 65 Watt solar panels , a 200 mA battery , 15 Intel Classmate PC laptop computers , a 3 m by 3 m foldable tent , five folding tables , 10 folding chairs as well as two computer teachers .
Voila , an instant classroom !
The solar panels are placed on the roof of the vehicle – which can be located up to 20 meters from the tented classroom – and are connected to a battery that powers the robust Intel Classmate PC laptops .
Students and local teachers work from self - paced , multilingual learning software developed by the foundation .
The software teaches students a range of skills , from basic keyboard and mouse functions through to working with Microsoft Office applications and using the internet .
The plan is to give students enough knowledge to explore further on their own .
Some of the students may be lucky enough to take up computer - related study at university or college , while others who show promise may be given computer service jobs by the foundation ’s partner companies , such as Essential Skills Development .
The program aims to show children that computers are within their reach and can offer them a brighter future , but it 's a huge task with the foundation eager to help more children .
The project recently won $ 100,000 in the Intel INSPIRE•EMPOWER Challenge , which the foundation plans to put towards a similar mobile classroom in Rwanda .
The Intel INSPIRE•EMPOWER
Challenge aims to reward communities that use technology to address problems in education , health care , economic development and the environment .
Another winner of the competition is the CellScope .

President Obama spoke yesterday on resisting injustice and intolerance at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum ’s Day of Remembrance Ceremony , an annual commemoration of the victims of the Holocaust .
From Obama ’s speech …
“ To this day , there are those who insist the Holocaust never happened , who perpetrate every form of intolerance — racism and anti- Semitism , homophobia , xenophobia , sexism and more — hatred that degrades its victim and diminishes us all .
Today and every day , we have an opportunity as well as an obligation to confront these scourges , to fight the impulse to turn the channel when we see images that disturb us or wrap ourselves in the false comfort that others ’ sufferings are not our own .
Instead , we have the opportunity to make a habit of empathy , to recognize ourselves in each other , to commit ourselves to resisting injustice and intolerance and indifference … ”
' It 's Taxpayer Money ' : Cuomo Will Subpoena AIG Over Bonuses NY Attorney General wants names and job descriptions of bonus receivers .
March 16 , 2009  --
The hot seat is getting even hotter for AIG Chairman and CEO Edward Liddy .
Not only has President Barack Obama called on his Treasury Secretary to do everything possible to block the bailed - out insurance company from doling out $ 165 million in bonuses , but now the New York Attorney General has announced that he will issue subpoenas immediately for the release of the names and job descriptions of those receiving bonuses .
" Taxpayers of this company are now supporting AIG , and they deserve at the very least to know how their money is being spent , " wrote Attorney General Andrew Cuomo in a letter he sent to Liddy Monday .
" And we owe it to the taxpayers to take every possible action to stop unwarranted bonus payments to those who caused the AIG meltdown in the first place . "
AIG has received over $ 170 billion from the government so far .
Cuomo had given AIG until 4 pm to turnover the information , and he announced late Monday that AIG failed to meet those demands and that subpoenas would be issued immediately .
" I believe in transparency and disclosure , " said Cuomo , " and this is taxpayer money . "
" We are in ongoing contact with the Attorney General and will respond appropriately to the subpoena , " said AIG spokesperson Christina Pretto .
Liddy has told Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner that the company 's " hands are tied " when it comes to distributing the bonuses because of contractual obligations .
Cuomo's letter has asked Liddy to turnover the contracts " you now claim obligate you to make these payments . "
" Moreover , you should immediately provide us with a list of who negotiated these contracts and who developed this retention plan so we can begin to investigate the circumstances surrounding these questionable bonus arrangements , " said Cuomo .
Cuomo said late Monday that " a lot has happened " since those contracts were signed .
" One could argue that if the taxpayers had n't bailed out AIG then those contracts would n't be worth the paper they were printed on , " said Cuomo .
Cuomo's letter in particular refers to AIG 's plan to award millions of dollars in bonuses to members of the Financial Products subsidiary .
" Financial Products was , of course , the division of AIG that led to its meltdown and the huge infusion of taxpayers funds to save the firm , " wrote Cuomo .
" Previously , AIG had agreed at our request to make no payments out of its $ 600 million Financial Products deferred compensation pool . "
Cuomo has led the crusade against bailed - out companies continued use of bonuses since last fall .
He has said he is investigating all of AIG 's finances back to January 2007 .
The War Over Executive Compensation
Cuomo is also seeking the names and compensation information of those at Merrill Lynch who received bonuses shortly before the firm merged with Bank of America .
In that case , Cuomo has accused Bank of America of undermining his authority , interfering with his investigation and attempting to influence the government 's witnesses , according to court documents .
Bank of America has argued that releasing the names and numbers to the public would be detrimental to the company .
" Bank of America has cooperated with the attorney general 's investigation into Merrill Lynch bonuses and will continue to do so , " spokesman Scott Silvestri said in a statement .
" Regarding the bonus information requested , Bank of America has continually offered to provide that information subject to reasonable confidentiality . "
Cuomo's office said that the bank has not demonstrated that it had ever " treated the information in a confidential manner . "
A ruling is expected later this week on whether or not the company will have to turn over the information .

( CNN ) --
A woman in California delivered what may be the nation 's second live - born set of octuplets on Monday morning , surprising doctors who expected seven babies .
The first three to seven days will be critical for the infants , Dr. Mandhir Gupta said .
The six boys and two girls -- ranging in weight from 1 pound 8 ounces to 3 pounds 4 ounces -- were generally doing well in incubators following their Caesarean - section delivery at Kaiser Permanente hospital in Bellflower , California , doctors said .
Three of the babies need breathing assistance , but otherwise the eight do n't appear to have serious problems , doctors said at a news conference Monday evening .
" It was a truly amazing delivery , " said Dr. Karen Maples , chief of the hospital 's obstetrics and gynecology department .
Doctors initially believed the mother -- whom they did not identify -- was pregnant with seven fetuses .
The woman was 23 weeks pregnant when she was hospitalized seven weeks ago and ordered to bed rest .
Watch doctors explain what happened »
Over a seven - week period , a team of 46 physicians , nurses and other staff prepared for the births .
When they started the delivery Monday -- more than nine weeks before the babies would be full term -- they were in for a surprise .
" After we got to Baby G , we were surprised by the discovery of a Baby H , " Maples said .
Do n't Miss Doctors separate conjoined twins
Getting the number correct with ultrasounds before delivery is difficult with so many babies , said Dr. Harold Henry , the hospital 's chief of fetal medicine .
" It is quite easy to miss a baby when you 're expecting seven , " Henry said .
The hospital said the woman did n't want her personal information released to the news media , and it would not answer questions about whether she 'd had fertility treatments .
Preliminary research indicates this is the second set of live - born octuplets in the United States , according to the hospital .
Eight babies believed to be the United States ' first set of live octuplets were born in Houston , Texas , in 1998 .
One of the infants died days after birth .
The seven other siblings recently celebrated their 10th birthday , the Houston Chronicle reported last month .
The first three to seven days will be critical for the California babies , said Dr. Mandhir Gupta , one of the doctors at the news conference .
The infants could be in incubators for six to eight weeks and in the hospital for 10 weeks , Gupta said .
The mother is doing " very well " after the deliveries , which took about five minutes , Gupta said .
" She is very excited that she [ has ] all these babies and that the babies are looking good so far , " Gupta said .

US expects more cases of ' widespread ' swine flu Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday April 25 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) 
A new multi-strain swine flu virus is widespread and cannot be contained , US health authorities said Saturday , warning that they expect to identify more cases .
" With infections in many different communities as we 're seeing , we do n't think that containment is feasible , " said Anne Schuchat of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
" We are not at a point where we can keep this virus in one place ...
Now that we are looking more widely , I really expect us to find more . "
She told reporters that the CDC was focusing on the transmissibility of the virus , noting that influenza is generally quite transmissible .
Her comments came after the head of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said the outbreak of the new virus transmitted between humans that has killed up to 68 people , infected hundreds in Mexico and infected eight in the United States is a " serious situation " with a " pandemic potential . "
" We are worried and because we are worried , we are working aggressively on a number of fronts , " said Schuchat , the interim deputy director for the CDC 's science and public health program .
" It is clear that this is widespread .
And that is why we have let you know that we cannot contain the spread of this virus . "
CDC officials were assisting public health authorities in Mexico to test additional specimens and providing epidemiologic support as part of a WHO team , she noted .
The centers have also dispatched teams in southern California , where six cases were reported .
Health leaders in the US , Mexico , Canada and at the WHO were communicating frequently , and state and local US health authorities were conducting investigations .
In order to tackle the transmissibility of the virus , which Schuchat said was clearly " widespread , " the United States and Mexico were using an already existing an infectious disease surveillance system along the border to test individuals with respiratory illness for influenza .
She said that two separate cases had already been detected through that system .
Mexican authorities on Friday launched a massive campaign to prevent the spread of the virus , urging people to avoid contact in public .
The CDC said tests show some of the Mexican victims died from the same new strain of swine flu that affected eight people in Texas and California , who later recovered .
There is no vaccine to protect humans from swine flu , only to protect pigs , according to the CDC .
Schuchat said measures were being taken to produce a vaccine against the virus if necessary , but cautioned that it usually takes " months " to produce a vaccine .
" We 're not going to have large amounts of vaccine tomorrow , " she warned .

Deborah delves into the secrets of Hampi ’s magnetic beauty and recounts an eerie tale of the dead body on the beach .
An Indian Disneyland
Hampi is quite possibly the most beautiful place on earth .
Even the most cynical and experienced traveler will admit as much .
No camera can capture even a fraction of Hampi ’s jaw - dropping beauty .
Words are even less sufficient .
My initial impression was that I ’d been transposited into a CGI ( Computer Generated Imagery ) movie or a surrealist pseudo - Dali landscape done by a Thai street artist .
Hampi is an Indian Disneyland – the rice fields are so startlingly green and the sky so stupidly blue and the stones so manically yellow …
Welcome to the Jurassic
If you do n’t die of heat or exhaustion after walking up the 650 steps to reach the Monkey Temple you ’ll be privy to the most magnificent sight of your life .
When I reached the top and looked out at as the sun was setting over a mental panorama of tall green rice grass , palm trees and hundreds of human - monkeys , I turned to my “ stair - mates ” and , to quote Sam Neil , said “ Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the Jurassic ! ”
And I really did expect a Stegosaurus to stretch its neck over the treetops hundreds of feet below me .
The Value of Death
Meanwhile , back at the guesthouse the silent Kiwi guy , Andrew , is telling us a story that happened to him two days ago .
He was walking along in Gokarna and stumbled upon a dead body on the beach .
He told the owner of his guesthouse whose first question was “ westerner or Indian ? ”
When Andrew answered that it was the latter the owner shrugged his shoulders and continued about his work .
The same thing happened in two more guesthouses so Andrew decided to climb the steep cliff path to find some police .
They too asked the question .
When he answered that the body was indeed Indian they told the by - now - incredulous Kiwi that they are the tourist police , they do not deal with locals and , if he likes , there is a police station in the village where he can report his finding .
End of story .
Death is so much a part of life here that it ’s difficult for westerners to grasp .
Manju , the Indian amongst us explained it thus : “ In India , we do not fear death like the West .
For us it is as known as birth and survival , and since those are the things we can control , we put our energy into that instead of worrying about death . ”
Lego of the Gods
I have decided to explore the region and there is no better way than by motorbike .
When you turn you have to be careful not to crash into a flock of goats led by a boy as tall as your knee .
And even though technically they drive on the left , there is n’t really enforcement of such trivial laws .
The traffic police are absent around here and survival on the roads is left up to Karma .
So I rode the bike up to the lake and stopped where the rocks are precariously balanced over the edge .
It seems as if Shiva and Ganesh were building lego together and thought it ’d be fun to place a few rocks over the lake to see if people would jump .
And the people jumped .
Some more crazy than others .
I witnessed three Indians do the suicide jump from 20 meters above water level where you ’re lucky if you do n’t smash your body into the rocks that lurk beneath the surface .
The little jump at seven metres ( some say eight , some six ) was scary enough .
After you ’ve flung yourself over the edge your life does indeed briefly pass in front of your eyes .
The Festival of Holi
I am ill .
Running to the loo .
It is Holi – the Hindu festival celebrating the beginning of spring where everyone throws coloured water and powder at each other .
We want to get across the river to celebrate but the police have banned the boat because of ‘ incidents ’ between drunk Indians and tourists .
So the only option is to swim .
We make it over as the festival is in full swing : primeval dancing , drum playing and chucking colours on everything and everyone .
Its loads of fun .
Women are not really allowed to take part and we get told off a few times .
I carry Sunita , a local eight year old girl I have grown attached to , on my shoulders .
Western Superstars
Since I have been in India I now understand what it must be like to be famous and hunted by the Paparazzi .
Indians are constantly snapping pictures on their camera phones .
I have made a new rule : every time someone catches me unawares I make them teach me something in their local tongue .
Here in Karnataka they speak Kannada .
I now can say about 10 basic sentences .
The locals love it when I speak to them in their language .
Dining by Moonlight
Raj , who sells water by the lake , hosts a Thali moonlight dinner for us on the rocks .
We discuss the virtues of being a cow in India and how all the other cows in the rest of the world must be green with envy – especially Argentinean ones .
The full moon lights up the lake and embalms the Hampi boulders in an ethereal glow .
I muse again for the millionth time about Hampi ’s splendor .
I think that Homer must have had Hampi in mind when he conjured Calypso ’s island in the Odyssey .
The Indian at my guesthouse told me that Hampi has a magnetic energy .
You want to leave but you can ’t .
I believe him .
How would you describe Hampi ?
What do you make of Andrew ’s dead body encounter ?
Post up your comments below , we want to hear from you !
