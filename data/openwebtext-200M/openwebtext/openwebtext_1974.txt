The two - week confrontation between Burma 's monks and military is no ordinary uprising , but a deeper struggle between spiritual and worldly forces in a country torn between the two polar opposites .
" Conditions are now critical for the monks , " says Ashin Asabhacara , head of the Burma - America Buddhist Association based in Maryland .
" The military break into the monasteries at night , torture monks and throw them in jail .
Their hunger for power is making them do terrible things and it will end very badly for them . "
Unlike earlier protests in Burma in the past two decades , the Buddhist clergy are taking the lead in demanding social justice and a new political order .
And as protests continue , with mounting casualties , the monasteries are the focus of brutal attacks from the heavily armed 400,000 - strong military .
But the unarmed monks are retaliating with spiritual tactics that are also powerful in a country where most of the population begins the day with prayers and offerings , and the vast majority believes that good deeds are spiritual capital .
For the monks , refusing food and alms from the military is a gesture that goes to the heart of Burmese Buddhism .
It was backed by an " excommunicative boycott " declared by a group of exiled monks , cutting off religious support from the junta and its supporters .
" The monks of Burma are poor , and they are unarmed , but they exert a life - and - death power over the population , " says Guy Horton , a British - based human rights consultant who has spent a decade collecting evidence of the Burmese military 's atrocities .
" This goes much deeper than ideology .
The government has tried to buy off the monks by building temples and other things .
But by attacking the monks they are putting their afterlives in grave danger , " says Horton , who is calling on Canada to join a campaign to bring the junta leaders to justice .
Monks normally begin the day by begging for food , and people who fill their bowls earn credits for the afterlife , known as karma .
When monks reject food by overturning their bowls it puts the would - be donors in danger of a terrifying spiritual future .
" It 's a very high - pressure tactic , " explains Bruce Matthews , a Burma expert and professor emeritus of comparative religion at Acadia University in Nova Scotia .
" It denies the military their credits .
If they die without enough , their rebirth would be at a lower order of existence . "
The junta 's generals are heavily influenced by Buddhism , says Horton .
" They 're terrified of the monkhood .
They 're endlessly filming themselves going to the pagodas , and half of Burmese television is about the military bringing gifts there . "
Monks play a role in all major aspects of life , attending marriages and funerals , acting as spiritual counsellors and educating the poor .
They run schools , hospitals and orphanages , an alternative welfare system in a desperately poor country with out - of - control inflation .
They also have strength in numbers : about 500,000 people devote their lives to the clergy , but hundreds of thousands of others have spent time in monasteries .
In spite of their unworldly image , Burma 's Buddhist clergy have been in the vanguard of political life for decades , sometimes working in partnership with the rulers .
" When you go back in history to how Burma came together , you see that there was a close alliance between monks and warrior kings , " says Priscilla Clapp , former chief of mission in the U.S. embassy in Burma .
" They took care of people , but they made sure they served the king . "
Now , says Clapp , the two generals running the junta see themselves as " modern warrior kings " and have tried – but failed – to resurrect the old partnership .
The excesses of the regime , and wretchedness of the Burmese people , have driven the monks to the streets .
" The junta is scared .
It 's faced with a saffron revolution , " she says , referring to the golden colour of some Buddhist robes .
Rank and file soldiers , and some commanders , may be listening to their own spiritual doubts as the demonstrations continue .
Unconfirmed rumours abound of two infantry divisions refusing orders to shoot the demonstrators , threatening a split in the army .
These paradoxes of power make the outcome of Burma 's democracy marches hard to predict .
Some analysts take the military 's hesitation to order wholesale slaughter of the demonstrators as a sign that the regime is breaking down .
Others point out that an institution with an iron grip on government , media and economic life is unlikely to crack over months , let alone days , of protest .
" Burma is the most militarized country in the world , " says David Steinberg , director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University .
" All power is centralized and personalized .
It 's difficult to see the junta compromising and some kind of civil - military partnership coming about . "
Even under brutal attack , the monks could claim a moral victory , says Matthews .
" Whether they will prevail against the military is difficult to see .
But they have done something extraordinary .
Even if they and the democratic activists fail this time , the handwriting is on the wall for the junta . "

Three British tourists who mocked a 76 - year - old rickshaw driver because he could n't pedal fast enough for them - then posted a video of the struggling and panting old man on YouTube - have caused uproar in Singapore .
The trio also ran off without paying the £ 5 fare he requested and escaped in a taxi yelling expletives which were heard on YouTube as they filmed themselves leaving the scene at Clarke Quay , popular nightspot .
“ Ten dollars my f*** ing arse , ” yelled one as the video camera showed a close - up of his face .
Scroll down for more ...
The video titled “ the Slowest Taxi In SE Asia ” was posted on the popular site by one of the three , who called himself Bo Davis .
Angered by the way they treated the rickshaw driver dozens of Singaporean bombarded the website and local papers , expressing their feelings and what they would like to do to them .
“ Do n't come back to Singapore , ” wrote one .
“ We will be waiting for you . ”
Another attacked them for behaving like Singapore was still a British colony .
And a local tabloid The New Paper splashed the story on the front page with two pages inside , showing the laughing faces of the mocking Brits goading the rickshaw rider .
The video also showed close - ups of the three Brits and the agonised look on the face of the driver , Mr Lee Shee Lam , as he pedalled as fast as he could under the weight of the three men , all in their mid to late twenties .
They were also heard laughing and mocking him .
“ God , he 's in fifth gear , ” said one .
They had squeezed into the rickshaw at Clarke Quay for the ten minute ride along the river .
But soon it was clear they were out to poke fun at Mr. Lam along the way .
Scroll down for more ...
Liew Hanqing , a reporter at Singapore tabloid , The New Paper , said she managed to communicate with Bo Davis via YouTube which gives his age as 26 .
She said : “ He seemed surprised at the reaction he got from viewers after he posted the video .
“ This was not bullying , ” he told her .
“ I do not like bullies or bullying . ”
Davis told her he posted the video to display his personal account which he had just opened - and did n't think anyone would look at it .
He told Hanqing : “ I could n't believe the comments - I was shocked by the threats .
People 's reactions were shocking but interesting . ”
But later Davis said he was sorry that he had caused so much offence to Singaporeans and posted an apology online .
Then he removed the video .
“ I am sorry for the offence caused , and for being disrespectful to the elderly .
But I think it 's been blown out of proportion .
Yes , I think we were insensitive but not being bullies . ”
But the video was put back on YouTube by an another angry Singaporean under the heading UK BASTARDS .
And the anger continued to grow .
Mr. Lam was working again last night in the Clarke Quay area where he is licensed .
He recalled the incident with a grimace and said : “ I 'd almost forgotten about it , but I was very angry when they ran off without paying . "
He had no idea they were making fun of him because he does not understand English too well and had no idea they were filming him .
“ They agreed to pay for the ride but then refused and ran away .
I could n't understand why because I did my best to give them a safe ride .
" I am a bit slow when so many people are in the rickshaw , but I am not a youngster any more , like they are .
Perhaps when they get old they will know what it 's like ! ”
“ I 'm not going to worry about them any more , ” he said .
“ I am sure they are now sorry they did this to me . ”
This is a somewhat odd cellular automaton implementation in Haskell .
It encodes the shape of the world , and the stepping rule , in the data structure .
Briefly :
data Cell v n = Cell { value :: v , neighbors :: n ( Cell v n ) , future :: Cell v n }
-- Build a cell and its chain of futures , given its rule , similar neighbors , -- and initial value .
mkCell :: Functor n => ( v -> n v -> v ) -> v -> n ( Cell v n ) ->
Cell v n mkCell rule val nei = initial where initial =
Cell val nei ( calcFuture initial ) calcFuture c = c' where c' =
Cell ( rule ( value c ) ( fmap value ( neighbors c ) ) ) ( fmap future ( neighbors c ) ) ( calcFuture c' ) data Moore c = Moore c c c c c c c c -- Conway 's Life evalLife :: Bool -> Moore Bool ->
Bool evalLife v n = f v ( sumN fromEnum n ) where f _ 3 = True f True 2 = True f _ _ = False

Scientists in the UK have found a way of reversing the early symptoms of prion diseases .
These diseases such as the human form of mad cow disease , variant Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease , or vCJD , and the disease in cattle called bovine spongiform encephalopathy , are more often than not fatal .
The researchers at University College , London , believe they have found a way to treat the disease in humans as long as it is detected before it has done harm to a large number of brain cells .
The scientists from the Medical Research Council ( MRC ) of the college , infected mice with abnormal prions and found they began to develop the disease but when the mice stopped producing their own prions , the symptoms cleared up .
The mice had been genetically altered to generate an enzyme in their bodies at around nine weeks of age , which effectively removed the gene that makes prions .
The mice which continued to produce normal prions became increasingly ill and died .
This says lead researcher Giovanna Malucci suggests that blocking the body 's ability to make its own natural , healthy prions can reverse the early symptoms of the disease .
Prions or rogue proteins , affect the brain cells by changing their shape , creating holes and turning them " spongy " .
Malucci and her team were able to stop this chain reaction by genetically switching off production of normal prion proteins .
It appears that if there is no natural prion protein present in the brain , the conversion process to the rogue form cannot take place and damage to brain cells will be prevented .
Malucci and her team believe the results could be useful in developing a treatment for vCJD or other prion diseases if the disease is detected in the early stages .
Dr. Mallucci hopes that the findings will eventually benefit people showing the first symptoms of vCJD , or other prion diseases such as " classic " CJD , the cause of which is unknown .
However Malucci says more needs to be found out about the exact role of prions in the system and the MRC unit has already taken a first step by identifying drugs that bind to normal prions .
Since vCJD - the human form of BSE - emerged in 1990 , there have been 158 confirmed or suspected cases of death caused by the disease ; another seven people believed to have the disease are still alive .
The study is published in the journal Neuron .
The sport 's roots can be traced to American Indians , who would sometimes hold red cloths in their hands for fish to bite , Professor Morgan said .
During the Depression , the technique was used as a way to put food on the table .
It has passed down through the generations ever since .
Hand - fishermen typically go out in groups of three or four ( usually all men , despite Misty McFarlin's example ) , according to Professor Morgan 's research , for safety reasons as well as social ones .
Catfish are hardly the only creatures that burrow or inhabit holes in rivers or lakes .
Beavers are common residents , as are snapping turtles and deadly cottonmouth snakes .
Mr. McFarlin , 41 , a plumber , likes to say that " the true deterrent to noodling is a vivid imagination " because he thinks no one in his right mind would stick his hand into a hole if he could picture what might live in it .
Experienced noodlers claim that they can read holes right away : clean , sandy sides mean catfish , because when a catfish is on its nest , it churns the water with its tail , keeping sand off the eggs and algae out of the hole .
Holes with slimy sides and muck mean " steer clear , " because the hole is likely to be inhabited by a creature even a noodler does n't want to confront .
Catfish themselves pose significant dangers as well , not so much for their teeth , which are small and feel like rough sandpaper , but for their ability to hold a noodler underwater .
TERRY IVEY , 39 , a hunting preserve owner from Hinton , Okla . , who attended the Okie Noodling Tournament last year , said he had the closest call of his 25 years of noodling two years ago , on the North Canadian River in Oklahoma .
The hole was under a boulder , he said , six feet down from the surface of the water and six more back under the rock , so he checked it with the help of a friend , who dived down with him to hold his legs .
After being underwater for more than a minute , Mr. Ivey found the catfish and grabbed for it , but the fish , which he later estimated at 80 pounds , clamped down on his wrist and tried to drag him back into the hole .
His goal switched almost immediately from trophy acquisition to survival , but as he tried to pull away , the jersey glove he was wearing got caught in the fish 's teeth .
He kicked frantically , the signal for his friend to pull him out .
" If my buddy did n't have my legs , I 'd still be in that hole , " Mr. Ivey said .
Despite the dangers -- or perhaps because of them -- noodling is a growing sport .
Noodlers at the Oklahoma tournament last year said that they used to be able to visit holes at their leisure but now get up at dawn to get to the river first .
The article " Bedtime for Gonzo " states " At this point , every day Alberto Gonzales continues as attorney general means more dishonor for the office and the nation -- and higher blood pressure for Senate Judiciary Committee members trying desperately to get a straight answer out of the man . "
The " Democrats are threatening to investigate him for perjury .
But it was Sen. Arlen Specter , a Republican , who looked Gonzo in the face and told him , " I do not find your testimony credible , candidly .
" Specter seems ready to pop a gasket .
" The hearing two days ago was devastating " for Gonzo , Specter said yesterday .
" But so was the hearing before that , and so was the hearing before that . "
The article despairingly notes the confrontation of Ashcroft in his hospital room and quotes Gonzales " There are no rules governing whether or not General Ashcroft can decide ' I 'm feeling well enough to make this decision , " Gonzo said .
When Specter pointed out that Ashcroft had already turned his powers over to Comey , Gonzo replied , " And he could always reclaim it .
There are no rules . "
" While he was in the hospital under sedation ? "
Specter interrupted , before giving up on getting a straight answer .
Gonzo answered the question , all right -- inadvertently , of course : " There are no rules . "
Many progressive observers note that dissemination of propaganda has been the main objective of big bro 43's administration as " That 's the guiding philosophy of this administration .
As far as these people are concerned , there are no rules of common decency .
There are no rules of customary practice .
There are no rules governing respect for the truth , or even respect for the privacy and health of an ailing colleague .
And we all know who sets that tone .
Sen .
Chuck Schumer tried valiantly to get Gonzo to say who sent him on that Mafia - movie errand to the hospital .
Gonzo's a loyal soldier ; he would n't snitch .
All Schumer got out of him was that the visit was " on behalf of the president of the United States . "

Behold the legend of Sockbaby .
Do you know where all of those socks go when you lose them in the laundry ?
They go to the Sockearth where the Sockpeople live .
The Sockpeople are fallen , sinful bastards just like us and they need a savior too .
Just as Jesus came to Earth as one of us , so he went to Sockearth as one of them .
Through a strange cacophony of events , Sockbaby ends up in yet another world inhabited by demonic men in suits and good guys like Ronnie Cordova and Burger , and so the saga begins ...

By beginning this post with the above figure , I do n’t do so to boast .
I know there are thousands of blogs that have received more subscribers than this — and in less time .
I highlight this figure ( 1,050 subscribers in 3 months ) to show that you do n’t need to have big money , the perfect niche or a staff of writers to quickly develop a 1,000 + network of loyal readers .
This blog exists within a mature and crowded niche , I ’m its sole author and I ’ve spent nothing on marketing and promotion .
I ’ve learned enough from this experience to share how you can get 1,000 more subscribers in 3 months .
Subscribers are people , too !
A subscriber is a person who has elected to have every article published on your site delivered to them .
That ’s an impressive committment .
For a reader to make the decision to subscribe , they need to feel that your content is 1 ) unmissable and 2 ) tailored to them .
If you ca n’t quickly describe your target audience then you ’ve just identified the key reason why you do n’t have as many subscribers as you ’d like .
You ’re writing about topics , when you should be writing for people .
What this means
Here ’s the difference when it comes to subscribers .
I ’ll use a hypothetical personal finance blog as an example .
Firstly , let ’s examine a personal finance blog without a target audience , writing on the topics of : Investing , Debt Elimination , Saving and Frugality .
Can we imagine a person for whom all these things are of a keen interest ?
If you ’re in a position to save , you ’re probably not worrying about debt elimination .
If you ’re trying to pay off debt , investing and saving might not have much relevance to you .
Even if you balance these topics equally , your readers will be skipping up to half of what you write .
Secondly , compare this with a personal finance blog written specifically for people in debt .
With a target audience in mind , you can ensure every post you write is relevant .
You can skip over talk of saving and investing and provide valuable advice on budgeting and frugality instead .
When an indebted person visits such a blog they can look across the breadth of the content and say : “ Everything here is relevant to me . ”
They ’re in a perfect position to decide to subscribe .
Once you work out who you ’re writing for you can cut out the topics that are n’t relevant to them .
When a visitor feels your articles are consistently tailored to their needs they ’ll be much more likely to subscribe .
Hopefully you can see that each post I write is aimed at a target audience ( look to the top right corner of the screen for a hint ! ) .
Another key strategy is to make your target audience obvious .
That way , each time a member of your target audience arrives they can see straight away ( hopefully before they ’ve even started reading your content ) that your site is tailored to them .
Another blog that does this is Freelance Folder ( which managed to gain around 1,200 subscribers in 3 months ) .
You can see how below .
Summary :
Focus on a target audience rather than a selection of topics .
Write every post for the benefit of that target audience .
Make it clear to new visitors who your blog is written for .
When more is less
The biggest misconception about getting subscribers is that you need to write a lot of articles each week ( preferably daily ) and that people will unsubscribe if you do n’t post enough .
In fact , the opposite is true .
Subscribers dislike being interrupted by content they do n’t want to read .
In terms of getting ( and keeping ) subscribers , one great post per week is better than five mediocre ones .
That your content is relevant is n’t enough .
It also has to be good .
To fall back on a common but appropriate cliché : when it comes to subscribers , it ’s quality over quantity .
Of course , quality and quantity is ideal .
If you can make the time , go for it .
Summary :
When it comes to subscribers , quality trumps quantity .
So , how can I write good stuff ?
My guiding principle is to fill each post with value for the target audience .
For example , instead of trying to explain you how to get 1,000 + subscribers in three months , I could have written about a nifty new WordPress plug - in , or the current state of the BlogRush widget .
There ’s nothing wrong with either of those topics , but it ’s clear which one would be more valuable to you .
One post with lots of value is better than a few posts with a little .
For a reader to want to subscribe they need to be moved by the value you offer .
They need to feel that your content is worth treasuring .
When creating content , let the value principle guide you .
Ask yourself : what ’s the most valuable thing I can give my target audience right now ?
If you find it hard to find the time to write value - packed posts , post less .
Yes — even if it means you only post once a week .
One value - packed post a week will grow your blog faster than seven posts with only a little bit of value ( Tim Ferriss writes at about this frequency and is in the Top 1,000 blogs on Technorati ) .
People simply do n’t link to or vote for posts that are n’t sufficiently value - packed — regardless of how many you write .
Summary :
Consistently value - packed articles are required in order to move people enough to subscribe .
How to source - out potential subscribers
Now that I ’ve described the process behind creating the kind of content that motivates people to subscribe , the next ( and crucial step ) is sourcing out potential subscribers .
Potential subscribers are really just members of your target audience .
They ’ll discover your blog through either of two main paths : links , or social media .
A bite - sized guide to getting links
Breaking it down again , there are two kinds of links : links you make and links you get .
My subscriber count has always jumped when I got a bunch of links ( or one link in a highly trafficked location ) .
If you want to get links , you need to :
Write an exceptionally value - packed article .
Do something remarkable and word - of - mouth worthy .
Ask for them .
The second type of links ( the kind you make ) can be just as powerful .
These include :
The by - line in your guest - posts .
Your forum signature .
The linked name that comes with the comments you make .
The most powerful links you can get are those on blogs , websites and within categories frequented by your target audience — preferably the most popular ones .
Not all links are equal :
A link with lots of targeted click - throughs is best .
A link with a handful of targeted click - throughs is second best .
A link with lots of badly targeted click - throughs is third best .
A link with a handful of badly targeted click - throughs is n’t worth much .
All these links are better than nothing , but some are better than others .
Links are doorways your target audience can use to discover your site .
If you ’re not getting links , you ’re not getting subscribers .
Summary :
If you ’re writing value - packed content you will generate links naturally .
Exceptionally value - packed content will always get more links .
Make your own links by guest - posting on popular blogs .
A bite - sized guide to social media
Articles will rarely do well on social media unless they ’re exceptionally value - packed or remarkable .
If you ’re not focusing on value , focus on doing something remarkable .
Luckily , content people want to link to also has a tendency to do well on social media .
Being active on social media will help things along .
People often vote for your articles if you vote for theirs : not because you ’ve got some sort of reciprocal scheme going , but because it ’s an easy way to repay the favor .
I ’m certain that having an active StumbleUpon profile has played an integral part in this blog ’s growth , for example .
Summary :
Writing linkable content will also help you with social media .
Put effort into social media and you will be rewarded .
A bite - sized guide to networking
People who like you are more likely to link to you or vote up your articles on social media ( and in doing so , source out new pockets of subscribers ) .
The much - vaunted practice of ‘ networking ’ is ultimately made up of what you do to get people to feel positive about you .
Here are some simple principles I ’ve stuck by :
Be nice .
Do n’t ignore people .
Be friendly .
Treat every person you interact with respectfully .
Do n’t view others as a means to an end .
Help out in the best way you can .
Be generous .
Do n’t take up too much time .
Focus on mutual benefit .
Give more than you take .
Viewed in this light , every email , comment , message , IM conversation and social media experience is networking .
They key is to help people out .
Give them something valuable for free , whether it be knowledge , advice , or your time .
Just like we saw with the success of Radiohead ’s In Rainbows album , you ultimately get more when you do n’t ask for anything .
In a world where people only want to give a little less than they can take , being generous will make you remarkable .
The little things
If a reader is moved enough by your content to subscribe they ’ll find the button even if it ’s hidden in your footer .
In fact , I ’ve subscribed to blogs that did n’t even have a subscribe button , either by burning their feed at Feedburner or getting the feed from the address bar .
Little things like button placement wo n’t make or break your efforts to get subscribers .
It ’s all the above stuff that matters most .
Despite this , the basic tenet of usability holds true : if you want someone to do something , you better make it as easy as possible .
Put your feed button above the fold .
This is where people expect it to be and is also the first place they look .
This is where people expect it to be and is also the first place they look .
Give readers the option to subscribe at the end of your articles .
By doing so , you ’re catching them when they ’ve just read a value - packed post and are feeling most positive about your content .
By doing so , you ’re catching them when they ’ve just read a value - packed post and are feeling most positive about your content .
A great looking design can increase a visitor ’s disposition to subscribe .
We inevitably associate a professional design with how seriously the blogger or webmaster takes what they do .
First impressions do count .

You can offer another incentive to subscribe .
I ’ve written about this in detail at Blogging Tips .
I ’ve written about this in detail at Blogging Tips .
When do I start showing the subscriber count ?
When you start to be proud of how many subscribers you have .
Conclusion
This is , in essence , a three - pronged strategy :
1 . Work out who your target audience is and write your content exclusively for them .
2 . Pack your articles with as much value as possible .
If time is a problem , post less .
3 . Source out your target audience by getting or making links and writing for social media .
By following this three - pronged strategy Skelliewag grew to 1,050 subscribers in 3 months .
There ’s no reason why your site can’t grow by just as much , if not more .
If you have any questions about this process please do n’t hesitate to ask by leaving a comment .

Yesterday we were warned of the health dangers associated with alcohol - not to mention bacon , ham and sausages .
Today there is more cheering news from a different set of scientists .
They have come up with the perfect excuse for heading to the pub after a game of football or rugby .
Their research has shown that a glass of beer is far better at rehydrating the body after exercise than water .
Scroll down for more ...
Researchers suspect that the sugars , salts and bubbles in a pint may help people absorb fluids more quickly .
The finding , which comes from a study at Granada University in Spain , will be welcome news for the legions of evening and weekend sports enthusiasts who enjoy a postmatch pint .
It will also ease the worries of those still digesting the report from the cancer experts who linked alcohol and other products to an increased risk of some forms of the disease .
Professor Manuel Garzon , of Granada 's medical faculty , made his discovery after tests on 25 students over several months .
They were asked to run on a treadmill under stifling temperatures of 40C ( 104 F ) until they were close to exhaustion .
Once they were on the point of giving up , researchers measured their hydration levels , concentrationability and motor skills .
Half were then given two half pints of Spanish lager to drink , while the rest were given water .
Both groups were then allowed to drink as much water as they wanted .
Professor Garzon said the rehydration effect in the students who were given beer was " slightly better " than among those given only water .
He believes the carbon dioxide in beer helps quench the thirst more quickly , while beer 's carbohydrates replace calories lost during physical exertion .
Based on the studies , the researchers have recommended moderate consumption of beer - 500 ml a day for men or 250 ml for women - as part of an athlete 's diet .
A typical person loses around a litre of water for every hour of exercise in sweat .
People who fail to rehydrate after exercise are more likely to feel tired , fuzzyheaded and suffer headaches .
A spokesman for the Campaign for Real Ale said " moderate levels " of beer had beneficial health effects .
Past studies have shown that sensible drinking of one or two units a day can reduce the risk of heart disease , dementia , diabetes and Parkinson 's disease , he said .
The ingredients of beer - which include malted barley , hops and yeast - are rich sources of vitamins and minerals .
Dr James Betts , an expert in post - exercise rehydration at Bath University , said : " People think of alcohol as being a diuretic , but if you are already hydrated , a small amount of beer could be a way of getting the fluid in . "
The best way of rehydrating after exercise was with a sports drink containing sugars , water and salt , he added .
The inventor of the WWW has a short , to - the - point post that explains exactly why supporting real , bona fide net neutrality is the Right Thing to Do .
I absolutely encourage you to read the entire post , but really he sums up the whole argument for net neutrality in his opening sentence :
When I invented the Web , I did n't have to ask anyone 's permission .
If you think about it in terms of start - ups having to ask the permission of AT&T to innovate , then the whole net neutrality issue becomes less complicated .
Ma Bell may I ?
What the opponents of net neutrality are pouring millions into lobbying for is a world where , when someone offers a new high - bandwidth service over the Internet , they have to go around to each of the last - mile providers and ask , " may I have permission to compete on a level playing field with the other services that go over your pipes ? "
And if entrepeneurs can't come up with enough funding to appease the troll that guards that particular bridge , then they could effectively lose access to the customers at the other end .
To move the discussion away from the typical example of high - bandwidth video , let me turn to the example of a new email attachment service , called Pando , that was recently brought to my attention .
From what I can tell , Pando is a P2P service for sending very large files through email .
You attach to your email a . pando file , which is probably something like a . torrent file , and a user on the other end who has the Pando client can open that .
pando file and use it to begin downloading the larger file that you want to send them .
Now , I have no idea how well this Pando thing works , or even if it works at all .
I bring it up only because it seems like new , kind of slick start - up idea .
But on a non-neutral Internet , Pando is a much less attractive as a small business .
Why ?
Because if I 'm on Comcast and you 're on AT&T , and I try to send you a . pando file , then both of our ISPs have to have agreed to let this new service 's packets through at a reasonable clip .
If either Comcast or AT&T has decided to throttle Pando packets ( maybe Pando is being used to send video files ! ) , then Pando will work for me when emailing some folks but not others .
In the face of such uneven and generally unpredictable results , most users will probably skip the service entirely , and the world would have one less small business .
At this point , I should insert a word on " throttling " vs. quality of service ( QoS ) .
The telcos are arguing that they do n't want to throttle anyone 's traffic — they just want the freedom to offer better transport ( QoS ) to services that pay up .
This is a misleading way to frame the issue .
If three companies run competing video - on - demand services and only one has paid the piper , then the other two guys are effectively throttled as far as end users are concerned .
This is especially true if the baseline level of transport service for streaming media on that ISP 's network is set painfully low .
All Comcast would have to do is make a rule that all streaming video sites default to a relatively small amount of bandwidth , and they get more acceptable levels of bandwidth as they pay more .
This amounts to throttling people who do n't pay , and I think the odds are greatly in favor of this kind of thing becoming rampant on a non-neutral Internet .
Even worse would be a situation where Comcast enters into some kind of exclusive deal with an online service provider , with the result that the cost of competing on a level playing field with that favored service are set prohibitively high .
Of course , such a move would probably spark lawsuits from competitors , but do we really want to rely on very expensive tort law to enforce what simple regulation could do much more cheaply and rationally ?
But I thought regulation was bad for markets ?
It 's on the topic of regulation that Berners - Lee lets loose with another great one - line takedown of all the anti-regulatory rhetoric that the telcos and their surrogates have been using :
For example , the market system depends on the rule that you can't photocopy money .
The simple truth that you can't have a free market without government regulation should be so obvious that it hurts , but after a few decades of some industries pushing a " regulation vs. free markets " dichotomy people need to be reminded that the sky is , in fact , blue .
Because markets rest on the rule of law , the relationship between markets and regulation is not a binary opposition but a continuum .
Anarchy at one extreme and overregulation at the other are both antithetical to free markets .
You have to have rules to play by , because the rules guarantee that the game is fair .
But enough of my preaching .
Go read the Berners - Lee post , pass it around to your friends , and call your congressperson .

James Harris and Josh Scheer
Former Assistant Secretary of Defense Philip Coyle knows a thing or two about the “ staggering ” amounts of money the U.S. funnels into the military - industrial complex , and why it is so difficult to stanch the profiteering .
Click here to listen to this and other Truthdig interviews .
Transcript :
James Harris :
This is Truthdig .
James Harris here again with Josh Scheer .
Today we are talking to Philip Coyle , he ’s the former assistant secretary of defense , and currently is a senior adviser at the Center for Defense Information .
Recently an article was published announcing that UC Berkeley had won a contract to develop defense , a contract worth some $ 1.6 billion each year .
In doing the research for this interview , I found that there was no cap to the trillions of dollars spent on defense .
Seeing these astronomic figures , I cannot help but think about the forgotten social programs , the failing education structure .
Can you tell me , what do we spend this money on ?
Where does it go ?
And are we spending too much ?
Philip Coyle :
The amount of money that the United States spends on defense is really quite staggering .
Over $ 750 billion a year , if you count everything .
Typically , those numbers are not counted .
Typically you hear numbers like 450 , not 750 or more .
But when you count everything , it ’s a very large amount of money .
And that does n’t count the war in Iraq and Afghanistan .
With the president ’s latest request , the total amount of money , either appropriated or requested for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and all , is now over $ 800 billion , 808 billion to be exact , and that does n’t include , that is not included , in the 750 or so that we spend each year on regular defense spending .
Josh Scheer :
It ’s actually interesting , a lot of people forget that the DOE , and the Veterans Affairs , and a lot of those departments , also get quite a bit of money from the military - industrial complex .
And from the president .
Coyle : Exactly .
Harris :
What are you doing to either defeat this spending mentality or work within the system to change some of these things ?
Coyle :
Well , it ’s very difficult , of course .
Some defense programs , some defense procurements , spend money in every single state of the union .
One of the displays that the U.S. Congress can get from the Pentagon is where exactly all the money is being spent on each particular program .
And so sometimes this means jobs all across the country that makes it very difficult to attack .
Scheer :
And the companies do that on purpose .
I ’ve talked to a lot of people on this whole subject and companies will make , as they say , the F - 22 or the B - 2 or one of those planes , wingtips , will be made in a state to guarantee jobs and to guarantee votes , right ?
Coyle :
Yes , they will , and of course once a factory or a plant is established in some city or town or state , the people there do n’t want to lose it .
Scheer : Yep . …
I know in the news recently we ’ve been trying to sell missile defense again and again , and it happens every year , and you were involved in testing for a number of years .
Were the tests ever really positive ?
Because I only read the negative , and maybe that ’s the way I look at the news that comes out , but I want to know what you think and , when you were there , were there positive tests ; why do we keep putting money in this program year after year ?
Coyle : Well , the United States is spending about $ 10 billion a year , sometimes 11 , but about $ 10 billion a year on missile defense and has been since President Bush came to office .
All in all , since Ronald Reagan gave his famous “ Star Wars ” speech , the United States has spent over $ 100 billion on missile defense .
And it ’s the most difficult thing the Pentagon has ever tried to do .
Much more difficult than any jet fighter or ship or tank or what have you .
The tests are sometimes successful ; for example , the ground - based system that is being deployed in Alaska and California , there have been 12 flight intercept tests in that system and six of them were successful and six failed .
But these tests are scripted to improve the chances for success , and so they do n’t really represent battlefield conditions , the fog of war so to speak , all of the uncertainties that you would have in an actual missile fight , in battle .
Scheer :
So basically they ’re giving it a failing grade , 50 percent , in optimal conditions ?
Coyle :
Yes , I think that is fair .
There ’s nothing wrong with these tests ; they need to do them of course if they are ever going to try to make the system be effective .
But there is just — they do n’t capture all of the realism of war .
Remember now that what we ’re talking about is nuclear weapons being launched towards the United States and perhaps some of them get through and go off , so talk about the fog of war would be hard to imagine .
Scheer : I remember , and this was many years ago , maybe 5 - 6 years ago , a lecture given at Stanford by an atomic scientist that the missile systems that they had then , and that they had when they were working on them during the “ Star Wars ” program , that missiles fired from subs , or from a dirty bomb that would be brought from a city — how , what country , besides say North Korea , could fire a missile , and how much do we have to fear from a dirty bomb that these missile systems would n’t work on .
Coyle :
Well , currently the only countries that have missiles that can reach the United States are Russia and China .
And neither one of those countries is an enemy of the United States today .
People worry very much about Iraq , excuse me , I beg our pardon , about Iran and North Korea .
Scheer :
Do n’t worry , the country made that mistake about four years ago .
Coyle : People worry about North Korea and Iran , but neither country has missiles that could reach the United States .
Scheer :
And another question I have , is this a fear factor kind of thing ? …
Nuclear weapons are a fearful subject , nobody want a nuclear bomb to go off in this country , but also a fear that other countries will develop missile shields on their own , or they ’ll weaponize space . …
How much does fear play in preventing a nuclear bomb ?
Coyle : I think it ’s very important , I think there are many members of Congress who genuinely fear what North Korea or Iran might be able to do some day .
And it ’s very hard to pass that up .
The fear of something is a stronger motivator sometimes than the thing itself .
Harris :
Many people say that drafting policy and even acting on policy in response to fear is a very bad thing .
I ’d love to hear your thoughts on that .
Coyle :
Well , indeed .
You get irrational if you get too frightened by something , you become irrational .
Unfortunately , 9/11 was such a horrible event that it just scared Americans out of their wits .
When you let that happen you run into the situation where you make irrational choices .
Scheer :
It would scare people but we look at , say , a 9/11 or we look at what those terrorists could do , that ’s what I was saying about the dirty bomb , we ’re fighting a war against people who had box cutters and kicked in [ airplane ] doors … do you really think , are they going to be able to get nuclear materials within the next 30 years ?
Coyle :
Well , that ’s of course a very important question , and we certainly hope not .
The United States has a program to try to better secure nuclear materials , not only here in the United States but in Russia and elsewhere around the world .
Recently the U.S. government secured some highly enriched uranium that was in a research reactor in Vietnam .
Successful effort .
So that effort to try to secure nuclear materials all around the world is an important part of dealing with the threat that terrorists might get ahold of such materials .
Scheer : …
Is what the Europeans are saying with the new missile shield that if you put something like that up , it may encourage a country to build nuclear weapons and that the greatest thing would be to try to take them all off the market ?
Would that be a better way of doing it ?
Taking nuclear weapons , nonproliferation , and using a different type of weapon . …
Coyle :
Well , the new missile shield that the United States is proposing to deploy in Poland and in the Czech Republic is supposedly to defend against missiles from Iran either attacking Europe or the United States .
But the system supposed for Poland and the Czech Republic have no demonstrated capability to actually defend Europe , let alone the United States , under realistic operational conditions .
Just the same , there are people in Europe who think that just putting it there , whether it would work or not , would help to deter Iran if Iran really believed that it worked .
Scheer :
And now I want to get off missile defense — I do n’t know if James wants to come back to it — because I know that another subject that you ’re obviously an expert on is universities and working with the Livermore Labs .
I want to know how much does the defense budget pie is say , from , two universities for research or through the DOE to the Livermore Labs , how much money are we giving to say these universities to do military - type research ?
Coyle :
Well , it ’s quite a small part of the total .
For example , I think the nuclear weapons budget of the United States , for everything it does with the military and every place else , is on the order of 20 billion , and at a place like Lawrence Livermore , their weapons budget is probably only a half a billion .
They have other programs in energy and in the environment and biology and medicine and so forth .
But they ’re not weapons programs .
Scheer :
And when you worked there , did they ever ask you to hold back findings because there [ was ] a lot of secrecy when you were working at the labs ?
Coyle :
Well , they did not ever ask me to hold back any findings , no .
Obviously some of the weapons work is classified , but not even all of the nuclear weapons work is classified .
The lab puts out a regular newspaper and a magazine and other things that describe its research .
So except for the things which actually need to be classified , that ’s where the secrecy is .
Scheer :
It has always interested me when I read anything about , not the labs , I ’m getting more to the university side with , say , UC Berkeley doing things like roboflies and smart dust , and there was an ABC report I think from this June about gay bombs and arming sharks and things like that .
Are those programs , are they expected to work in the next 20 years ?
Are they giving them a lot of the money ?
Are they giving them a lot of thought ?
Or was it just something that , say , smart dust sounds interesting , so we ’ll give a little bit of money ?
What ’s your take on that ?
Coyle : Well , the Defense Department does fund some pretty far - out ideas .
But again the amount of spending is quite low compared to , say , the war in Iraq or other things we might discuss .
And yes , small pieces of it go to ideas that do n’t pan out .
But that ’s part of the research and development process .
Scheer : … I know that recently [ at ]
Santa Clara University , there were student groups who were starving themselves because of the university ’s involvement in nuclear weapons and this kind of thing .
You ’re saying that it ’s just a small part ?
So why would these students be kind of concerned about it , do you think ?
Coyle :
Well , they could be concerned on principle if they just do n’t like the idea , no matter what it costs .
But , usually the things that will draw protests are actually a relatively small part of the defense budget .
The exception these days , of course , being the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Harris :
With due respect , you have just in conversation mentioned over a trillion dollars .
And we ’re just getting started .
Coyle : Right .
Harris :
Does the military have carte blanche to spend what they want to spend , develop what they want to develop , and no one is going to ask a question .
Is that a safe assumption ?
Is that a safe statement ?
No one is going to question these things .
Coyle : I do n’t think it is ; I do n’t think that ’s correct .
As the old saying goes , the president of the United States proposes , and the U.S. Congress disposes .
So if the Congress does n’t appropriate the money , if they do n’t authorize the funds , it wo n’t happen .
Now , unfortunately with respect to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , right now , Congress , the majority of the Congress , is trying not to authorize what the president wants , but unfortunately they do n’t have the votes to make it happen .
Scheer :
It ’s strange though , because again , talking about this with a lot of people , Congress , their staffers , seem to be getting government jobs .
The congressmen can become lobbyists , no one wants to be against defense , there is a kind of a carte blanche , a little bit , to do this , because there ’s no oversight from Congress , and there ’s no , these defense contractors are pitching something that people want .
They want defense and they do n’t want to sacrifice that need , right ?
Coyle : Exactly .
If you ask in the context of missile defense or any other defense program , if you ask most Americans , should n’t we defend ourselves ?
They say , in polls , they say yes .
It ’s only when you start to talk about the difficulty , or the cost , of a program that then American voters will say , “ Well , wait a minute , I did n’t realize that . ”
Scheer :
And besides some groups like yours and other arms trade research , and even OMB watch , and other of these groups , there ’s no one in Congress really going in and saying , there are some that are doing oversight , but it ’s really these private institutions that are doing all the oversight , right ?
Coyle :
That ’s where a lot of it comes from .
The Congress does have investigative powers but they were not using them as aggressively , prior to last November .
Scheer :
How much lobbying do you think the universities do ?
Because I know with Lockheed and Halliburton , obviously , they have powerful lobbies ; they have the whole revolving - door policy where they are hiring people , congressmen , or people in the Pentagon .
What do you think the universities are doing ?
Do they lobby as much , or are they just so trusted to get the job done , say , with Livermore or with roboflies , that they are just getting these contracts ?
Coyle :
It ’s quite different for universities , any university , whether you ’re talking about the University of California or the University of Pennsylvania .
Big contractors like Boeing and Lockheed and so forth have large Washington offices and very substantial lobbying budgets .
Universities do not have , they may have a Washington office but most universities do n’t .
Some do but they usually are small , a handful of people and very limited budgets .
And the way they operate is quite different .
Universities are obviously interested in their own futures , but they ’re also trying to give straight answers to straight questions .
Scheer : Yeah , but it is interesting because in this last thing in May that James was talking about earlier about Lockheed , Lockheed was in that running and the university beat them out .
So it is interesting that the University of California could beat out that major player in Washington .
I guess the government trusts them , right ?
Would that be correct ?
Coyle : I think that ’s correct , yeah .
Scheer :
It makes you wonder what they think about Lockheed , but . …
Harris :
They must love Lockheed .
They spend tons and tons of money with Lockheed .
Philip , it seems that as we hear more and more about private entities , as we hear about private entities and corporate America running amuck , does the government need to take more responsibility for the money that is being spent , and for the way it is being spent , because the groups that are doing it now seem like they are spending a lot of money and do n’t have a lot of accountability for how that money is being spent .
Coyle : I think the Blackwater case is a very interesting one because it appears that they did not have to operate under the same rules as other security contractors who were there in Iraq .
And there ’s a long complicated story about how that came about , but nevertheless , our government ought to know what rules these contractors are operating under .
And examine whether it ’s right for some contractors to basically have no rules and others to have lots of rules .
Harris :
Do you think some of the inconsistencies that exist in Blackwater and related organizations ?
Do you think those things are true for companies like Boeing and Lockheed that do major services for us on the military - defense end ?
Coyle : I think the situation with Blackwater is quite special because , you know , it was involving , providing security in Iraq , which is a very difficult place to provide security .
I do n’t believe that Lockheed does that kind of work ; I do n’t think Boeing does that kind of work .
But that does n’t mean that greater oversight is n’t appropriate for those kinds of defense contractors , also .
They spend billions and billions of dollars , and if the government is going to be a good customer , the government needs to know how its money is being spent .
Scheer :
It ’s interesting about Lockheed , just one little wrap - up question for James , that when you look into Lockheed and you go even on their Web site , not only do they provide , they ’re not only a defense company .
But they also work for the Welfare Administration , they work for the Department of Interior , they used to do work for the Education Department , they do n’t do any of that anymore .
They do work for most parts of the government .
That ’s where they get even more money , NASA , a whole slew of non-defense entities , I mean . …
Coyle : Yes , and some of these companies are truly global companies .
In the same sense that some oil companies are truly global .
They are not really national oil companies , they ’re global . …
Scheer :
They put their mailboxes in Bermuda so they can pay $ 20,000 in taxes and not … but thank you very much , it was great to talk to you .
Coyle :
It was nice talking to you anytime .
Harris : Indeed , and one thing Philip said earlier was that people when asked , are definitely for defense , but when they find out how much it costs , hey , they want to be against defense .
So if you want to make a change , or look into how some of this money is being spent , you have to take an active role .
It ca n’t be something you bitch about and leave alone ; you have to be consistent in that .
So Philip Doyle , former assistant secretary of defense and currently senior adviser at the Center of Defense Information , thank you for joining us .
For Josh Scheer , for Philip Coyle , this is James Harris , and this is Truthdig .
Encoding Inductive and Coinductive Types in Polymorphic Lambda Calculus
This was written about two years ago .
Mostly inspired by Philip Wadler ‘s note Recursive types for free .
Inductive types
Inductive types are least fixed - points .
An indcutive type μF is simulated by
forall x . ( F x -> x ) -> x
In Haskell , we need a constructor to wrap a “ forall ” quantifier .
> newtype LFix f = LF ( forall x. ( f x -> x ) -> x ) > instance Show ( LFix f ) where > show _ = " " > foldL :: Functor f => ( f x -> x ) -> LFix f -> x > foldL f ( LF x ) = x f > inL :: Functor f => f ( LFix f ) -> LFix f > inL fx = LF ( \\f -> f . fmap ( foldL f ) $ fx ) > outL :: Functor f => LFix f -> f ( LFix f ) > outL = foldL ( fmap inL )
Example : lists .
> data F a x = L | R a x deriving Show > instance Functor ( F a ) where > fmap f L = L > fmap f ( R a x ) = R a ( f x ) > type ListL a = LFix ( F a )
A ListL can only be constructed out of nil and cons .
Main > consL 1 ( consL 2 ( consL 3 nilL ) )
> nilL = inL L > consL a x = inL ( R a x )
We can convert a ListL to a ‘ real ’ Haskell list .
Main > lList $ consL 1 ( consL 2 ( consL 3 nilL ) ) [ 1,2,3 ]
> lList :: LFix ( F a ) -> [ a ] >
lList = foldL ll > where ll L = [ ] > ll ( R a x ) = a : x
However , a ListL has to be explicitly built , so there is no infinite ListL .
Coinductive types
A coinductive type νF is simulatd by
exists x . ( x -> F x , x )
We represent it in Haskell using the property exists x .
F x == forall y . ( forall x . F x -> y ) -> y :
> data GFix f = forall x .
GF ( x -> f x , x ) > instance Show ( GFix f ) where > show _ = " " > unfoldG :: Functor f => ( x -> f x ) -> x -> GFix f > unfoldG g x = GF ( g , x ) > outG :: Functor f => GFix f -> f ( GFix f ) > outG ( GF ( g , x ) ) = fmap ( unfoldG g ) . g $ x > inG :: Functor f => f ( GFix f ) ->
GFix f > inG = unfoldG ( fmap outG )
Example :
> type ListG a = GFix ( F a )
ListG can be constructed out of nil and cons , as well as an unfold .
> nilG = inG L > consG a x = inG ( R a x ) > fromG :: Int -> ListG Int > fromG m = unfoldG ft m > where ft m = R m ( m+1 )
However , one can perform only a finite number of outG .
Main > fmap outG . outG . fromG $ 1 R 1 ( R 2 )
Isomorphism
The function force witnesses the isomorphism between LFix and GFix .
> force :: Functor f => GFix f ->
LFix f > force = inL . fmap force .
outG -- recursion !
If LFix and GFix are isomorphic , we are allowed to build hylomorphisms :
> fromTo :: Int ->
Int -> LFix ( F Int ) > fromTo m n = takeLessThan n . force .
fromG $ m > takeLessThan :: Int -> LFix ( F Int ) -> LFix ( F Int ) > takeLessThan n = foldL ( tlt n ) > where tlt n L = nilL > tlt n ( R m x ) | n <= m = nilL > | otherwise = consL m x Main > lList ( fromTo 1 10 ) [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ]

There 's reported to be much joy in heaven over any sinner who repenteth .
So I suppose celebrations should be unconfined at the news that the head of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents has put the boot into the elf 'n ' safety nazis .
After all , preventing accidents provides the moral justification for these self - righteous lunatics interfering in our lives and banning pretty much every activity known to man .
Tom Mullarkey , chief executive of Rospa , says his worthy cause has been hijacked by ' extremists ' .
Consequently , children are being deprived of their childhood because they are prevented from doing anything which carries even a scintilla of risk .
Everything from playing conkers to wearing football boots with studs and swimming with snorkels has been outlawed in the name of keeping our kids safe .
" We do not believe in extremist health and safety ideas which would keep children wrapped in cotton wool , " said Mr Mullarkey .
" Our argument is that a skinned knee or twisted ankle in a challenging and exciting play environment is not just acceptable , it is a positive necessity . "
Let 's overlook the tortuous use of language .
In the real world , children play in parks - in officialdom , they utilise " challenging and exciting play environments " .
Instead , we should congratulate Mr Mullarkey .
Though he is rather late to the party , his intervention is nonetheless welcome .
I could fill this column week in , week out with the latest examples of elf 'n ' safety madness .
For instance , I 've just had an e-mail from a reader who was asked to sign a disclaimer before she could take home for her dog the leftovers from a Sunday lunch at a carvery .
The restaurant was seeking a legal assurance that Rover would chow down on the scraps that very day .
Clearly the management - or more likely , their insurers - were concerned that the pooch might catch food poisoning if the meat was held over for a couple of days beyond its roast - by date and a lawsuit for damages may well follow .
All this was explained by the waitress in the name of elf 'n ' safety , a catch - all cliche which can best be summed up as " What do you want to do ?
You can 't . "
Greedy insurance companies who take your money in premiums and then refuse to pay out when you have an accident are partly responsible .
So are the spiv lawyers from Blame Direct , who advertise on daytime television with the promise that they can turn your sprained ankle into a new car or a foreign holiday .
You could be entitled to compensay - shun .
But they could n't do it without the ludicrous laws passed by braindead , puritan politicians and the ' guidelines ' drawn up by what Mr Mullarkey identifies as ' small - minded bureaucrats ' .
That phrase is tautologous .
In the context of bureaucracy , the expression ' small - minded ' is superfluous .
When did you ever meet a broadminded bureaucrat ?
Small - minded is what bureaucrats do .
That is how Brown 's Britain works - or , rather , does n't .
They are not known for their sense of proportion .
Remember that maniac who wanted to chop down all the palm trees in Torquay in case someone - cut themselves on a fallen frond ?
' They 're like tigers , ' he said .
'
Beautiful to look at but you would n't want them wandering the streets . '
Nurse !
It 's difficult not to conclude that the elf 'n ' safety crowd are , like the polarbear huggers , in the grip of advanced mental illness .
The rules , in common with most other regulations , are not introduced for our benefit , they are manufactured to give the bureaucrats something to do to justify their miserable , worthless existence - to bully us , punish us , show us who 's boss .
Very occasionally , someone in authority , like Tom Mullarkey , blows the whistle .
But it never makes the slightest bit of difference .
Last year , the head of the Health and Safety Executive himself declared that the whole , er , mullarkey had got completely out of hand .
No one took the slightest bit of notice .
The pencilheads simply returned to their rules mine and carried on churning out ever more insane restrictions on our freedom .
Everybody back on the coach .
It was probably only a matter of time before they turned their attention to doggy bags .
Barking .
Paul Bremer , America 's former proconsul in Baghdad , today defended his reputation against comments from President George Bush that the official had acted on his own accord in committing one of the most calamitious mistakes of the Iraq war .
In a breach with the Administration he once served , Mr Bremer released two letters to the New York Times refuting Mr Bush 's remarks in a new biography that the White House was not involved in the decision to dissolve the Iraqi army .
The disbanding of Saddam Hussein 's military left hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers stranded without jobs or income , and is widely recognised as one of the most disastrous measures undertaken by Mr Bremer during his year - long authority in Baghdad .
Mr Bremer , who has been blamed for many of the failures of the post - war occupation , apparently was unwilling to take it any more .
He released two letters to the Times to prove his assertion that the White House and the Pentagon knew in advance of his plan to dismantle the military and that they approved .
Mr Bremer told the newspaper he sent a draft of the order to the Pentagon on May 9 , 2003 and that it had been circulated widely to the Defence Secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , and other officials .
" It was not a controversial decision . "
In the first letter , from Mr Bremer to Mr Bush , dated May 22 , 2003 , Mr Bremer writes at length about Iraqis weeping tears of joy at their liberation by US troops , and the dissolution of Saddam Hussein 's ruling Ba'ath Party .
" We must make it clear to everyone that we mean business : that Saddam and the Ba'athists are finished , " he writes .
He tells Mr Bush that the de-Baathification of the civil service was proving popular despite " some inefficiencies and griping " .
He deals with the disbanding of the army in a single , obliquely worded sentence .
" I will parallel this step with an even more robust measure dissolving Saddam 's military and intelligence structures to emphasize that we mean business . "
The breezy tone of Mr Bremer 's letter is at odds with the sweeping implications of the decision to do away with one of Iraq 's main institutions , and the strong opposition to the dissolution of the army from US military officials at the time .
Mr Bush responded the next day , in a brief reply sent from his ranch in Texas .
Though it was such an instrumental step in the de-Baathification process , there is no direct reference to dissolving Saddam 's army .
" Your leadership is apparent .
You have quickly made a positive and significant impact .
You have my full support and confidence .
You also have the backing of our Administration that knows our work will take time , " Mr Bush writes .
The publication of that exchange of letters between the White House and Washington 's man in Baghdad sheds new light on the chaotic and somewhat incidental way in which Mr Bush dealt with events in Iraq - though his legacy as president will be almost entirely defined by the war .
Further revelations about the dysfunction in the Bush White House surfaced this week with the publication of a new biography , Dead Certain .
In his conversations with the author , Robert Draper , Mr Bush admitted that disbanding Saddam 's military had been a major mistake .
" The policy was to keep the army intact ; did n't happen , " he said .
He then suggested that he had been left out of the loop by Mr Bremer .
" Yeah , I can't remember , I 'm sure I said , ' This is the policy , what happened ? ' "
Mr Bush is quoted as saying .
He then told Draper to check with his national security adviser , Stephen Hadley .
THE EYE IN THE PYRAMID
He asked if there was an international conspiracy to overthrow our government .
The answer is yes ... — Ron Paul , August 30 , 2003
Ron Paul is what David ( Orcinus ) Neiwert , a leading authority on the radical right , calls a transmitter : an ostensibly respectable figure whose advocacy of fringe positions lends them a legitimacy they could never otherwise aspire to .
Paul , a tireless foe of the United Nations for more than 30 years , is one of the higher - profile proponents of the familiar " New World Order " conspiracy theory , a paranoid fantasy in which a shadowy group of powerful players is perpetually plotting to conquer the world .
Like many on the fringe , Paul takes his fear of other countries to ridiculous extremes ; when asked by radio host Alex Jones in November 2005 about a report that Dutch and Mexican troops were helping out with Hurricane Katrina relief operations , Paul called it " a horrible precedent , and it's all part of the NAFTA scheme and globalization and world government . "
( MP3 is here ; exchange begins at about the 17:55 mark .
Paul is a favorite guest of " 9/11 Truth " guy Alex Jones , who has never heard a conspiracy theory he could n't embrace , from way back ; he has appeared on Jones ' program three times since February . )
So who are these shadowy forces who are plotting to dismantle our Constitution and surrender our sovereignty to a one - world government ?
Paul explained , in a 2004 interview :
They 're certainly not known to a lot of people ; it 's actually what they 're doing .
But then again , it 's not absolute secrecy .
If you look around you can usually get the information .
There was a time when nobody even knew who was a member of the CFR or the Trilateral Commission .
I think it 's a bad sign that they 're not as secret as they used to be .
They 're bolder now .
But there is an agenda .
They 're behind the scenes in many way — very secretive .
The Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) and the Trilateral Commission are what Cecil Adams calls " discussion groups for world leaders that have become a target of right wing crazy people , " who tend to mention them in the same breath as sinister insinuations about " international bankers " ( no points for guessing who they are ) .
GOLD !
And then there 's the money .
Even more than fleet - footed black criminals , the impending collapse of the world financial system has long been Paul 's greatest obsession .
The July 29 , 1985 issue of Barron 's profiled Paul , then settling into his new role as an investment guru following three terms in Congress .
The magazine quoted a pitch letter for Paul 's new investment bulletin :
Dear Friend .
Will you survive the " new money " ?
You must be prepared , because within one year , the U.S. Treasury will impose a radically different currency on the American people .
Government officials wo n't tell you the truth about this ominous new development and most of your neighbors will be caught napping ....
I saw the ugly new bills , tinted pink and blue and blighted with holograms , diffraction gratings , metal threads and chemical alarms . "
The government , Paul assured his readers , would be recalling the old currency at the same time , which would cause a real problem for " the underground economy , " most of whose participants are doing " a very worthwhile thing " that 's good for the country .
Paul 's June 1985 newsletter told of one Professor Claude Martin of the University of Michigan , who supervised consumer testing of the new money in 1983 : " Today ... the professor sounds frightened and refuses to talk .
After muttering that he no longer is permitted to discuss the project , he hangs up . "
Professor Martin discussed the project at length with Barron 's ( the article notes dryly ) and said he'd never spoke to Paul .
When confronted with this discrepancy , Paul said he'd heard the story from another person , " who I choose not to name . "
Ten years later , of course , the Treasury did begin redesigning our paper money — minus , one presumes , the chemical alarms — but never recalled the old bills ; civilization did not fall .
Paul 's solution ?
Gold , young feller , gold !
As with Bush and tax cuts , Paul has never found a problem for which gold was not the solution .
A longtime proponent of returning the US to the gold standard , Paul 's writings on gold — and there are a lot of them — are liberally sprinkled with references to the Federal Reserve , Bretton Woods , and the rest of the usual gang of tropes ; they imbue the shiny , somewhat arbitrarily chosen metal with almost supernatural powers to save us from the impending doom that is always just around the corner but , somehow , never quite arrives .
Fortunately , Barron 's notes , the ever - helpful Paul had just the thing for the discerning gold buyer , " a coin dealer you can trust " : Ron Paul & Co. , Dealers in Precious Metals and Rare Coins .
RON PAUL AND THE CLINTONS
In the 1990s , like every far - right lunatic worth his salt , Ron Paul turned his frenzied attention to the Clintons .
A 1993 direct mail piece from Paul ran through the checklist , missing nothing along the way :
What kind of a man is Bill Clinton ?
Our families tell much about us .
Clinton 's wife is a far leftist with very close female friends ...
( Wink , wink . )
...( while her husband is a sexual playboy of John F. Kennedy
proportions ) .
A friend of mine who attended Yale Law School with Hillary says that she was known as the " class commie . "
Today , I guess , she is merely a pinko .
And " Co- President " of the United States .
According to the Washington Times , Clinton 's mother spends every day at the horsetrack near corrupt Hot Springs .
According to The New Republic , as a nurse anesthesist , she once let a patient die while doing her nails .
She was found to be criminally negligent , and then cleared .
Her son Bill , the governor , then promoted the man who cleared her .
You may have read about the uproar over pardons of hardened criminals signed by a state senator who was temporary Arkansas governor during the inauguration .
Now the Washington Times reports that the pardons were engineered by Clinton before he went to Washington .
One of the criminals let out of prison was the son of a politician who had been exposing Clinton 's black and white illegitimate children with photos and addresses .
" Woods colts , " they 're called in Arkansas slang .
Then they made a corrupt deal .
The man agreed to shut up during the campaign ; Clinton agreed to spring his son .
Emphasis mine .
For Paul , no rumor about the Clintons was too outrageous to pass on .
In the March 15 , 1994 issue of the Ron Paul Survival Report , Paul addressed the death of Vince Foster , whose 1993 suicide was twisted by the far - right enemies of democracy into a series of increasingly outlandish conspiracy theories alleging that Foster was actually murdered and that Clinton ordered it .
These scurrilous and reprehensible stories were told and retold tirelessly in far - right organs for Clinton 's entire presidency , always flying just under the radar of mainstream media notice .
Paul 's retelling repeats all of the standard libels .
He characterizes Hillary Clinton , without offering any evidence , as " Foster 's ex-paramour " — in evident contradiction of Paul 's other " theory " about the then - First Lady — and suggests that the " murder " was tied up in some way with the cocaine habit Paul accuses Bill Clinton of having :
There is another story that has gained some importance in the upper reaches of Washington , D.C.
It alleges that Bill Clinton has long used cocaine , and that Foster was his " connection " ....
I ( Ron Paul ) , am reminded about all the stories of CIA - Contra cocaine smuggling through the Mena , Arkansas , airport when Clinton was governor , and his supposed protection of the racket .
The cocaine speculation would explain certain mysteries .
During the campaign , Bill never released his medical records ....
[ C ] ould the reason for his reticence be DOPE ?
Clinton has perpetuated troubles with his throat and voice , which could be related to the nasal drainage a cokehead experiences .
He is also an insomniac , which dopers are .
None of this is conclusive , of course , but it sure is interesting .
Emphasis mine .

DUDE IS WACK
This stuff is important to me personally because I remember the heyday of the radical anti-government right wing .
I remember the day those attitudes cost 168 Americans their lives .
I remember living not 300 miles away from Oklahoma City at the time , attending the University of Kansas , and wondering if we had just witnessed the Fort Sumter of a new civil war , and whether any of my neighbors would not fight for America , if push came to shove , but would take up arms against her .
And I remember , all too well , that Ron Paul and his ilk were heroes to the people who filled the Internet with hate and conspiracy - mongering .
And it 's going to take a hell of a lot more than a few sweet words against the war to make me forget that .
I 'll repeat what I said in my first Ron Paul diary : I understand how important , how visceral , opposition to the war is for a lot of people .
It is for precisely this reason that it is so important that Kossacks understand that , opposition to the war aside , Ron Paul is not our friend .
For a final thought , I could n't possibly top the garrulous Professor Claude Martin : " He 's a nut . "
" There is no end in sight , " said Kurt Karl , chief U.S. economist with Swiss Re in New York .
" The builders did n't realize how many cancellations they are going to face .
If we hit 1.0 million start range , it 's consistent with recessions in the past .
And we are heading in that direction . "
The dour report pushed up prices for bonds and weighed on the dollar as traders saw greater likelihood the Federal Reserve would follow up a rate cut it made last month with another at its next meeting on Oct. 31 .
A separate report , however , showed the economy facing inflation pressure from food and energy , which could complicate the Fed 's thinking on borrowing costs .
Consumer Prices Rise
The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index , the most broadly used gauge of inflation , rose 0.3 percent last month , the biggest gain in four months .
However , the core rate , which excludes energy and food , moved up a modest 0.2 percent .
" The housing starts and consumer price inflation numbers highlight the tough dilemma the Federal Reserve faces , " said Bernard Bauhmohl , managing director of the Economic Outlook
Group in Princeton Junction , New Jersey .
It 's become a TV ritual : Every year on April 4 , as Americans commemorate Martin Luther King 's death , we get perfunctory network news reports about " the slain civil rights leader . "
The remarkable thing about these reviews of King 's life is that several years — his last years — are totally missing , as if flushed down a memory hole .
What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage : King battling desegregation in Birmingham ( 1963 ) ; reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington ( 1963 ) ; marching for voting rights in Selma , Alabama ( 1965 ) ; and finally , lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis ( 1968 ) .
An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968 .
Yet King did n't take a sabbatical near the end of his life .
In fact , he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever .
Almost all of those speeches were filmed or taped .
But they 're not shown today on TV .
Why ?
It 's because national news media have never come to terms with what Martin Luther King Jr. stood for during his final years .
In the early 1960s , when King focused his challenge on legalized racial discrimination in the South , most major media were his allies .
Network TV and national publications graphically showed the police dogs and bullwhips and cattle prods used against Southern blacks who sought the right to vote or to eat at a public lunch counter .
But after passage of civil rights acts in 1964 and 1965 , King began challenging the nation 's fundamental priorities .
He maintained that civil rights laws were empty without " human rights " — including economic rights .
For people too poor to eat at a restaurant or afford a decent home , King said , anti-discrimination laws were hollow .
Noting that a majority of Americans below the poverty line were white , King developed a class perspective .
He decried the huge income gaps between rich and poor , and called for " radical changes in the structure of our society " to redistribute wealth and power .

" True compassion , " King declared , " is more than flinging a coin to a beggar ; it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring . "
By 1967 , King had also become the country 's most prominent opponent of the Vietnam War , and a staunch critic of overall U.S. foreign policy , which he deemed militaristic .
In his " Beyond Vietnam " speech delivered at New York 's Riverside Church on April 4 , 1967 — a year to the day before he was murdered — King called the United States " the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today . "
( Full text / audio here .
http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article2564.htm)
From Vietnam to South Africa to Latin America , King said , the U.S. was " on the wrong side of a world revolution . "
King questioned " our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America , " and asked why the U.S. was suppressing revolutions " of the shirtless and barefoot people " in the Third World , instead of supporting them .
In foreign policy , King also offered an economic critique , complaining about " capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia , Africa and South America , only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries . "
You have n't heard the " Beyond Vietnam " speech on network news retrospectives , but national media heard it loud and clear back in 1967 — and loudly denounced it .
Life magazine called it " demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi . "
The Washington Post patronized that " King has diminished his usefulness to his cause , his country , his people . "
In his last months , King was organizing the most militant project of his life : the Poor People 's Campaign .
He crisscrossed the country to assemble " a multiracial army of the poor " that would descend on Washington — engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol , if need be — until Congress enacted a poor people 's bill of rights .
Reader 's Digest warned of an " insurrection . "
King 's economic bill of rights called for massive government jobs programs to rebuild America 's cities .
He saw a crying need to confront a Congress that had demonstrated its " hostility to the poor " — appropriating " military funds with alacrity and generosity , " but providing " poverty funds with miserliness . "
How familiar that sounds today , nearly 40 years after King 's efforts on behalf of the poor people 's mobilization were cut short by an assassin 's bullet .
In 2007 , in this nation of immense wealth , the White House and most in Congress continue to accept the perpetuation of poverty .
They fund foreign wars with " alacrity and generosity , " while being miserly in dispensing funds for education and healthcare and environmental cleanup .
And those priorities are largely unquestioned by mainstream media .
No surprise that they tell us so little about the last years of Martin Luther King 's life .
Correction :
An earlier version of this column mistakenly attributed a quote from Life to Time magazine .
Every year that you age , your heart shrinks and its ability to pump blood through your body decreases by up to 5 percent , a new study finds .
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University analyzed MRIs ( magnetic resonance images ) of the structure and pumping function of the hearts of 5,004 men and women between the ages of 45 and 84 to look for minute changes .
The patients were of various ethnic backgrounds and had no existing symptoms of heart disease .
The doctors found that the heart 's muscle mass gradually shrinks an average of about 0.3 grams per year .
They also found that for each year that people age , the time it takes for the heart muscles to squeeze and relax grows longer , by 2 to 5 percent .
The actual amount of blood pumped out of the heart falls by about 9 milliliters per year , the researchers said .
" Our results demonstrate just how the heart plays a losing game of catch - up as people age , " said study leader Susan Cheng , a former medicine resident at Hopkins .
The results , presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association on Nov. 4 , provide insight into the risk of developing heart failure , which occurs when the heart can't fill up with or pump enough blood through the body , the researchers say .
" We already knew that the heart is constantly trying to adapt to risk factors , but now we know that this task gets more difficult as the heart ages and loses a little bit of its pumping capacity every year , " Cheng said .
Obesity and high blood pressure are also risk factors for developing congestive heart failure , which is marked by symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue .
Estimates show that more than 5 million Americans have some form of congestive heart failure .
Exploding stars that light the way for research on dark energy are n’t as powerful or bright , on average , as they once were , says a new study by University of Toronto astronomers .
The study , which compared supernovae in nearby galaxies with those that exploded up to nine billion light years away in the distant universe , found the distant supernovae were an average of 12 per cent brighter .
The distant supernovae were brighter because they were younger , the study found .
Since uniformly bright exploding stars help astronomers study the nature of dark energy – an unknown type of energy that causes the universe to accelerate its expansion – the team ’s findings suggest it could become more difficult to study dark energy in the future .
Astronomers can correct for supernovae of varying brightness , but it will prove challenging .
“ The findings do not call into question that the universe is accelerating but the evolving mix of supernovae could limit future attempts to determine the nature of dark energy , ” said Andrew Howell , lead author of the study and post - doctoral researcher .
“ You can think of supernovae as light bulbs , ” he said .
“ We found that the early universe supernovae had a higher wattage , but as long as we can figure out the wattage , we should be able to correct for that .
Learning more about dark energy is going to take very precise corrections though and we are n’t sure how well we can do that yet . ”
The paper , Predicted and Observed Evolution in the Mean Properties of Type Ia Supernovae with Redshift , was co-authored by post - doctoral researchers Mark Sullivan and Alex Conley and Professor Ray Carlberg of astronomy and astrophysics .
It appears in the Sept. 20 issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters .

February ’s Big Read in Missouri has selected a surprising novel–Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury .
I should not assume everyone today has read it , so briefly it is a novel about a future in which it is illegal to read books .
The fire department , because all houses are built of fireproof materials , no longer puts out fires , but burns books when it finds hidden caches .
A fairly decent film was made of it in the Sixties .
The reasoning behind this future is the eventual , clinical “ rationalization ” of history by a technocratic elite who have decided that fiction–and dreams–are inimical to peace and productivity and happiness .
The scientific age did this , with its hyper rationality and impatience with anything that cannot be measured or controlled .
It is a parable much of its times –the Fifties–and a terrifying landscape to anyone with half a brain and an ounce of independence .
But …
Ray Bradbury got it wrong , but when I first read Fahrenheit 451 I believed him .
He scared me to the core with that book .
That and the related stories , like The Exiles and Usher II , chilled me and set me on schemes of hiding my books from the sterile - suited , cold - eyed rationalists bent on doing me good for my own sake .
Scared me terrifically , but in the end he got it wrong .
I was eleven when I read both 451 and The Martian Chronicles .
I was in parochial school , among people ready to protect me with great spiritual warmth from a world that seemed determined to do away with God .
Somehow in that strange time in the middle to late Sixties , communism and science had gotten entwined .
It ’s clear now .
Most of the sf films of the Fifties and Sixties depicted the scientist as an emotionless drudge , all consumed with reason and facts .
Communists were likewise shown to be people who would sacrifice their parents in the name of the state , the collective , the greater good of the proletariat .
There was no room for love or faith or kindness .
It was an aesthetic alliance , a tone and pervasive comparison that we just took for granted .
We were children , we did n’t know .
And most did n’t care .
There was baseball and muscle cars , rock ’n ’roll and miniskirts , and Johnson , whose Texan drawl was anything but literate and scientific , was going to make the country povertyless and free .
Science was going to moon , not learning how think .
Communism was “ over there ” in rice paddies and Red Square and the quickest way to get a punch in the eye was to call somebody a “ Commie . ”
But I was reading these stories of how in the name of the orderly society all the books were going to be collected and burned and it was going to be the scientists –the rationalists – who were going to do it .
After all , it was n’t rational to believe in alternate worlds or aliens or ghosts or Atlantis ( even though archaeologists were searching , but they were n’t after all scientists –were they ?
–scientists worked in laboratories and wore white smocks … ) ; it was n’t rational to dream about John Carter or Tarzan , pretend to be Horatio Hornblower or James Bond ; it was n’t rational to prefer reading fantasies about other stars rather than textbooks about them .
Was it ?
I was n’t sure .
Even while I made preparations , hidey - holes in which to squirrel away my books , something nagged me about the whole premise .
For one thing , while I was reading Bradbury , I was also reading Clarke .
The thing about Arthur C. Clarke , especially at that age , is the impossibility of coming away without a sense of his profound faith that science –Reason –will give us the stars .
And everything else in between .
Clarke ’s work shares a pervasive confidence –not loud and splashy , but quietly insistent , just there in the background –that the true spirituality of humanity is expressed in its ability to solve problems and realize dreams .
Wait a minute .
Dreams ?
But scientists are n’t dreamers , are they ?
I mean , the books I love , the novels and stories , they ’re dreams on paper , made living by the reading … they are n’t rational .
They wo n’t solve problems or give us the stars …will they ?
The scientists will burn them … wo n’t they ?
Like most things at that age , obsessions come and go .
I recovered from my fright .
I did n’t think about it for a long time , until I ran into committees organized to pull books from library shelves , people who published lists of banned books , boycotts against bookstores designed to get rid of certain books .
Then all the fear Bradbury had evoked in me as a child came back , full force .
But they were n’t scientists .
Or communists .
They were people who believed in ghosts .
People who believed in devils and plots with communists .
People who were afraid of scientists .
People who , if they read books at all , only read the books they are told to read by those who make promises they cannot deliver .
Bradbury got it wrong .
Partly , at least .
The book burners do n’t know anything about science , nor do they want to .
If they win they will not be clean , sterile technocrats .
They wo n’t be burning the Bible along with Narnia and the Galactic Empire .
They wo n’t go to Mars .
They wo n’t go anywhere .
Science is a dream , too .
Clarke understood .
I ’m glad I read them both .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho reversed course on Thursday and said he would remain in the U.S. Congress despite his conviction in a sex - sting operation at an airport men ’s room .
In a statement just hours after a Minnesota court refused to let him withdraw his guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct , Craig said he planned to complete his third term that ends in January 2009 .
“ When my term has expired , I will retire and not seek re-election , ” said Craig , 62 .
“ I hope this provides the certainty Idaho needs and deserves . ”
Craig has insisted he did nothing wrong , did not try to solicit sex from an undercover policeman and is not gay .
But under pressure from fellow Republicans , he announced on September 1 he intended to resign on September 30 .
He began to waffle about his resignation shortly afterward , creating uncertainty about his future even as the Idaho governor interviewed some two dozen possible successors and had picked a possible replacement in the event Craig resigned .
Even if Craig left , it would have no impact on control of the Senate , now held by Democrats 51 - 49 .
Republican leadership aides said there were no plans to try again to push Craig out , and there was no way to force him to leave , although he will face a Senate ethics probe .
The case has been a major political embarrassment for Republicans , since they have long billed themselves as the party of conservative family values .
Democrats won control of Congress in last year ’s elections amid a series of Republican scandals , including one involving a Florida congressman sending sexually suggestive electronic messages to teenage male interns .
Sen . John Ensign of Nevada , who heads the Senate Republican campaign committee , said Craig should step down as he earlier said he would .
“ He had his day in court , ” Ensign said .
“ I am calling on Senator Craig to keep his word .
...
It ’s the right thing to do for the Senate .
It is the right thing to do for his party . ”
Sen .
Mike Crapo , Craig ’s fellow Republican from Idaho , was one of Craig ’s few supporters , saying , “ I think it is perfectly acceptable for him to change his decision ” to step down as he explores possible court appeals .
WORKING ‘EFFECTIVELY
Craig said in his statement , “ As I continued to work for Idaho over the past three weeks here in the Senate , I have seen that it is possible for me to work here effectively . ”
Craig was arrested at Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport on June 11 after an undercover police officer said Craig sat down in a stall next to him and used hand and foot signals to indicate he was soliciting sex .
Craig said his actions were misread and that he was not gay .
Craig said he did nothing wrong but panicked and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of disorderly misconduct .
After the case became public in August , triggering a political firestorm , he sought to have his guilty plea withdrawn .
The senator announced his decision to stay in the Senate shortly after Judge Charles Porter of the Hennepin County District Court in Minnesota dismissed arguments made a week ago that Craig was rushed into pleading guilty and only did so after being promised secrecy by the undercover officer who arrested him .
Senator Larry Craig ( R - ID ) is pictured in these police booking photos taken on June 11 , 2007 .
A Minnesota judge on Thursday refused to let Craig take back the guilty plea he made after a sex sting arrest , raising the possibility the Idaho Republican will resign his Senate seat as planned .

Porter ruled Craig ’s guilty plea to a disorderly conduct charge was “ accurate , voluntary and intelligent , and ... supported by the evidence . ”
“ I am extremely disappointed with the ruling issued today , ” Craig said in his statement .
“ I am innocent of the charges against me .
I continue to work with my legal team to explore my additional legal options . ”
In his 27 - page ruling , Porter revealed more details of Craig ’s encounter with Sgt. Dave Karsnia in adjoining bathroom stalls at Minneapolis ’ airport .
Craig peeked at the officer , sat down in a stall next to him and used hand and foot signals to indicate he was soliciting sex .
When Karsnia held his police identification underneath the stall divider , Craig said , “ No , ” and argued “ You solicited me . ”
A week later , Craig confronted Karsnia at the airport and was told to call the local prosecutor , which he did several times before mailing in his guilty plea .
A $ 1,000 fine was cut in half , and he was ordered to pay $ 575 in fines and court costs and given a 10 - day suspended sentence .
Introduction
Windows Preinstallation Environment ( WinPE ) is a lightweight version of Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or Windows Vista .
It is used for the deployment of workstations and servers by large corporations .
WinPE 2.0 is actually the lightweight version of Windows Vista with minimal GUI and drivers , with the ability to detect USB drives on - the - fly .
Just plug it in , run diskpart and then list vol .
You should see your USB drive listed with drive letter already assigned .
Originally , WinPE was only meant to be used as a platform for deploying Microsoft Windows operating systems .
In later versions , WinPE developed into a platform for the following uses :
Deployment of workstations and servers in large corporations .
Pre-installation of workstations and servers by system builders , for sale to end users .
Recovery platform used by larger system builders such as Dell , Acer and HP for use in Windows recovery .
Replacement for MS - DOS as a utility operating system used by technicians for system diagnostics and software repair work .
Platform for third - party Windows utilities , like the newest version of Symantec Ghost .
Today , I 'll teach you how to create a WinPE 2.0 bootable USB key .
As mentioned earlier , this is a lightweight version of Windows Vista .
This will be useful since older operating systems like Windows 98 and Windows XP will become obsolete soon enough .
Creating a bootable USB key with Windows ME or Windows 98 or even DOS is easy when you use the HP USB Disk Storage Format Tool with a bootable Windows 98 / ME floppy disk .
If you do n't have a Windows 98 / ME system , you can get the boot image here .
But how do you create a WinPE bootable USB key ?
Before you read on , please make sure you have a Windows Vista system as you will need it to format your USB key .
If you do n't already have OPK ( OEM Preinstallation Kit ) for Windows Vista installed in your system , then you can download the Automated Installation Kit ( AIK ) for Windows Vista .
If you do n't have OPK for Windows Vista and do not have a broadband connection , I do n't think you can go any further because the Windows Vista AIK weighs in at 992.2 MB !
If you have either Windows Vista OPK or Windows Vista AIK installed , follow these steps to create a bootable USB key for WinPE 2.0 .
Formatting The USB Key
1. Insert your USB key into your Windows Vista system .
Note that you can't do this with a Windows XP system because your USB key will not be listed as a disk when you follow the steps below .
2. Start a command prompt by going to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt .
3 . Type in the following commands ( in bold ) and press Enter after each command .
The comments follow below and italicised .
Please exclude them when you type the commands .
• diskpart
• list disk
- This lists the disks available in your system .
Check whether disk 1's size tallies with that of your USB key
• sel disk 1
- This selects the disk number of your USB key .
Change accordingly to reflect your USB key if you have multiple drives on your Vista system .
If in doubt , type ' list vol ' and check the size of your USB key and compare it with the list from ' list disk '
• clean
- This will delete everything in your USB key , so before you do this , make sure this is your USB key and not your hard drive !
• create par primary
- This creates a primary partition in your USB key
• sel par 1
- This selects the newly created partition
• act
- This makes the partition active
• format fs=fat32
- This formats the selected partition with FAT32 filesystem
• assign
- This assigns the USB key to a drive letter
• exit
At this point , your USB key will be empty and formatted with the FAT32 filesystem .
Now , we need to insert WinPE into the USB key and make it bootable .

As I understand it , attributes are syntactic sugar to do " stuff " .
Here 's a random simple example :
package Loud ; use Attribute : : Handlers ; sub Loud : ATTR { my ( $ package , $ symbol , $ referent , $ attr , $ data , $ phase ) = @_ ; no strict ' refs ' ; # redefines subroutines given the " Loud " attribute *{ $ package . ' ::'.*{$symbol}{NAME}} = sub { # dup STDOUT and instead pipe things to another program open my $ oldout , " > & STDOUT " or die " Ca n't dup STDOUT : + $ ! " ; open STDOUT , " | perl - pe 'tr/a-z / A - Z / ' " or die " Ca n't redirect STD + OUT : $ ! " ; $ | = 1 ; # call the original subroutine $ referent ->( @_ ) ; # restore STDOUT close STDOUT ; open STDOUT , " >& " , $ oldout or die " Ca n't dup \$oldout : $ ! " ; } } # ... in another file or package package main ; use base qw / Loud / ; # We want this function to be loud sub foo : Loud { print " Purple is a nice color .
" ; } foo ( ) ; print " Do n't yell !
" ; [ download ]
The output of this program ( it runs as shown above ) is :
PURPLE IS A NICE COLOR .
Do n't yell ! [ download ]
Catalyst uses the ActionClass attribute here to append some action ( provided by RenderView.pm ) to your subroutine
Last.fm connects users who share the same music tastes
The service , bought in May for $ 280 m ( £ 140 m ) by CBS Corporation , has signed a deal with the Sony BMG record label .
The partnership will give the web 2.0 service 's 20 million users access to the entire Sony catalogue of music .
Started in 2002 , the new deal will make Last .fm the largest web radio service the world , according to the company .
" We 've always aimed to have everything ever recorded available to listen to on our site , and having access to Sony 's collection of some of the world 's most popular music takes us another huge step closer , " said Martin Stiksel , co-founder of the service .
Last.fm allows users to connect with other listeners with similar music tastes , to custom - build their own radio stations and to watch music video clips .
The software also tracks what users play on their PC or MP3 player to make recommendations .
Thomas Hesse of Sony BMG said this was key in its decision to partner with the UK firm .
" The Last . fm streaming service will give our established artists a platform through which they can reach new audiences , and its unique recommendation system will provide our emerging artists with an important opportunity to build their fan base , " he said .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - A few weeks ago Candace Locklear ’s office computer quietly started sending out dozens of instant messages with photos attached that were infected with malicious software .
She was sitting at her desk , with no sign that the messaging software was active .
By the time she figured out what was going on , several friends and colleagues had opened the attachments and infected their computers .
It took eight hours for a technician to clean up her computer .
But because the malicious software worked so secretly , she ’s still not convinced that all ’s clear .
“ I ’d like to think that it ’s gone .
But I just do n’t know , ” said Locklear , 40 , a publicist in San Francisco .
“ That ’s what is so frustrating . ”
Computer security experts estimate that tens of millions of personal computers are infected with malicious software like the one that attacked Locklear ’s machine .
Such programs , generally classified as malware , attack companies along with consumers .
Some are keyloggers , recording every key stroke that the user enters -- sending valuable bank account information , passwords and credit card numbers to hackers .
In July , hackers used keylogging software to gather passwords to databases at the U.S. Department of Transportation , consulting firm Booz Allen , Hewlett - Packard Co and satellite network company Hughes Network Systems , according to British Internet security software maker Prevx Inc .
And other malware programs turn PCs into “ zombies , ” literally giving hackers full control over the machine .
The zombies can be instructed to act as servers , sending out tens of thousands of spam emails promoting counterfeit medications , luxury watches or penny stocks without the PC owner ever knowing about it .
The computer that controls the zombies -- known as the command and control center -- is able to change the text of the spam depending on what his or her customer wants to sell .

Inc said last month that confidential contact information of millions of its job seekers was stolen by criminals who used zombies .
Contact data for 146,000 job seekers using the official U.S. government jobs
Web site was also taken .
Monster said it would beef up its security , but even with enhanced protection there are no guarantees .
Security experts say that while companies and consumers need to be vigilant to protect themselves against Internet - borne threats , determined criminals are hard to beat .
“ I hate to scare people , but there is never 100 percent ( security ) , ” says Gadi Evron , a researcher with Internet security firm Beyond Security .
“ If you want to know for sure , never do anything with your computer and never connect to the Internet . ”
Evron has organized conferences between government and industry researchers to fight hackers who set up botnets , or networks of millions of zombies .
He said the picture painted by some presenters was depressing .
“ The problems are not getting solved .
They are getting worse , ” he said .
“ The bad guys are making a lot of money . ”
Still , he and other security experts recommend that PC users take basic precautions , including installing up - to - date security software , keeping current with updates that software providers distribute over the Web , and backing up files .
There ’s a wide range of PC security software available , including ones that were recently updated or about to be introduced by BiDefender , CA Inc , Check Point ’s Zone Alarm , F - Secure Corp , Kaspersky Labs , McAfee Inc , Microsoft Corp , Prevx Corp , Symantec Corp ’s Norton Security and Trend Micro Inc .
More important than security software , users need to monitor their own behavior .
The bulk of malware is installed on computers by users who either click on a Web link or on a file that is attached to an email or instant message .
PC users can greatly reduce the risk of infection by only visiting familiar Web sites and avoiding unknown attachments .
“ You wo n’t know you are infected until one day your ISP turns you off or restricts access or money starts disappearing from your bank account , ” said Adam O’Donnell , a senior research scientist with Cloudmark , which sells anti-spam software .
There 's a new myth percolating about the U.S. economy : Female workers are doing great .
So are educated men .
The only ones hurting are male high - school dropouts .
So , the argument goes , cut the whining about globalization and technological change hurting the American middle class , fix the education and training system , and get on with it .
It 's a nice story .
Unfortunately , it is n't true .
Women are closing the pay gap with men and are outpacing men in the race to get college diplomas .
But the fact is that the remarkable burst ...
To get a version that ’s set up for benchmarking , get the wf - 2. py file from this directory :
This version of the script finishes in 1.9 seconds .
This is a 3.5 x speedup over Santiago ’s version , and over 250x faster than Tim ’s Erlang version .
Pretty good for a short single - threaded script , do n’t you think ?
But I ’m running this on a Core Duo machine .
Two CPU cores , that is .
What about using them both for this task ?
A Multi-Threaded Python Solution #
To run multiple subtasks in parallel , we need to split the task up in some way .
Since the program reads a single text file , the easiest way to do that is to split the file into multiple pieces on the way in .
Here ’s a simple function that rushes through the file , splitting it up in 1 megabyte chunks , and returns chunk offsets and sizes :
def getchunks ( file , size =1024 *1024 ) : f = open ( file ) while 1 : start = f.tell ( ) f.seek ( size , 1 ) s = f.readline ( ) yield start , f.tell ( ) - start if not s : break
By default , this splits the file in megabyte - sized chunks :
>>> for chunk in getchunks ( " o1000 k.ap " ) : ... print chunk ( 0L , 1048637L ) ( 1048637L , 1048810L ) ( 2097447L , 1048793L ) ( 3146240L , 1048603L )
Note the use of readline to make sure that each chunk ends at a newline character .
( Without this , there ’s a small chance that we ’ll miss some entries here and there .
This is probably not much of a problem in practice , but let ’s stick to the exact solution for now . )
So , given a list of chunks , we need something that takes a chunk , and produces a partial result .
Here ’s a first attempt , where the map and reduce steps are combined into a single loop :
pat = re.compile (... ) def process ( file , chunk ) : f = open ( file ) f.seek ( chunk [ 0 ] ) d = defaultdict ( int ) search = pat. search for line in f.read ( chunk [ 1 ] ) .splitlines ( ) : if " GET / ongoing / When " in line : m = search ( line ) if m : d[m.group ( 1 ) ] += 1 return d
Note that we cannot loop over the file itself , since we need to stop when we reach the end of it .
The above version solves this by reading the entire chunk , and then splitting it into lines .
To test this code , we can loop over the chunks and feed them to the process function , one by one , and combine the result :
count = defaultdict ( int ) for chunk in getchunks ( file ) : for key , value in process ( file , chunk ) .items ( ) : count[key ] += value
This version is a bit slower than the non-chunked version on my machine ; one pass over the 200 megabyte file takes about 2.6 seconds .
However , since a chunk is guaranteed to contain a full set of lines , we can speed things up a bit more by looking for matches in the chunk itself instead of splitting it into lines :
def process ( file , chunk ) : f = open ( file ) f.seek ( chunk [ 0 ] ) d = defaultdict ( int ) for page in pat.findall ( f.read ( chunk [ 1 ] ) ) : d[page ] += 1 return d
With this change , the time drops to 1.8 seconds ( 3.7 x faster than the original version ) .
The next step is to set things up so we can do the processing in parallel .
First , we ’ll call the process function from a standard “ worker thread ” wrapper :
import threading , Queue queue = Queue. Queue ( ) result = [ ] class Worker ( threading .
Thread ) : def run ( self ) : while 1 : args = queue.get ( ) if args is None : break result.append ( process (*args ) ) queue.task_done ( )
This uses the standard “ worker thread ” pattern , with a thread - safe Queue for pending jobs , and a plain list object to collect the results ( list. append is an atomic operation in CPython ) .
To finish the script , just create a bunch of workers , give them something to do ( via the queue ) , and collect the results into a single dictionary :
for i in range ( 4 ) : w = Worker ( ) w.setDaemon( 1 ) w.start ( ) for chunk in getchunks ( file ) : queue.put ( ( file , chunk ) ) queue.join ( ) count = defaultdict ( int ) for item in result : for key , value in item.items ( ) : count[key ] += value
With a single thread , this runs in about 1.8 seconds ( same as the non-threaded version ) .
When we increase the number of threads , things are improved :
Two threads : 1.9 seconds
Three : 1.7 seconds
Four to eight : 1.6 seconds
For this specific test , the ideal number appears to be three threads per CPU .
With fewer threads , the CPU:s will occasionally get stuck waiting for I/O .
Or perhaps they ’re waiting for the interpreter itself ; Python uses a global interpreter lock to protect the interpreter internals from simultaneous access , so there ’s probably some fighting over the interpreter going on as well .
To get even more performance out of this , we need to get around the lock in some way .
Luckily , for this kind of problem , the solution is straightforward .
A Multi-Processor Python Solution #
To fully get around the interpreter lock , we need to run each subtask in a separate process .
An easy way to do that is to let each worker thread start an associated process , send it a chunk , and read back the result .
To make things really simple , and also portable , we ’ll use the script itself as the subprocess , and use a special option to enter “ subprocess ” mode .
Here ’s the updated worker thread :
import subprocess , sys executable = [ sys.executable ] if sys.platform == " win32 " : executable.append ( " - u " ) class Worker ( threading .
Thread ) : def run ( self ) : process = subprocess .
Popen ( executable + [ sys.argv[0 ] , " -- process " ] , stdin=subprocess .PIPE , stdout=subprocess .PIPE ) stdin = process.stdin stdout = process.stdout while 1 : cmd = queue.get ( ) if cmd is None : putobject ( stdin , None ) break putobject ( stdin , cmd ) result.append(getobject(stdout ) ) queue.task_done ( )
where the getobject and putobject helpers are defined as :
import marshal , struct def putobject ( file , object ) : data = marshal.dumps( object ) file.write( struct.pack ( " I " , len( data ) ) ) file . write ( data ) file .
flush ( ) def getobject ( file ) : try : n = struct.unpack ( " I " , file .read ( 4 ) ) [ 0 ] except struct.error : return None return marshal.loads(file.read (n ) )
The worker thread runs a copy of the script itself , and passes in the “ — process ” option .
To enter subprocess mode , we need to look for that before we do anything else :
if " - - process " in sys.argv : stdin = sys.stdin stdout = sys.stdout while 1 : args = getobject ( stdin ) if args is None : sys.exit( 0 ) result = process ( * args ) putobject ( stdout , result ) else : ... create worker threads ...
With this approach , the processing time drops to 1.2 seconds , when using two threads / processes ( one per CPU ) .
But that ’s about as good as it gets ; adding more processes does n’t really improve things on this machine .
Memory Mapping #
So , is this the best we can get ?
Not quite .
We can speed up the file access as well , by switching to memory mapping :

The rigged a pair of boxers with fasteners at the seams , so these are n't so different from the pull away warm up pants ( AKA , hiphop tuxedo ) .
But like most of the best inventions , the beauty here lies in the simplicity of design .
The quotes by the kids are the best part of this video , laced with lament and hope deeper than we could expect from youngsters :
" When someone gives you a wedgie , it hurts , and when we made wedgie proof underwear , it wo n't hurt anymore . "
Cheer up kid , you 'll get fewer wedgies as you age towards your nobel peace prizes for these things .
Although for me and many Giz readers , I 'd say this piece of engineering has come a decade or three too late .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Haythem could only recognize his oldest boy from his tall and slim physique as well as what was left of his shoes .
His son's head had been blown away , his body charred beyond recognition .
His wife of more than 20 years was torn apart .
Ahmed and his mother , Mahassen , were killed in the September 16 shootings in Baghdad .
" Only part of her neck and jaw remained , " Haythem told CNN .
The rest of her was covered by a body bag .
Choking back tears , he said , " Killing them was not enough , blowing up their skulls , they burned them and disfigured them . "
Haythem 's wife , Mahassen , and his 20 - year - old son , Ahmed , were among the 17 Iraqi civilians killed and 27 others wounded in a hail of gunfire September 16 in Baghdad .
Watch Haythem 's video of the charred wreckage »
Guards working for private security firm Blackwater USA are accused of opening fire on the Iraqis .
The Iraqi government has said the Blackwater guards shot without provocation -- something the U.S. - based contractor has denied , saying the guards were in a firefight with gunmen .
An Iraqi government report has accused Blackwater of " premeditated murder , " saying the company 's guards randomly fired at civilians .
An Iraqi panel investigating the shootings has asked Blackwater to pay the families of each of the victims $ 8 million in compensation .
" Money will not compensate us for what we have lost , even if it were piles of it , " Haythem said .
" No one can put a price on the lives of those killed . "
Haythem , 46 , a doctor who specializes in blood diseases , spoke from his temporary home in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood where he is living with his mother and two remaining children -- daughter Maryam , 18 , and son Haidar , 17 .
While he spoke , his mother sat in a corner of the room , moaning and sobbing , rocking back and forth on a couch .
She wore all black .
All Haythem and the family know about the final moments of their loved ones is what two Iraqi police officers who witnessed the shootings have told them -- that Ahmed was shot as he was driving his car in Nusoor Square and his mother clutched him tight as he was bleeding .
" Those who witnessed the incident say that my son's head was scattered and my wife held him and hugged him , " Haythem said .
" She was screaming , ' My son , my son !
Help me !
Help me ! ' "
The car slowly rolled forward until Blackwater guards unleashed more shots that turned the vehicle into a fireball , according to the witnesses .
" They understood the call for help .
They sprayed her with bullets , " he said .
Blackwater has not discussed specifics about the case , saying the FBI is investigating the matter .
Blackwater CEO Erik Prince told CNN Sunday one of the Blackwater vehicles was damaged by small arms fire and that his guards committed no " deliberate violence . "
Haythem 's wife also was a doctor and his son was attending medical school with hopes of becoming a surgeon .
" They destroyed my family and they killed my beloved wife , my better half , " Haythem said calmly .
" They deprived me of my eldest son who I have raised into a strong , young man .
They deprived him of fulfilling his dream to be a doctor and a surgeon .
They planted pain and misery in the hearts of my two younger kids . "
His daughter and son live in fear that he too will be slain on the streets of Baghdad , leaving them as orphans .
Maryam sat with her father throughout the interview , not wanting to leave his side .
She said she and her mother were close friends -- able to chat like sisters and share stories beyond most mother - daughter relationships .
" My friends would always tell me how much they noticed my mom 's love for me .
She used to always talk to me about my future and her dreams for me , " she said .
" I hope I live up to her expectations . "
Maryam 's last conversation with her mom was the morning of September 16 .
Maryam had a biology exam that day .
Her mom woke her up and reviewed the material with her to make sure she was properly prepared for the test .
" She stayed for another few minutes , joking and laughing , " Maryam said , tears running down her cheeks .
Haythem was dropped off at work that day by his wife and son .
They then picked up a college application for Maryam , who is hoping to enter dental school .
At some point afterward they were killed .
Haythem first began worrying when his wife was late picking him up from work .
Then calls to her cell phone went unanswered .
In the chaotic world of Baghdad -- where violence and kidnappings are common -- anytime a loved one does n't show up on time fears of the worst begin .
He eventually made it home and began making more phone calls .
The worrying intensified as news reports swirled of a deadly shooting in Nusoor Square .
He called his brother , a doctor at a nearby hospital , to check the emergency room and the morgue .
The brother found no signs of them .
Haythem 's brother then went to the scene and found a burned - out car .
He called Haythem and asked for the license plate number .
" My brother collapsed and said , ' The family car is burned and may God bless their souls , ' " Haythem said .
Despite his sorrow and anguish , Haythem maintains a calm and peaceful attitude , saying he only seeks justice through the courts and that he trusts the U.S. and international judicial systems .
" All we want is the fair judiciary do us justice .
We ask the judge who takes this case to think before he rules , to be satisfied with his ruling as if he were , God forbid , personally involved , " he said .
Haythem 's and Maryam 's faces light up when they speak of their loved ones .
Ahmed , they said , was an achiever , an ambitious young man who not only was always at the top of his class but who also enjoyed sports and singing and had an interest in languages .
He was fluent in English and was learning French and Italian .
" He was quiet and very popular and a leader .
This was all wasted in a moment , " his father said .
" He was guilty of no crime .
What compensation is there for that ?
There can't be any . "
Maryam just wishes she could turn the clock back .
" I only wish I could relive last month , my family around , " she said .
" But they are gone .
What can we do ?
If we die , we will do so in Iraq and hopefully we will all meet in heaven . "

Afghanistan : U.S. Worried Iran Sending Chinese Weapons To Taliban
9/15/07 September 14 , 2007 ( RFE / RL ) -- U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte says Washington has complained to Beijing about Chinese weapons shipments to Iran that appear to be turning up in the hands of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan .
Negroponte confirmed the U.S. concerns over China 's weapons deals with Tehran after a 10 - ton weapons cache was discovered in the western Afghan province of Herat .
The cache found in Ghurian district , near the border with Iran , included artillery shells , land mines , and rocket - propelled grenade launchers with Chinese , Russian , and Persian markings on them .
Britain's Foreign Office has also confirmed that it has complained to Beijing about Chinese - made HN - 5 antiaircraft missiles confiscated from Taliban fighters who were captured or killed by British Royal Marines in Helmand Province .
Beijing has said that it would investigate allegations that the weapons were forwarded to the Taliban through Iran .
When asked in Kabul on September 11 about the Taliban 's use of sophisticated new Chinese weapons , U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte also suggested that Iran has been a transit point for Chinese arms deliveries to the Taliban .
" A subject that I have discussed with the Chinese in the past is the fact of their weapons sales to the country of Iran and our concern , " Negroponte said .
" We have tried to discourage the Chinese from signing any new weapons contracts with Iran .
We are concerned by reports -- which we consider to be reliable -- of explosively formed projectiles and other kinds of military equipment coming from Iran across the border and coming into the hands of the Taliban . "
" I have no doubt that Iran has been involved in channeling money and arms to various elements in Afghanistan , including the Taliban , for the last few years ...
There are Pashtuns and non-Pashtuns who are being funded by Iran . " -- Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid .
In June , U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Washington had no evidence proving a direct role by the Iranian government in smuggling weapons to the Taliban .
But Gates said Washington suspects
Tehran is involved .
" I have n't seen any intelligence specifically to this effect , but I would say , given the quantities we are seeing , it is difficult to believe that it is associated with smuggling or the drug business or that it is taking place without the knowledge of the Iranian government , " Gates said .
Not Without Tehran 's Knowledge ?
Alex Vatanka is the Washington - based Iran analyst for Jane 's Information Group , which publishes " Jane 's Defence Weekly " and other journals about the weapons industry and global security issues .
Vatanka says it will remain unclear whether the Ghurian weapons cache is linked to the Taliban until Afghan or U.S. authorities announce details of their joint investigation .
But the presence of Chinese weapons so close to the Iranian border is the strongest evidence to date suggesting Tehran has had at least an indirect role in arms shipments to Afghanistan , Vatanka said .
" Whether the government or somebody in Iran could be buying arms from China and , without Tehran 's knowledge , ship it over to Afghanistan -- on that volume of weapons -- I find that extremely unlikely , " he said .
" I can only see that happening if somebody pretty senior and in an influential political position in Iran decided to facilitate that without letting everybody in the system know about it .
But they still had to be involved somewhere in the state machinery .
We 're not talking about rogue elements [ in Iran ] .
Baluchi drug traffickers can't pull that kind of thing off . "
Many analysts have noted that Shi'ite Iran and the Sunni Taliban had been firm enemies since 1998 , when the Taliban regime controlled most of Afghanistan and executed nine Iranian diplomats in Mazar-e Sharif .
But Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid , an expert on Islamic militancy in the region and author of the book " Taliban , " told RFE / RL that times appear to have changed .
Now , with U.S. forces deployed some 60 kilometers from the Iranian border at Shindad Airfield in Herat Province , Rashid says Tehran and the Taliban have a common enemy .
" I have no doubt that Iran has been involved in channeling money and arms to various elements in Afghanistan , including the Taliban , for the last few years .
They have long - running relations with many of the commanders and small - time warlords in western Afghanistan , " Rashid said .
He continued : " I think Iran is playing all sides in the Afghan conflict .
And there are Pashtuns and non-Pashtuns who are being funded by Iran who are active in western Afghanistan .
If the Iranians are convinced that the Americans are undermining them through western Afghanistan , then it is very likely that these agents of theirs have been activated . "
Political Backlash
Still , Vatanka says it would be " almost irrational behavior " for Tehran to supply the Taliban with weapons .
He says such a move would almost certainly lead to a negative domestic political backlash for Iranian President Mahmud Ahmadinejad 's government .
For that reason , Vatanka says he is eagerly awaiting the assessment of Afghan and U.S. investigators about whether the arms in the Ghurian cache were stashed away by the Taliban or by one of several rival militia factions in Herat Province .
" The question is , what would get even a faction within Iran to make that type of a decision ?
Maybe you have excellent business ties between the Iranians and the Afghans on the other side -- not necesarily the central government in Kabul -- but local leaders in Herat who turn around saying , ' You Iranians are building roads and infrastructure here .
You are setting up shops and factories .
But for us to be able to guarantee that we can protect your business interests , we 'll need to receive some arms . '
That 's an argument that one could put out : that the Iranians are essentially supplying not the Taliban , but Afghan partners to secure Iranian businesses and interests in western Afghanistan , " Vatanka said .
To date , Afghan President Hamid Karzai has refused to publicly support allegations of a direct link between Tehran and weapons shipments to the Taliban .
" We do n't have any such evidence so far of the involvement of the Iranian government in supplying the Taliban .
We have a very good relationship with the Iranian government .
Iran and Afghanistan have never been as friendly as they are today , " Karzai said .
Vatanka says that as long as Karzai maintains that position , skeptics around the world will dismiss suggestions from Washington that Tehran is supplying Taliban fighters in Afghanistan .
" From a U.S. point of view , if the insurgency in Afghanistan is essentially escalating based on Iranian assistance , then what Washington really needs to do is to provide far more evidence that points to that -- and get Mr. Hamid Karzai in Kabul and the regional governments in Afghanistan to back the U.S. up when it makes these claims against Iran , " Vatanka said .
After the U.S. military failed to find the weapons of mass destruction allegedly being stockpiled in Iraq , Vatanka said , " the skeptics out there are saying ' These [ new allegations ] are being made up by the U.S. to justify another war with Iran ' -- which might not actually be the case .
Iran might be involved .
But because of the lack of evidence , the Iranians are saying , ' Who else is backing up the U.S. allegations ? ' "
Some scientists say millions of research funds have been wasted
File
On 4 has discovered thousands of studies have been invalidated .
It found some scientists have failed to carry out simple and inexpensive checks to ensure they are working with the right forms of human tumour cells .
Cancer Research UK said it used robust procedures to check the cell - lines used in research .
One of the latest examples of scientific research to be affected by this problem is a study of oesophageal cancer .
Researcher Dr Chris Tselepis worked with an international team which has found that TE7 , an experimental culture of cancer cells used in labs for the past 20 years , was the wrong cancer .
Whole programmes of research had to be redone using verified human brain tumour cells
Prof Geoff Pilkington , University of Portsmouth
" Fortunately , for us our research was based on a number of cell types , so the impact of a mistaken identity for this line has actually been fairly minimal to us , " said Dr Tselepis who is studying the cancer at the Cancer Research UK laboratories in Birmingham University .
" But I 'm sure there 's many other laboratories UK and worldwide - based that essentially base lots of their conclusions on one cell line and in that case , this mistaken identity has a massive impact on conclusions that people draw from such studies , " he added .
Few scientists publicly admit such problems but Prof Geoff Pilkington , of the University of Portsmouth , told the BBC that he had to discard research into brain tumours after it emerged his team were studying human cells contaminated by the cells of rats and mice .
" Whole programmes of research had to be redone using verified human brain tumour cells , " he said .
" It 's hugely expensive and it's incredibly frustrating , " Prof Pilkington added .
Erroneous data
The problem is compounded by the fact that studies based on erroneous research data will be printed in reputable scientific journals and become part of the accepted literature , thus misleading future researchers .
Earlier this year 19 eminent cancer specialists from the UK and USA wrote to the US health secretary urging tough action to end this waste of time , effort and money .
The US authorities replied that there appeared to be " abundant evidence " that many studies and publications had been compromised .
But the letter 's originator , Prof Roland Nardone of the Catholic University of America , told the BBC that some scientists seemed unwilling to act .
Authenticated cell - lines
He said the best way to get scientists to comply would be to withhold research grants and publication in scientific journals unless their research used authenticated cell - lines .
This verification can be achieved using a technique of DNA profiling which compares the cell - line with a list of known contaminants and can cost as little as £ 180 per sample .
But the Medical Research Council , the major source of public funds for such research in the UK which provides £ 70 m of grants annually for cancer studies , is reluctant to enforce authentication .
Dr Rob Buckle of the MRC told the BBC : " As soon as you start talking about regulation we have to ensure that it is proportionate and does not inhibit research . "
Dr Buckle said the MRC was not aware of any particular study in the UK which had been compromised by problems with cell samples .
However , one of the UK's leading cancer medicine experts has said it is time for the scientific community to put its house in order .
Cancer Research UK says it carries out stringent checks on cell - lines
" No grant or no publication , " said Prof Karol Sikora , of Imperial College , London .
" If one of the leading journals , which all of us want to publish in , said : ' You have used cell - line - just give us the certificate of authenticity , ' Now we can tell all that and it does n't necessarily cost a lot of money . "
Cancer Research UK , which spends £ 315 m a year on research , would not be interviewed for the programme .
Instead it issued a statement from Dr Lilian Clark , its executive director of Science Operations & Funding , which said : " It is of paramount importance for us to ensure that all our researchers deliver world class science - they have the latest systems and robust procedures in place to guarantee this . "
Dr Clark said the charity carried out stringent checks on cell - lines , including a DNA authenticating service .

WITH the health care system at the center of the political debate , a lot of scary claims are being thrown around .
The dangerous ones are not those that are false ; watchdogs in the news media are quick to debunk them .
Rather , the dangerous ones are those that are true but do n’t mean what people think they mean .
Here are three of the true but misleading statements about health care that politicians and pundits love to use to frighten the public :
STATEMENT 1 The United States has lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality than Canada , which has national health insurance .
The differences between the neighbors are indeed significant .
Life expectancy at birth is 2.6 years greater for Canadian men than for American men , and 2.3 years greater for Canadian women than American women .
Infant mortality in the United States is 6.8 per 1,000 live births , versus 5.3 in Canada .
These facts are often taken as evidence for the inadequacy of the American health system .
But a recent study by June and Dave O’Neill , economists at Baruch College , from which these numbers come , shows that the difference in health outcomes has more to do with broader social forces .
The Ministry of Culture has begun insisting that tourists visiting the country ’s monuments , including the Taj Mahal , pay the entrance fees in rupees rather than in dollars .
Entrance to many sites for foreign tourists is priced in dollars and then converted to rupees , but the ministry has been losing tourism revenue as the dollar slid more than 12 percent this year against the rupee .
The government had fixed a $ 5 entrance fee for World Heritage sites like the Taj Mahal and Humayun ’s Tomb and $ 2 for other monuments at a time when the dollar was worth about 50 rupees .
It is now worth around 39 rupees .
The new rate for Heritage sites is 250 rupees , meaning a foreign tourist will pay the equivalent of about $ 6.50 .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 29 — Marking the 14th anniversary of legislation that allowed gay men and lesbians to serve in the military but only if they kept their orientation secret , 28 retired generals and admirals plan to release a letter on Friday urging Congress to repeal the law .
“ We respectfully urge Congress to repeal the ‘ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ’ policy , ” the letter says .
“ Those of us signing this letter have dedicated our lives to defending the rights of our citizens to believe whatever they wish . ”
The retired officers offer data showing that 65,000 gay men and lesbians now serve in the American armed forces and that there are more than one million gay veterans .
“ They have served our nation honorably , ” the letter states .
The letter ’s release comes as rallies are scheduled on the Mall by groups calling for a change in the law , which is known as “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” because it bars the military from investigating soldiers ’ sexual orientation if they keep it to themselves .
Detective Daniel Pagnotta , the lead investigator in that case , said the gang leader had such a reputation for violence , and the options available to relocate the witness were so limited , that it was simply too risky .
The police instead set up a sting operation that led to the arrest of the gang leader on narcotics charges .
They have not charged him in connection with the killing .
“ We knew we could have gotten evidence to link him to the murder , ” said Detective Pagnotta , who retired in June .
“ But it was pretty obvious that if we did , our witness would end up dead .
So we took what we could get . ”
Under the best of circumstances , the effort to spare civilians the ordeal of appearing in court can push the authorities to strengthen their cases by finding sturdier evidence .
When the Trenton police investigated a gang shooting outside the Jet Wine and Liquor Store in May 2005 , detectives found a witness who was willing to help them , but he was extremely uneasy .
Rather than put his name on a report that could be turned over to the suspect ’s lawyers , or pushing him to testify before a grand jury , detectives looked for other options and struck gold : a videotape that showed the suspect with a gun .
It led to an indictment for murder without the need for the witness to testify .
“ They ca n’t intimidate a videotape , ” Detective Pagnotta said .
Vernon J. Geberth , whose textbook “ Practical Homicide Investigation ” is used to train detectives in hundreds of police departments , cautioned that whatever forensic evidence or police testimony prosecutors may present at trial , there is no substitute for the power of a credible civilian witness .
“ With witnesses , I always say the more the merrier , ” said Mr. Geberth , who retired from the New York Police Department after serving as commander of the Bronx Homicide Task Force .
In Camden , attempts to build trust with residents has had mixed results .
In 2004 , when the police were making arrests in just 14 percent of all shootings , they formed a special response team to flood crime scenes with investigators and to canvass for witnesses .
Today , the police solve more than 40 percent of all shootings , according to city statistics .
Google will on Tuesday launch a customisable search engine that users can carry on their own blogs and other websites , a move that potentially opens up a big new market for its search listings and related advertising .
Marissa Mayer , vice - president of search products and user experience , said it was the most significant launch that Google would announce in the final months of this year .
By letting companies and individuals build their own specialised search engines , it will also create competition for the many new “ vertical ” search products that have recently been launched on the web , she added .
These sites , which deal with narrow areas of interest from job vacancies to information technology , have become one of the industry ’s big new growth areas .
Users of Google Custom Search Engine will be able to select the websites they want to be included in their searches , and add to this list in future by “ tagging ” websites they visit .
Any searches will then return results just from that slice of the Google search index .
Google also said it had created an easy way for users to “ paste ” a search box for the personalised engine on to their own webpages , so that visitors can carry out searches using their preferred parameters .
Results to those searches will also carry context - relevant advertising from Google ’s AdSense network .
Any revenue from the advertising will be shared with website owners on the same terms that Google offers to existing publishers that carry its search results , executives said .
The ideas behind Google ’s personalised search engine echo experiments tried by some other “ Web 2.0 ” companies .
Rollyo ( short for Roll Your Own Search Engine ) offers a similar service .
Google shares set a fresh lifetime high of $ 480.78 on Monday that followed last week ’s report of surging financial growth and Wall Street ’s upgrades on the stock , Reuters reports .
Shares jumped 4.6 per cent to close at $ 480.78 on Nasdaq , surpassing an intraday trading high of $ 475.11 set on January 11 2006 .
The stock fell to lows around $ 330 in March .

BERLIN —
An EU official called on Germany to impose speed limits on its autobahns to fight global warming , drawing angry responses yesterday in a country that cherishes what it calls “ free driving for free citizens . ”
The call came as the German government makes taking action against climate change a priority while it holds the rotating presidencies of the European Union and Group of Eight .
But the German environment minister showed little enthusiasm for EU Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas ’ suggestion , and a group representing Germany ’s auto industry said it needed “ no coaching on efficient climate protection from Brussels . ”
Many stretches of German autobahn lack speed limits — traditionally a cherished freedom in a rule - bound country .
However , the growing concern over carbon - dioxide emissions is putting that tradition under renewed scrutiny .
“ There are so many areas in which we waste energy in a completely senseless way and burden the climate , ” Mr. Dimas told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper .
“ A simple measure in Germany could be a general speed limit on highways , ” he added , according to the newspaper .
“ Speed limits make a lot of sense for many reasons and are completely normal in most EU states , as in the U.S.A. — only in Germany , strangely , is it controversial . ”
The commissioner did not suggest a specific speed limit for Germany , but in most European countries the highway speed limit is either 75 or 80 miles per hour .
Britain , Latvia and Sweden have the lowest speed limits at 70 mph , according to an official EU Web site .
Mr. Dimas ’ comments drew a number of negative responses yesterday on the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung ’s Internet site .
One respondent described the debate as a “ farce ” and questioned the environmental record of Mr. Dimas ’ native Greece .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who has said Europe should take a leading role in combating climate change to set an example for the United States , China and others , last week steered an EU summit to a bold set of measures to fight global warming .
Among several initiatives , the EU is planning to push for an increased use of energy - saving light bulbs to slash energy consumption and reduce the effects of greenhouse gases .
However , Mrs. Merkel has brushed aside previous suggestions — most recently last month — that a general speed limit on the autobahn would help fight climate change .
Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel said yesterday that he has “ nothing against [ a limit ] for reasons of traffic safety , ” but argued that the restriction would not encourage manufacturers to produce more environmentally friendly engines .
“ This is a secondary front and a trivialization of the climate problem , ” he said at an event in Hamburg .
The German Association of the Automotive Industry , which represents an industry that includes such famous names as Volkswagen , BMW , Porsche and DaimlerChrysler , said Germany needed “ no coaching ” from Brussels on how to protect the climate — “ above all when the proposals are only symbolic . ”
“ The German auto industry will act on climate change where there is real potential for savings ” of vehicle emissions , the group said in a statement .
Transport Ministry spokesman Dirk Inger said a study by a federal agency had found that an overall autobahn limit of 62 mph would reduce carbon - dioxide emissions by only 0.6 percent .
The U.S. Department of Energy calculates that for each 5 mph a car drives over 60 mph , fuel economy declines by 10 percent .
Mr. Inger also contended that , among European countries , only Germany had succeeded in reducing vehicle emissions .
“ Symbolic politics does n’t help us move forward on climate protection , ” Mr. Inger said .
“ That goes for Mr. Dimas , too . ”

Reach out with His noodly appendage !
Make your own Flying Spaghetti Monster crown .
Here ’s what you ’ll need : A ) white cloth , B ) black cloth , C ) cable ties , D ) hot glue , E ) a big spool of white rope , F ) scissors , G ) needles , H ) stuffing , I ) a headband , J ) thread , and K ) thick copper wire .
Your costume will be comprised of two basic parts : a headband with eyestalks and a crown of noodles .
For the headband you will take a long piece of copper wire , bend it in the shape of the eyestalks , attach it to a headband and cover the ends with fabric .
The noodles will be made of artistically coiled rope .
Our costume started out as a vegetarian pastafarian .
For a more orthodox deity we used paper meatballs from the flickr coloring contest which you could replace with balls of brown yarn or painted styrofoam balls .
Our headband happened to have holes in it , so it was convenient to route the wire through the holes .
If yours does n’t have holes , you can mount it on top of the band .
Strap the wire to the headband with cable ties .
Tighten the cable ties so that the joint is on top of the headband .
Clip the ends off .
Hot glue will help prevent it from rolling forward or back .
Cut the white fabric into a circle and a lollipop shape .
Sew the circle to the top of the lollipop leaving a gap where the stick would be attached .
Fold the stick portion in half and sew to form a tube .
Turn the round part inside out first .
Turn the tube inside out starting at the base of the circle .
You can use your wire to push it all the way inside out .
Stuff the eyeball through the opening at the base of the stalk .
Put the wire into the eyestalk and arrange the stuffing around it .
Sew the base of the eyeball shut around the wire .
Glue or sew the a black dot in the center of the eye .
Here ’s what your finished eyestalks should look like .
Now for the spaghetti !
Cut off several pieces of rope since you ’re going to want some pasta ends hanging out .
Be sure and leave a nice long one since people will want to be touched by His noodly appendage .
Coil up most of your rope and arrange the loose pieces around it .
Bind the pieces together with cable ties .
Be sure to aim the the pointy parts of the ties away from where it will sit on your head .
You do n’t want to get cable ties caught in your hair or poked in your scalp .
You may need to fuse the ends of your rope so they do n’t fray .

" Welcome to Denmark 's Tora Bora , " says Bobby Schultz , gesturing towards a rickety hot - dog van at the junction between two busy streets in Copenhagen 's fashionable Norrebo district .
It is an unlikely terrorist hideout , inhabited by an even less likely terrorist .
But in the eyes of Denmark 's ministry of justice , Preben Mikkelson , the 56 - year - old grandfather cheerfully grilling half a dozen different kinds of sausages by the roadside earlier this week is at the very least a terrorist sympathiser .
And if the Danish justice minister , Lene Espersen , has her way , soon his only contact with the culinary world will be prison rations .
Alongside Schultz and five other Danes , Mikkelson could be in jail by Christmas for his part in one of Europe 's most curious court cases : the so - called T - shirt terror trial .
His crime was sticking a poster up in his van for a brand of T - shirts bearing the logos of two groups classed by the EU as terrorist organisations : the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) .
The T - shirts were designed , printed , marketed , and sold over the internet for £ 15 ( about £ 3.50 of which was to go to PFLP and Farc ) by his co-accused - a teacher , two students , a copy shop owner , a website host and Schultz , a government worker .
All are members of a Danish activist group called Fighters + Lovers and are charged with " sponsoring terrorism " , a crime under post - 9/11 Danish anti-terror laws that carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years .
The case against them has caused the biggest debate about free speech in Denmark since the 2005 row about cartoons featuring the prophet Muhammad , and has been rumbling along in a Copenhagen court since September .
A verdict is expected on December 13 .
F+L describes itself as " a private enterprise dedicated to the cause of freedom and hard - rocking street gear " .
Pictures on the company 's website show the gear modelled by beautiful people with even suntans and moody expressions doing rebellious things .
One shot shows a young Adonis in sunglasses scaling a fence wearing a bright yellow T - shirt with a pink Farc insignia and a picture of a gun .
The fashion world is no stranger to controversy , but some may question F+L 's influences .
One of their muses is the Palestinian hijacker Leila Khaled , whose " stylish classic coolness " the group praises , alongside " the funky outrageous style of [ the late ] Colombian guerrilla commander Jacobo Arenas " who founded Farc in the 1960s .
Schultz ( not his real name : under Danish law defendants ' names are only made public if they are found guilty ) does not accept F+L's activities glamorise war and make armed struggle sexy .
But one of his co-defendants , Katrine Willumsen , a 24 - year - old student who is happy for her real name to be used , admits it is potentially a problem .
" But as the person who put together the hundreds of T - shirt orders we received from around the world before we got arrested , I can tell you that the majority of our customers were fat , old men , " she said .
She knows the buyers were not hip young things because almost everyone asked for XXL size , and they had " old- fashioned names " .
All the defendants are adamant they have not committed any crime .
They believe the EU " terror list " to be undemocratic because it is drawn up behind closed doors according to unknown criteria , and say that both PFLP and Farc are not terrorists but legitimate resistance movements comparable with Denmark 's own Nazi resistance during the second world war .
They say that neither group is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK , which does not defer to the EU on such matters .
What 's more , they say , they were n't financing any sort of violence , as the £ 3.50 from each T - shirt sale that would have gone to the two organisations was earmarked for " humanitarian projects " such as equipment for radio stations .
In the event , the money never reached Palestine or Colombia : by the time around 600 orders had been received , in February 2006 , the defendants were arrested after an extensive surveillance operation , their computers and remaining T - shirts confiscated ( even the smelly ones lingering in the defendants ' washing baskets ) and the company 's bank account frozen .
The trial began on September 20 , and quickly became far more than a case merely about the seven .
As the case unfolded , featuring terrorism experts from the USA , Israel and South America as witnesses , it became the court 's responsibility to decide whether Farc and the PFLP are terrorist organisations or freedom fighters , and judge the legality of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands and whether the Colombian government is a democratic regime .
As the prosecuting lawyer , Lone Damgaard , told Copenhagen city court : " It is not easy to decide what constitutes terror . "
Whatever is decided on December 13 , this case is almost certainly not closed .
The loser is likely to appeal : F+L has already announced that if its members are found guilty they will appeal to a higher court , taking the case to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg if necessary .
And it turns out that because the case began in a municipal court , which does not have full sentencing powers , the maximum sentence any of the defendants could receive is four years .
Meanwhile , the F+L Seven have n't let the prospect of a Christmas in jail sour their creative juices .
They have given up on T - shirts for now , and instead turned their attention to gold branded lighters bearing the legend : " A fire for fighters and a light for lovers . "
And business , says Schultz , is booming .

You 're probably used to doing that by now , though :)
Yep , that 's it .
( In fact , I changed that line a long time ago to do double - word returns , then forgot about it . )
That code does n't handle linux - ppc [ 32|64 ] , which use cr0.so , or AIX - ppc [ 32|64 ] , which use r4 .
The way the current code can call post_reg_write and then change the result registers again ( i.e. if the syscall post handler mangled them ) also looks suspicious .
I moved the post_reg_write call ( s ) into putSyscallStatusIntoGuestState ( ) for now , where each platform explicitly writes the registers it cares about , instead of using the arg layout .

Yay !
Roughly when would that be ?
" October " for the OS itself .
Leopard OS open - source release will follow the OS itself , and I 'd guess that the lawyers would n't let valgrind out before the OS open - source release .

Meisner opposed an abstract window for Cologne Cathedral
Cardinal Joachim Meisner , Archbishop of Cologne , was speaking as the Church inaugurated its Kolumba art museum .
Cardinal Meisner warned that when art became estranged from worship , culture became degenerate .
The cardinal had not intended to pay tribute to " old ideologies " , a spokesman said .
Taboo
The BBC's Marianne Landzettel says this was no off - the - cuff remark by the cardinal , delivered in a sermon in Cologne Cathedral , but was precisely scripted .
She says the phrase degenerate art - " entartete Kunst " - in German has only one connotation : that of Nazi Germany and the persecution of artists , the banning of paintings and the burning of books .
I thought all this was history , and then it is a high - ranking member of the Catholic clergy who uses it
Michael Vesper , former minister
" Entartete Kunst " was the name of an exhibition of works organised by the Nazis in 1937 in Munich as a warning to the German people .
In a newspaper interview , the North Rhine - Westphalia culture secretary , Hans - Dietrich Grosse - Brockhoff , said it was appalling that Cardinal Meisner had used such a word .
Former minister Michael Vesper also said he was shocked .
" I thought all this was history , and then it is a high - ranking member of the Catholic clergy who uses it , " he said .
After Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933 , the Nazi government started to bring art under its control .
All modern art , and Expressionism in particular , was labelled degenerate and was not to be shown in public .
More than 15,000 paintings were removed from German museums .
Recently Cardinal Meisner expressed opposition to a new stained - glass window in Cologne Cathedral .
The abstract work by renowned artist Gerhard Richter contains thousands of squares .
The archbishop 's supporters say he is not opposed to modern art as such but wanted the window to be a more figurative representation , including of those who suffered under Nazi persecution .
Correspondents say any sign of agreement with the Nazis is taboo in Germany .
Last week , a top TV presenter was sacked for praising the Nazis ' respect for families and motherhood .
CARACAS , Venezuela , Monday , Dec. 3 — Voters in this country narrowly defeated a proposed overhaul to the constitution in a contentious referendum over granting President Hugo Chávez sweeping new powers , the Election Commission announced early Monday .
It was the first major electoral defeat in the nine years of his presidency .
Voters rejected the 69 proposed amendments 51 to 49 percent .
The political opposition erupted into celebration , shooting fireworks into the air and honking car horns , when electoral officials announced the results at 1:20 a.m .
The nation had remained on edge since polls closed Sunday afternoon and the wait for results began .

The outcome is a stunning development in a country where Mr. Chávez and his supporters control nearly all of the levers of power .
Almost immediately after the results were broadcast on state television , Mr. Chávez conceded defeat , describing the results as a “ photo finish . ”
Residents said a 9 pm to 5 am curfew had also been announced for the city of Mandalay after a day in which tens of thousands of Buddhist monks and their supporters marched throughout the country in defiance of the military regime .
It was also reported the government - which is facing the most serious threat to its power since 1988 - had also imposed a ban on groups of more than five people gathering .
There were ominous claims tonight the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi , who has been under house arrest since 2003 , had been moved to the notorious Insein prison after appearing in front of her house to greet marching monks on Saturday .
The Reuters news agency quoted a well - placed source saying she had been moved on Sunday .
If confirmed it would mark a hardening of the regime 's position .
Truckloads of troops were sent on to the streets of Rangoon earlier today , where up to 50,000 marched despite the presence of army trucks near the Shwedagon pagoda - the most overt sign of a possible security crackdown after six days of demonstrations during which the army has remained in barracks .
Vehicles fitted with loudspeakers toured the city , warning people not to join the monks in what has become the greatest challenge to the military dictatorship in almost two decades .
The announcements said anyone taking part in , or supporting , the monks ' demonstrations faced prosecution , threatening to use military force to disperse any fresh " illegal " protests .
Yesterday the crowds swelled to 100,000 .
Burma Campaign UK claimed troops had infiltrated the demonstrators disguised as monks , planning to spark violence to justify a crackdown .
There were unconfirmed reports that hospitals were preparing for patients and prisons had been cleared to make room for arrests .
However , there were no reports of clashes with demonstrators today .
The protests began last month after the government sharply raised fuel prices , but have escalated into a broader , anti-government movement , with the monks chanting for democracy .
So far , Burma 's military leadership has remained uncharacteristically quiet , its silence emboldening ever greater numbers to take to the streets .
But fears are growing of a repeat of the 1988 pro-democracy uprising , which was broken up by troops who killed up to 3,000 people .
Amid growing international protest , the Nobel Peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu praised the " courage of the people of Burma " , adding in a statement : " It is so like the rolling mass action that eventually toppled apartheid " in South Africa .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , praised the peaceful nature of the protests and voiced his hopes that authorities in the country would " seize this opportunity to engage without delay in dialogue with all the relevant parties to the national reconciliation process " .
Today 's demonstrations were accompanied by other , smaller , protests in the second city , Mandalay , but they took place amid heightened tension - a sharp contrast to yesterday , when the mood was described as relaxed and " euphoric " .
As the monks , in maroon - coloured robes , left the Shwedagon pagoda , thousands of people cheered and clapped and linked arms to protect the protesters .
MPs from Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy also took part .
Around 400 students , some carrying a peacock flag that became the symbol of the 1988 protests , also showed their defiance of the military threats .
The fact that such unprecedented demonstrations should continue in the face of warnings of a crackdown is a mark of the depth of anger felt towards a regime that has hobbled the economy and left many suffering dire economic hardship .
A young 22 year old inventor , by the name of Kent Hodgson , has found a way to almost instantly chill a beverage without using any ice .
His relatively simple idea uses liquid CO2 to turn a warm beverage into a cold one within seconds .
The usefulness of a small device such as this one is endless .
It could eliminate the need for hauling around those huge coolers to the beach or to a barbecue .
It can also save space in your refrigerator by not having to put huge cases of beer , or other drink , into the fridge , and instead cooling the drink right before you actually drink it .
Also , this device does not dilute the drink , like ice does .
The inventor of this device says that the technology involved in this little gadget is very simple .
Here 's how he explains it in his own words , " You have plastic cooling cells which are pressed down into the dock which houses the liquid carbon dioxide .
The liquid CO2 expands and is pressurized into dry ice in the base of the cooling cells ... in a moment .
You then pop it into your drink and then proceed from there as you normally would . " ( Kent Hodgson )
The device is slightly larger than a pen , and it is expected to cool a case of beer with one canister of CO2 .
At this rate , it is estimated that it will cost about 7 cents to cool each beer .
Well worth it , if you ask me , to have a warm beer turn ice cold within seconds .
Kent Hodgson calls his invention Huski , and he is currently showing the device at an exhibit at the Design Exposure 2007 at Britomart Pavilion .
He is currently working on patenting the device , and expects to retail it for about $ 50 .

The Difference between a Recommendation and an Ad
A quick thought regarding Facebook ’s new Social Ads platform .
A recommendation is something you get from someone who knows something about you .
They have seen an item of interest and thought that you might gain some use by it .
They give their recommendation freely , knowing that it may do you some good , expecting nothing in return other than perhaps a “ thank you ” .
Recommendations are thus social capital .
The primary reason for a recommendation is a need on the receiver ’s side .
An advertisement is something you get from someone who may or may not know something about you .
They have an item they want you to be interested in , and hope you might gain some use by it .
They give it freely , but they do expect something in return as they are paying for this transaction .
Thus they are biased , however small , to give you that ad .
Advertisers will never give you what they objectively think is best for you .
They ’ll give you what they have .
Ads are thus economic capital .
The primary reason for an advertisement is a need on the sender ’s side .
Facebook cannot give recommendations as long as they accept money from advertisers which constrains the items available for placement .
They are being paid to show only certain stuff … not necessarily the stuff that ’s best for you , but the stuff made by the people who are giving them money .
To their credit , Facebook does n’t seem to be using the term “ recommendation ” … yet .

The wager stood at three guineas , according to which the dog would kill the monkey in at most six minutes .
The dog's owner agreed that the monkey would be allowed to defend itself with a stick about a foot long .
Hundreds of spectators gathered to witness this fight and the odds stood at eight , nine and even ten to one in favour of the dog , which could scarcely be subdued before the fight .
The monkey 's owner took a stick , about twelve inches long , from his coat pocket , tossed it to the monkey ...
The monkey was amazingly nimble , jumped about three feet high in the air and when it came down landed directly on the dog's back , bit firmly in the dog 's neck , grabbed his opponent 's left ear with his hand thereby preventing the dog from turning his head to bite him .
In this totally surprising situation the monkey now began to work over the dog's head with his club and he pounded so forcefully and relentlessly on the dog's skull that the poor creature cried out loudly ...
It is proposed that this article be deleted , because of the following concern :
this seems like nonsense
" What a monster ! " said a greasy butcher , who sat there with open mouth , a red nightcap on his head , pointing at Jacco Macacco .
" I bet a leg of mutton on the monkey !
You could strike me down if I ever saw such a thing before in my life ... "
Who would win in a fight ?
Wikipedia has the answer , but sometimes being a source of such answers comes at a price .
As with seemingly every other topic on the site , an anonymous expert sprung from the grass roots to detail the fascinating , hidden history of prizefights between dogs and monkeys .
" A quite unusual fight between two animals was staged in Worcester , " read his description of one fight , taken from an obscure magazine article from 1799 .
There 's even an illustration — titled " Battle of the Bulldog and the Monkey " ( above ) — from 1799 .
So who won the fight ?
The monkey .
Eventually the dog's corpse is carried from the ring . ()
Yes , it 's a cruel fight - to - the - death .
What 's more surprising is that someone in 1799 went to the trouble of carving an engraving to commemorate the event .
( Hey , 18th - century dog- fighters — get a life ! )
Then again , back here in the 21st century , Wikipedia editors would pick apart a description of the event sentence by sentence in a dog - fight of their own .
Reading the article 's " History " page ultimately offers its own morbid spectator sport .
In a six - part , 1400 - word entry , user SirIsaacBrock ( according to his user page , a Canadian MBA ) first described recreational " monkey baiting " in March of 2006 — and was unaware that his status as a Wikipedia editor would soon come to an end .
" Monkey - baiting is a blood sport involving the baiting of monkeys , " his original entry began — linking the words " blood sport , " " baiting , " and " monkeys . "
Within two weeks another Wikipedia user had tagged the article with a warning flag .
The user was later reassured by Sir Isaac 's involvement in another full - scale WikiProject — documenting various forms of animal baiting — and left an apology on Sir Isaac 's own Wikipedia discussion page .
( Six days later , another user would also add : " Thanks for the correction in Badger Baiting ... " )
In fact , there 's a whole series of Wikipedia articles , on everything from duck baiting to rat baiting and donkey baiting .
" Badger - baiting is a blood sport involving the baiting of badgers . "
" Donkey - baiting is a blood sport involving the baiting of donkeys ....
" But the monkey - baiting page remained controversial .
Sir Isaac presented an 1820 description of a second monkey / dog fight — this time between a dog and Jacco Macacco , " a celebrated monkey gladiator " who could dispatch opponents in 3 minutes .
" It is amazing how many owners would send their dogs to almost certain death , " Sir Isaac had written .
" This strikes me as unwiki , " another editor complained , saying it was not objective fact , and adding , " I personally do not find it ' amazing .
'" Another user complained about the article 's " wholy innapropriate origional research [ sic ] . "
Of course , research about 18th - century animal fights is hard to find — and a year later , the article remains online , a testament to one user 's dedication to his personal topic of interest .
Within four months of creating his page about monkey / dog fights , a warning appeared on his user page saying he'd been identified as " the puppet master of one or more abusive or block / ban- evading sock puppets . "
( Sock puppets are deceptive online identities . )
He has since been banned from Wikipedia .
In a way , it 's ironic .
SirIsaacBrock was a man who could tell you who'd win in a fight between a hunting dog and a rage - filled monkey — but he could n't stay online against a handful of Wikipedia editors .
Will he be hard to replace ?
How many amateur historians are available with an interest in monkey - baiting ?
We can only hope that his obsessive and self - destructive work will inspire a new generation of Wikipedians to continue to monitor this deserving subject matter .
Or , better yet , perhaps there 's another sock puppet out there at this very moment , waiting to ambush us with the latest and greatest in monkey - baiting

“ On Intelligence , ” written by Jeff Hawkins with Sandra Blakeslee , is a great read , full of provocative ideas about how our brains work .
Hawkins founded Palm Computing and Handspring , but he says that his true lifelong passion has been trying to understand our brains .
In 2002 , he founded the Redwood Neuroscience Institute ( now the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Berkeley ) .
At Redwood , he developed a theory of the brain , that he expounds in this book .
The book is a popular science book ; you will not find any equations or explicit algorithms .
It reads very smoothly , undoubtably due to the fact that Hawkins was helped in writing the book by Sandra Blakeslee , a science writer for the New York Times .
Hawkins argues that the cortex consists of modules that are all performing the same algorithm .
The purpose of that algorithm is to learn to complete and predict the spatio - temporal patterns coming into a module from “ lower ” modules in the brain ’s hierarchy , using feedback from “ higher ” modules .
I find this hypothesis for how the brain works extremely attractive , and “ On Intelligence ” argues for the hypothesis almost too well , in that the difficulties of converting the hypothesis into a concrete and useful algorithm will slip by the reader , as if by sleight of hand .
The problem , of course , is that it is easy to use words to talk about how a brain might work ; the hard part is making a machine do the same thing .
Peter Dayan , a leading computational neuroscientist , has written a much more detailed review .
And for a 2006 lecture by Hawkins about his theory , you can watch this video .
After reading the book , I actually spent a few weeks trying to make the hypothesis into a concrete algorithm , without much success .
But Hawkins is certainly putting his money where his mouth is : he has founded a company , called Numenta , and Numenta has released software ( the “ Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing ” or “ NuPIC ” ) that implements part of his theory .
NuPIC appears to be based on software originally written by Numenta co-founder and Stanford graduate student Dileep George , but transformed by a team of software developers into a professional - quality product .
However , it is very disappointing that the NUPIC software does not include feedback in its hierarchies , nor does it let you learn and infer temporal patterns ( only spatial ones ) .
To be honest , I am not so surprised , because it was these elements ( that are obviously central in Hawkins ’ theory ) that I found it so difficult to integrate into a real algorithm .
Numenta promises that future versions of NuPIC will fill these gaps .
I sincerely wish them the best of luck !
I should say that I think it is wonderful that an impatient guy like Hawkins pushes the field , using a different approach than the standard academic one .
So in summary , you should definitely read Hawkins ’ book , and if you ’re intrigued , you should by all means check out the free Numenta software .
Whether this line of research will lead to anything significant though , I ’m not really sure …

“ If a man ’s dishonest to obtain a job , he ’ll be dishonest on the job . ”
Mike Huckabee
With Mike Huckabee ’s sudden prominence in the 2008 GOP Presidential race has come greater scrutiny , of both the man and his record .
Prominent in both his famous weight loss saga , and as such it too merits scrutiny .
In June 2003 , Mike Huckabee was an obscure and obese ( 290 lb. ) Arkansas Governor .
By June 2004 , Huckabee lost 110 lbs. , which he attributed to diet and exercise .
This feat naturally attracted media attention as a human - interest story , to which Huckabee added a public policy angle by also touting his anti-obesity public health initiative called Healthy Arkansas .
This program included public service spots featuring a newly trim Governor Huckabee assuring Arkansans that if he could lose weight , so could they .
“ That was me just over a year and a 105 pounds ago .
Now if I can lose weight , anyone can . ”
Huckabee was featured in a spate of articles and media appearances that gave him enough national awareness to launch his long - shot Presidential candidacy .
According to the Washington Post ,
Huckabee ’s signature issue is fitness and weight control , and his evangelism on these matters never strays far from his own example .
Huckabee wrote a book about using diet and exercise for weight loss , Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork , featuring the obligatory before and after photographs on the cover and providing a rationale for a book tour and more media appearances .
The weight loss story remains part of the campaign ’s narrative .
Newt Gingrich , explaining Huckabee ’s rise cites his “ experience in health - care where …he lost 100 pounds and began exercising is personally a great story . ”
Huckabee ’s campaign continues to tout that his
“ efforts to improve his own health have received national attention .
. . .
[ H ]e lost 110 pounds , ” and that he uses “ his own life story to wage a war against the obesity epidemic in America . ”
Huckabee attributes his extraordinary weight loss achievement to his rigorous adherence to principles of diet and exercise , the evidence for which consists entirely of Huckabee saying it is so , and media accounts that echo Huckabee ’s claim .
When we hear , however , of the growing popularity of gastric bypass surgery , the thought occurs , what if that is how Huckabee lost his weight ?
Could he have had such surgery secretly ?
Would he then attribute the subsequent inevitable weight loss to his determination and discipline ?
Use his weight loss as a model for Government anti-obesity efforts ?
Author a fraudulent “ How I did it ” diet book ?
The media has n’t as much as hinted at this possibility .
Surely , such a scam would n’t be possible … would it ?
At present , the media appear more interested in promoting rather than investigating Huckabee ’s candidacy .
This disinterest would obviously change dramatically should Huckabee secure the GOP nomination .
The belated media scrutiny to which Huckabee would then be subjected might be well able to force Huckabee to admit mischaracterizing the source of his weight loss .
The political impact of such a disclosure would be undeniably negative and possibly even disastrous to the GOP ticket ( this is discussed further below ) .
Anything Huckabee has to reveal about his weight loss needs to happen prior to the primaries .
The media is n’t going to do any investigating now , and so we must do the investigating for ourselves .
The medical case for bariatric surgery
What is somewhat unusual about the evidence for Huckabee having had gastric bypass surgery is that it is almost entirely medical .
There is very little evidence of that type of by which political secrets are usually uncovered , e.g. witnesses , money trail , documents , etc .
The lack of such usual evidence , however , might not preclude the possibility of bariatric surgery as much as it indicates that medical privacy has been well maintained .
A medical case can be as convincing as any other , as medical reasoning is not without rigor , and has recourse to medical literature .
It happens that unexplained weight loss is a classic medical diagnostic problem , for which there are a myriad of potential diagnoses .
We can apply diagnostic methodology to explain Huckabee ’s > 100 lb weight loss , which is relatively simple as we need consider only two explanations : Nonsurgical diet / exercise or gastric bypass surgery ( the most popular form of bariatric surgery ) .
The first principle of diagnosis is the Law of Parsimony , a medical application of Occam ’s Razor .
The principle is to avoid making two diagnoses if one diagnosis adequately explains the symptom presentation .
In applying the Law of Parsimony specifically to Huckabee ’s weight loss question we gather what clinical findings we can , and ask whether bariatric surgery or diet / exercise best explains all these findings without needing to invoke further diagnoses or explanations .
To find these symptoms and findings we turn to the internet , where a surprising amount of material is publicly available owing mainly to Huckabee ’s relentless obesity PR campaign .
Huckabee ’s medical history
All diagnosis starts with the medical history the patient provides .
Huckabee denies surgery and gives a history of diet / exercise , but is a vague historian .
His weight loss performance is world class ; he lost 75 lbs , 0.4 lbs. per day , for 6 months .
Huckabee attributes his amazing success , after multiple diet failures , to his enrollment in the University of Arkansas Medical Center ( UAMS ) Weight Control Program , directed by endocrinologist Dr. Philip Kern .
The UAMS program involves an initial liquid diet , followed by gradual reintroduction of a normal but caloric restricted diet .
Huckabee states he was enrolled in the program , but provides no details of his experience .
You ’d expect his “ How I did it ” diet book to divulge a helpful diet technique or two — e.g. estimation of calories consumed and expended .
But no , the book is a compilation of homilies bereft of detail , almost as if it was someone else that was enduring a daily deficit of 1400 calories .
Perhaps the UAMS program could fill in the detail ?
No , the UAMS program is even less specific than Huckabee .
The Weight Control Program website has a few expired links to Huckabee media features , but no account from UAMS .
Dr. Kern says little , aside from participating in some of Huckabee ’s media events , praising Huckabee as a model patient and noting that his results were highly atypical for the program .
Huckabee has certainly been appreciative of Dr. Kern ’s efforts .
In 2007 , Governor Huckabee allocated $ 1 million in Arkansas general funds to endow the Dr. Philip Kern Chair at UAMS .
Denial of having bariatric surgery
Huckabee has generally avoided the subject of bariatric surgery , including not mentioning it in his weight loss book .
Neither have the media had the temerity to ask Huckabee about surgery , so intent have they been to credulously report the inspiring diet / exercise story .
Nonetheless , Huckabee has specifically denied non -diet / exercise weight loss on at least three occasions .
CNN ’s Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta , M.D. , specifically asked Huckabee how he lost his weight :
GUPTA : Listen , you know , a lot of people watching .
And obviously , it ’s a dramatic amount of weight that you lost .
How did you do it ?
HUCKABEE : The old fashioned way .
First of all , I had to learn that it was a change of lifestyle .
And my goal was n’t to lose weight .
And that ’s why this time I was successful , as opposed to previous times in my life .
And I would lose weight , but then gain it back and add some to it …
When I did those things , the weight took care of itself .
And I became a normal person in terms of my body weight .
Bariatric surgery has become more established in recent years , but it as yet can in no way be construed as the old fashioned way , and so this must count as a bariatric denial .
Huckabee volunteered that he did not have bariatric surgery , while speaking at the LIVESTRONG Presidential Cancer Forum :
HUCKABEE :
We do the same thing for bariatric surgery , which I know there are very few states that will actually provide .
For us , it was a three - stage level .
MATTHEWS : What is bariatric ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : That ’s to assist with weight loss for people who are morbidly obese . …
I was able to go through a program that was largely behavior modification through our med school .
You know , I changed my lifestyle but I ’ve had friends for whom that did n’t quite work and they went the route of the surgery .
The surgery is still incredibly better than allowing people to go for the rest of their lives which , by the way , will be dramatically shortened and more expensive , without some type of intervention and that ’s why the more that we can do to curb it , the better .
In a 2006 Newsweek “ Live Talk ” Internet chat , Huckabee was asked by a participant :
Moorhead , MN : Mr. Governor , I have lost 180 pounds myself .
I did consider surgery but did not go that route .
Did you also consider surgery before undertaking the task at hand ?
Mike Huckabee : I never considered it even though some close friends of mine have done it and most successfully .
It was a matter of fear for me — I do n’t like doctors slicing on me unless it ’s the only option !
( Just a personal thing ! )
So Huckabee is on record as specifically denying having gastric bypass surgery , unless he wishes to invoke Clintonian dodges ( “ I never considered it , you see , I just went and did it ” ) .
Most interesting was the ambiguous statement elicited by the website Calorie Lab when it asked Huckabee ’s spokeswoman , Alice Stewart , by email whether Huckabee had had bariatric surgery .
She responded :
“ Even if Governor Huckabee had lost weight by having bariatric surgery , there would be no shame in that , ” says Alice Stewart , press secretary for the Mike Huckabee Exploratory Committee .
“ [ But the ] fact is that the governor ’s weight loss program was very well documented by the media .
Steve Barnes of Time Magazine interviewed the governor as well as his doctors . ”
This curious response reads more like an admission of bariatric surgery than a denial .
Relative incidence of diet / exercise vs. bariatric weight loss
All medical diagnosis starts first with the recognition that common things happen commonly .
In considering different diagnoses , it is best to favor that which more commonly occurs .
So , the first thing to consider is the incidence of > 100 lb. weight loss for exercise / diet and bariatric surgery respectively .
Greater than > 100 lb. weight loss with diet / exercise is rare , and even rarer is keeping it off .
The reason that Huckabee ’s story garnered so much media attention was that it was “ man bites dog . ”
Partly as it is so rare , there are no incidence numbers , but a reasonable estimate of the number of people in the U.S. each year who through diet / exercise lose > 100 lbs. is fewer than 1000 .
On the other hand , the number of people in the U.S. in 2003 who had gastric bypass surgery was estimated at 102,000 .
So , if all we know is that someone rapidly lost 110 lbs. , the chances that it was through gastric bypass surgery are about 100 to 1 .
So , before we even start considering the particulars of Huckabee ’s story , in comparison to relatively commonplace bariatric weight loss , the diet / exercise diagnosis an many times less common , and thus less likely .
Weight loss pattern highly consistent with bariatric surgery
Just as it is said that once is a fluke ; twice is a coincidence ; three times is a pattern , so too does it seem unlikely that that diet / exercise should be able to match the characteristic weight loss pattern of bariatric surgery in terms of rapidity , amount , and maintenance .
The graphs below are from a large Swedish study in demonstrating the weight loss in 4047 obese subjects evenly divided between surgical and nonsurgical subjects .
The nonsurgical group , on average , had almost no weight loss .
The surgical group had weight loss that was rapid , large , and lasting .
The first graph demonstrates the pattern , upon which Huckabee ’s weight loss has been superimposed in the the second graph .
Starting at 290 lbs. , Huckabee 75 lbs. in 6 months and 110 in one year .
Since then he has regained 12 lbs .
The weight loss pattern of gastric bypass surgery is so highly characteristic and differs so markedly from the diet / exercise as to almost represent a signature .
Huckabee ’s rate , amount and persistence of weight loss follows exactly gastric bypass surgery ’s unique pattern .
Rapidity of weight loss
The New York Times reporters expressed astonishment at the rapidity of Huckabee ’s weight loss , stating he had been “ shedding weight so rapidly that it was as if he simply unzipped a fat suit and stepped out . ”
The NYT ’s amazement is because such rapid loss is so atypical for a diet and exercise regimen , in which a favorable 6 month weight loss is 5 - 10 % of body weight , a far cry from Huckabee ’s 26 % .
Huckabee ’s 75 lb. in 6 months was at a clip of 0.4 lbs/day , a 1400 calorie daily deficit .
A study of an appetite suppressant that enrolled 605 obese subjects in a 2 year weight loss program demonstrates rapidity typical for nonsurgical weight loss .
The study scattergram above displays the weight loss achieved at 6 months among the 605 patients of various starting weights in the study .
From his starting weight of 290 lbs ( 134 kg ) , Huckabee lost 75 lbs ( 34 kg ) in 6 months .
Huckabee ’s rapid weight loss experience is distant from all of the study ’s 605 subjects .
Amount of weight loss
In the appetite suppressant study , which is typical for diet / exercise studies , the average weight loss at two years was only 9.5 lbs. , the maximum weight loss of any participant in both the placebo and the drug group was 58 lbs. and 101 lbs. respectively .
In the amount of weight loss , Huckabee ’s 110 lbs. likewise easily surpassed all 605 participants .
Maintenance of weight loss
Huckabee has largely maintained his now normal weight for nearly 4 years .
This is characteristic for gastric bypass , but not so for diet / exercise regimens .
The vast majority of those who lose weight through diet / exercise regain weight .
For example , in a University of Kentucky study , in which subjects lost more than 100 lbs. , 49 % of that was regained after 5 years .
Weight regain typical for diet / exercise is demonstrated in the graph here .
Study participants on average regained 29 lbs. of their initial 48 lb. weight loss .
In maintenance as well , Huckabee ’s experience differs markedly from diet / exercise regimens .
In rapidity , amount , and maintenance of weight loss , Huckabee ’s weight loss demonstrates the exact pattern of gastric bypass surgery , which for each parameter differs markedly from diet / exercise .
Physical appearance after bariatric surgery
Some medical conditions affect the appearance of a patient in a characteristic way ; recognition of the appearance facilitates rapid diagnosis .
Such appearances often have descriptive names , such as the famous Pink Puffer and Blue Bloater of emphysema and chronic bronchitis respectively .
The distinctive bariatric appearance does not yet have an alliterative appellation ( Sallow Sagger ? ) , but is nonetheless distinctive and recognizable .
The bariatrics ’ distinctive appearance
The bariatric look includes muscular atrophy , lumpy distribution of fat , sallow redundant skin , and thin sparse hair .
It results from the extremely rapid loss of fat and muscle due to the caloric deficit enforced by the miniscule gastric pouch , as well as the malabsorbtion of protein , vitamins , minerals and nutrients caused by the operation ’s bypass ( hence the name ) of about 6 feet of small intestine .
This malnutrition manifests in unfavorable and recognizable skin and hair changes .
The singular and recognizable appearance is evident in photographs of bariatrics ( including Huckabee ) , but best appreciated in person .
Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi was struck by Huckabee ’s appearance and somewhat uncharitably described his reaction :
Huckabee , who in recent years has lost 100 pounds , has the roundish , half - deflated physique of an ex-fatty .
With his button nose and never - waning smile , he looks slightly unreal , like an oversize Muppet .
I was so taken aback by his appearance that I checked his hands to make sure they had the right number of fingers .
People who lose a large amount of weight through diet and exercise lose weight more slowly and without nutritional deficiencies and , thus , do n’t have this appearance .
To some extent , diet / exercise weight loss looks like the person has done something , bariatric looks like something has happened to them .
These two photographs demonstrate the changes between 2002 and 2005 ( thankfully , that is snow , not dandruff in 2005 ) .
Note the hair thinning , and change in skin color , from ruddy to sallow .
Muscle wasting is indicated by the concave region between the eyes and ear where the temporal muscle has atrophied .
If you had n’t seen Huckabee since 2002 , in 2005 you would not exclaim to him “ Hey … you look great ! ” , but rather inquire “ So…are you doing okay ? ”
These photographs demonstrate the rapid skin and hair changes Huckabee underwent .
In April 2003 , Huckabee has relatively thick hair and a ruddy complexion .
In August 2003 , two months into his weight loss , his skin is paler , and his hair is thinning .
In 2006 , his skin appears sallow and waxy , and his hair sparse .
A video shot in 2007 reveals the extent of hair loss on top and a general thinning .
In this photograph from the 2005 Little Rock Marathon , Huckabee demonstrates the characteristic bariatric washed out appearance , with pasty skin , sparse hair , atrophic musculature , and irregular fat retention .
The appearance differs markedly from the look of vitality expected from weight loss resulting from healthy diet and vigorous exercise .
Posing next to a hale 62 year old , it is the 49 year old Huckabee that appears spent .
Those who lose weight through diet and exercise may have redundant skin , but not the changes in muscles , skin and hair .
Again , Huckabee demonstrates the characteristic bariatric changes that are not expected with diet / exercise , and thus requires another diagnosis or explanation .
Diet habits consistent with bariatric surgery
Bariatrics have a specific diet necessitated by the miniscule gastric “ pouch ” that starts out the size of a golf ball and eventually expands to hold only one cup .
Specific bariatric dietary requirements also include increased protein and decreased fats to compensate for malabsorbtion .
They also have specific “ eating goals ” ( e.g. , taking 30 - 45 minutes to eat each meal , eating slowly , taking small bites ) .
Details on Huckabee ’s diet are found in the numerous human - interest stories his weight loss spawned .
He does not eat at banquets and receptions .
At events , he will have special food supplied for him from a cooler kept in his car or does not finish his meals .
He eats six small meals per day .
Avoidance of restaurant - type banquet meals is telling because such meals create difficulties for bariatric surgery patients .
These diet peculiarities bear little resemblance to maintence of weight loss , but tally quite well with characteristic bariatric limitations .
Huckabee ’s endorsement of bariatric surgery
Huckabee is certainly knowledgeable about bariatric surgery , coverage for which Huckabee provided Arkansas State employees .
As he told interviewer Margeret Warner :
We did weight loss programs .
We covered those .
Because we found that , even at the point of bariatric surgery , which is pretty expensive , most people ca n’t afford it — it scared me to death — but , you know , a lot of people , they ’re morbidly obese .
They need it .
There ’s a 60 percent to 80 percent financial return in terms of fewer health care costs after the surgery than there were with a person who has a situation of being morbidly obese .
That Huckabee championed bariatric surgery as Governor offers political cover should his own surgery ever be revealed .
( The Governor is incorrect on the costs as well .
Post - bariatric patients are more costly because , with their many complications , their hospitalization rate doubles for 3 - 5 years after the surgery ) .
Opportunity for surreptitious gastric bypass surgery
If Huckabee were to have had gastric bypass surgery , he would have required opportunity to disappear from public view during a brief hospitalization and recovery .
One such opportunity is evident in public notices in the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette .
Huckabee dates the onset of his weight loss to June 2003 .
In 2003 , Huckabee attended the Council of State Governments ’ spring meeting , held May 15 - 18 , in St. Thomas , Virgin Islands .
The Arkansas Democrat - Gazette reported on May 21 that Governor Huckabee was extending the trip to include a personal vacation with an indeterminate return date , adding portentously :
“ The governor chooses for his office not to disclose all of his travel plans ”
This absence must have been unusual , because in his 10 years as Governor , this is the only article in the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette archive that refers directly to Huckabee ’s vacation plans .
Huckabee , thus , had the opportunity to leave the Virgin Islands on Sunday , May 18 , for any destination ( including Arkansas ) , where he could have had bariatric surgery on Monday , May 19 , followed by several days of hospitalization and recuperation .
However , former Arkansas Governor Frank
White died unexpectedly Wednesday , May 21 , which necessitated Huckabee ’s public return on Thursday .
Huckabee attended White ’s lying in State in the Capitol Rotunda on Friday and spoke at the funeral on Saturday , May 24 .
The Arkansas - Democrat Gazette reports no Huckabee appearances the subsequent week until addressing high school students Saturday May 31st , except for Memorial Day services Monday , May 26 , .
On June 1 , Huckabee attended a conference in Mississippi .
With laparscopic bariatric surgery on Monday May 19 , Huckabee is likely to have been discharged from the hospital on Wednesday , the average hospital length of stay for such surgery being 2.5 days .
Gov.
White ’s death necessitated public appearances on Friday and Saturday .
Laparoscopic surgery patients ambulate the day of the procedure and recover rapidly , so by Friday , Huckabee would have been able to appear in public without noticeable difficulty .
Subsequent hernia operation
In March 2005 , Huckabee had surgery to repair a Spigelian hernia of the abdominal wall .
Spigelian hernias occur naturally , are not associated with bariatric surgery , and are located in the mid abdominal region .
Spigelian hernias are quite rare .
How rare ?
At the Mayo Clinic , only 3.8 Spigelian hernia operations are performed per year ; only 479 Spigelian hernias have been reported in the world medical literature ; out of a thousand abdominal hernias , only one to two are Spigelian hernias .
Spigelian hernias are located in the abdomen near the belly button , close to where incisions are made for either open or laparoscopic bariatric surgery .
In contrast to the rarity of Spigelian hernias , post bariatric complications requiring surgery are very common , especially incisional ( or ventral ) hernia repair .
Overall , 15 % of bariatric patients will require surgery for a incisional hernia in the first three years , an additional 5 % will need a laparotomy , and 5 % will undergo a wound revision .
A Huckabee disclosure of an incisional hernia operation would be tantamount to admittance of previous bariatric surgery .
On the press release , therefore , his surgeon needed to provide a naturally occurring hernia diagnosis that has a surgical repair resembling that of an incisional hernia .
Among naturally occurring abdominal hernias , a Spigelian hernia is the type of hernia that most closely resembles an incisional hernia , as it is in the lower abdomen instead of the groin .
Due to their rarity , there is no estimate of the annual incidence of Spigelian hernias , but if we generously attribute Spigelian hernias to be 2 % as common as the 1 in 500 person incidence of inguinal hernias , the annual chance of having a Spigelian hernia is one in 25,000 .
This chance is infinitesimal in comparison to the approximately 10 % incidence of bariatric complication requiring surgery in the first two years .
All else being equal , a repair of a post bariatric incisional hernia is thus 2,500 times more likely than a nonbariatric Spigelian hernia .
The particulars of Huckabee ’s operation provide further bariatric surgery connections .
The Baptist Health Hospital at which the Spigelian hernia repair was performed is Arkansas ’ only Bariatric Center of Excellence , and was performed by a surgeon whose partner is a leading Arkansas bariatric surgeon .
Participation in a marathon
Huckabee makes much of the fact that he has completed several marathons , as if these feats are impressive enough by themselves to substantiate the exercise basis for his weight loss .
It is possible to lose weight through exercise such as running , but examples of marathon runners who have sustained > 100 lb. diet / exercise weight loss are scarce .
It is much more common for bariatrics to find that the massive bariatric weight loss allows them for the first time to exercise .
This corresponds with Huckabee ’s story , related in his book and elsewhere , in which he describes beginning to exercise only after he had already achieved significant weight loss .
Bariatrics that run , and even run marathons , are not particularly difficult to find .
That the amount of exercise should increase after bariatric surgery is borne out by the Swedish bariatric study , in which the proportion of in the bariatric group exercising increases from 55 to 90 % after surgery , significantly surpassing the nonsurgical control group which remained unchanged ( see graph ) .
Again , we find Huckabee demonstrating a finding entirely characteristic of bariatric surgery ( increased exercise ) that is atypical for nonsurgical weight loss .
In Huckabee ’s marathon running photographs there is a possible clue as to his bariatric status .
A marathon runner expends approximately 2800 calories , and so to avoid hitting the hypoglycemic “ wall ” , marathoners commonly enhance bodily glycogen stores by consuming large amounts of carbohydrates ( e.g. pasta ) pre-race .
Such ingestion might be difficult for a bariatric with his miniscule gastric “ pouch , ” and other malabsorption issues .
Since bariatrics cannot so readily “ glycogen pre-load ” , we might expect , therefore , that bariatric marathoners to run carrying readily available extra energy supplementation on their person , so as to enable frequently imbibe during the race to ward off and , if necessary , to treat hypoglycemia .
When runners need carry extra items , they often use a special belt , such as the Fuel Belt .
On an organized marathon , in which energy bars and drinks are available at regular intervals , most runners have no need for the encumbrance of a Fuel Belt .
One finds only
one marathoner , Huckabee , wearing such a belt in the photographs from the the 2005 and 2006 Little Rock Marathon ( you may note a belt on # 1368 , he is an Board Member with the American Running Association , who is running with Huckabee ) .
One can find , however , other bariatric marathoners here , and here also sporting a “ Fuel Belt ” .
Such Fuel Belts are not rare among regular marathon runners , and his wearing a belt does n’t prove he is a bariatric .
Such belts are , however , demonstrably more common among bariatric runners than among nonbariatric ( and it is really difficult to find a belt so heavily laden as his ) .
If 5 % of nonbariatric runners and 40 % of bariatic runners wear such belts it is one more statistical piece to add to the bariatric side of the balance , and it is one more coincidence added on to the diet / exercise ledger .
Medical privacy and keeping the surgery a secret
Huckabee would have the expectation that his operation and several days of hospitalization would be kept private .
Within medicine , medical privacy is held to be a fundamental ethical obligation .
Medical privacy since early 2003 has gained Federal protection , with HIPAA medical privacy regulations .
These standards apply with equal force to both medical office practices and hospitals .
Medical privacy is part of every hospitals accreditation , and like every hospital , the Baptist Health Hospital mentioned above has quite specific medical privacy regulations .
Still , some may doubt that Huckabee could have had surgery without the news getting “ out . ”
If unsourced rumors are the criterion , it is “ out . ”
There is no particular shortage of usually anonymous internet posts and blogs that purport in Arkansas it is “ generally known , ” Huckabee had gastric bypass surgery , or that it is known at which hospital or by which surgeon it was performed .
Examples of these posts may be seen here , here , here , and here .
If Huckabee himself kept his surgery secret , a substantiated disclosure rising above the level of rumor would require a health care professional to identify him or herself while violating both medical ethics and Federal laws .
It is thus not surprising that there are no identified witnesses .
Should Huckabee should become the GOP nominee , however , the entire MSM and Democrat apparatus will available to reward and protect anyone who “ steps forward ” .
Fugitive from the Law of Parsimony
We ’ve considered a host of clinical factors so as to determine whether each is best explained by bariatric surgery or diet / exercise .
The findings are as follows :
Huckabee ’s vague history of diet / exercise does n’t adequately explain his astonishing result .
His spokeswoman gives an ambiguous denial .
Massive and persistent weight loss with bariatric surgery is orders of magnitude more common than with diet / exercise .
Huckabee ’s weight loss record fits the pattern of gastric bypass surgery exactly for rapidity , amount and maintenance , and not at all like that of diet / exercise .
Huckabee demonstrates changes in physical appearance that appear bariatric both in general and the specific ( hair loss and skin changes ) .
His particular diet habits are tellingly bariatric .
Just prior to his rapid weight loss he took an unusual vacation with a furtive itinerary and end date .
In 2005 he needed an abdominal hernia repair , an expected complication of bariatric surgery , and this was explained to be a Spigelian hernia , a vanishingly rare hernia type that is best explained as an apparent cover story .
His marathon prowess is not so likely to be an example of exercise inducing weight loss , as it is the expected result of ( bariatric ) weight loss permitting exercise .
While running marathons Huckabee is shown carrying that energy supplementation , that is both expected of , and associated with , bariatric marathoners .
The lack of any identified witnesses to the bariatric surgery / hospitalization is adequately explained by medical privacy ethical standards as well as the rigor of Federal law .
In applying the above mentioned Law of Parsimony , it is evident that the one explanation of bariatric surgery readily satisfies every clinical finding .
Diet / exercise alone is not sufficient to explain the findings ; it must either string together a series of unlikely to rare findings ( rapid , massive weight loss ) , and / or introduce new conditions and diagnoses ( e.g. rare hernias , hair loss )
.
Ramifications of a Huckabee disclosure
If Huckabee the nominee is eventually forced to admit that he mischaracterized his weight loss saga , the magnitude of the negative political impact is unknown .
Perhaps it would n’t much matter , voters would accept and forget .
However , it does n’t require an excess of imagination to think of what advantage it would provide the Democrats .
Regardless of what type of attack the they may wish to launch , be it against Huckabee ’s veracity , integrity , credibility , qualifications , issues , health status , suitability for office , or even person , it would be facilitated by Huckabee ’s acknowledgment of deception .
A thousand articles would begin “ Huckabee , who admitted deceit regarding his gastric bypass surgery … ” and would follow with further accusations that the campaign would have to defend from back on its heels .
It is easy to see the lines of attack that flow directly from an admission of gastric bypass surgery , and that a Huckabee GOP Nominee could scarcely defend :
Huckabee the former preacher even now has a perception of being an Elmer Gantry .
Being the perpetrator of a diet scam will complete the template , which will be used endlessly .
Democrat attack ad : “ Huckabee ’s Arkansas health plan was to secretly have gastric bypass surgery , and then blame Arkansans still obese for high health care costs . ”
The Democrats and media will find victims .
Obese Arkansans will be interviewed , who felt humiliated for remaining fat after the Governor falsely claimed that his weight loss proved “ anyone can ” .
Huckabee will have been shown to falsify his Presidential resume with his spurious weight loss achievement .
People who falsify resumes are fired , not elevated to the Nation ’s highest office .
Huckabee will have falsified his medical history to voters .
Thompson admitted he had Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma , Giuliani prostate cancer and McCain melanoma .
Bariatric surgery is of similar medical impact , and Huckabee has no excuse to hide his status from voters .
Trust but Verify
Huckabee is as eager as the other candidates to inherit the mantle of Ronald Reagan , whose famed adage was “ Trust but verify . ”
Huckabee can embody Reagan ’s axiom by making public medical information sufficient to disprove weight loss surgery , prior to the Republican primaries .
If Huckabee can substantiate his claim that he lost his weight the old fashioned way , then verification could only add to his stature , as losing 100 lbs and keeping it off through diet and exercise is such an impressive achievement that , if anything , Huckabee has been too modest .
If , on the other hand , Huckabee were to admit to having had weight loss surgery , the magnitude of the negative political impact is uncertain .
Some might think it would n’t much matter , if that is the case there is no reason not to disclose it .
If , on the other hand it were to matter a great deal , then greater is Huckabee ’s duty to the Republican cause to disclose it now , so that the GOP nominee can be chosen fully appraised of each candidate ’s political risks .
Methods of verification
There are several means by which Huckabee could verify his non-bariatric status .
The gold standard would be to have a simple upper GI barium swallow X - Ray , which could be accomplished in less than 20 minutes at any outpatient radiology office .
If Huckabee has not had bariatric surgery , the result will provide absolute confirmation , which will only add to Huckabee ’s credibility .
Huckabee probably had a barium swallow CT scan performed in 2005 to diagnose the hernia .
That CT scan ( report and films ) would also show whether the upper GI tract is unmolested .
The hospital records from the Spigelian hernia operation would contain information , such as the operative report , and possibly laparscopic photographs , that should be able to settle the matter , although the X - rays would be more definitive .
In any case , the means exist by which the Huckabee campaign could , at any time and in less than an hour , eliminate all doubt for all time about Huckabee ’s weight loss story .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf -- a key U.S. ally -- is less popular in his own country than al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , according to a poll of Pakistanis conducted last month by an anti-terrorism organization .
A hardline Islamic activist burns an American flag during anti-U.S. protests in Karachi , Pakistan , last month .
Additionally , nearly three - fourths of poll respondents said they oppose U.S. military action against al Qaeda and the Taliban inside Pakistan , according to results from the poll conducted by the independent polling organization Terror Free Tomorrow .
" We have conducted 23 polls all over the Muslim world , and this is the most disturbing one we have conducted , " said Ken Ballen , the group 's head .
" Pakistan is the one Muslim nation that has nuclear weapons , and the people who want to use them against us -- like the Taliban and al Qaeda -- are more popular there than our allies like Musharraf . "
The poll was conducted for Terror Free Tomorrow by D3 Systems of Vienna , Virginia . , and the Pakistan Institute for Public Opinion .
Interviews were conducted August 18 - 29 , face - to - face with 1,044 Pakistanis across 105 urban and rural sampling points in all four provinces across the nation .
Households were randomly selected .
According to poll results , bin Laden has a 46 percent approval rating .
Musharraf 's support is 38 percent .
U.S. President George W. Bush 's approval : 9 percent .
Asked their opinion on the real purpose of the U.S. - led war on terror , 66 percent of poll respondents said they believe the United States is acting against Islam or has anti-Muslim motivation .
Others refused to answer the question or said they did not know .
" We failed in winning hearts and minds in Pakistan , " Ballen told CNN .
" In fact , only 4 percent said we had a good motivation in the war on terrorism . "
Seventy - four percent said they oppose U.S. military action against al Qaeda and the Taliban inside Pakistan .
After American relief efforts following the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan 's Kashmir region , 46 percent of Pakistanis had a positive opinion of the United States , according to the poll .
But as of last month , only 19 percent reported a favorable opinion .
Meanwhile , al Qaeda has a 43 percent approval rate ; the Taliban has a 38 percent approval rate ; and local radical extremist groups had an approval rating between 37 percent to 49 percent .
Views of U.S. could improve , responses indicate
There were a few bright spots in the poll results , however .
Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto -- a relatively moderate and progressive figure , as well as a woman -- had a 63 percent approval rating .
Seventy - five percent of poll respondents said suicide bombings are rarely or never justified .
And a majority of Pakistanis said their opinion of the United States would improve if , among other things , there were increases in American aid to Pakistan , American business investments and the number of visas issued for Pakistanis to work in the United States .
Terror Free Tomorrow is a non-partisan , nonprofit group in Washington , D.C. , and according to its
Web site is " the only organization dedicated to a new strategic vision : Leading the fight against terror by winning the popular support that empowers global terrorists . "

There are still 50,000 families forced to live in FEMA trailers ever since Hurricane Katrina .
Trailers in which the levels of formaldehyde present in the air are so high , CBS has obtained emails that indicate the agency is prohibiting its employees from even briefly stepping inside them , and despite agency claims " that it is still working on the formaldehyde problem , " it is n't .
In July the head of the agency told Congress he was working quickly to deal with the toxic formaldehyde issue .
" FEMA and the CDC are scheduled to begin Phase One of a study in the Gulf Coast within the next few weeks , " said FEMA Administrator R. David Paulison .
Now FEMA says the study has been halted - not a single trailer tested .
The stated reason : the agency says it needs to identify " action levels for responding to the results . "
In other words , when FEMA finds high levels of the toxic fumes , the agency still does n't know what to do about it .
Sadly , this is exactly what we can expect as long as the party that does n't believe in government is heading our government .
Ever since Ronald Reagan 's inaugural speech when he declared " Government is n't the solution ; it is the problem , " Republicans could hardly have done more to make sure it is the case .
Donald Vance thought he was doing the right thing when he told the FBI about the illegal sale of guns , land mines and rocket launchers , all sold for cash with no receipt required .
The buyers were Iraqi insurgents , American soldiers , State Department workers , and Iraqi embassy and ministry employees .
So Vance says he blew the whistle , supplying photos and documents and other intelligence to an FBI agent in his hometown of Chicago because he did n't know whom to trust in Iraq .
For his trouble , he says , he got 97 days in Camp Cropper , an American military prison outside Baghdad that once held Saddam Hussein , and he was classified a security detainee .
Also held was colleague Nathan Ertel , who helped Vance gather evidence documenting the sales , according to a federal lawsuit both have filed in Chicago , alleging they were illegally imprisoned and subjected to physical and mental interrogation tactics " reserved for terrorists and so - called enemy combatants . "
A report issued a few weeks ago by the Government Accountability Office states the US has " lost " more than 190,000 AK - 47 rifles and pistols .
If Donald Vance is to be believed these weapons are being sold to whoever has the cash , which brings me to my theory that the Bush Administration has no interest in ever winning their illegal war .
As long as there are well armed insurgents our troops will need to stay in Iraq and money can be handed over to American corporations at astronomical amounts .
For the corporations the war in Iraq has been a tremendous success and anyone who blows the whistle on this money making endeavor will pay the price .
Congress gave over 30 billion dollars for the reconstruction of Iraq with
8.8 billion of it missing .
Why has this never been investigated ?
Bunnatine " Bunny " Greenhouse knows this only too well .
As the highest - ranking civilian contracting officer in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , she testified before a congressional committee in 2005 that she found widespread fraud in multibillion - dollar rebuilding contracts awarded to former Halliburton subsidiary KBR .
Soon after , Greenhouse was demoted .
She now sits in a tiny cubicle in a different department with very little to do and no decision - making authority , at the end of an otherwise exemplary 20 - year career .
People she has known for years no longer speak to her .
The message is clear , if you blow the whistle they will make your life hell .
Julie McBride testified last year that as a " morale , welfare and recreation coordinator " at Camp Fallujah , she saw KBR exaggerate costs by double - and triple - counting the number of soldiers who used recreational facilities .
She also said the company took supplies destined for a Super Bowl party for U.S. troops and instead used them to stage a celebration for themselves .
" After I voiced my concerns about what I believed to be accounting fraud , Halliburton placed me under guard and kept me in seclusion , " she told the committee .
" My property was searched , and I was specifically told that I was not allowed to speak to any member of the U.S. military .
I remained under guard until I was flown out of the country . "
Halliburton and KBR denied her testimony .
This is nothing new as its been 72 years since Smedley Butler wrote his book , War is a Racket detailing the first references to the Military Industrial Complex .
WAR is a racket .
It always has been .
It is possibly the oldest , easily the most profitable , surely the most vicious .
It is the only one international in scope .
It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives .
A racket is best described , I believe , as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people .
Only a small " inside " group knows what it is about .
It is conducted for the benefit of the very few , at the expense of the very many .
Out of war a few people make huge fortunes .
The mafia runs rackets and so does the United States government .
We 've been taken over by a criminal faction hell bent on torturing , killing , maiming and destroying people for profit .
We will never get our democracy back until we tame corporate power and get their money out of our politicians pockets .
We will never get their money away from our politicians until we elect candidates for office who refuse to take lobbyist and corporate donations .
Our people powered movement is a war .
It 's a battle of the people versus corporate power and it will take years to win , maybe a lifetime .
But win we must if we 're ever to get our country back to the principles it was founded upon .
So , give what you can to our people powered candidates and do n't ever get discouraged , this battle is long .

There 's a lot of underexplained goings - on in the article you link to .
Vance says the seller is an Iraqi - owned company .
The buyers include US soldiers .
Um , WTF ?
American soldiers buying weapons from an Iraqi - owned company , and the US gov't is protecting it ?
This suggests laundering on a massive scale .
Who owns the ( Iraqi ) owners of Shield Group Security Co. ?
What are the American soldiers doing with the weapons they buy ?
Why is there no Congressional investigation into this ?
We need at the very least a congressional inquiry ; write or call your member of congress , ( 202)224-3121 .

e Solar is one of the early - stage companies Google is working with .
Google has announced a plan to develop sources of renewable energy that will be cheaper than coal .
The new initiative , RE< C , ( renewable energy is cheaper than coal ) will begin by focusing on solar power technology , and will also encompass geothermal energy production .
According to the Google .
Org blog , of the early - stage companies they ’ve begun to work with to drive down the costs of renewable energy are eSolar Inc. and Makani Power .
“ We have gained expertise in designing and building large - scale , energy - intensive facilities by building efficient data centers , ” said Larry Page , Google Co-founder and President of Products .
“ We want to apply the same creativity and innovation to the challenge of generating renewable electricity at globally significant scale , and produce it cheaper than from coal . ”
Makani’s Power Kite
Page added , “ There has been tremendous work already on renewable energy .
Technologies have been developed that can mature into industries capable of providing electricity cheaper than coal .
Solar thermal technology , for example , provides a very plausible path to providing renewable energy cheaper than coal .
We are also very interested in further developing other technologies that have potential to be cost - competitive and green .
We are aware of several promising technologies , and believe there are many more out there . ”
Page continued , “ With talented technologists , great partners and significant investments , we hope to rapidly push forward .
Our goal is to produce one gigawatt of renewable energy capacity that is cheaper than coal .
We are optimistic this can be done in years , not decades . ”
( One gigawatt can power a city the size of San Francisco . )
“ If we meet this goal , ” said Page , “ and large - scale renewable deployments are cheaper than coal , the world will have the option to meet a substantial portion of electricity needs from renewable sources and significantly reduce carbon emissions .
We expect this would be a good business for us as well . ”
Coal is the primary power source for many around the world , supplying 40 % of the world ’s electricity .
The greenhouse gases it produces are one of our greatest environmental challenges .
Making electricity produced from renewable energy cheaper than coal would be a key part of reducing global greenhouse - gas emissions .
“ Cheap renewable energy is not only critical for the environment but also vital for economic development in many places where there is limited affordable energy of any kind , ” added Sergey Brin , Google Co-founder and President of Technology .

The Washington Post published a story yesterday stating that Personal Health Beliefs are Largely Hit and Myth .
The story discusses the results of an American Cancer Society ( ACS ) study released last week , which will be published in the September 1st issue of the journal Cancer .
The study assessed the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of scientifically unsubstantiated beliefs about cancer risk , finding that [ 1 ] :
… beliefs in several scientifically unsubstantiated cancer risk statements are relatively common among the participants in this study , and that the prevalence of such beliefs varies by certain sociodemographic characteristics .
Men were more likely to endorse scientifically unsubstantiated cancer risk beliefs than women .
Other characteristics associated with lower health literacy included non-white race , Hispanic ethnicity , income below $ 30,000 and less than a high school education .
Surprisingly , those people who considered themselves “ somewhat informed ” or “ not very informed ” about cancer , compared to those who considered themselves “ very informed ” , were less likely to agree with unsubstantiated cancer risk beliefs .
The authors state that this result is consistent with previous research [ 2 ] , demonstrating that people tend to overrate their own abilities and reach judgements with too much confidence .
Remarkably , over two - thirds of those people surveyed believe that the risk of dying from cancer in the U.S. is increasing .
This simply is not true .
Back in January I wrote about the decrease in annual U.S. cancer deaths when the 2007 cancer statistics were published .
The age - standardized cancer death rate has been decreasing since the early 1990s [ 3,4 ] .
The ACS study reminded me of anther investigation published in May of this year that examined the sociodemographic correlates of fatalistic beliefs regarding cancer prevention [ 5 ] .
Said another way , “ what personal characteristics correlate with the belief that cancer is predetermined and inevitable ? ”
The study found the following with respect to fatalistic beliefs about cancer prevention :
Nearly half of respondents agreed that “ It seems like almost everything causes cancer . ”
Over one - quarter of respondents agreed that “ There ’s not much people can do to lower their chances of getting cancer . ”
A whopping 72 % of respondents agreed that “ There are so many recommendations about preventing cancer , it ’s hard to know which ones to follow . ”
The results were similar to the ACS study mentioned above , that is , that fatalistic beliefs about cancer are stronger among less educated Americans .
A notable difference however in the results is that , when controlling for socioeconomic status ( with the exception of Spanish - speaking Hispanics ) , the beliefs are either weaker or equivalent among African Americans and Hispanics compared with Whites .
I must point out that these results are inconsistent with earlier investigations as well as the recent ACS study .
The study ’s relatively low response rate ( 34.5 % ) may be responsible for this inconsistency .
Family cancer history was linked to a stronger belief that “ everything causes cancer ” , which suggests a proximal cancer experience that raises perceived risk .
Unexplainably , being married or living as married was associated with greater agreement of two of the three fatalistic beliefs .
These results are a cause for concern as fatalistic beliefs are associated with people NOT engaging in cancer prevention behaviors , including regular exercise , not smoking , and fruit and vegetable consumption .
Individual beliefs in several scientifically unsubstantiated cancer risk statements may influence actual health - related behaviors and adherence to cancer screening guidelines .
Indeed , although a few years ago the ACS estimated that half of all men and one third of women may develop some type of cancer in their lifetime [ 6 ] , as much as 70 % of all cancers are preventable through diet and lifestyle .
The take - home message ?
There is a great deal of misinformation and scientifically unsubstantiated health beliefs in the world today .
Be extremely critical of what you read and hear .
Demand to see the scientific data and base your beliefs on the evidence .

The Arab press recently published more cartoons condemning terrorism .

These cartoons presented terrorism as an indiscriminately destructive force striking everything in its path , and mocked the terrorists for blindly pursuing the promise of the virgins of Paradise .
The cartoons also expressed criticism of extremists who entice the youth , indoctrinating them to embrace extremist ideas .
The following are samples of these cartoons :

Is C++ hurting Mozilla development ?
Is it practical to move the Mozilla codebase to another language ?
Automated rewriting of code can help some , but there are some basic language limitations that limit the scope of rewriting within C++.
What if Mozilla invented a mostly - C++- compatible language that solved problems better than C ++?
Why !?
Am I crazy ?
Well , maybe a little .
But what are the disadvantages of C ++?
Poor memory safety ;
Lack of good support for UTF strings / iterators ;
difficulty integrating correctly with garbage - collection runtimes ( MMgc ) , especially if we want to move towards an exact / moving garbage collector with strong type annotations ;
difficulty integrating exception handling with other runtimes ( Tamarin ) ;
C++ lacks features Mozilla hackers want : see some of roc ’s ideas ;
static analysis :
It would be good to statically prevent certain code patterns ( such as stack - allocated nsCOMPtr ) , or behave differently than C++ normally would ( change the behavior of a stack - allocated nsCOMArray versus a heap - allocated one ) ;
We are hoping to use trace - based optimization to speed JavaScript .
If the C++ frontend shares a common runtime with the JS frontend , these optimizations could occur across JS / C++ language boundaries .
The Moz2 team brainstormed using a C++ frontend that would produce Tamarin bytecode , but Tamarin bytecode does n’t really have the primitives for operating on binary objects .
On the other hand , C++ or something like it have advantages that we should preserve :
C++ can be very low level and performant , if coded carefully ;
The vast majority of our codebase is written in C ++ ;
Is it practical ?
I do n’t know .
Some wild speculation is below .
Please do n’t take it as anything more than a brainstorm informed by a little bit of IRC conversation .
LLVM is a project implementing a low - level bytecode format with strong type annotations , and code generator , optimizer , and compiler ( static and JIT ) to operate on this bytecode .
There is a tool which uses the GCC frontend to compile C/C++ code into LLVM bytecode .
It is already possible to use the llvm - gcc4 frontend to compile and run mozilla ; it compiles the Mozilla codebase to an intermediate LLVM form and from there into standard binary objects .
We would not invent an entirely new language : rather we would take the GCC frontend and gradually integrate features as needed by Mozilla .
In addition , we could translate spidermonkey bytecode into LLVM bytecode for optimization and JITting .
Finally , optimization passes for trace - based optimizations could be added which operate on the level of LLVM bytecode .
Problems …
The most pressing problem from my perspective is that using the G++ frontend requires compiling Mozilla with a mingw - llvm toolchain on Windows .
The gcc toolchain on Windows does not use vtables which are MS - COM compatible , which means that Mozilla code which uses or implements MS - COM interfaces will fail .
In addition , we would be tied to the mingw win32 api libraries , which are not the supported Microsoft SDKs and may not be always up to date , because they are clean - room reverse - engineered headers and libraries .
This mainly affects the accessibility code which makes extensive use of MS COM and ATL .
Is it feasible to teach gcc / mingw to use the MS SDK headers and import libraries ?
Is it feasible to teach the minw compiler about the MSVC ABI so that our code can continue to call and implement MS COM interfaces ?
Is there another solution so that the accessibility code continues to work ?
Questions
Am I absolutely crazy ?
As a Mozilla developer , what features do you think are most important for ease of Mozilla development ?
Are there solutions other than the g++ frontend that would allow our C++ codebase to evolve to a new language ?
Is this a silly exercise ?
Would we be spending way too much time on the language and GCC and LLVM and whatnot , and not enough on our codebase ?
Are there other ways to modernize our codebase gradually but effectively ?
Is LLVM or a custom language something we should consider for mozilla2 , or keep in mind for later releases ?

While there are hundreds of people I greatly admire , I 've always been stingy in adding to my personal list of heroes .
Perhaps that 's in part because " hero " has lost its shine from being applied so promiscuously .
Seven or eight or nine times out of ten these days the recipient of such labeling largesse simply does n't qualify for hero status .
Perhaps it 's just my personal perversity that says quarterbacks who make last - minute touchdowns , surgeons who install new hearts , or victims of terrorist attacks are n't , no matter how wonderful and hardworking they may be , heroes .
But it 's a perversity that wants to see the word return to its original power .
My number one personal hero is Frederick Douglass , the runaway slave whose persistent eloquence was one of the leading factors persuading Abraham Lincoln to bring black soldiers into the Union Army .
On July 4 , 1852 , he delivered a speech in Rochester , N.Y. , that both roused and riled those who heard it or read it later .
Here it is , without further comment :
Fellow citizens , pardon me , allow me to ask , why am I called upon to speak here today ?
What have I , or those I represent , to do with your national independence ?
Are the great principles of political freedom and of natural justice , embodied in that Declaration of Independence , extended to us ?
and am I , therefore , called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar , and to confess the benefits and express devout gratitude for the blessings resulting from your independence to us ?
Would to God , both for your sakes and ours , that an affirmative answer could be truthfully returned to these questions !
Then would my task be light , and my burden easy and delightful .
For who is there so cold that a nation 's sympathy could not warm him ?
Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude that would not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits ?
Who so stolid and selfish that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation 's jubilee , when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs ?
I am not that man .
In a case like that the dumb might eloquently speak and the " lame man leap as an hart . "
But such is not the state of the case .
I say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us .
am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary !
Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us .
The blessings in which you , this day , rejoice are not enjoyed in common .
The rich inheritance of justice , liberty , prosperity , and independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you , not by me .
The sunlight that brought light and healing to you has brought stripes and death to me .
This Fourth of July is yours , not mine .
You may rejoice , I must mourn .
To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty , and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems , were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony .
Do you mean , citizens , to mock me by asking me to speak today ?
If so , there is a parallel to your conduct .
And let me warn that it is dangerous to copy the example of nation whose crimes , towering up to heaven , were thrown down by the breath of the Almighty , burying that nation in irrevocable ruin !
I can today take up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe - smitten people .
" By the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down .
Yea !
We wept when we remembered Zion .
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof .
For there , they that carried us away captive , required of us a song ; and they who wasted us required of us mirth , saying , Sing us one of the songs of Zion .
How can we sing the Lord 's song in a strange land ?
If I forget thee , O Jerusalem , let my right hand forget her cunning .
If do not remember thee , let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth . "
Fellow citizens , above your national , tumultuous joy , I hear the mournful wail of millions !
Whose chains , heavy and grievous yesterday , are , today , rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them .
If I do forget , if I do not faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorry this day , " may my right hand cleave to the roof of my mouth " !
To forget them , to pass lightly over their wrongs , and to chime in with the popular theme would be treason most scandalous and shocking , and would make me a reproach before God and the world .
My subject , then , fellow citizens , is American slavery .
I shall see this day and its popular characteristics from the slave 's point of view .
Standing there identified with the American bondman , making his wrongs mine .
I do not hesitate to declare with all my soul that the character and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on this Fourth of July !
Whether we turn to the declarations of the past or to the professions of the present , the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous and revolting .
America is false to the past , false to the present , and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future .
Standing with God and the crushed and bleeding slave on this occasion , I will , in the name of humanity which is outraged , in the name of liberty which is fettered , in the name of the Constitution and the Bible which are disregarded and trampled upon , dare to call in question and to denounce , with all the emphasis I can command , everything that serves to perpetuate slavery - the great sin and shame of America !
" I will not equivocate , I will not excuse " ; I will use the severest language I can command ; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man , whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice , shall not confess to be right and just ....
For the present , it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the Negro race .
Is it not as astonishing that , while we are plowing , planting , and reaping , using all kinds of mechanical tools , erecting houses , constructing bridges , building ships , working in metals of brass , iron , copper , and secretaries , having among us lawyers doctors , ministers , poets , authors , editors , orators , and teachers ; and that , while we are engaged in all manner of enterprises common to other men , digging gold in California , capturing the whale in the Pacific , feeding sheep and cattle on the hillside , living , moving , acting , thinking , planning , living in families as husbands , wives , and children , and above all , confessing and worshiping the Christian 's God , and looking hopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave , we are called upon to prove that we are men !...
What , am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes , to rob them of their liberty , to work them without wages , to keep them ignorant of their relations to their fellow men , to beat them with sticks , to flay their flesh with the lash , to load their limbs with irons , to hunt them with dogs , to sell them at auction , to sunder their families , to knock out their teeth , to burn their flesh , to starve them into obedience and submission to their masters ?
Must I argue that a system thus marked with blood , and stained with pollution , is wrong ?
No !
I will not .
I have better employment for my time and strength than such arguments would imply ....
What , to the American slave , is your Fourth of July ?
I answer : a day that reveals to him , more than all other days in the year , the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim .
To him , your celebration is a sham ; your boasted liberty , an unholy license ; your national greatness , swelling vanity ; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless ; your denunciation of tyrants , brass - fronted impudence ; your shouts of liberty and equality , hollow mockery ; your prayers and hymns , your sermons and thanksgivings , with all your religious parade and solemnity , are , to Him , mere bombast , fraud , deception , impiety , and hypocrisy - a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages .
There is not a nation of savages .
There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the United States at this very hour .
Go where you may , search where you will , roam through all the monarchies and despotisms - of the Old World , travel through South America , search out every abuse , and when you have found the last , lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation , and you will say with me that , for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy , America reigns without a rival .

Howdy !
This is the Diesel Sweeties syndicated comics archive !
Print DS ran from 2007 - 2008 in real - life newspapers .
I 'm coloring these strips and posting them a week at a time , every Friday until I 'm done .
In response to the RIAA and MPAA 's campaign against file - sharing , the University of Kansas has announced a stringent policy for students found sharing copyrighted content on the university network .
Students fingered for file - sharing would be kicked off of the residence hall network , although they would still be able to use campus computer labs .
A brief notice on the University of Kansas ResNet site explains the university 's new position very succinctly .
" If you are caught downloading copyrighted material , you will lose your ResNet privileges forever , " reads the notice .
" No second notices , no excuses , no refunds .
One violation and your ResNet internet access is gone for as long as you reside on campus . "
Presumably , the University is referring to illegally downloaded copyrighted material , as there is plenty of copyrighted material that can be downloaded legally .
Formerly , KU had a three strikes policy , but the new policy is one of the most stringent we have seen .
Other schools have tightened their policies on copyright infringement since Big Content ratcheted up its fight against on - campus file - sharing .
For one , Stanford University has made file - sharing a potentially very expensive proposition with its reconnection fees .
First - time offenders will have to pay a $ 100 reconnection fee , with subsequent offenses assessed reconnection fees of $ 500 and $ 1,000 .
Along with the $ 1,000 fee , students will be referred to Judicial Affairs for disciplinary action after a third offense .
Ohio University has taken a different approach to file - sharing , choosing to ban all P2P traffic from its network .
Although it has had the effect of shutting down some of the file - sharing that occurs on its campus network , it has also had the effect of pushing some of the P2P traffic to darknets .
A KU spokesperson told the Lawrence Journal - World that the increased number of takedown notices has led to the new policy .
The school received 345 complaints in 2005 , up from 141 the year before .
" It 's serious business .
Students need to take notice , " KU spokesman Todd Cohen told the Journal - World .
Cohen also noted that the school had received 23 prelitigation settlement letters from the RIAA on the same day the new policy was announced .
Another factor in KU 's move may be recent rumblings from Congress .
In May , Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) of the House Judiciary Committee issued an ominous warning to schools , telling them that they need to do something about piracy or Congress would be forced to act .
" We want to know exactly what they plan to do to stop illegal downloading on their campuses , " said Smith .
" Universities have a moral and legal obligation to ensure students do not use campus computers for illegal downloading . "
The end result may be an expensive technological arms race between schools and technologically - savvy students .
KU 's new policy is likely to have the desired effect of discouraging most casual P2P users while driving towards darknets .
D'oh !
Senate GOP staffers wince at Simpsons SCHIP ' joke '
Perhaps Friday afternoon boredom got the best of some House Republican staffers , or maybe whoever wrote this press release just came off an 18 - hour Simpsons marathon .
Whatever the case , the use of fictional Springfield 's Montgomery Burns and Mayor Joe Quimby to sell GOP talking points on a critical healthcare bill is being panned in the blogosphere .
Even some Republican staffers on the other side of Capitol Hill winced at the stilted Simpsons joke .
The House Energy and Commerce Committee minority staff imagined a fictional press conference featuring " Republican businessman " Burns and Quimby , " D - Springfield , " supporting the " Senate 's gazillion - dollar SCHIP bill . "
( Congress and President Bush are fighting over the reauthorization of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program . )
" Somehow they managed to look bitter instead of funny , " one Senate GOP aide told Roll Call 's Heard on the Hill column .
 That took a lot of talent . 
Wonkette called the GOP attempt a humor a " mindfuck of a press release , " and Ryan Powers , blogging at The Body Politik , said the satire has " absolutely no basis in reality . "
The GOP release also took some pot-shots at MoveOn.org , a favorite GOP target , and it included a disclaimer in case anyone would confuse the yellow - hued Springfieldians for actual politicians .
" * Actual facts and events may vary , " it says , " but really , how much ? "
May 11 , 2007 -- Movie ratings will now be partly based on smoking shown on the silver screen .
The Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) says it will consider on - screen smoking in its movie ratings system .
Movies that " glamorize smoking or movies that feature pervasive smoking outside of an historic or other mitigating context may receive a higher rating , " states an MPAA news release dated May 10 .
The news release includes a statement from MPAA chair and CEO Dan Glickman .
" There is broad awareness of smoking as a unique public health concern due to nicotine 's highly addictive nature , and no parent wants their child to take up the habit , " states Glickman .
By including smoking in the movie ratings system , parents will get more information about movie content , Glickman notes .
However , on - screen smoking wo n't require an " R " rating .
Instead , smoking will be one of several factors -- including violence , sexual situations , and language -- that determine movie ratings .
Three out of every four films that contained " any smoking at all " over the past few years are already rated ' R ' for other reasons , says Glickman .

A giant outline of Homer Simpson brandishing a doughnut was enough to make even pagans go " D'oh " .
Painted opposite famous fertility symbol , the Cerne Abbas giant , the idea had been to plug the new Simpsons movie due out later this month .
But instead the image has incited the wrath of British pagans who have now pledged to perform " rain magic " to rid their sacred site of its unwelcome guest .
Scroll down for more
The 17th century chalk outline of the naked , sexually aroused , club - wielding giant is believed by many to be a symbol of ancient spirituality .
Many couples also believe the mysterious image , which is carved in the hillside above Cerne Abbas , Dorset , is an aid to fertility .
The giant doughnut - wielding Homer has been painted with water - based biodegradable paint which will wash away as soon as it rains .
Ann Bryn- Evans , joint Wessex district manager for The Pagan Federation , said : " It 's very disrespectful and not at all aesthetically pleasing .
" We were hoping for some dry weather but I think I have changed my mind .
We 'll be doing some rain magic to bring the rain and wash it away . "
She added : " I 'm amazed they got permission to do something so ridiculous .
It 's an area of scientific interest . "
She also expressed fears that the painting of Homer , from the animated television series The Simpsons , would cause a mess as it washed away .
Catherine Hosen , who is the Wiltshire representative for The Pagan Federation , said : " I find it quite shocking and very disrespectful .
" It 's just a publicity stunt for a film and we are talking about a monument which is definitely of great historical significance and a lot of people feel has important spiritual significance as well . "
It is not the first time the well - endowed giant has been used to advertise products .
He has been used to promote items as diverse as condoms , jeans and bicycles .
During the Second World War , he was disguised to prevent the Germans from using him as an aerial landmark .
Since then he has always been visible , receiving regular grass trimming and a full re-chalking every 25 years .

SACRAMENTO / Judge tosses a blanket on topless protest / Breasts
Not Bombs told nudity not part of free - speech rights
2005-11-05 04:00:00 PDT Sacramento --
A federal judge denied on Friday a request from a group of Mendocino women who wanted to protest topless on the grounds of the state Capitol .
U.S. District Judge Garland Burrell said the group made no compelling argument that showing their breasts constitutes free speech .
" Being topless is not inherently expressive " speech , Burrell said .
The group , Breasts Not Bombs , had scheduled a protest for noon Monday .
The California Highway Patrol threatened to arrest anyone who went topless .
Sherry Glaser , a leader of the group , said the protest may take place without bare breasts .
" All we really have is the power of ourselves , " she said .
" Our bodies bring attention . "
Group members , whose protest on the west steps of the Capitol is intended to contrast the " indecent " initiatives backed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on the November ballot with their " natural and decent " breasts , sought a temporary restraining order prohibiting CHP officers from arresting women who protest topless .
The First Amendment protects their right to protest bare breasted , the group argued .
" The very act is a dynamic and fully expressive statement worthy of constitutional protection , " their brief asserts .
But Burrell did n't buy that argument .
" Do you think the founding fathers had this in mind when they drafted the First Amendment ? " he asked Matthew Kumin , the lawyer representing Breasts Not Bombs .
Lawyers for the state said no previous group has been allowed to protest on Capitol grounds unclothed .
Those protesters who have disrobed were ordered to put their clothes on or face arrest .
" It has always been our policy that we do not allow nudity on the Capitol 's grounds , " said Tom Marshall , a CHP spokesman .
Allowing public nudity on the Capitol grounds would also be disruptive and possibly dangerous , the state argued .
" The state Capitol is a destination for California residents and tourists from around the world .
Hundreds of California schoolchildren visit on a daily basis .
They often enjoy their lunch on the west steps of the Capitol , " the lawyers for the attorney general 's office wrote .
" What visitors to the Capitol do not and cannot expect is to see topless adults and children engaged in public nudity under the guise of political protest . "
U.S. economy may be in crisis for next five years , expert says
The United States is unlikely to have the best investment environment in the next five years , according to Evgeni Nadorchin , a chief economist at Trust bank .
Bigness .ru requested Nadorshin to comment on recent developments in the U.S. securities market .
U.S. economy may be in crisis for next five years , expert says
The last week brought sad news for the White House .
To begin with , Japanese companies agreed to make payments in yens for Iran ’s crude imports last Tuesday .
The Japanese had previously paid for Iranian oil in the U.S. dollar .
In fact , Iran had earlier signed an agreement on the yen payments for its crude exports with a number of small - sized Japanese refineries .
Two leading Japanese oil exporters of Iranian crude joined the agreement last Tuesday .
Japan is one of the world ’s major oil exporters .
The country has sent a clear message to the global oil market by switching to the yen in its payments for Iran ’s oil .
“ The dollar is n’t a convenient currency for Iran ’s oil receipts for political reasons .
The dollar payments for oil are made via correspondent accounts at U.S. banks , ” Nadorshin said , in an interview to Bigness.ru .
“ Keeping in mind that Iran is listed by the U.S. government among the countries of the “ axis of evil , ” the U.S. government is not only aware of those accounts , it can control them .
The U.S. government even blocked certain accounts in the past , ” Nadorshin added .
From the technical point of view , it would be more difficult for the United States to block such accounts in a Japanese bank .
A mere 15 percent of Iran ’s oil income is now being paid in the dollar .
The biggest part of Iran ’s income ( 65 percent ) from crude exports is in euros .
The yen payments account for 15 percent of Iran ’s oil income .
Another of the last week ’s unpleasant surprise for the dollar economy was of Asian origin .
According to data released by the U.S. Treasury last Tuesday , the region ’s major economies , namely , Japan , China and Taiwan unloaded some of U.S. Treasury bonds from their foreign reserves .
The amount of U.S. Treasury bonds shed by the three countries totals $ 52 billions .
Compared with the countries ’ aggregate amount of foreign reserves , which are worth trillions of dollars , the above sum is fairly small .
However , the fact is of importance : Japan , China and Taiwan cut their investments in U.S. Treasure bonds to a record low in the last five years .
The United States have expressed concern about the move since the above three economies plus Hong Kong and South Korea account for 51 percent ( $ 1.14 trillion ) of the total amount of foreign investments in U.S. Treasury bonds .
Tougher times could be in store for the U.S. Treasury following all those developments if the government fails to curb inflation , according to Mark Ostwald , an analyst at Insigner de Beaufort .
“ The Asian banks did n’t plan shedding their dollar reserves completely , ” Nadorshin said in his interview to Bigness.ru .
He stressed the point that $ 52 billion is a drop in the water for the countries “ whose combined foreign reserves exceed two trillion U.S. dollars . ”
The move falls into the trend of the last several years i.e. the dollar proportion of foreign reserves is on the decrease .
Nadorshin reminded that U.S. Treasury bonds were traditionally considered gilt - edged securities .
However , now investors are concerned about the fact that they bought assets in a currency that is growing increasingly weaker .
Besides , the U.S. economy may be heading for a recession .
The unloading of dollar assets was inevitable .
On the contrary , the last several weeks have seen an inflow of $ 11 billion to investment funds that put money in the developing markets e.g. Russia .
Speaking of the negative impact on the U.S. economy in the wake of the events that occurred last week , Nadorshin argued that they might indicate a long - term economic crisis the global superpower is currently going through .
“ The U.S. economy has been showing its weakness throughout the year .
It ’s a weakness that prevents the economy from keeping the dollar strong against other currencies as the main unit of account .
The economy has to tackle a number of issues including deficits and structural issues .
The economic measures proved to be ineffective in resolving any of those issues .
The country recently experienced a suprime mortgage crisis that will probably help them resolve the issues , which they tried to resolve by increasing interest rates , ” Nadorshin said in his interview to Bigness.ru

Hamid 's debut , Moth Smoke , was published in 2000
The attacks occurred while he was writing his second book , newly - published The Reluctant Fundamentalist , a psychological thriller about a young Pakistani man , Changez , who meets an American stranger in Lahore .
Hamid had begun writing the book long before the attacks on New York and Washington .
But he said that when they happened , they changed what happens in the story " quite dramatically . "
" I tried to write a couple of drafts after 2001 that were set before 2001 , just so the events would n't overpower the story - and it seemed increasingly problematic to do that , because one knows what happens afterwards , " Hamid told BBC World Service 's The Word programme .
" To have this novel set immediately before seemed strange .
" After a while , I began to try to try to incorporate the events and set it around that time - the events suited the narrative - but it 's very difficult to get enough distance from something like that . "
Eventually , he found that in a way , the 11 September attacks fitted the story because they were part of " the same manifestation of disconnect and difference that I was writing about before they happened " .
' Disconnect and difference '
The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a short novel , presented as a monologue from Changez 's point of view .
Changez tells the American the story of his life : how he went to Princeton university in the US ; how he rose to a high position at a consultancy firm ; and how he abandoned it all after the attacks of 11 September 2001 .
A pivotal scene has Changez smiling at the collapse of the Twin Towers
" Because it 's a dramatic monologue , and it 's set between two people almost as if it 's happening on stage , there 's a certain sense that it can't possibly be happening this way .
" There 's a sense of space that it opens up to a writer , a slightly playful or theatrical space that you can operate in , and for me that was important because I wanted to create a particular atmosphere - one of mutual suspicion .
" I wanted that to very much mirror the mutual suspicion that I think America and Pakistani , or America and Muslim , society views each other . "
The character of Changez was originally written to have a very American voice , but Hamid found this felt " too familiar " .
Instead , he wanted to use the voice to be unfamiliar - and so wrote Changez with a voice from Pakistan 's educational system , which has its origins in old British schools .
" It 's both courtly and menacing at the same time , " Hamid said .
" In the West , it touches on a strangely ancient culture that does n't occupy the same historical time that we do - that we are in conflict with . "
Fundamental focus
The Reluctant Fundamentalist contains a number of ironies - amongst them that the fundamentalism of the title is not to do with Islam , but comes from the company in which Changez works , which urges its staff to " focus on the fundamentals " .
But Hamid , who himself worked as a management consultant for many years in New York and London , stressed that he was not attempting to single out America for criticism in the book , but rather a particular creed of corporate thinking .
" There is a corporate or a financial fundamentalism , which is broader than just America - it is a global thing , " he said .
" It is a reduction of people to units of value , which happens all over the world , and increasingly often .
" In its own form , unchecked , it 's exactly the same as any other form of absolutist system .
I was setting up that kind of a parallel .
" I think those economic forces , and people who adhere entirely to them , generate the same kind of fear and hostility that people who adhere to fundamental religious forces do . "
Not since the infamous PS3 crime wave of late 2006 have we seen anything like this .
According to a notice posted on the heavily trafficked AVS Forum , the HD DVD and Blu-ray sections are being closed to new posts " for a short time , " and the reasoning behind such a severe action may shock you .
Apparently , a number of hot - headed posters have not only been dissin ' supporters of ( insert rival format here ) , but some have lashed out at other members with " physical threats that have involved police and possible legal action . "
While it 's not exactly clear what pushed these extremists to the edge , there 's no denying that the recent price drops on standalone HD DVD players have given the HD community as a whole a lot more to yap about , and we guess some folks just did n't know where to draw the line .
The format war just took on a whole new meaning , and it 's not one to be proud of .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 22  A pair of new reports have delivered scorching judgments about the State Department ’s performance in overseeing work done by the private companies that the government relies on increasingly in Iraq and Afghanistan to carry out delicate security work and other missions .
A State Department review of its own security practices in Iraq assails the department for poor coordination , communication , oversight and accountability involving armed security companies like Blackwater USA , according to people who have been briefed on the report .
In addition to Blackwater , the State Department ’s two other security contractors in Iraq are DynCorp International and Triple Canopy .
At the same time , a government audit expected to be released Tuesday says that records documenting the work of DynCorp International , the State Department ’s largest contractor , are in such disarray that the department cannot say “ specifically what it received ” for most of the $ 1.2 billion it has paid the company since 2004 to train the police in Iraq .
The review of security practices was ordered last month by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , and it did not address the Sept. 16 shooting involving Blackwater guards , which Iraqi investigators said killed 17 Iraqis .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is leading a separate inquiry into that episode .
Hiding Data Behind Attorney - Client Privilege
Interesting advice :
He cites a key advantage to bringing in lawyers up front : “ If you hire a law firm to supervise the process , even if there are technical engineers involved , then the process will be covered by attorney - client privilege , ” Cunningham said .
He noted that in a lawsuit following a data theft , plaintiffs usually seek a company ’s records of “ all the [ data - security ] recommendations that were made [ before the breach ] and whether or not you followed them .
And if you go and hire technical consultants only , all that information gets turned over in discovery .
[ But ] if you have it through a law firm , it ’s generally not . ”
Gregory Engel has some good comments about this :
This is n’t a “ prevention initiative ” for data security , it ’s a preemptive initiative for corporate irresponsibility .
I ’m not sure it will work , though .
I do n’t think you can run all of your data past your attorney and then magically have it imbued with the un-subpoena - able power of “ attorney - client privilege . ”

“ LION King ” audiences at the Minskoff have been sniffing the sweet scent of marijuana .
It turns out the pot -head fans of former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh , who ’s doing a nine - day stint at the Nokia Theater next door , were lighting up .
“ The smoke was so thick it was seeping through the wall and into the Disney audience , and they started complaining , ” a spy at Monday ’s show told The Post ’s Bruce Golding .
“ The ushers are now very vigilant and making sure nobody lights up . ” A Nokia rep admitted there were complaints .
The Minskoff had no comment .
" We just can't have a president named Huckabee .
You just can't , " my brightest student proclaimed last week .
" What are those people thinking , " she said , giggling .
They are n't , I started to tell her , and then I remembered another moment , and another girl , in a graduate class more than 30 years ago .
" The American people are not going to elect a peanut farmer named Jimmy who sounds like he should be on Hee - Haw , " that one had said .
They did elect the peanut farmer , as you may remember .
And now , out of the blue and the endless dreary " debates , " a guy nobody ever heard of six months ago named Huckabee has suddenly surged to the top of the GOP pack .
Who is Mike Huckabee ?
He is a 52 - year - old Christian fundamentalist Southern Baptist preacher who ... plays bass guitar in a rock ' n ' roll band and idolizes Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones .
( He said one of the highlights of being governor of Arkansas was pardoning Richards for a 30 - year - old reckless driving conviction . )
He grew up in — no , I did n't make this up — Hope , the same tiny Arkansas town Bill Clinton came from .
Like Bill Clinton , he was poor .
Unlike Clinton , he was no Rhodes scholar , going instead to Ouachita Baptist University , getting married at 18 .
He does not seem to have had an eye for other women , though he certainly did for food .
( His son once said he could n't walk into Taco Bell without spending more than $ 7 .
But when the doctors told him he had diabetes four years ago , he lost 110 pounds , lickety - split . )
Later , he lived for a while in a trailer ( he called it a " triple - wide " ) on the grounds of the Arkansas governor 's mansion , while it was being renovated .
( This is , by the way , why journalists mostly do n't think about writing novels .
Real life is far , far stranger .
Hard as you try , you just can't make this stuff up . )
Like most human beings , Michael Dale Huckabee is a bundle of contradictions , which seems to add to his appeal .
When it comes to science , he is about as backward as William Jennings Bryan was during the Scopes trial .
He does n't believe in evolution , and thinks the earth may be only 6,000 years old .
He opposes all abortion , and has angrily denied that man is a primate .
But he also clearly and sincerely cares about the poor .
He raised taxes in Arkansas , again and again , to try and do something for the least advantaged .
He raised taxes to build new roads and to try to provide some better services .
Huckabee fought to put all of Arkansas ' share of the tobacco settlement money into the state 's health care system .
( Compare that to the worthless scuts in the Michigan Legislature , who sold our share off in May at less than 50 cents on the dollar to avoid having to balance the budget . )
Huckabee even seems to think we need some form of national health care and can be very eloquent at denouncing those right - to - lifers who are n't interested in doing anything to help the babies they force to be born .
In other words , he really is an old - fashioned Southern populist , one who has been successful at persuading people he cares about their problems ... because he actually does .
Interestingly , he seems to be doing far better at this than John Edwards , who was just as poor as a child , but went on to become a millionaire lawyer , now seen as a man who gets $ 400 haircuts .
Does that mean Mike Huckabee will be the next president ?
Not at all .
I am not even convinced he is going to be the Republican nominee for a number of reasons .
He still does not have the kind of money Mitt Romney has .
Corporate interests are scared to death that he really does want to do something for the poor and disadvantaged .
They 'll spend a lot to stop him .
Also , flash - in - the pan , come - from - nowhere candidates like Huckabee can sometimes do well in places like Iowa and New Hampshire , but seldom have the money — or the slates of delegates — needed to compete in all the many early primary states .
Remember , this whole thing may well be decided on Feb. 5 , when 20 or so states all vote in what 's being called " Super - Duper Tuesday . "
Plus , the press is still in their early , first - crush over Mike Huckabee stage .
What will follow quickly is some more intense scrutiny .
Reporters in Arkansas say the Huckabee family was notorious for chasing down every loose buck they could , often in blissful disregard of any ethical niceties .
( When he and his wife Janet renewed their wedding vows , they set up " Bridal registries " at stores like Target so people could shower them with presents .
They also apparently encouraged " gift cards " to be given as well . )
He seems to have somewhat of a thin skin , and is , Matt Taibbi of Rolling Stone reports , a real religious nut .
But after spending some time with him , Taibbi concluded , " the fact that he is succeeding in spite of his obvious and undisguised lunacy is a testament to the desperation of the voting public , which is so hungry for a candidate who actually responds to its needs , that it may be willing to overlook " that he is a whack job .
In other words , Huckabee seems to be a member of that endangered species in politics : a real person .
If you want to know why he may well have a chance , take a look at the candidate who should logically be the Republican nominee , former Massachusetts Governor — and Detroit native — Mitt Romney .
He is far more handsome than Huckabee .
He speaks very well , is enormously intelligent , has a picture - perfect family . . . and comes across as an utter robot .
I interviewed him in April , and have seldom spoken to a more calculating machine .
The one sincere note that comes across when you talk to Romney is that he really does think he is better than anyone else , period .
Just take a look at the interview he gave The Detroit News ' Gordon Trowbridge , published online Sunday .
Romney was asked about the fact that Huckabee has soared ahead of him in Iowa .
That 's not to be taken seriously , the bionic man said .
" With the challenges we face , you need somebody who is smart , analytical , " he said .
" I 'm able to take tough issues and analyze them .
I like debate , argument , consideration of options .
You need to have a deliberative , thoughtful approach . "
Romney 's supporters have been worried that the public wo n't accept a Mormon .
Their real problem may be , to put it in Star Trek terms , that he is a Vulcan , incapable of human emotion .
This is a guy , after all , who put his Irish Setter Seamus in a cage on top of the family car for a 12 - hour drive from Boston to Ontario , and then was amazed to discover the terrified dog 's excrement flowing down the windows .
His reaction to what was clearly animal torture ?
He hosed off the car .
Yes , Romney is proudly into emotion - free crisis management .
Yet this is an emotion - laden world , in which not everybody can make $ 250 million as a venture capitalist .
Frankly , if I were Hillary Clinton , I would be much more worried about running against Mike Huckabee .
The venture capitalists of America do n't get that , but a lot of other people do , which is why this could be an even more interesting race than we imagined .

About author Jack Lessenberry opines weekly for Detroit 's Metro Times .
I have maintained in a number of articles over the past several years that no Christian — whether he terms himself a conservative , an evangelical , a fundamentalist , or a Bible - believer — has any business in the U.S. military , including the National Guard and the chaplaincy .
Although the same goes for anyone else who names the name of Christ , I have always emphasized these particular Christian groups because of the unholy relationship that exists between them and the military .
But what about American Jews , Muslims , Buddhists , and Hindus ?
Would it be okay if they joined the military ?
And what about the members of the various cults and sects that abound in the United States ?
Is the military a good place for them ?
And let ’s not forget about atheists , agnostics , infidels , witches , Satanists , and the irreligious .
Should they be discouraged from joining the military as well ?
Should anyone join the military ?
Here are seven reasons why I think that no one , regardless of his religion or lack of it , should join today ’s military .
1 . Joining the military may cost you your limbs , your mind , or even your life .
There is no end in sight to the Iraq war .
Over 3,800 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Iraq .
Many thousands more have been wounded .
Hundreds of these have had limbs amputated .
An increasing number of soldiers are committing suicide .
Untold numbers suffer from post - traumatic stress disorder .
Some soldiers will spend the rest of their lives unable to work or drive a car .
Others will live out their days as physical and / or emotional basket cases .
What makes you think that you or one of your loved ones will not be sent to Iraq or will emerge unscathed in body and mind ?
Do n’t trust the recruiter who tells you that you wo n’t be sent to Iraq .
They are getting so desperate for cannon fodder that they are blatantly lying to potential recruits .
2 . Joining the military may have an adverse effect on your family .
The breakup of marriages and relationships because of soldiers being deployed to Iraq and elsewhere is epidemic .
Multiple duty tours and increased deployment terms are the death knell for stable families .
It is devastating to a young child to be deprived of his father for months at a time .
It is a national disgrace that we send single mothers in the National Guard off to war who must then leave their small children in the care of friends or relatives .
Yes , I know they joined the military of their own free will , but it still should n’t be done .
What makes you think that the military will never send you away from your family for an extended period of time ?
You know that the possibility exists , so why gamble with your family ?
And then , as if being away from your family was n’t bad enough on you and them , some soldiers come home with such physical and / or mental problems that they are unable to return to civilian life .
Debt , doctors , and divorce lawyers soon consume their finances .
It is U.S. military families that are the unseen victims of the war in Iraq .
3 . Joining the military does not mean that you will be defending the country .
The purpose of the U.S. military should be to defend the United States .
Period .
Yet , one of the greatest myths ever invented is that the current U.S. military somehow defends our freedoms .
First of all , our freedoms are not in danger of being taken away by foreign countries ; if they are taken away it will be by our own government .
It is not a country making war on us that we need to fear , it is our government making war on the Bill of Rights .
And second , how is stationing troops in 150 different regions of the world on hundreds of U.S. military bases defending our freedoms ?
It is not the purpose of the U.S. military to change regimes , secure the borders of other countries , or spread democracy at gunpoint .
The Department of Defense should first and foremost be the Department of Homeland Security .
4 . Joining the military means that you will be helping to carry out an evil , reckless , and interventionist U.S. foreign policy .
For many , many years now , U.S. foreign policy has resulted in the destabilization and overthrow of governments , the assassination of leaders , the destruction of industry and infrastructure , the backing of military coups , death squads , and drug traffickers , imperialism under the guise of humanitarianism , support for corrupt and tyrannical governments , interference in the elections of other countries , taking sides or intervening in civil wars , engaging in provocative naval actions under the guise of protecting freedom of navigation , thousands of dubious covert actions , the dismissal of civilian casualties as collateral damage , the United States being the arms dealer to the world , and the United States bribing and bullying itself around the world as the world ’s policeman , fireman , social worker , and busybody .
5 . Joining the military means that you will be expected to unconditionally follow orders .
There will be no questioning of the purpose or morality of an order .
You will often times not be in a position to know whether an order is in fact dubious or immoral .
You will be expected to , without reservation , drop that bomb , fire that weapon , launch that missile , and throw that grenade , as well as kill people and destroy their property .
Do you question whether that prisoner should be transported to some secret CIA prison to undergo “ enhanced interrogation techniques ” ?
Too bad .
Do you question whether the United States should have troops in 150 different places around the globe ?
Sorry .
Do you question whether the United States should launch a preemptive strike ?
Banish the thought .
Do you question whether the United States should effect a regime change ?
Keep your mouth shut .
But would n’t military effectiveness unravel if the troops did n’t obey orders ?
Let ’s hope so .
Every act of American military intervention was made possible because the troops blindly followed the orders of their superiors .
If they had refused to do anything that was not related to actually defending the country , then there would not have been any overseas deployments , land mines buried , bombs dropped , preemptive strikes , or missiles launched .
The result of this would have been not only less anti-American sentiment , but fewer terrorists , fewer dead foreign civilians , and fewer dead American soldiers .
6 . Joining the military means that you will be pressured to make a god out of the military .
Am I exaggerating ?
Here is a note I recently received from a veteran : Mr. Vance , I , perhaps , have some insights why soldiers or Christian soldiers do not refuse to fight .
I enlisted in the Marines when I was 17 .
I went to boot camp 2 months after graduating from a Jesuit high school in 88 .
I served until 94 .
In that time I graduated from boot camp as Series Honorman , was meritoriously promoted twice , was platoon high shooter a few times , and volunteered for as much advance and rear party ( so I could stay in the field ) duties I could .
At the time , I was not a Christian and worshipped the USMC .
Boot camp was an interesting experience .
They instill ones duty to first the Marines ( before I went to combat , I made sure I had a good picture of me standing proudly in front of the Marine Colors ) then your comrades .
At the end of boot camp we would have done anything for the drill instructors and our comrades .
There was a saying , ours is not to reason why , but to do and die .
There are few people that have the where - with - all to go against this .
Plus , the intellectual foundation required for resistance ( which , even though I went to a Jesuit prep school , I did n’t have ) is constantly attacked .
The honor of our former Marines and duty to current Marines must be upheld .
The attitude , when in these situations , is that you must make “ them ” objects .
Otherwise you might hesitate and it could get yourself or your comrades killed .
This attitude pretty much trumps everything else .
Luckily , I got out , found Antiwar.com and then LewRockwell.com .
Best Regards .
SM
Idolatry is certainly something that any non-religious person should be averse to .
7 . Joining the military means that you may be put into a position where you will have to kill or be killed .
What guarantee do you have that you will always be in a non -combat role ?
You are responsible for the “ enemy ” soldiers you kill as they defend their homeland against U.S. aggression .
It may soothe your conscience if you attempt to justify your actions by maintaining it is self - defense , but it is hardly self - defense when you travel thousands of miles away to engage in an unnecessary and unjust war .
You are responsible for the civilians you kill .
Dismissing them as collateral damage does n’t change the fact that you killed someone who was no threat to you or your country .
You are responsible for every soldier and civilian you kill : not Bush , not Cheney , not Rumsfeld , not Gates , not your commanding officers , and not Wolfowitz , Feith , Hadley , Perle , Abrams , Tenet , Powell , Rice , and the other architects of the Iraq War .
Bush and company will not be firing a single shot .
You will be expected to do their dirty work and live with it the rest of your life .
“ Thou shalt not kill ” is not just a tenet of the Judeo - Christian tradition ; it is part of the moral code of every civilization , pagan or religious .
Should anyone join the military ?
Certainly not today ’s military .
And until a major change in U.S. foreign policy occurs , not tomorrow ’s military either .
So be all you can be : Just do n’t be it in the U.S. military .
The Best of Laurence M. Vance
I caught an article today that really made my brows pop up .
Apparently President Bush is , for the first time , willing to at least consider withdrawing some troops from Iraq .
Now that ’s huge since until now Bush has put “ withdrawal from Iraq ” just below “ shoot self in scrotum with nailgun ” on his list of things he does n’t want to do .
[ Bush ] raised the possibility during a surprise visit to a desert air base in Iraq ’s Anbar province on Monday , saying there were signs of improved security and that some U.S. troops could be withdrawn from the country if the trend continued .
Even though he couched his words carefully and made no promises , it was the kind of concession rarely heard from Bush , who has made single - mindedness a defining trait of his presidency and of his conduct of the unpopular war in Iraq .
First of all , the fact that the president is willing to talk about troop withdrawal is about as sad as it gets .
A rational and responsible leader should be loathe to go into war and optimistic about leaving , but instead we have the reverse .
But still , I suppose it ’s a step forward and that ’s better than sitting back .
Anbar , huh ?
All right , let ’s take a look at that …
So Bush is using some kind of “ success ” in the Anbar province as evidence that his strategy is working and thanks to his bold vision we may finally be able to start scaling down troop levels .
Awesome .
But hold on now , ThinkProgress dug up a few things that directly contradict that assertion , including this snippet from an Associated Press report .
In truth , the progress in Anbar was initiated by the Iraqis themselves , a point Gates himself made , saying the Sunni tribes decided to fight and retake control from al - Qaida many months before Bush decided to send an extra 4,000 Marines to Anbar as part of his troop buildup .
So sending extra troops had nothing to do with the stability in Anbar .
A little ironic because on one hand the Iraqi military seems to be doing jack squat , but meanwhile the militants are starting to buckle down and get some work done .
Of course , that was evident early on when there ’d be these big fights between militants and American forces that did n’t involve the Iraqi military for some reason , but I digress .
Our military “ surge ” is n’t the reason for this improvement , which is strange because according to Bush if we were to leave then the nation would get overtaken by “ al Qaeda types ” and the entire country would collapse into a giant lake of fire .
Yet here we have a group of Sunnis who took it upon their own initiative to start driving out the unwanted “ types ” .
We ’re not done though .
Apparently while all this was going on , a whole bunch of Sunni and Shia leaders met in Northern Ireland for some secret peace talks , which pointedly did not involve the United States .
Emphasis added .
The faction leaders have agreed to consult further on a series of recommendations , labelled the Helsinki agreement .
The 12 points contain clear echoes of Senator George Mitchell ’s principles on non-violence and democracy which paved the way towards the Good Friday Agreement .
Aside from promising to resolve political differences peacefully , the agreement commits the Iraqi parties to consider the creation of a disarmament commission , and the formation of a group to deal with the legacy of Iraq ’s past .
They also seek an end to international and regional interference in Iraq ’s affairs .
Ever had that friend who wants to help , probably sincerely , but has no idea what in the world he ’s doing ?
Then the only way to make him leave is to quickly fix it on your own ?
That ’s where Iraq is with us .
The tribes are fighting off the terrorists and the leaders are meeting without us in secret .
While it ’s true that the United States military has helped protect the Iraqis against many attacks , what we ’re seeing here is that they ’re trying to resolve things without involving us .
Not because they want to finally stand on their own two feet and are doing so while we hold their hand , but because they simply do n’t want us there any more .
Actually , hey , this is a great thing for two reasons .
For one thing , it means Iraq may stabilize finally and our troops can come hom .
For another thing , I can still keep bleating about how Bush ’s policies were completely idiotic .
I get to have my cake and eat it , too .
Keith the model was created for a Fine Art degree course
A Gwent Police officer told Flick Sawkins and Angela Harker of Starling Vendetta Boutique they could be prosecuted unless the body was clothed .
A strategically - placed fig leaf now hides the modesty of the window artwork in the Newport shop .
An online petition has been launched against the cover-up .
Kate Montgomery , 21 , who created the artwork , said she was surprised at how much interest it had generated .
Recently graduated from a Fine Art degree course at Newport University , the main character of the shop window display - called Keith - had been created for her course .
" To be honest , I can't get my head around how people are being about it , it 's really surreal and ridiculous
Artist Kate Montgomery
When her friends relaunched their shop last month , she agreed to put some of her art in the window , but said she had not expected the reaction she got .
" Some of the old ladies walk past and they do look a bit horrified but most people see it and laugh , " she said .
" I think some people are worried children might see it , but when you see parents walking with their children , they stop and have a look and then they laugh . "
Wardens working for Newport City Council were initially approached by shoppers about the naked figure before the complaint was passed to police .
The shop was then told it faced prosecution under section 5 of the Public Order Act for causing " alarm or distress " unless the art work was censored .
But an online petition has been launched by supporters of the art work to allow it to be shown properly .
' Alarm and distress '
" We 've had a lot of support , " said Ms Montgomery .
She promised that once the fuss about Keith had died down , a replacement figure would be put in the window instead called Barbara - and she will also be completely naked .
The owners of the boutique , which only opened last month , said on their website : " According to the officers visiting us , under a " Section 4 , or is it 5 ? " , the art work causes " alarm and distress " and as such must be covered or removed to avoid a hefty fine .
" How many other things can you think of which cause alarm and distress while walking round Newport city centre ? "
A spokeswoman for Gwent Police said a local Police Community Support Officer advised the shop owners they cover up the model because it was causing " alarm and distress to passers - by . "
" It was n't a warning and they have since covered it up and we have n't had any further complaints , " she said .
" It is a potential offence under section 5 of the Public Order Act if it causes harassment alarm or distress .
" If we get any complaints or the council get any complaints we will act on it but since then it has n't been flagged up as an issue . "
The LAPD ’s plan to map Muslim communities in an effort to identify potential hotbeds of extremism departs from the way law enforcement has dealt with local anti-terrorism since 9/11 and prompted widespread skepticism Friday .
In a document reviewed Friday by The Times , the LAPD ’s Los Angeles Police Department ’s counter - terrorism bureau proposed using U.S. census data and other demographic information to pinpoint various Muslim communities and then reach out to them through social service agencies .
FOR THE RECORD :
Muslim mapping :
In Saturday ’s Section A , a photograph caption with a story about a Los Angeles Police Department program to map Muslim communities said , “ Mohammed Abdul Aleem , center , with Faisal Ansari , left , and Siraz Bawa says ideas like the LAPD program push moderate Muslims toward extremism . ”
The caption should have made clear that the statement about pushing moderate Muslims toward extremism was Aleem ’s alone . —
LAPD officials said that it is crucial for them to gain a better understanding of isolated parts of the Muslim community .
Those groups can potentially breed violent extremism , the LAPD said in its plan .
“ This is not . . . targeting or profiling , ” Police Chief William J. Bratton said Friday in defending the program .
“ It is an effort to understand communities , ” he said .
But the effort sparked an outcry from civil libertarians and some Muslim activists , who compared the program to religious profiling .
Others noted that the effort faces enormous practical difficulties .
The U.S. Census Bureau is barred by law from asking people for their religious affiliation .
As a result , there is no scientific data on the size of the nation ’s Muslim population , let alone its location , with estimates of the population nationwide ranging from about 1.4 million adults in a Pew Research Center study this year to the 7 million or more claimed by some community organizations .
Census data on ancestry also would not yield accurate Muslim estimates , because significant numbers of ethnic Iranians are Jewish and many ethnic Lebanese , Palestinians and Syrians are Christians .
“ It ’s not realistic to think you are going to be able to find out where all the Muslims are , ” said Salam Al - Marayati , executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council .
Hussam Ayloush of the Council on American - Islamic Relations in Anaheim said the LAPD project seemed based on the European experience of isolated and often - distressed Muslim enclaves -- a model that does n’t apply to the United States , where the Muslim population is far more dispersed .
American Muslims differ from their European co-religionists in several other respects .
A Pew survey of 1,050 adult American Muslims nationwide found them to be “ largely assimilated , happy with their lives and moderate . ”
Although two - thirds are immigrants , most respondents said Muslims should integrate into U.S. society rather than isolate themselves .
The survey found striking differences between American Muslims and their European counterparts , with more in the U.S. rejecting extremism and supporting coexistence with Israel .
Only 2 % of American Muslims were low - income , compared with rates of 18 % and higher in the United Kingdom , France , Germany and Spain .
The LAPD ’s proposal differs substantially from the way federal counter - terrorism authorities have dealt with Southern California ’s Muslim community .
Stung by decades of controversy over its monitoring of antiwar and civil rights groups , the FBI has been wary of post - 9/11 initiatives that would draw criticism that its anti-terrorism efforts are based on racial profiling of Muslims .
As a result , its counter - terrorism efforts have been largely driven by informants , intelligence reports or specific incidents that direct attention to a particular group or community .
“ We learned our lesson early on , ” one retired FBI counter - terrorism official said Friday .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , questioned the logic of the mapping program , reasoning that the wholesale plotting of Muslim communities -- rather than zeroing in on suspected extremists -- could drain counter - terrorism resources and alienate Muslim residents at a time when they are crucial to law enforcement efforts .
Al - Marayati and others who gathered for Friday prayer at the Islamic Center of Southern California questioned the premise of the mapping project .
There were no clearly defined Muslim neighborhoods in Southern California , he said .
Some neighborhoods are known for large Middle Eastern populations , but often their residents are not Muslim .
Beverly Hills , for example , has a sizable and well - known Iranian population , but many of them are Persian Jews .
Mosque member Omar Ricci , offspring of a Pakistani Muslim mother and Italian American Catholic father , said he has more Armenian Christian neighbors than Muslims on his street in Glendale .
Maher Hathout , an Egyptian native and retired physician , who is a spokesman for the Islamic Center , said his neighborhood in Arcadia is an ethnic and religious polyglot ; he said he was more familiar with his Christian next - door neighbor than the Muslims who live a few doors away .
The mosque is on Vermont Avenue in Koreatown .
The backlash against the program was intense enough Friday that LAPD ’s planned partner in the project , USC ’s National Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events , said it was carefully studying whether to join the endeavor .
“ I realize that there are many concerns with a potential mapping project related to profiling , privacy and civil liberties , ” center Director Detlof von Winterfeldt said in a statement .
But LAPD leaders stood behind the proposal .
Hoping to defuse the controversy , Bratton said Friday that the LAPD ’s plan is in its early stages and extended an invitation to meet with critics to hear their suggestions on how to advance what he described as a “ community engagement effort . ”
In outlining the program last week before a congressional committee , Deputy Police Chief Michael P. Downing , who heads the counter - terrorism operation , said the department ’s plan was designed to minimize the radicalization of Muslims in Los Angeles .
Instead of relying on experts , he said , the mapping would produce a “ richer picture ” of the community and guide future strategies .
“ While this project will lay out geographic locations of many different Muslim populations around Los Angeles , we also intend to take a deeper look at their history , demographics , language , culture , ethnic breakdown , socioeconomic status and social interactions , ” he said .
“ It is also our hope to identify communities , within the larger Muslim community which may be susceptible to violent ideologically based extremism and then use a full spectrum approach guided by intelligence - led strategy . ”
On Friday , Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa defended the LAPD ’s efforts .
“ Chief Downing has good intentions here , ” said Villaraigosa , who added that he had only learned of the new program through newspaper articles and at a short briefing .
But some Muslims fear that the police intervention in their communities could have the opposite effect from what officials intended .
“ Anytime the administration talks about attacking Iran , anytime they start to float ideas like these , we are pushed more toward extremism , ” Mohammed Abdul Aleem , 49 , of Culver City said .
“ Every time our president opens his mouth , there are more people joining Al Qaeda . ”
To Aleem , the LAPD ’s plan to map out the city ’s Muslim community will do nothing more than “ fuel the fire . ”
“ It ’s making it harder and harder for the moderate Muslims , ” he said .
Times staff writer Jean - Paul Renaud contributed to this report .
You hear the horror stories , but you never think that it 'll be you .
You always assume that all that noise comes from a small and unlucky fraction of customers .
Being stuck in the cable installation wringer of woe myself , however , I can confirm , once and for all , that Comcast loves to live up to its reputation .
No -one in their right mind should go anywhere near this wretched and disorganized cack - house [ British for " shithouse " ... it mystified us , too .
– Eds. ] of a company .
The point is , however , that we often have little choice but to do so , thanks to the uneven tapestry of internet , phone and TV services laid like a soiled , moth - eaten rag over the United States .
So here I am , in a house already wired for cable , wondering when the On Switch will finally be flipped .
I 'll keep the story short : I moved home , but before doing so , arranged for Comcast to set up " Triple Play " TV , internet and phone service at my new address .
The earliest they could do so was the Thursday after the Saturday I arrived .
When thursday comes , we get a call saying the cable guy would be delayed .
When he finally appears , he heads into the yard , but comes in barely seconds later .
Apparently , he 's just got a phone call and his significant other is in labor .
So , he goes .
Cheerio !
I believe him , because he left behind a plastic case containing other customers ' checks and service orders .
I also got a phone call from his team leader , apologizing and offering to reschedule .
Sounds like a plan .
The earliest possible time , however , is almost a week later , on the following Tuesday .
Lovely .
They 'll try to come sooner .
Splendid .
What 's left to do but wait ?
Oh , and they want me to pop that box in the doorway , so someone can come and pick it up .
It 's an uneventful week , except for an interesting Comcast note left on a neighbor 's door saying " Sorry we missed you " a few days later , making it look rather as if an engineer was within spitting distance of our home with nothing to do .
When Tuesday – today – came , however , I got not a cable guy but a phone call from Comcast asking me what day I 'd like to schedule the installation .
Say what ?
I believe I got two slightly inconsistent explanations , but the haze of frustration is thick , and memory is always the first thing to go .
Either way , the upshot was that there was no date , and then the following Tuesday was the date , and then , after complaints , Thursday was the re-re - rescheduled date .
If they were trying to schedule my execution , I 'd have been delighted .
Any which way , it 's annoying , because I work at home and rely on the internet to do so .
I 'm currently borrowing the neighbors ' WiFi , and in these old Victorian homes , with their porous brick walls , it 's about as speedy and reliable as , say , a Comcast installation docket .
It takes about 5 minutes to bring up the webpage that lets me enter a post , let alone actually publish one .
Also , the better half does n't like to go without TV for long .
Everyone suffers , especially when the only thing rabbit ears can pick up is NBC .
I know that mere delays are but a molehill amid the Himalayan towers of Comcast 's complaint sheets , but look at it this way : if I were a commuter , I 'd have lost three days of work ( so far ) hanging around waiting for the cable guy .
I 've been given the weirdest explanation ever for calling off an installation , had a bunch of presumably private customer info ( and signed checks ! ) dumped on me , seen evidence that Comcast engineers have been yards from my door on cancelled service calls , and finally been screwed around on rescheduling .
The conclusion is inescapable .
I 'm waiting on a call from the local team leader ( who has been very friendly and apologetic through the whole thing ) but it 's time to ask : what are the alternatives in the Pittsburgh metro area ?
DSL peaks in my neighborhood at a feeble 1.5 Mbps , according to Verizon , which just does n't cut my mustard .
I 'll be sure to keep the world apprised of my insignificant travails .
An update is scheduled for Thursday – guaranteed .
Back in January , I posted The Complicator 's Gloves , which was an example of what happens when Complicators get a chance to design something other than software .
Recently , a reader pointed me to a fun article on the BBC about a software engineer who decided to “ solve ” the 150 - year old “ problem ” of the bicycle .
I could n’t resist sharing it with all of you …
1 : The back cog drives the back wheel chain , which unlike on a normal bike can turn either way when the back handlebar is steered .
2:Back handlebar which steers the back wheel and has a rear light .
3 : Front handlebar which steers the front wheel and has a light and rear - view mirror .
4:Pedals are at right angles to the wheels .
5 : The seat is shaped like an upside - down crescent .
6 : This frame goes over the lap of the cyclist , but can go under if preferred .
From the BBC article ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6375259.stm),
The cyclist sits sideways and operates a wheel with each hand , and pedalling makes the whole bike travel sideways .
" It 's a front - to - back balance not a left - to - right like a normal bike .
That affords you tremendous grace and motion .
It 's dance - like .
" The advantages are in the motion .
It 's never going to win you the Tour de France .
But it 's mesmerising and entertaining . "
Let 's hope we never have to work on his code .
The dangers of having way too much free time .
Wow .
I got so much traffic from stumbleupon .
My intention was not to ruin somebody 's life - I just wanted to show about 5 friends an interesting article .
Stumbleupon and Digg seemed to have given me hundreds of hits .
Lol .
April 3 , 2007  --
You may want John McCain or Hillary Clinton to run the country , but do you want politicians deciding what music you listen to ?
Though we think of them as lawmakers , not tastemakers , elected officials play a tremendously important role in popular culture .
Congress may soon respond to a recent decision imposing high fees on webcasters , businesses that broadcast music over the Internet .
Webcasters claim they will quickly go bankrupt as a result of the ruling by the Copyright Royalty Board , a federal panel that regulates Internet radio royalties .
Most Internet radio stations are independent from the major media companies that own the majority of traditional radio stations .
As a result , webcasters play a far more diverse selection of music than broadcast or even satellite radio .
For my DJ and music selection business , I have relied on Internet radio stations to expose me to new songs , bands and trends .
On Pandora , for example , you can enter the names of favorite artists and songs , and the site will generate playlists with similar types of music , make recommendations and play music that you likely have n't heard .
Pandora , KCRW.com and other sites such as lastfm.com have exposed me to literally hundreds of relatively unknown musicians .
In turn , I have helped get some of these artists ' songs into movies and played at retail and restaurant outlets .
I have performed them in front of thousands of people live throughout the world .
Without these stations , I would n't have this music to introduce to new audiences .
But sometimes it 's harder for people in Washington to understand how this process works -- and how it helps music .
The Copyright Royalty Board , which operates under the Library of Congress , dealt a potentially devastating blow by ruling that webcasters must pay both artists and record labels every time a song is streamed online .
Basically , if a station has 1,000 listeners for a song , it has to pay this royalty 1,000 times for that single song .
Imagine paying for 400 songs a day or 146,000 songs a year times the hundreds of thousands to millions of people that tune into your channel .

These rates may far exceed the revenue at many Internet radio companies .
Until this decision , these smaller companies simply paid a percentage of their income for their royalties .
This generous rule was supposed to foster growth in the infant industry of webcasting .
In response to the ruling , these small independent webcasters have banded together to petition Congress for new laws -- and to plead listeners to give donations .
They have formed a coalition Web site to aid them at SaveTheStreams.org .
And they have persuaded the royalty board to reconsider its ruling , at least to buy some time .
Meanwhile , traditional or " terrestrial " radio stations operate under a more lenient system .
They pay a fee to the composer each time a song is played -- not each time someone listens to the song .
There is an understanding in the industry that the record labels should not receive royalties because radio play is essentially publicity for their artists .
No such understanding was present in the 1990s when Congress wrote the laws for Internet music distribution .
Under the two laws , the Digital Sound Recordings Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , the record label becomes entitled to payment for every play online .
So webcasters pay both the composer and the label , while label fees alone will put them in the red .
A key part of my job is to identify which artists will matter months and years down the road , but with this decision we can see how our representatives in Washington can shape culture for decades .
Without laws made by Congress guaranteeing that music had copyright protection , the record industry would n't have even existed .
The record labels have , in return , spent considerable sums of time and money to create their powerful lobby in Congress .
Even though many listeners would testify that Internet radio had encouraged them to buy more , not less , music , the labels have not fought hard for Web radio because they face their own crisis .
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that CD sales were in steep decline , and that profits at labels had tumbled as much as 74 percent in the case of Warner Bros. , for example .
Understandably , the labels want to milk as much from their copyrights as possible .

Some lawmakers , such as Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts , have already come out against the high royalties .
Can he get more senators and presidential candidates to go along with him ?

The findings - which last night drew a fierce response from the Church of England - will reignite the debate about the role of religion in the education system and come as the government attempts to reassure critics that faith schools do not favour the selection of middle - class , white pupils .
Rebecca Allen , of the Institute of Education , University of London , and Professor Anne West , Professor of Education Policy at the London School of Economics , studied the intake of faith schools across the capital using an extensive ' pupil - level ' database compiled by the Department for Children , Schools and Families .
Although the majority of faith schools were established to educate the poor , the two academics said it appeared many had moved away from their original remit .
While observing there are exceptions , the researchers found religious secondary schools in London educate a smaller proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals than non-religious schools and that their intakes are ' significantly more affluent ' than the neighbourhoods in which they are located .
Their research showed 17 per cent of pupils at faith schools are eligible for free school meals compared with 25 per cent at non-religious schools .
Faith schools educate just under 20 per cent of lowest - ability pupils compared with 31 per cent of non-religious schools .
Faith schools also educate a greater proportion of the pupils who score highest before arriving in secondary education .
' This research poses important questions for policymakers , ' West said .
' My concern is that the [ current system ] is giving schools an incentive to select pupils who are easier to teach . '
Although faith schools tend to be located in less affluent inner-city areas , the research found pupils from ethnic minorities that are over - represented in such locations are largely absent .
Just one per cent of Pakistani and Bangladeshi pupils are educated in faith schools , the researchers claim .
The claims are likely to be seized upon by critics of faith schools .
Last year research revealed many headteachers were deeply concerned about the effect of the schools on the education system .
In one poll almost half felt there should be fewer or no faith schools .
' This research shows once and for all that so - called faith schools are simply private schools on the rates for those who know how to play the system , ' said Terry Sanderson , the president of the National Secular Society .
Yesterday , ministers strongly denied the government was planning more faith schools .
' The government has no policy to increase the number , ' said Ed Balls , secretary of state for Children , Schools and Families .
' It is up to local communities to decide the kind of schools they want . '
A spokesman for the Church of England said the research did not reflect the true picture across the country as a whole .
' The LSE study focuses purely on London , which has a very different demographic to the rest of the country , ' the spokesman said .
' The Church always has , and always will be , committed to serving the communities within which our schools are located . '

Subject : Incremental , undoable parsing in OCaml as the general parser inversion
This message is to show that the incremental parsing in OCaml is a solved problem -- essentially for any parser .
Moreover , the procedure to convert from a regular parser to an incremental one is independent of the parser implementation .
The incremental parsing lets us parse from a stream that is only partially known .
The parser may report what it can and will ask for more input .
When more input is supplied , the parsing resumes .
No OS threads are required .
The solution to control inversion is to use delimited continuations -- which are designed for the purpose of giving fine control over continuations in direct - style programs .

[ And the builtin GLR parser is purely functional : ]
The solution below works especially well with functions .
That is , if the parser maintains no visible state , the parsing is not only incremental but is also undoable and restartable .
If , after ingesting the current chunk of input the parser reported a problem , we can `go back ' and supply a different .

Linear or segmented stack is an implementation detail .
The central issue is delimited continuations .
In fact , OCaml has a rare distinction of being the first system with widely available native delimited continuations ( the native implementation of `control ' was announced for Scheme48 back at ICFP02 , but it was not included in the Scheme48 distribution ) .
So , OCaml is well ahead of the pack .
The solution is illustrated below .
For simplicity , we 'll be using Genlex .
make_lexer of OCaml 3.09 as our parser ( it is quite inconvenient for me at the moment to upgrade to OCaml 3.10 ) .
Code fragments ( cut and pasted from the eshell buffer ) are given below within [ [ ... ] ] brackets .
First , preliminaries : [ [ (* Open the DelimCC library http://pobox.com/~oleg/ftp/Computation/Continuations.html#caml-shift *) open Delimcc ; ; let shift p f = take_subcont p ( fun sk ( ) -> push_prompt p ( fun ( ) -> ( f ( fun c -> push_prompt p ( fun ( ) -> push_subcont sk ( fun ( ) -> c ) ) ) ) ) ) ;; open Stream ; ; open Printf ; ; ]]
First , we define the lexer and demonstrate non-incremental parsing .
We apply the lexer to a sample stream and print out the produced tokens .
We use the standard library Stream.iter function . [ [ let lexer = Genlex.make_lexer [ " + " ; " - " ; " * " ; " / " ; " let " ; " = " ; " ( " ; " ) " ] ; ; let stream_f n1 str = fun pos -> (* printf " stream_fn1 : asked for char #%d
" pos ; *) if pos < String.length str then Some str.[ pos ] else None ; ; let show_token_stream = Stream.iter ( function | Genlex .
Kwd s -> printf " Stream elem : Kwd %s
" s | Genlex .
Ident s -> printf " Stream elem : Ident %s
" s | Genlex .
Int d -> printf " Stream elem : int %d
" d | Genlex .
Float f -> printf " Stream elem : float %g
" f | Genlex .
String s -> printf " Stream elem : \ " %s \ "
" s | Genlex .
Char c -> printf " Stream elem : ' %c '
" c ) ; ; ]]
Evaluating [ [ let test1 = show_token_stream ( lexer ( Stream.from ( stream_fn1 " let x = 1 + 2 in (* comment *) \ " xxx \ " ^ x " ) ) ) ; ; ] ] produces the expected result Stream elem : Kwd let Stream elem : Ident x Stream elem : Kwd = Stream elem : int 1 Stream elem : Kwd +
Stream elem : int 2 Stream elem : Ident in Stream elem : " xx x " Stream elem : Ident ^ Stream elem : Ident x val test1 : unit = ()
We now invert the parser , in the following two lines : [ [ type stream_req = ReqDone | ReqChar of int * ( char option -> stream_req ) ; ; let stream_inv p = fun pos -> shift p ( fun sk -> ReqChar ( pos , sk ) ) ; ; ]]
That is it .
If we wish to ask the user for chunks ( rather than characters ) of data , we need a simple buffering layer . [ [ let rec filler buffer buffer_pos = function ReqDone -> ReqDone | ReqChar ( pos , k ) as req -> let pos_rel = pos - buffer_pos in let _ = (* we do n't accumulate already emptied buffers .
We could . *) assert ( pos_rel >= 0 ) in if pos_rel < String.length buffer then (* desired char is already in buffer *) filler buffer buffer_pos ( k ( Some buffer . [ pos_rel ] ) ) else (* buffer underflow .
Ask the user to fill the buffer *) req ;; let cont str ( ReqChar ( pos , k ) as req ) = filler str pos req ; ; let finish ( ReqChar ( pos , k ) ) = filler " " pos ( k None ) ; ; ]]
We are all set .
Please compare the iterator below with test1 above .
The composition " show_token_stream ( lexer ( Stream.from " is exactly as before .
We merely replaced the stream function stream_fn with stream_inv .
In calculus terms , we replaced " x " with " x+dx " . [ [ let test2c0 = let p = new_prompt ( ) in push_prompt p ( fun ( ) -> filler " " 0 ( show_token_stream ( lexer ( Stream.from ( stream_inv p ) ) ) ; ReqDone ) ) ; ; ]]
Now , the result is val test2c0 : stream_req = ReqChar ( 0 , < fun > )
That is , the parser is suspended , awaiting the character number 0 .
We now feed the parser chunks of input .
The chunks do not have to contain complete lexems .
For example , a comment may start in one chunk and end in another . [ [ let test2c1 = cont " let x = 1 + 2 " test2c0 ; ; ]]
Stream elem : Kwd let Stream elem : Ident x Stream elem : Kwd = Stream elem : int 1 Stream elem : Kwd +
Stream elem : int 2 val test2c1 : stream_req = ReqChar ( 14 , < fun > )
The parser ate the chunk , produced some tokens , and waits for more input . [ [ let test2c2 = cont " in ( * com " test2c1 ; ; ]]
Stream elem : Ident in val test2c2 : stream_req = ReqChar ( 24 , < fun > )
Here , the chunk contains a non-terminating comment . [ [ let test2c3 = cont " ment *) " test2c2 ; ; ] ] val test2c3 : stream_req = ReqChar ( 32 , < fun > ) [ [ let test2c4 = cont " \" xx " test2c3 ; ; ] ] val test2c4 : stream_req = ReqChar ( 35 , < fun > ) [ [ let test2c5 = cont " x\ " " test2c4 ; ; ]]
Stream elem : " xxx " val test2c5 : stream_req = ReqChar ( 38 , < fun > )
Finally the parser produced something , because it got the matching double quote . [ [ let test2c6 = cont " ^ x " test2c5 ; ; ]]
Stream elem : Ident ^ val test2c6 : stream_req = ReqChar ( 42 , < fun > ) [ [ let test2c7 = finish test2c6 ; ; ]]
Stream elem : Ident x val test2c7 : stream_req = ReqDone
And we are finished .
As we said earlier , the parser can be restartable and undoable .
Suppose , we have changed our mind and decided to continue parsing after the checkpoint test2c6 : [ [ let test2c71 = cont " yx * 10 " test2c6 ; ; let test2c8 = finish test2c71 ; ; ]]
Stream elem : Ident xyx Stream elem : Kwd * val test2c71 : stream_req = ReqChar ( 49 , < fun > )
Stream elem : int 10 val test2c8 : stream_req = ReqDone and so we get an `alternative ' parse , of an alternative stream .
We can go back to any checkpoint test2c1 , test2c2 , etc. and continue parsing from that point .
The Tsar ’s Opponent
Garry Kasparov takes aim at the power of Vladimir Putin .
by David Remnick
On a recent summer evening , the greatest player in the history of chess , Garry Kasparov , wrapped up an exhausting series of meetings devoted to the defeat of the Kremlin regime .
After days of debate , a motley pride of unlikely revolutionaries – bearded politicos , earnest academics , and multigrained environmentalists – collected their cigarettes and left Kasparov ’s apartment , divided and worn out .
Little had been accomplished .
Crumpled drafts of fevered proclamations lay scattered on the kitchen table .
Puffy - eyed and unsmiling , Kasparov grunted a curt farewell to his comrades and went off to make yet another urgent telephone call .
Kasparov is forty - four .
He was the world chess champion for fifteen years .
Until his retirement , two years ago , his dominance was unprecedented .
Lasker , Capablanca , Alekhine , Fischer – none came close .
Chess has outsized meaning in Russia , and Kasparov at home was a cross between the greatest of athletes and a revered intellectual .
Now he has volunteered for grim and , very likely , futile duty .
As the most conspicuous leader of Drugaya Rossiya ( the Other Russia ) , an umbrella group of liberals , neo-Bolsheviks , and just about anyone else wishing to speak ill of Vladimir Putin .
Ideas Versus Experience Clash In Primaries
By Galina Stolyarova
As Garry Kasparov faces off with Mikhail Kasyanov in a series of primaries being held by The Other Russia Coalition to elect a unified opposition candidate that would oppose pro-Kremlin rivals in the forthcoming presidential elections , the contest is one of political steadfastness verses leadership experience .
In a series of regional primaries being conducted in 54 Russian cities , former chess champion Kasparov and former prime minister Kasyanov have so far led the field .
Kasparov won the vote in St. Petersburg on Sunday .
The list of potential candidates in the primaries also includes Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky , Communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov , emigre dissident Vladimir Bukovsky , liberal State Duma deputy Vladimir Ryzhkov , former leader of the Union of Right Forces Boris Nemtsov and People movement leader Sergei Gulyayev .
The decisive vote takes place this coming Sunday during the opposition coalition ’s federal congress in Moscow .

Yasemin Vatansever and Yatunde Diya , both of north London , were arrested at Accra international airport on 2 July .
They denied the charge of attempting to smuggle more than 6kg ( 13lbs ) of the drug on a BA flight to London .
The girls were found guilty by a Ghanaian court and could face up to three years in a juvenile detention facility when sentenced on 5 December .
The BBC's Will Ross in Accra said the girls will appeal against the verdict .
" They are very upset at the moment , " said lawyer Sabine Zanker , of Fair Trials Abroad , after the 90 - minute hearing in a closed juvenile court .
' Ruthlessly exploited '
" Their families are very deeply disappointed about the verdict . "
She added : " These are two extremely vulnerable young girls whose naivety was ruthlessly exploited by the man who lured them to Ghana and led them to this terrible fate .
" They are together .
It is a real blessing that they are together because it would be much harder if they were apart .
They are very supportive of each other . "
They had told the court they were set up , but the prosecution said they were involved from the start in a plot to smuggle drugs .
The girls have already spent nearly five months in custody after they were arrested with laptop bags containing cocaine .
Joint operation
Ms Zanker added that it was unlikely the girls would be able to serve their sentence in the UK as , at the moment , there is no transfer agreement between the two countries .
The girls were tried under Ghana 's Juvenile Justice
Act which meant their trial had to be completed within six months .
They were caught under a joint operation set up between the UK and Ghana , a year ago , to combat drug smuggling from the west African country .
So far " tens of millions of pounds of drugs " has been seized and stopped from reaching the UK , the HM Revenue and Customs ( HMRC ) said .
Following the North American release of the Wii on November 19 , officials from Nintendo have confirmed that the console has sold more than 600,000 units in its first eight days of availability .
In addition , the company noted that , when taking into account first - party software and accessory sales , Wii sales have thus far amounted to an impressive $ 190 million .
Nintendo also added that sales of the Wii's highly anticipated launch title , , has already has achieved sales of more than 454,000 units in the Americas , a figure which it notes represents in excess of of 75 percent of all hardware purchasers .
While still early , Nintendo is expected to continue to ship large amounts of consoles to North America , with Lazard Capital Markets ' analyst Colin Sebastian in particular recently predicting Wii shipments of 150,000 - 200,000 per week throughout the remainder of 2006 .
Nintendo itself has said that it expects to ship a total of 4 million consoles globally during the six weeks between the system 's launch on November 19 in North America and the end of 2006 .
The Japanese launch of the system will follow North America on December 2nd .
" Even with sales already in excess of 600,000 units , demand continues to exceed supply , as it's clear this is one of the ' gotta - have ' products for the holiday season , " commented Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils - Aime .
" We 've shipped retailers several times the amount of hardware the other company was able to deliver for its launch around the same time -- and we still sold out .
" He added : " Given the inclusive nature of Wii game play , we 're seeing this new form of video gaming is already a huge hit with gamers and newcomers alike .
It continues to be a phenomenal launch . "
HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro poked fun at President George W. Bush on Sunday for proclaiming “ Long Live Free Cuba , ” likening it to Spain ’s king saying the same during his colonial rule over the island .

Bush said the transfer of power from the ailing Fidel Castro to his brother Raul as of July 2006 was unacceptable , proclaiming liberty was more important than stability and ending his comments in the speech to the U.S. State Department on Wednesday with “ Viva Cuba Libre . ”
The slogan was first used by Cuban independence fighters , known as Mambisis , in 1868 as they began their decades - long war against Spain ’s colonial rule .
It was also the battle cry of Fidel Castro ’s guerrilla fighters in the late 1950s .
Raul Castro often ends speeches with the slogan instead of Fidel Castro ’s “ Motherland or Death . ”
“ I never imagined I would hear the words coming from the mouth of a U.S. president 139 years later , ” Castro said in an essay titled “ Bush , Mambi ? ” carried by the official media .
“ It ’s as if a king in those times , or his governor , proclaimed ‘ Viva Cuba Libre , ’ ” Castro said .
Castro , 81 , has not appeared in public since undergoing a series of abdominal surgeries and has looked frail in occasional video clips and pictures , although he writes regularly and is said to participate in government decisions .
Bush said on Wednesday he would maintain sanctions against Cuba and called on the Cuban people , military and police to join efforts to open Cuba to multi-party democracy .
Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque accused Bush of encouraging a violent uprising against Cuba ’s Communist government .
Castro compared the Mambisis , who freed their slaves , with President Abraham Lincoln ’s abolition of slavery , then quoted Lincoln ’s famous words in reference to the Bush speech .
“ You can fool some of the people all of the time or all of the people part of the time , but you ca n’t fool all of the people all of the time , ” Castro said .
Cuba on Sunday marked the 48th anniversary of the death of revolutionary hero Camilo Cienfuegos , who disappeared in a plane crash , and earlier this month that of Guerrilla fighter Ernesto Che Guevara .
“ For what their names symbolize , we respond to the false Mambi : Viva Lincoln ! Viva Che ! Viva Camilo ! ” Castro concluded .
Mark Vonnegut gave the speech on his late father 's behalf
The lecture - written two weeks before the author 's death aged 84 earlier this month - was delivered by his son Mark .
Vonnegut had planned to present it himself , as part of a series of events held to honour him in his home city .
The writer 's most famous works are Slaughterhouse - Five and Cat's Cradle , which became cult classics with students in the 1960s and 70s .
Time capsule
Mark Vonnegut said the sold - out event was " a great honour to him " .
" I 'm trying to figure out if he 's sorry he 's not here or not .
He was really , really serious about being funny , " he added .
Vonnegut served in the US army during World War II
Vonnegut interview
The speech concluded with the line : " I thank you for your attention and I 'm outta here . "
The Year of Vonnegut in Indianapolis was designed to encourage more people to use libraries .
A number of items , including a copy of Slaughterhouse - Five , have been placed in a time capsule which has been sealed for 50 years inside the city 's newly - expanded main library .
His final book was A Man Without A Country ( 2005 ) , which was published in paperback at the beginning of this year .
This is part two of the text of a talk delivered to the Yale Computer Science department on November 28 .
Part one appeared yesterday .
After a few years in Redmond , Washington , during which I completely failed to adapt to my environment , I beat a hasty retreat to New York City .
I stayed on with Microsoft in New York for a few months , where I was a complete and utter failure as a consultant at Microsoft Consulting , and then I spent a few years in the mid-90s , when the Internet was first starting to happen , at Viacom .
That ’s this big corporate conglomerate which owned MTV , VH1 , Nickelodeon , Blockbuster , Paramount Studios , Comedy Central , CBS , and a bunch of other entertainment companies .
New York was the first place I got to see what most computer programmers do for a living .
It ’s this scary thing called “ in house software . ”
It ’s terrifying .
You never want to do in house software .
You ’re a programmer for a big corporation that makes , oh , I do n’t know , aluminum cans , and there ’s nothing quite available off the shelf which does the exact kind of aluminum can processing that they need , so they have these in - house programmers , or they hire companies like Accenture and IBM to send them overpriced programmers , to write this software .
And there are two reasons this is so frightening : one , because it ’s not a very fulfilling career if you ’re a programmer , for a list of reasons which I ’ll enumerate in a moment , but two , it ’s frightening because this is what probably 80 % of programming jobs are like , and if you ’re not very , very careful when you graduate , you might find yourself working on in - house software , by accident , and let me tell you , it can drain the life out of you .
OK , so , why does it suck to be an in house programmer .
Number one .
You never get to do things the right way .
You always have to do things the expedient way .
It costs so much money to hire these programmers — typically a company like Accenture or IBM would charge $ 300 an hour for the services of some recent Yale PoliSci grad who took a 6 week course in dot net programming , and who is earning $ 47,000 a year and hoping that it ’ll provide enough experience to get into business school — anyway , it costs so much to hire these programmers that you ’re not going to allowed to build things with Ruby on Rails no matter how cool Ruby is and no matter how spiffy the Ajax is going to be .
You ’re going into Visual Studio , you ’re going to click on the wizard , you ’re going to drag the little Grid control onto the page , you ’re going to hook it up to the database , and presto , you ’re done .
It ’s good enough .
Get out of there and onto the next thing .
That ’s the second reason these jobs suck : as soon as your program gets good enough , you have to stop working on it .
Once the core functionality is there , the main problem is solved , there is absolutely no return - on - investment , no business reason to make the software any better .
So all of these in house programs look like a dog ’s breakfast : because it ’s just not worth a penny to make them look nice .
Forget any pride in workmanship or craftsmanship you learned in CS323 .
You ’re going to churn out embarrassing junk , and then , you ’re going to rush off to patch up last year ’s embarrassing junk which is starting to break down because it was n’t done right in the first place , twenty - seven years of that and you get a gold watch .
Oh , and they do n’t give gold watches any more .
27 years and you get carpal tunnel syndrome .
Now , at a product company , for example , if you ’re a software developer working on a software product or even an online product like Google or Facebook , the better you make the product , the better it sells .
The key point about in - house development is that once it ’s “ good enough , ” you stop .
When you ’re working on products , you can keep refining and polishing and refactoring and improving , and if you work for Facebook , you can spend a whole month optimizing the Ajax name - choosing gizmo so that it ’s really fast and really cool , and all that effort is worthwhile because it makes your product better than the competition .
So , the number two reason product work is better than in - house work is that you get to make beautiful things .
Number three : when you ’re a programmer at a software company , the work you ’re doing is directly related to the way the company makes money .
That means , for one thing , that management cares about you .
It means you get the best benefits and the nicest offices and the best chances for promotion .
A programmer is never going to rise to become CEO of Viacom , but you might well rise to become CEO of a tech company .
Anyway .
After Microsoft
I took a job at Viacom , because I wanted to learn something about the internet and Microsoft was willfully ignoring it in those days .
But at Viacom , I was just an in - house programmer , several layers removed from anybody who did anything that made Viacom money in any way .
And I could tell that no matter how critical it was for Viacom to get this internet thing right , when it came time to assign people to desks , the in - house programmers were stuck with 3 people per cubicle in a dark part of the office with no line - of - sight to a window , and the “ producers , ” I do n’t know what they did exactly but they were sort of the equivalent of Turtle on Entourage , the producers had their own big windowed offices overlooking the Hudson River .
Once at a Viacom Christmas party I was introduced to the executive in charge of interactive strategy or something .
A very lofty position .
He said something vague and inept about how interactivity was very important .
It was the future .
It convinced me that he had no flipping idea whatsoever what it was that was happening and what the internet meant or what I did as a programmer , and he was a little bit scared of it all , but who cares , because he ’s making 2 million dollars a year and I ’m just a typist or “ HTML operator ” or whatever it is that I did , how hard can it be , his teenage daughter can do that .
So I moved across the street to Juno Online Services .
This was an early internet provider that gave people free dial - up accounts that could only be use for email .
It was n’t like Hotmail or Gmail , which did n’t exist yet , because you did n’t need internet access to begin with , so it was really free .
Juno was , allegedly , supported by advertising .
It turned out that advertising to the kinds of people who wo n’t pay $ 20 a month for AOL is not exactly the most lucrative business in the world , so in reality , Juno was supported by rich investors .
But at least Juno was a product company where programmers were held in high regard , and I felt good about their mission to provide email to everyone .
And indeed I worked there happily for about three years as a C++ programmer .
Eventually , though , I started to discover that the management philosophy at Juno was old fashioned .
The assumption there was that managers exist to tell people what to do .
This is quite upside - down from the way management worked in typical west - coast high tech companies .
What I was used to from the west coast was an attitude that management is just an annoying , mundane chore someone has to do so that the smart people can get their work done .
Think of an academic department at a university , where being the chairperson of the department is actually something of a burden that nobody really wants to do ; they ’d much rather be doing research .
That ’s the Silicon Valley style of management .
Managers exist to get furniture out of the way so the real talent can do brilliant work .
Juno was founded by very young , very inexperienced people — the president of the company was 24 years old and it was his first job , not just his first management job — and somewhere in a book or a movie or a TV show he had gotten the idea that managers exist to DECIDE .
If there ’s one thing I know , it ’s that managers have the least information about every technical issue , and they are the last people who should be deciding anything .
When I was at Microsoft , Mike Maples , the head of the applications division , used to have people come to him to resolve some technical debate they were having .
And he would juggle some bowling pins , tell a joke , and tell them to get the hell out of his office and solve their own damned problems instead of coming to him , the least qualified person to make a technical decision on its merits .
That was , I thought , the only way to manage smart , highly qualified people .
But the Juno managers , like George Bush , were the deciders , and there were too many decisions to be made , so they practiced something I started calling hit - and - run micromanagement : they dive in from nowhere , micromanage some tiny little issue , like how dates should be entered in a dialog box , overriding the opinions of all the highly qualified technical people on the team who had been working on that problem for weeks , and then they disappeared , so that ’s the hit - and - run part , because there ’s some other little brush fire elsewhere that needs micromanagement .
So , I quit , without a real plan .
A quick note :

On September 11 , 2001 , our nation – and much of the world – watched – in shock , with emotions raw – as two towers , two massive feats of engineering , symbols of the triumph of capitalism and technology , of greed and power , of America and freedom , stood with gaping holes burning on a crisp , clear September morning .
Then the towers fell .
In that moment , we Americans were united and much of the world with us .
“ We are all Americans !
We are all New Yorkers ! ” Le Monde declared .
Vigils were held in Tehran for the victims .
Around the world , there was outrage and sadness over the events .
We were a long way from freedom fries and Ahmadinejad .
Three Generations
Three generations of Americans stood before their televisions sets and on the streets of New York City and Washington D.C. and watched these events unfold : the Greatest Generation which had endured the Great Depression , fought a cataclysmic world war , and set America on a path to isolate the Soviet Union and win the cold war ; the Baby Boomers split into two camps : those liberals who had seen the corruptions and hypocrisies of their parents ’ world and marched in support of civil rights , women ’s rights , gay rights , and against the Vietnam war and American imperialism ; and those conservatives who decried their parents ’ tepid stand against Communism , wanting this totalitarian ideology declared the evil that it was , who wanted to fight Communism wherever it was and destroy it , and who at the same time , wanted to preserve traditional values at home , to ward off the rapid changes the Baby Boomer liberals and the Greatest Generation had put into motion ; and then there was us , a generation with out an identity , who had not yet been shaped by great movements or moments in history , and who saw the two towers burning fall .
On 9/11 we were all one people .
On 9/12 we began to put each of our selves back together .
Those in the Greatest Generation , elderly , stood aside , offering advice , waiting to be called upon for service and sacrifice , looking at FDR ’s marshaling of America ’s resources after Pearl Harbor as a model .
Our generation , uncertain , waited for guidance .
Those in power , Republicans and Democrats of the Baby Boom Generation , panicked .
Congress passed bills expanding government power without reading or understanding them ; the directive went down from the President : the gloves are off : we must use any means necessary to stop another attack ; the media , sensing the mood of the country , placed American flags on every broadcast and avoided asking tough questions .
Karl Rove
But as the dust settled , old divisions began to reassert themselves .
Perhaps the most pivotal figure in the domestic fallout that followed was Karl Rove .
Rove had been trying to find a defining moment which he could use to create a new political consensus , to create a transformation in the electorate .
He saw that 9/11 would be a transformational event , and that it could be the defining event of the early 21st century .
So he decided to harness this anti-American attack and to use it to isolate those views he saw as threats – the views of the liberal Baby Boomers .
He believed history had provided him with the lever to move the electorate and the country into his ideological camp .
Rove thought he could use 9/11 to initiate a shift in the electorate and consolidate his party ’s hold on power .
Gradually , his strategy backfired , and America became more polarized than ever , split roughly along the same lines as they had split in the 1960s .
The Baby Boomers , united on September 11 , 2001 had become polarized again by September 11 , 2002 .
Here is where we leave history leaves us today – with out parents ’ generation hopelessly polarized , bringing to this pivotal moment in history their various prejudices and suspicions ; somehow , the challenges we face from islamist radicals , from global climate change , from a failing health care system , from the demands of globalization have become subordinated to a culture war in which there can be no winner .
Like a bickering couple , this generation has polarized around every issue and made each issue serve a purpose in their larger and more petty generational conflict .
The Post 9/11 Generation
My generation – those who have graduated high school between 1997 and the the present , the post 9/11 generation – has been shaped almost entirely by the post - Cold War administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush .
We have watched and sometimes participated in this war of our parents , but have never been entirely invested in it .
Instead , we volunteered locally , we created communities over the web , we started businesses , we marched against war on our campuses – we made a difference in each of our local communities , but made no impact on our nation ’s course .
We can see the enormity of the problems facing us , and we realize the pettiness of so many of the issues that take up the media ’s attention .
While our society waste reams of paper debating whether to accept gay marriage , evolution , or presidential trysts , the issues of civil liberties , terrorism , environmental issues , health care , education , and free speech ( including net neutrality ) , are largely ignored .
After 9/11 , my generation realized that we would soon be inheriting this world with all of it ’s burdens and responsibilities , and today , six years on , we see a fucked up world falling apart and we are divorced from the levers of power , unable to alter the unfortunate trajectory of our history .
We , the post 9/11 generation , are a cynical generation .
But we hold out for the promise of hope .
This is why we must show up at the polls and caucuses this winter to determine which candidates we will have to choose from .
We must not let this election pass us by .
This next election is our chance , our opportunity to make our voices heard .
And we cannot let another four or eight years pass with more of the same petty culture wars overshadowing the real and pressing issues we face .
Our parents may not have to deal with these issues , but we will .
2008 must be the year we lay our claim to the leadership of our country .
We may yet have another chance before these issues are hard upon us ; or this may be our last chance to prepare for coming storm .
footnote : I want to make clear that I do not wish to equate the behavior of liberal and conservative Baby Boomers , especially in recent times .
I believe that the conservative Baby Boomers have , since at least the late 1990s , tried far harder to polarize the nation and distract us from the pressing problems that our country faces because they believed doing so aided them in winning elections .
But , especially over the course of the past 50 years , I believe both sides have done their parts and that in the end , regardless of blame , no political figure rooted in the Baby Boom generation can bring the country together .

The 3 - way catalysator of a car apparently works differently from the way chemists had expected .
The conversion of carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide takes place not in one single step , but in at least two different steps .
To date , the second reaction path was completely unknown , but it seems to work much more efficiently than the first , more familiar process .
This discovery has been made by surface physicist Marcelo Ackermann from Leiden University .
His findings call into question the chemistry of catalysators .
Catalysator performance now understood
Because the second reaction path was not known , chemists had never properly understood what made the difference between a good and a poor performance of a catalysator .
They considered the formation of a thin layer of oxide on the catalysator as detrimental to catalysis .
But Ackermann has discovered how such a layer forms , and is able to demonstrate that this layer actually ensures that the catalysator works properly .
Researchers can now determine precisely the atomic structure which causes a catalysator to perform more or less effectively .
Real - life circumstances
Ackermann obtained his PhD at Leiden University on Tuesday 13 November .
He was able to make these findings during the course of his work with a team of scientists and technical specialists who are collaborating on developing a technique which for the first time makes it possible to study catalysis at atomic level under real - life circumstances , namely at high temperature and under high gas pressure .
His new method is a form of X - ray diffraction which is rendered sensitive to the structure of the surface of a crystal .
Exhaust gases
Ackermann examined the elementary steps in the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide ( CO ) on platinum and palladium .
This is precisely the reaction which takes place in the familiar 3 - way catalysator , which converts toxins in exhaust gases into less harmful substances .
A 3 - way catalysator currently consists of small particles of platinum and palladium , which catalyse the conversion of carbon monoxide ( CO ) into carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) using oxygen ( O2 ) .
Binding and releasing
In chemistry , there is a tried and tested formula which describes the complete path from reactant to end product : how molecules from both reactants bind to the surface ( adsorption ) , how they come together there and form a new reaction product , which is subsequently again released from the surface ( desorption ) .
Separate oxygen molecules
This formula , which has been used by chemists for more than a hundred years , gives a general description of the first known reaction path : CO and O2 are adsorbed on the surface , whereby O2 is split into two separate O atoms .
O and CO come together on the surface , resulting in the formation of CO2 .
Second process : first a thin layer of oxide
But the process can also proceed very differently , and the formula does not describe this .
The surface in this case first forms an atom - thin layer of platinum or palladium oxide .
The CO molecules which come into contact with this oxide layer immediately oxidise into CO2 .
This process takes place only if the pressure of oxygen ( O2 ) is relatively high in relation to the pressure of carbon monoxide ( CO ) .
Systematically wrongly interpreted
At low pressure and low temperature – conditions which are carefully created and maintained within advanced laboratory environments – this second process is never observed .
There is no possibility for the oxide layer to form under such conditions .
Chemists , including Gerhard Ertl , this years winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry , have therefore always assumed that the formation of an oxide layer must be disadvantageous for the catalytic reaction , and have systematically wrongly interpreted results in which platinum and palladium oxides have been observed .
Coarsening
By measuring the structure of the oxide layer during the catalytic oxidation of CO , the researchers have also for the first time examined the effect of the reaction on the oxide layer .
They saw that this thin and shiny oxide layer coarsens as a result of the reaction .
This confirms the scenario that CO actually takes the oxygen for the oxidation to CO2 from the layer of platinum or palladium .
Fluctuating reaction rate
The empty space which the removed oxygen atom has left behind in the oxide layer is then replenished by fresh oxygen molecules from the gas phase , which maintains the oxide layer .
Under specific conditions , the surface , by coarsening , will spontaneously switch backwards and forwards between an oxidised and non -oxidised state .
Consequently , the reaction rate will increase and slow down .
Surfaces are ‘ hot ’
The research into chemical processes on fixed surfaces is currently the focus of considerable attention .
The Nobel Prize for Chemistry this year was awarded to Gerhard Ertl for his surface work .
The interest from the industry sector in Ackermann ’s research was recently emphasized with the launch of the public - private research programme NIMIC , a partnership between the TU Delft , Leiden University , and a number of different industries and research institutes aimed at revealing at atomic scale key processes which are important for industry and medicine
Prize
Last year , during the 24th European Conference on Surface Science ( ECOSS ) , Marcelo Ackermann was awarded the prize for the best student paper .
Ackerman is a member of the Interface Physics Group of Professor Joost Frenken , LION , Leiden Institute of Physics , Leiden University ( The Netherlands ) .
When Death Cab for Cutie guitarist / producer Chris Walla woke up on Monday , his " To Do " list probably read something like this :
1. Call MTV
News to discuss upcoming , long - delayed solo record .
2. Call U.S. Department of Homeland Security to discuss seizure of hard drive containing said long - delayed solo record .
3 . Head into town for weekly tuque fitting .
Yes , it seems that recently , Walla 's solo record ( which has been scheduled to come out at various points over the past , well , four years ) took another step toward oblivion when the master hard drive — containing all song files — was confiscated by Homeland Security at the Canadian border , for reasons not abundantly clear , and sent to the department 's computer - forensics division for further inspection .
If it sounds like a huge joke , Walla ensures you it is n't .
" It 's a true story .
Barsuk [ Records , which is putting out the record ] had hired a courier — who does international stuff all the time and who they had used before — to bring [ the album ] back from Canada , where I was working on it .
And he got to the border and he had all his paperwork and it was all cool , only they turned him away , and they confiscated the drive and gave it to the computer - forensics division of our Homeland Security - type people , " sighed Walla , who has produced nearly all Death Cab 's output , as well as records by the Decemberists , Hot Hot Heat , Nada Surf , Tegan and Sara and others .
" And now I could n't even venture a guess as to where it is , or what it 's doing there .
I mean , I can't just call their customer - service center and ask about my drive .
There 's nothing I can do .
I do n't know if we can hire an attorney ... is there a black - hole attorney ?
You ca n't take a black hole to court . "
And though his song files might have disappeared into a web of government bureaucracy , Walla does still have the tapes containing all his songs , which he's now trying to master and mix on his own in order to have the record out — Lord willin ' — in January .
" Luckily , the tapes are Plan B , so while I 'm bummed about the whole thing , it could be a whole lot worse , " he laughed .
" I still get to play music .
I mean , I 'm not at Guantánamo or anything like that .
I mean , my drive might be .
They could be water - boarding my drive for all I know . "
And though Walla 's laughing when he mentions Guantánamo , he's not joking when he adds that his record — which he 's calling Field Manual — is " very political , " packed with songs about issues both foreign ( " The Score " tackles the war in Iraq ) and domestic ( " Everyone Needs a Home " deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina ; " Sing Again " is about so - called " morning after " pills and whether they 're a form of contraception or abortion ) .
Easy listening , this is not .
" I 'm calling it Field Manual because myself and the guy who designed the packaging were looking through all these Army field guides from World War II .
And there was one that he found that was really terrifying , actually , " Walla explained .
" It was basically a manual issued by the Army in the late '30s , early ' 40s , about how to build what we now call an [ improvised explosive device ] in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Like how to hide a bomb in a bed or in a tube of toothpaste .
Just terrible stuff , and I started having this feeling of , like , ' Well , we need a new field manual . '
" And while it really is a political record , it 's also intensely personal , and it's not like , political in a way where I hope to change anyone 's mind , because I 've been doing my political - rock homework for a few years now , trying to decode what works and what does n't , " he continued .
" Basically , it was my hope that I would be able to write a bunch of songs about the sh-- that I think about pretty much every day .
But there are n't any character assassinations or indictments on the record .
It 's tricky to write a political record .
It was tough to get to a place where I felt comfortable with the words coming out of my mouth . "
And getting to that place has taken awhile .
Walla said that though he 's been writing songs for years , it took him a long time to figure out just what he was trying to say .
As it turns out , he had plenty to say , and Field Manual is the sound of him coming to that realization ( he credits the directness of Ted Leo , Against Me ! and the Thermals ' Hutch Harris as " touchstones " for that discovery ) .
And while he hustles to finish the record — and continue work on Death Cab for Cutie 's new record , which he said is " coming along super heavy ... we 've got six songs done .
They 're really bloody " — he 's finally prepared to stand on his own , come hell or high water .
Or looming , shadow - like government organizations .
" This is a solo record , which is a little bit scary , because there 's a feeling of ' Oh , you 're officially making a statement , ' and you 're either the fist - waving left or the flag - waving right , and there 's no in between , " he laughed .
" But I made this record because it felt irresponsible for me to have a platform for what I 'm thinking and not use it .
And not just to do political songs .
If all I wanted to do was cover Air Supply songs , I could 've done that too . "

“ Instead of having all of us pay our fair share , we ’ve got over $ 1 trillion worth of loopholes in the corporate tax code , ” Obama said .
“ This is n’t the invisible hand of the market at work .
It ’s the successful work of special interests . ”
At a time when polls show Democrats yearning for change , Obama is portraying himself as better suited than his chief rival for the nomination , Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York , to take on powerful corporate lobbyists in Washington .

Obama pledged tax relief to 150 million workers in the form of a credit of up to $ 500 a person .
It would offset payroll taxes on the first $ 8,100 of a worker ’s earnings .
An Obama advisor said the tax break would phase out at incomes between $ 150,000 and $ 200,000 a year .
The senator also vowed to eliminate income taxes for retirees making less than $ 50,000 a year .
For homeowners who do not file itemized tax returns , he proposed a tax credit averaging around $ 500 a year .
Obama urged that the tax code be simplified so that millions of Americans could prepare their returns in less than five minutes .
He also pledged to abolish capital gains taxes for start - up businesses , a step designed to encourage innovation and spur new jobs .

His advisors were vague in identifying the sources of money to cover the tax cuts .
The senator called for increasing taxes on capital gains and dividends for those in the highest tax brackets , but aides declined to say by how much .
Advisors said his plan also would close corporate tax loopholes , crack down on offshore tax havens and block hedge funds from avoiding taxes .
“ We should n’t be distorting our tax code to benefit a few powerful interests , ” Obama said in remarks to several dozen tax experts at the Tax Policy Center , a research center in Washington run by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution .
“ We should be insisting that everyone pays their fair share , and when I ’m president , they will . ”
As part of his agenda to expand healthcare coverage , Obama previously called for rolling back President Bush ’s income - tax cuts for those making more than $ 250,000 a year .
His healthcare plan also called for increases in dividend and capital - gains taxes ; but an advisor said that would generate enough revenue to cover Obama ’s new tax - break plans as well .

A Clinton spokesman declined to comment on Obama ’s proposal .
Another Democratic presidential contender , former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina , proposed a plan in July to revamp tax laws to tilt the burden away from the middle class and toward the wealthy .
In response to Obama ’s plan , Edwards spokesman Eric Schultz said : “ When it comes to selecting a president , specifics matter , and we look forward to seeing what tax rates Sen. Obama proposes . ”

Passive Driving
Why are we still exposed to pollution that kills 39,000 a year ?
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 1st November 2005
It was fudged – stupidly and unnecessarily fudged – but at least they tried .
The ban on smoking in pubs , though gutted by the prime minister ’s cowardice , will save some fraction of the bar staff who die every year as a result of passive smoking .
The moral case is clear : people are being exposed to a risk for which they have not volunteered .
While smokers have an undisputed right to kill themselves , they have no right to kill other people .
This case being generally applicable , what does the government intend to do about passive driving ?
Every year , according to a paper published by the British Medical Journal , some 54 bar staff in the United Kingdom die as a result of their exposure to other people ’s cigarette smoke ( 1 ) .
And every year , according to the European Union , some 39,000 deaths in this country are caused or hastened by air pollution , most of which comes from vehicles ( 2 ) .
This is a problem three orders of magnitude greater than the one which has filled the newspapers for the past six months , and no one is talking about it .
It is true to say that our air , like that of most parts of the rich world , is much cleaner than it used to be .
Since the great smog of 1952 forced the government to legislate , since coal gave way to gas and factories fitted filters to their chimneys , acute pollution crises of the kind which once killed thousands in a couple of days have not recurred .
( Our nostalgia for the London peasouper , like the uproar over the disappearance of the Routemaster bus , betrays one of our national weaknesses : a romantic attachment to pollution . )
Between 1992 and 2000 , traffic fumes fell steeply .
But in 2000 the decline in the most dangerous pollutant – small particles of soot – came to a halt ( 3 ) .
Since then the levels have held more or less steady ( with a spike in the hot summer of 2003 ) .
The British government is in breach of European rules , and the European Commission is in breach of any serious effort to do something about it .
So 39,000 lives are shortened every year .
Surprisingly , passive driving strikes mostly at the heart , not the lungs .
The effect is not clearly understood .
According to the government ’s Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants , either an inflammation of the lungs makes blood more likely to clot , or the pollutants somehow change the autonomic nervous system ’s control of the heartbeat .
Either way , the committee says , there is a convincing association between “ daily average concentrations of a number of classical air pollutants and the number of deaths occurring daily from cardiovascular causes ” ( 4 ) .
While pollution can kill people who are already ill , there is a good deal of argument about the harm it does to healthy people .
The committee maintains that “ long term exposure to air pollution is unlikely to be a cause of the increased number of people now suffering from asthma in the UK .
” (5 ) Given that air pollution was declining until 2000 , this must be true .
But a study of 4000 children in Munich showed that those who lived within 50 metres of busy roads were twice as likely to suffer from asthma , and suffered more from coughing , wheezing and allergies ( 6 ) .
A massive study in Taiwan – involving 300,000 children – found that those exposed to the heaviest traffic pollution were 16 % more likely to suffer from allergic rhinitis ( hayfever , housedust allergy and the like ) ( 7 ) .
The most carcinogenic compound ever detected – 3 - nitrobenzanthrone – is produced by heavily loaded diesel engines ( 8 ) .
Like the other cancer - causing molecules they emit , it is released in very small quantities , and no one yet knows what effect it might have .
But exhaust pollutants of the class to which it belongs appear , unusually , to pass straight through the placenta , which means that foetuses might be especially vulnerable ( 9 ) .
That the decline in some forms of pollution has – despite technological advances – stopped points to a series of staggering regulatory failures .
The most immediate one has recently been uncovered by researchers at Oxford Brookes University .
They found that the government tests designed to ensure that catalytic converters work properly are hopeless .
In the laboratory , the converter in a modern car conforming to the latest regulations appears to have an efficiency of more than 99 % .
In the real world this falls to 72 - 75 % ( 10 ) .
It looks as if the manufacturers are designing their cars to respond to the peculiarities of the government test , rather than to reduce emissions on the road .
While enforcement is feeble , the tough rules the European Union once proposed have been nobbled by the manufacturers .
The new strategy the Commission published in September consists of asking them sweetly to stop killing our frail citizens , rather than imposing a legal obligation to keep reducing the quantity of fine soot particles their vehicles produce ( 11 ) .
It grants governments like ours – which have done as little as they can get away with – five years in which to sit on their backsides and make excuses .
But even with all this mollycoddling , we still ca n’t meet the rules .
This year the UK has somehow contrived to break the pathetic standards ( a maximum of 35 days on which pollution can exceed the legal limit ) that the European Union currently imposes .
The problem appears to be that the growth in traffic has caught up with the improvement in the performance of engines .
The government has been arguing that to do something about this would not be “ cost effective ” .
But as the National Society for Clean Air points out , if it had acted when it had to , the rules would have cost far less ( 12 ) .
The idea that laws can be broken when it makes financial sense has interesting implications for the criminal justice system .
As a cyclist , these failures drive me beserk .
I refuse to own a car , partly because I believe it is wrong to fill other people ’s lungs with carcinogens .
And so , while the drivers breathe their filtered air , I have to sit behind their tailpipes , drawing their excretions – for I am exerting myself – deep into my chest .
The Routemasters being dragged – to incomprehensible public dismay – off the streets of London do not die .
Their tops are cut off , then their headless wights are sent to my home city – Oxford – with the sole and certain purpose of making our lives hell .
Carrying two or three half - frozen tourists at a time , they trundle round and round the centre on endless guided tours .
To judge by the smoke that comes out of their rear ends they seem to run on burning tyres rather than diesel , but the council ’s environmental health department , engaged in lively competition with the planning department to establish the outer limits of uselessness , refuses to return my calls , so I have no idea why they are still allowed to operate .
At least the bar staff can , though perhaps at the cost of unemployment , withdraw their labour from the cancer market , but what choice do I have , or does anyone have , short of living in an oxygen tent ?
Why , in this age of particulate filters and hypercars , do I have to fill my lungs with every known species of airborne fug whenever I go to buy a pint of milk ?
Is it so hard for a government which seems determined to offend the entire voting public with its assaults on schools and hospitals to stand up to a handful of motor manufacturers who no longer even operate here ?
Or must we believe that public health in the United Kingdom takes second place to the profits of foreign corporations ?

Draft briefing note .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 24 — With American military successes outpacing political gains in Iraq , the Bush administration has lowered its expectation of quickly achieving major steps toward unifying the country , including passage of a long - stymied plan to share oil revenues and holding regional elections .
Instead , administration officials say they are focusing their immediate efforts on several more limited but achievable goals in the hope of convincing Iraqis , foreign governments and Americans that progress is being made toward the political breakthroughs that the military campaign of the past 10 months was supposed to promote .
The short - term American targets include passage of a $ 48 billion Iraqi budget , something the Iraqis say they are on their way to doing anyway ; renewing the United Nations mandate that authorizes an American presence in the country , which the Iraqis have done repeatedly before ; and passing legislation to allow thousands of Baath Party members from Saddam Hussein ’s era to rejoin the government .
A senior Bush administration official described that goal as largely symbolic since rehirings have been quietly taking place already .
Bush administration officials have not abandoned their larger goals and emphasize the importance of reaching them eventually .
They say that even modest steps , taken soon , could set the stage for more progress , in the same manner that this year ’s troop “ surge ” opened the way , unexpectedly , for drawing Sunni tribesmen to the American side .

This past week , the German Association of Jewish Soldiers held its first meeting in Berlin .
Michael Berger , president of the association , said his group , which was founded last year , aims to research and record the history of Jewish soldiers .
Special focus is to be placed on " the fate Jewish soldiers who served on the front during World War I and who later suffered , along with their families , under Nazi dictatorship , " Berger said .
Many Jewish soldiers were sent to concentration camps , like Buchenwald near Weimar
More than 85,000 Jewish soldiers served for the German Empire during the First World War , and over 12,000 lost their lives .
The surviving Jewish military personnel , many of whom were highly decorated , were forced out of the German military beginning in 1933 when Hitler became came to power .
Jewish soldiers serve again
Nowadays , Jewish soldiers once again serve in the German army , or Bundeswehr as it has been called since 1955 .
The exact number is unknown since answers to questions about religion are voluntary in the army .
According to the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung , however , it is at least a three - digit number .
These are the military who have founded the Bund jüdischer Soldaten , or German Association of Jewish Soldiers .
Stephan Kramer , secretary general of the Central Council of Jews in Germany , has assured the Bund of his group 's support .
Carrying on a tradition
During the 1938 pogram , Nazis set fire to synagogues and looted Jewish businesses
The modern German Association of Jewish Soldiers sees itself as carrying on in the tradition of the Reichsbund jüdischer Frontsoldaten ( Reich Federation of Jewish Front Soldiers ) , which was founded in 1919 with the purpose of opposing the renewed growth of anti-Semitism during the Weimar Republik .
In its heyday , up to 40,000 soldiers were members .
When Hitler claimed power , the Nazis declared the Jewish soldiers " unfit to serve " in the military and in 1936 , banned any political activity by the group .
Following the 1938 pogrom known as the Kristallnacht ( Night of Broken Glass ) , the group was dissolved completely .

There are digital worlds out there that most of us have no idea about .
One of them is called Second Life ( SL ) , and it 's got 6 million residents .
These residents are avatars – animated cartoon - like characters – created by ordinary people who register to take part in Second Life .
These ordinary people buy their avatars houses , open bank accounts for them , take them out to bars , and let them throw parties .
All the things we all do in our first lives .
Occasionally things get out of hand , as often happens when cartoon characters get together .
Recently , an avatar was allegedly raped , and some people want the perpetrator brought to justice .
And I do n't mean the avatar .
They want the real person who created the rapist avatar to be punished in real life for what his character did in Second Life .
The Washington Post recently reported that police in Belgium are investigating whether a crime had been committed .
I think I can help with their investigation .
And I 'd like to .
The answer to whether a crime was committed is no .
Because if the answer were yes , we'd have to start prosecuting authors who create characters that commit crimes against other characters .
We 'd have actresses on " Law & Order " who play rape victims filing charges in the real world against the writers who created the characters who assaulted them .
See how obvious the boundaries are when applied to fictional worlds we 're familiar with such as those in literature and TV ?
But boundaries are not so obvious when applied to digital worlds .
Officials in Germany are looking into an incident involving sex between an adult and a child that occurred in SL .
German laws against child pornography are so strict that many reasonable people believe they apply to acts that occur in digital worlds such as SL .
The FBI has also been called in to SL to ensure that casinos there comply with US law .
Apparently , the line between fantasy and reality is n't so clear anymore .
And I think I know why .
It has to do with a phrase you may have last heard in English class , " suspension of disbelief . "
For thousands of years , storytellers have created fictional worlds , which we enter through our willingness to suspend our disbelief .
This is a uniquely human sort of thing , a psychological and emotional contract that allows us to spend several hours caring about characters and events that are n't real .
The contract works beautifully as long as there is a creator who does the creating and a reader or viewer who does the suspending of disbelief .
But digital worlds such as SL have made us all creators and suspenders simultaneously .
And that changes everything by creating a fictional world with two key characteristics of the real world .
One is randomness .
We can't control everything that happens to our character .
And the other is time .
Traditional fictional forms have a built - in escape hatch : the final curtain or the words , " The End . "
But the digital fictional world of SL , like real life , is 24/ 7 .
Maybe if you suspend your disbelief for too long , it 's difficult to return to disbelief .
Maybe at that point , suspension of disbelief + time = reality .
Studies show that a similar thing happens to kids when they watch too much violence on TV .
It 's not necessarily that the violence causes them to be more violent .
It 's that it causes them to lose the line between reality and fantasy .
So they might pull a real trigger not expecting real results .
In essence , their mechanism for suspending disbelief is stuck in the " on " position .
One of the hallmarks of fiction is the quest for justice .
And so I hope justice is done to the SL avatar if he did , indeed , commit a rape .
The solution will no doubt require police investigators , lawyers , and judges .
As long as they 're avatars , all will be well .
In fact , this gives all those would - be cops and lawyers out there an opportunity to be what they always wanted to be .
It gives them a second chance – and a second life .

Kanye West Breaks Down On Stage ( Video )
broke down on stage near the end of his concert in Paris while dedicating the song " Hey Mama " to his mother , , who passed away last week from plastic surgery complications .
A band member tried to console Kanye before he left the stage , eventually returning to perform " Stronger , " as the audience screamed their support .
" He kept shouting out to the audience , ' I need you ... I need you right now . ' and the public was screaming back .
It was magic . "
Audience members captured the moment on their mobile phones and are being posted on YouTube .
I have posted two of the videos below .
West is expected to return to Oklahoma for his mother 's funeral on Tuesday .
Our hearts go out to him .
View videos of Kanye West during this very touching moment at his concert in Paris below .
Senators who can find themselves on the wrong side of a campaign ad for voting party line on a Bill ( from the opposing party ) and for voting against party line on a Bill ( from a primary challenger in their own party ) will skip out on voting altogether .
It covers their political tuckus nicely .
They are recorded as " not voting " , and it deprives their political enemies of election - year ammunition .
Still , it 's a rare event ( McCain notwithstanding ) , with a typical bill up for a Passage vote seeing 2 - 3 Senators recorded as " not voting " , on average .
Twelve senators are recorded as " not voting " for S. 1927 -- six Democrats , and six Republicans : Sen Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) , Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , Bunning ( R - KY ) , Dorgan ( D - ND ) , Sen. Judd A. Gregg ( R -NH ) , Sen. Tom Harkin ( D - IA ) , Sen .
Tim Johnson ( D - SD ; who has been absent since his stroke this past year ) , Sen John Kerry ( D - MA ) , Sen . Trent Lott ( R - MS ) , Sen. Dick Lugar ( R - IN ) , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) , Sen. Patty Murray ( D - WA ) .
First , when did those Senators become unavailable ?
Of the twelve Senators who did not vote ( at 9:16 pm ) , only 2 were not present 12 hours earlier ( 9:38 am ) to vote on the confirmation of Timothy D. DeGuisti of Oklahoma to be US District Judge ( they are : Johnson , who has been out all term with a stroke , and Murray ) .
That confirmation was unanimous among all 96 voting Senators .
So , the other 10 Senators become unavailable some time within the 12 hours before S. 1927 was voted on .
Senators are elected to vote on bills : can such a mass - vacation be common practice in the Senate ?
Some simple questions :
When was the last time 6 Democratic Senators failed to vote on a bill ?
When was the last time 6 Republican Senators failed to vote on a bill ?
When was the last time 12 Senators , in total , failed to vote on a bill ?
July ?
May ?
I started looking , and had to go back to 2003 .
Here 's the list of votes on Passage for bills , and the number of " not voting " Senators .
Sorry the white space below , I 'm trying to fix it . .

number , and the number of " not voting " Senators ( in parenthesis ) .

H.R. 2989 ( 6 ) ; S. 877 ( 3 ) ; S. 1689 ( 1 ) ; S. 1053 ( 5 ) ; H.R. 3161 ( 5 ) ;
H.R. 2658 ( 5 ) ; H.R. 2754 ( 6 Dems + 2 Rep. ) ;
Finally , H.R. 2754 had 6
Dems who were " not voting " .
But , that bill was a water and energy infrastructure bill , and it passed unanimously .
And , I had to go back 90 Bills , to mid-2003 , to find that one .
But that is nothing like the situation S. 1927 , which should have been the most hotly contested bill before Congress in years , requiring all Senators to be on the floor in case the uncertainty in the number of votes for or against brought it down to a single Senator .
This suffices to say : having six Senators from either party miss a Passage vote is rare , and back 4 years , the only other time it occurred was when the bill 's outcome was absolutely positively assured .
For S. 1927 , not only did 6
Dems miss the vote ; 6 Republicans missed it too .
6 Republicans missed it too .
That means , not only did the Democratic caucus know the outcome , the Republicans new the outcome as well : the bill was absolutely , positively assured to pass .
The GOP Senate leadership must have known the Democratic votes for S. 1927 were assured , in order to release such a huge number of GOP Senators , permitting them to cover their political tuckus in states where their re-election was in doubt .
So Six GOP Senators -- more than for any other bill in the last 4 years -- took the opportunity to cover their political tuckus and be " not voting " .
I do n't see how that is at all possible , unless they were told -- assured -- precisely how many Dems would vote for the bill --- that it was n't even close , that 4 Dems would n't suddenly change their mind and turn an Passage of S.1927 into a sudden and important defeated bill .
And I do n't know what other situation would permit the GOP leadership to be so confident in the number of Democratic votes for the bill , except that the Democratic leadership saw they would lose , and decided to strike a deal , assuring the GOP of passage before they took to the floor that night .
I started off in this direction , because 2 days ago , in a diary by The Big E it was pointed out that newly elected Sen .
Amy Klobuchar explained her vote for S. 1927 this way :
The bill approved by the House and Senate this week provides a temporary six month extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
While I supported the extension as a temporary measure , I remain concerned about whether there are adequate safeguards in the bill , and will work with my colleagues to address these concerns in the next six months while we enact a permanent extension of FISA .
What set off Alarm Bells was that Sen .
Klobuchar described this bill as an extension of FISA , which it is not .
FISA is not set to expire .
It 's in place , it was n't going to change , if the Senate had n't voted , all would be as it was for the past 19 years .
I do n't believe that Sen .
Klobuchar is ill - informed ; that nobody bothered to tell her that FISA was n't going to expire .
It was also suggested she was on " auto - pilot " , due to the disaster in her home state ( the bridge collapse in MN ) ; except if true , a Senator on " autopilot " might be expected to vote with the caucus , not vote against it .
So this lead me to wonder , were the Democratic votes for S. 1927 actually rounded up ?
Did she do what the leadership asked her to do , with political cover in her conservative state , but without conviction ?
Certainly the reason she gave for voting for S. 1927 is non-operative .
I apologize this diary is a bummer .
I want to reiterate and conclude , as I stated elsewhere all week , that I very strongly believe that the way to overcome the problem we had with S. 1927 is to send your campaign contributions exclusively to the DSCC , DCCC and DNC .
Why ?
Because the more that candidates are dependent upon the Senate and House leadership for re-election , the more they will react to party discipline , and vote with the caucus and with our needs , instead of against them .
UPDATE : 9:04a EDT
As Smallbottle mentions below , there 's much discussion about whether or not the best response to the situation described in this diary is stronger support for the DSCC and DCCC .
I welcome full - throated discussion on this issue in the comments section .
My conclusion remains that we should strengthen Democratic party institutions , to help enforcement of party discipline on those who would weaken the Caucus hand .
Caracas , November 5 , 2007 ( venezuelanalysis.com ) -
Over a hundred thousand Venezuleans marched in support of President Chavez and of his
constitutional reform on Sunday , which Chavez described as the most important
referendum of his presidency .
Marchers ,
almost all dressed in red - the color of Venezuela 's Bolivarian movement -
filled the entire 1.3 km ( 0.8 mi ) Bolivar
Avenue and spilled into side streets .
The demonstration
proceeded without incident and culminated with a three hour speech by Chavez .
During
the 8.5 km ( 5.3 mi ) march , which passed through most of Caracas , rains poured down on marchers for
part of the time .
The
constitutional reform referendum , which will take place on December 2nd ,
will be in two parts , where Chavez is urging his supporters to vote " Yes " in
both parts of the reform .
If passed , the reform would revise 69 articles of Venezuela's
350 - article constitution .
Sunday 's march marked the beginning of the " Yes "
campaign .
" Now ‘ Yes ! '
Here begins another great battle to obtain another great victory , but we have to
fight in all parts of the country , " said Chavez to the cheering crowd on Sunday .
" Every year will have a battle .
The path of revolution is the path of a thousand
battles .
We have managed to coincide with the path of a thousand battles the path
of a thousand victories , " he added .
Chavez
also said that this was the most important referendum of his presidency .
" I
have no doubt that this is the most important of all the referenda that have taken
place , including the recall referendum of August 2004 and the one of December
1999 with which the current constitution was approved , " said Chavez .
One of the
key challenges in this referendum , argued Chavez , is to overcome abstention .
He
mentioned that in the recall referendum abstention was at 30 % and during the
approval of the constitution it was at 53 % of registered voters .
" We have to
defeat abstention so that there is no doubt that the great majority of Venezuelans
approve of the constitutional reform . "
What is needed is a " resounding "
victory , according to Chavez .
During
his speech Chavez warned that the opposition will try to do anything to stop
the reform , including destabilizing the country .
" I warn he leaders of the
opposition , who are going about playing with fire , invoking a military coup and
filling the streets with violence - I suggest to them that they forget about
this possibility because if they continue on this path they will regret it because
by no path will they be able to defeat us . "
Referring
to opposition students who had rampaged down the same avenue where the
pro-reform march was taking place and set fire to several trees and a police
car , Chavez warned , " We wo n't allow these spoiled little brats , these rich kids
with a silver spoon in their mouths to go around tearing up the center of Caracas . "
He asked the
city mayor to closely examine permits for marches , in case the violence was
their main objective .
One of the opposition 's main goals , according to Chavez ,
was a death that they can blame on the government .
The
international news channel CNN was another target during Chavez 's speech , which
he accused of having joined the opposition because it was broadcasting
unverified reports about Chavez supporters supposedly killing an anti-Chavez
student during a demonstration last week .
Police have already arrested the killer ,
who was hired to assassinate the student due to a dispute within the university
that had nothing to do with the constitutional reform protests .
Chavez
also said that the reform represents a historic break with the past and would
usher in 21st century socialism in Venezuela .
" Although there still is
much to do , Caracas
already has a new face , " he said .
Also , by the year 2021 , when Chavez says the
Bolivarian Revolution will be complete , " There will be no favelas [ slums ] , but
a socialist and beautiful city . "
The
reform , which changes 69 out of 350 articles of Venezuela 's 1999 constitution , is
supposed to bring the country closer to 21st century socialism by
deepening grassroots or participatory democracy and by organizing the country 's
state institutions more efficiently .
Also , in one of the more controversial
changes , it would extend the president 's term of office from six to seven years
and eliminate the two consecutive term limit on holding presidential office .
According to a recent opinion poll reported by Venezulea's
largest circulation paper Últimas
Noticias , 46.6 % of Venezuelans believe that the reform is necessary , while
35.0 % oppose it .
Also , 72 % of Venezuelans evaluate Chavez 's job performance as
being good to excellent , versus 25 % who evaluate it as being bad to terrible .

With the U.S. Government trying to shut down websites and stealing gold , I feel the need to discuss communications security , surveillance and anonymity as the U.S. collapses further into overt fascism .
I need to get this off my chest , once and for all , because people , who do n’t know much about computers , are being bombarded with nonsense , and they ’re bombarding me with nonsense as a result .
I want a single post that goes all the way , and this is it .
“ Have you heard about Tor ? ” I am routinely asked via clear text email .
Yes , I know about Tor , but we need to take a much closer look at what remaining anonymous online really requires .
First of all , since this is a long post , I do n’t want to waste your time .
If you ’re a computer expert or network engineer , etc. you will already know this stuff .
If , however , you ’re a casual computer user who does n’t know much about the underlying principles of information systems , this will be way over your head .
If you ’re a casual computer user who is thinking about anonymity online , this article might be useful for letting you know some more about what you do n’t know .
A lot of times , ignorant people refer to things they do n’t understand as “ tinfoil . ”
( The gatekeeper Left loves this term . )
What follows , however , is so far out that it seems like tinfoil even to me .
But then again , I have n’t been targeted by a death squad for my activities online , like some people are in many countries around the world .
So , is it tinfoil ?
For you , maybe .
For people struggling against repressive regimes , maybe not .
When I use the term “ tinfoil ” below , I ’m not making fun of you , I ’m making fun of myself , and the roles I ’ve had to play in corporate IT departments .
You do n’t know tinfoil unless you ’ve worked in a corporate IT department .
Corporate IT is a technocratic pyramid built on paranoia , surveillance and fiefdoms of specialized knowledge and privileges ( rights and permissions ) .
Since all modern fascist organizations are essentially the same , I hope that my grim experiences within these organizations will help you understand more about the nature of the dire situation that we ’re all facing .
If you think that you ’re thinking outside of the box , my main purpose in writing this is to inform you that there are actually boxes within boxes , and that if you plan on engaging an opponent as powerful as the American Corporate State ( or any other maniac fascist regime ) , it ’s not going to be easy .
I do n’t know how many boxes within boxes there are .
What I do know is that the U.S. Department of Defense built the underlying technologies that make the Internet possible .
They built “ this ” world .
So , you want to be anonymous in a world that was thought up by the U.S. Department of Defense ?
Most computer users do n’t have what it takes , in terms of technical skills , or discipline , to pull it off .
I ’m sorry if that sounds harsh , but it ’s absolutely true .
I ’m not claiming to be any kind of expert at all .
If knowledge of computers and networks represented all the grains of sand on a beach , I ’d say that I was familiar with about 5 of those grains of sand .
I would like to hear from people who know more than me about any flaws in this information .
A long time ago , as a sort of theoretical challenge to myself , I tried to define a reliable protocol for remaining anonymous online .
Why ?
Ask any nerd , “ Why ? ” and the nerd will usually respond : “ Why not ? ”
If the nerd is unusually honest , he or she might respond , “ Because I ca n’t help it . ”
So , somewhere between , “ Why not ? ” and “ Because I could n’t help it , ” I set out on this quest .
As you might already know , I studied information warfare in college and I did several years of time in corporate IT environments .
I knew about the types of surveillance and control that are possible at the client , server and network levels .
I looked at the challenge as all IT people look at all IT related challenges : Assume the absolute worst .
I went even further with this .
I made irrationally negative assumptions .
I assumed that everything I did online was compromised .
I assumed the worst tinfoil nightmares about commercial operating systems .
I assumed that my ISP was a subsidiary of the NSA , etc .
Got the idea ?
Let ’s look at each level in a bit more detail ( in no particular order ) :
Servers : Potential Honeypots
Many technologies that amateur anonymity fetishists are attracted to are actually designed to harvest information .
Put yourself in the shoes of the NSA .
If you wanted a concentrated haul of the most interesting information what would you do ?
You would establish a honeypot : a service ( free or paid ) that purported to provide an anonymous web browsing / email capability .
Who knows what people might get up to if they thought nobody was looking ?
That , of course , is the idea with honeypots .
If you ’re relying on a proxy server , how will you know that it ’s not simply recording your entire session for examination by acreages of the Homeland ’s supercomputers that are running advanced statistical Magic 8 Ball algorithms ?
Because the company or individual providing your proxy service says that they do n’t keep logs ?
HA
Am I saying that all proxies are run by the NSA .
No .
Am I saying that some number of them are .
I ’d bet my life on it .
How many of them are run by governments ?
I do n’t know .
Unless you know which governments are running which proxies , you must assume that all of them are compromised .
In reality , the NSA would probably be the least of your worries when using a proxy server or open base station .
Nerds with too much time on their hands get up to all kinds nonsense .
Do they set up anonymous proxy servers and open base stations just to see what people do with them ?
Yes .
Do criminals do it to find out personal information about you ?
Yes .
So even if the proxy or base station you ’re on is n’t run by the NSA , who is running it ?
And why ?
Maybe you ’re eLitE and use several proxies .
You can probably assume that the proxies are n’t colluding directly , but what about the networks ?
Which leads us to the next level …
Networks : If You Feel Like You ’re Being Watched , It ’s Because You Are
The network providers are keeping end to end records of every session .
The question is : Are the network providers colluding with the U.S. Government ?
Since you ca n’t assume that they ’re not , you must assume that they are .
I would assume that the U.S. Government has end to end coverage of every IP session that starts and ends on U.S. networks .
With corporate collusion and off the shelf hardware and software , this is n’t a stretch at all .
For non U.S. networks , the NSA gets in with multi billion dollar tools like the U.S.S. Jimmy Carter , and who knows what else …
There are dozens of off the shelf products that you would swear were designed for use by intelligence agencies , but they ’re routinely peddled to — and used by — corporations .
If corporations have and use these surveillance capabilities , what are the intelligence agencies running on the service providers ’ networks ?
I ’ll be buggered if I know , but I know it ’s not good .
That recent ATT / NSA thing is just a tiny / trivial tip of the iceberg .
Clients : NSA Side Projects ?
Microsoft and Apple sought assistance from the U.S. National Security Agency .
Evil Corporations Working with the NSA + Closed Source Binaries = Not Good .
What is that thing actually doing ?
I do n’t know .
Thank you .
That ’s all I need to know .
Countermeasures
Access the Internet Using an Open Wireless Network , Preferably from Great Distance
In terms of a threat assessment , for our purposes , I see the networks as posing the biggest problem .
People write to me all the time raving about the dreaded Google cookie .
HA .
“ We must use scroogle ! ” for freedom and safety , etc .
When I mention that their ISP is , most likely , keeping every URL that they visit in a database , at a minimum , and that NSA boxes are probably analyzing every FORM tagged submission , well , that ’s a hard lesson for people .
Go ahead , use scroogle .
Maybe the people running it are n’t evil .
So what .
Scroogle might make you feel good , but it has nothing to do with security or anonymity , not when you consider the capabilities of the enemy on the network .
Give any 14 year old hacker access to the right network switch and , unless you know what you ’re doing , he or she will use a packet sniffer to find out what you had for breakfast .
Now , the difference between most 14 year old hackers and the NSA is that the pimply faced kids do n’t have physical access to the network that would allow them to conduct man in the middle surveillance on you .
The NSA does .
Again , that NSA / ATT thing is fly fart level .
That ’s nothing .
That ’s just the piece of the program that got outed .
You need a false flag connection to the Internet .
In other words , access the Internet via someone else ’s open wireless router , preferably from great distance .
Lots of organizations , businesses and individuals provide free , wireless Internet access ; on purpose , believe it or not .
Ideally , you would use a cantenna or a high performance parabolic antenna to authoritatively distance yourself from any surveillance cameras that are likely saturating your local coffee shop or other business that provides free Internet access .
Hitting the base station from hundreds of meters away would be nice .
If you were to carry the paranoia to an extreme level , you would assume that They would show up at your access point and use direction finding equipment to spot your physical location .
“ Tinfoil ! ” you say ?
Keychain WiFi access point finders have had crude DF capabilities for years .
Then you have civilian grade WiFi network engineering stuff like the Yellow Jacket .
Direction finding is as old as the hills and trivial to do .
If you do happen to attract the wrong kind of attention on an anonymous base station , pinpointing your location would be a simple matter .
Solution ?
If you are playing this game as if your life is on the line , do n’t use the same open base station twice .
Hey , this post is going out to those of you who send me the paranoid emails .
You wanted to know , I ’m telling you !
I mean , it would suck to look toward your friendly anonymous WiFi provider with a pair of binoculars and see a guy in a suit looking back at you .
Hint : if you see a van with several antennas arranged in some geometric pattern on the roof , that would not be a positive development .
But that was 1980s era technology , the last time I dabbled with DF gear with a buddy of mine .
Here ’s a nice little integrated soup to nuts solution that is probably more like what They would be using .
Surf Away : Just Do n’t Do Anything That You Normally Do Online
All of the stuff that you do with your “ normal ” online persona , you know , online banking , checking email , discussion groups , etc :
You ca n’t do any of that .
The second you associate a user profile on a server with your behavior , you ’re back to square one .
The Matrix has you .
You would have to create what the intelligence business calls a “ legend ” for your new anonymous online life .
You may only access this persona using these extreme communications security protocols .
Obviously , you ca n’t create an agent X persona via your anonymous connection and then log into some site using that profile on your home cable modem connection .
To borrow another bit of jargon from the people who do this for real , full time , you must practice “ compartmentalization . ”
If you actually attract the wrong kind of attention on a server , OR a network , with your agent X persona , if you have n’t f@#$ %& up in some way , all roads will lead back to the open base station .
“ After connecting through the open WiFi network , should I also use an anonymous proxy ? ”
I would assume that even if the proxy is clean , and there is no way to know that it is , They will have that thing covered on the network , end to end .
Physical disassociation from the access point is the best proxy .
Client Side
Never write anything to disk .
Oh , you were n’t planning on using your Windows or MacOS laptop with all of those closed source binaries whirring away , were you ?
Man , I do n’t know where you got your tinfoil hat , but that thing is obviously defective .
You will have to learn about Live CD distributions of Linux .
You boot that thing .
Do your business .
Turn off the computer .
Nothing is written to the hard disk .
“ But I need to save my work ? ”
If you want to save your work , the easiest way of routinely handling encrypted workflow is to use an encrypted volume and a tool that only decrypts your data on the fly , in RAM .
The best tool I know of for handling encrypted volumes is TrueCrypt .
Hint : Use cascading encryption algorithms .
[ UPDATE : Is TrueCrypt a Honeypot ? ]
Do
They have some technology , in an underground hanger at Area 51 , that ’s capable of breaking one of those cascading crypto schemes ?
I do n’t know .
I doubt it , but anything is possible when infinite budgets are involved .
Hey , man , you wanted to save your work , right ?
That ’s the score when you ’ve got half a role of Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil around your head .
“ But I need to send email . ”
For our purposes here , I would n’t .
Email is locked down and heavily surveilled , partially because of the plague of spam , but read on …
I do n’t believe in web based email solutions that purport to provide strong encryption and / or anonymity .
Who knows what their applets and servers are doing ?
Not me .
And if they rely on SSL , well , that ’s ok for buying a book online , but no tinfoiler in his right mind would bet his life on SSL .
The Thunderbird / Enigmail / GPG solution is the best way to send and receive VERY secure email that I know of .
But will your agent x persona be able to deliver email via SMTP ?
I would n’t count on it .
And from which domain ?
Unless you are very naughty , you should n’t be allowed anonymous access to a SMPT server anyway .
You might have to go with a throw - away web based email account and then cut and paste your encrypted messages into that .
As a rule , however , never compose a message that you plan on encrypting in a web based form .
Some of them use technologies that transmit what you ’re typing over the web AS YOU TYPE .
This is so you do n’t lose what you typed if the session cuts out , but guess what ?
That ’s right , you just blew it .
Use open source tools that are running locally on your system to encrypt and decrypt messages .
An effective way of communicating with someone , outside of email , would be via newsgroup or bulletin board that allows anonymous posting .
( Note : If you try it here , I ’ll just delete it . )
You are , in effect , using the board as a numbers station .
You ’re not trying to hide the signal .
You assume that it will be intercepted .
You encrypt your message to the recipient , using his / her public key , and post the ciphertext to the board .
The recipient goes on there , copies the message and decrypts it .
I first encountered this in the mid 1990s on usenet .
Of course , the person on the other end needs to have the same level of discipline and paranoia as you for this to work properly .
Last but not least :
Make sure that you spoof your MAC address EVERY time you go online .
Funny story : I worked at a place that was locked down to the point that every MAC address was screened at the network level .
Say , for example , that someone brought in a personal laptop from home , even though there was no chance of being able to use the network for much ( domain sign on was required ) the switch would alert a sys admin indicating that an alien device was plugged into the network , along with the jack / cube / desk number .
MAC addresses are unique , and perfect for surveillance purposes .
Always spoof your MAC address when you ’re running in agent x mode .
Well , that ’s pretty much it .
( Actually , I ’m tired of typing . )
I did n’t say it was going to be easy , and you should watch out for people and products that make those claims .
Of course , evil people could use the above techniques to do evil things , and that is the argument that the government will use to convince you to submit to total surveillance of everything you do .
In case you ’re curious about how I get online : I use Windows XP on a five year old laptop , from home .
While I ’m running two firewalls , there ’s no onion routing , proxies , live CD operating systems and I do n’t bother with spoofing my MAC address .
If you use a bank that knows where you live , They know where you live .
Since I ’m forced to use such a bank , I do n’t bother with the rest .
The Matrix has me .
If you think being anonymous online is hard , try living without a bank account … .
Sorry , being homeless in a city park does n’t count .
Oh yeah , what about Tor …
HAHA .
Imagine my shock .
Via : tin0.de :
A group of 9
Tor routers also functioning overtly or indirectly as Tor exit nodes have been observed colluding on the public Tor network .
…
Due to the sheer amount of traffic apparently passing through this collusion network , consolidation and analysis of exit node traffic is only one of several forms of anonymity attacks made more feasible .
Hence these 9 routers appear to pose a significant anonymity threat to users of the public Tor network .

Mozilla Firefox - Referer Spoofing Using JavaScript
Summary
Versions of Mozilla Firefox prior to 2.0.0.10 are vulnerable to a race - condition when setting ' window.location ' values using JavaScript .
In some circumstances , the race - condition can be exploited to spoof referer headers .
Specially crafted iframe content can be used to perform cross -site request forgery ( CSRF ) against sites that accept GET requests and use referer checking for protection .
Attack Goal
The goal of the attack is to have an iframe pointed to one site and then cause the iframe to load a second location .
The first site 's location should become the referer header when requesting the second location 's content .
These locations could be on different sites , the same site or even the same page .
If this can be accomplished , the attack can be used to defeat simplistic cross - site request forgery ( CSRF ) protections that depend entirely on the referer header .
Background
In general , Firefox attempts to prevent an iframe 's parent from reading / writing content in the iframe 's browsing context once the the location is changed .
When an iframe location is updated , the iframe is submitted with a referer value of the parent 's location .
The parent 's access to the iframe content is lost once the location is changed , but the parent can continue to exert control over the iframe by changing its location or creating new content .
Additionally , if the iframe 's new location is set from within its own browsing context , the previous location becomes the referer header value .
There have been several past vulnerabilities related to iframes ( e.g. , Michal Zalewski 's IFRAME snatch , Bugzilla entries # 381300 and # 343168 ) .
These vulnerabilities show that there is a small window of time where the iframe context may be exposed .
Using ' setTimeout ' or ' setInterval ' to load the second location would seem like obvious candidates , but the timers are cancelled once the existing iframe page is unloaded .
But what if the timing approach is inverted ?
Instead of using a timer to load the second location , a timer is used to the load the first location in the background .
Then , once the first location is loaded , the current location is set to the desired site ( thus causing the first location to become the referer ) .
Normally this should be impossible , because the iframe should not have two browsing contexts at the same time .
But , if the user is presented with ' alert ' , ' confirm ' or ' prompt ' dialog and the original iframe 's context is persisted long enough for the first location to finish loading , the ' window.location ' can be set to the second request ; this second request will be submitted with a referer value of the first location .
Realizing the Attack
The following are two approaches to the attack :
Joke Method -
The iframe content is written as JavaScript that starts a timer to change the location to the desired referer .
The ' window.onload ' event is set to function that opens a ' confirm ' dialog and then sets the iframe location to the target .
If the first location loads before the ' confirm ' dialog is dismissed , the race is won and the referer header is set to the first location .
Winding Paths Technique -
The iframe content is set to HTML and JavaScript that uses a meta refresh to load the desired referer after one second .
A timer is set so that before the page refreshes , a function is fired that presents the user with an ' alert ' dialog ; once the ' alert ' is dismissed the iframe location is set to the target .
If the first location loads before the ' alert ' dialog is dismissed , the race is won and the referer header is set to the first location .
Attack Matrix
Which attacks work with what user agents ?
User Agent Joke Method Winding Paths Technique Mozilla /5.0 ( X11 ; U ; Linux i686 ( x86_64 ) ; en-US ; rv:1.8.1.9 ) Gecko/20071025 Firefox /2.0.0.9 Yes Yes Mozilla / 5.0 ( Macintosh ; U ; PPC Mac OS X Mach - O ; en-US ; rv:1.8.1.9 ) Gecko/20071025 Firefox /2.0.0.9 Yes Yes Mozilla / 5.0 ( Windows ; U ; Windows NT 5.1 ; en-US ; rv:1.8.1.9 ) Gecko/20071025 Firefox /2.0.0.9 Yes Yes Mozilla /5.0 ( X11 ; U ; Linux i686 ( x86_64 ) ; en-US ; rv:1.9a9 pre ) Gecko/2007110504 Minefield /3.0a9 pre No Yes Mozilla / 5.0 ( Macintosh ; U ; PPC Mac OS X Mach - O 10.4 ; en- US ; rv:1.9a9 pre ) Gecko/2007110504 Minefield /3.0a9 pre No Yes Mozilla / 5.0 ( Windows ; U ; Windows NT 5.1 ; en-US ; rv:1.9a9 pre ) Gecko/2007110505 Minefield /3.0a9 pre
No Yes
Notes
Only the GET request method seems to be affected .
There does not appear to be any mechanism to submit POST data .
If the user 's browser is configured to not submit Referer information ( e.g. , network.http.sendRefererHeader=0 ) , these attacks obviously do nothing .
The attack will fail if the user forcibly kills the browser , turns off her machine or severs her Internet connection before dismissing the dialog box .
The examples use dynamically generated iframe for demonstration purposes .
These attacks work equally as well for static pages or top level content ( e.g. , sample using meta refresh [ source ] ) .
Unfortunately , it is not as stealthy .
The meta refresh approach is most desirable , because the initial request is submitted without any referer information making the attack more difficult to detect .
These examples use intentionally goofy text .
A real attack would use more appropriate text .
Invoking the " Joke Method " twice in a row crashes MineField / 3.0a9 pre .

Imitation Samurai swords : Cheap on the internet
The Home Office has confirmed plans to outlaw the weapons in England and Wales after putting forward the idea earlier this year .
Home Office minister Vernon Coaker said there was a clear danger to the public posed by easily - available swords .
The proposal is expected to stop short of banning genuine Japanese swords held by collectors or genuine enthusiasts .
In March 2007 the Home Office proposed banning imitation Samurai swords after representations from both MPs and the public .
Ministers in Scotland had proposed a similar move in 2006 .
In the wrong hands , samurai swords are dangerous weapons
Vernon Coaker ,
Home Office minister
Defending the sword
Calls for a ban came after a number of high - profile incidents in which cheap Samurai - style swords had been used as a weapon .
The Home Office estimates there have been some 80 attacks in recent years involving Samurai - style blades , leading to at least five deaths .
While genuine Samurai swords are part of Japanese history and change hands for large sums of money , there is a trade in imitation blades which can be bought over the internet for as little as £ 35 .
Jail threat
Under the proposals , the government will ban the import , sale and hire of Samurai swords from April 2008 .
Anyone breaching the ban will face six months in jail and a £ 5,000 fine .
However , ministers say they have recognised there is a special case for exemptions for genuine collectors of the original weapons and acknowledge there is a legitimate role for the blades in some forms of martial arts .
Vernon Coaker said : " In the wrong hands , samurai swords are dangerous weapons - there have been a number of high profile , serious incidents involving samurai swords in England and Wales in recent years .
" It is therefore crucial that we take this action to tackle the menace of violent crime .
" We recognise it is the cheap , easily available samurai swords which are being used in crime and not the genuine , more expensive samurai swords which are of interest to collectors and martial arts enthusiasts . "
Thomas Roe : Jailed recently in Lincoln
In 2000 Andrew Pennington - an aide to former Liberal Democrat MP Nigel Jones - was murdered when Robert Ashman attacked both men at a constituency surgery in Cheltenham .
And at the beginning of December this year a Lincoln man was jailed after using a Samurai - style sword to murder a passer - by whom he thought had attempted to rape his wife .
The Association of Chief Police Officers has backed the Home office move saying that while the weapon is relatively uncommon , there is justification for a ban .
While genuine collectors such as museums will still be able to trade in the weapons , it remains unclear what measures will be put in place to prevent people from buying cheap blades via the internet , already considered a major marketplace for the swords .
This list was compiled by the co-editor of the Fortean Times , a Journal of Strange Phenomena , a monthly British magazine .
15 Bees who pay their respects
Margaret Bell , who kept bees in Leintwardine , about 7 miles from her home in Ludlow , Shropshire ( England ) , died in June 1994 .
Soon after her funeral , mourners were amazed to see hundreds of bees settle on the corner of the street opposite the house where she had lived for 26 years .
The bees stayed for an hour before buzzing off over the rooftops .
The local press ran a photograph of the bees hanging on the wall in a cluster .

14 Phantom Car Crash
Advertisement
On December 11 , 2002 , two motorists called police to report seeing a car veering off the A3 trunk road with headlights blazing at Burpham in Surrey .
A thorough search uncovered a car concealed in dense undergrowth and the long - dead driver nearby .
It turned out that the crash had actually happened five months earlier when the driver , Christopher Chandler , had been reported missing by his brother .
13 Enigmatic Earth Divot
Am irregular shaped hole , about 10 ft by 7ft with 2ft vertical sides , was found on a remote farm near Grand Coulee , Washington State , in October 1984 .
It had not been there a month earlier .
‘ Dribblings ’ of earth and stones led to a three - ton grass - covered earth divot 75 ft away .
It was almost as if the divot had been removed with a gigantic cookie cutter , except that roots dangled intact from the vertical side of both hold and slab .
There were no clues such as vehicle tracks and an earthquake was thought very unlikely .
12 Balloon Buddies
Laura Buxton released a helium filled balloon during celebrations for her grandparents ’ gold wedding anniversary in Blurton , Staffordshire , in June 2001 .
Attached to the balloon was her name and address and a note asking the finder to write back .
Ten days later she received a reply .
The balloon had been found by another Laura Buxton in the garden hedge of her home in Pewsey , Wiltshire , 140 miles away .
Both Lauras were ages 10 and both had three year old black Labradors , a guinea pig , and a rabbit .
11 Hum Misty for Me
A noise a bit like amplifier feedback had been heard for three years coming from the right ear of a Welsh pony called Misty , according to the Vetinary Record ( April 1995 ) .
It varied in intensity but stayed at a constant pitch of 7 kHz .
Hearing a buzzing in one ’s ears is called Subjective Tinnitus ; much rarer is when others can also hear the noise .
This is called Objective Tinnitus and the cause is still largely a matter of debate .
10 Whirlwind Children
A nine - year old Chinese girl was playing in Songjian near Shanghai , in July 1992 when she was carried off by a whirlwind and deposited unhurt in a treetop almost two miles away .
According to a wire report from May 1986 , a freak wind lifted up 13 children in the oasis of Hami in Western China and deposited them unharmed in sand dunes and scrub 12 miles away .
9 Riverside Mystery
Gloria Ramirez , 31 , died of Kidney failure at Riverside General Hospital , California , in February 1994 , after being rushed there with chest pains .
Emergency room staff were felled by ‘ fumes ’ when a blood sample was taken .
A strange oily sheen on the woman ’s skin and unexplained white crystals in her blood were reported .
A doctor suffered liver and lung damage , and bone necrosis .
At least 23 other people were affected .
One hypothesis was that Ramirez , who had had cervical cancer , had taken a cocktail of medicines that combined to make an insecticide ( organophospate ) but tests yielded no clue .
8 Boulders in Trees
In April 1997 , a turkey hunter in Yellowwood State Forest , Indiana , came upon a huge sandstone boulder wedged between three branches of an oak tree about 35 feet from the ground .
The arrow shaped rock was estimated to weight 500 lb .
Subsequently , four more large boulders were found wedged high up in trees elsewhere in the forest .
All were in remote areas .
None of the trees were damaged and there were no signs of heavy equipment begin used or of tornado damage and no one recalled any mishaps involving dynamite anywhere nearby .
7 Helpful Voices
While on holiday a woman , referred to by the British Medical Journal ( 1997 ) as AB , heard two voices in her head telling her to return home immediately .
Back in London the voices gave her an address that turned out to be a hospital ’s brain scan department .
The voices told her to ask for a scan as she had a brain tumour and her brain stem was inflamed .
Though she had no symptoms , a scan was eventually arranged and she did indeed have a tumour .
After an operation , AB heard the voices again : ‘ We are pleased to have helped you , ’ they said ‘ Good - bye . ’
AB made a full recovery .
6 La Mancha Negro
A Hazard unique to Venezuelan highways is a slippery goo called La Mancha Negra ( the black stain ) , although it is more of a sludge with the consistency of chewing gum .
Although the government has spent millions of dollars in research , no one knows what the goo is and where it comes from , or how to get rid of it .
It first appeared in 1987 on the road from Caracas to the airport , covering 50 yards , and spread inexorably every year .
By 1992 it was a major road hazard all around the capital and it was claimed 1,800 motorists had died after losing control .
The problem remains to this day .
5 Postcard Farewell
When Jim Wilson ’s father died in Natal , South Africa , in April 1967 , both Jim , living in England , and his sister Muriel , living in Holland , were informed .
Muriel contacted her husband who was on business in Portugal , and he flew to South Africa right away .
Changing planes at Las Palmas airport in the Canary Islands , he bought a postcard showing holidaymakers on Margate Beach , Natal , and sent it to Muriel .
It was she who noticed that the photograph showed her father walking up the beach .
4 Notecase from the Sky
In October 1975 Mrs Lynn Connolly was hanging washing in her garden in the Quadrant , Hull , when she felt a sharp tap on the top of her head .
It was caused by a small silver notecase , 63 mm by 36.5 mm , hinged , containing a used notepad with 13 sheets left .
It was marked with the initials ‘ SE ’ , ‘ C8 ’ , ‘ TB ’ ( or ‘ JB ’ ) and ‘ Klaipea ’ , a Lithuanian seaport .
No one claimed it at the police station , so it was returned to Mrs Connolly .
It seems likely it fell only a short distance but from where ?
If it had dropped from a plane , it would have given her more than a tap .
3 Fiery Persecution
The village of Canneto di Caronia on Sicily ’s north coast has been plagued by mysterious fires .
The trouble began on January 20 , 2004 , when a TV caught fire .
Then things in neighbourhood houses began to burn , including washing machines , mobile phones , mattresses , chairs and even the insulation on water pipes .
The electricity company cut off all power , as did the railway company , but the fires continued .
Experts of all kinds carried out tests , but no explanation was found .
The village was evacuated in February , but when people returned in March the fires resumed .
Police ruled out a pyromaniac after they saw wires bursting into flames .
2 Bovine Enigma
On June 28 , 2002 , in the middle of a spate of unexplained cattle mutilations in Argentina , something macabre was found in a field near suco , west of Rio Cuarto in San Luis province .
Nineteen cows were stuffed into a sheet metal water tank , closed with a conical cap .
Nine were drowned , the rest barely alive , having endured freezing temperatures , not to mention the shock of their lives .
1 Boy Turns into a Yam
Three pupils of the Evangelist Primary School in the northern Nigerian town of Maiduguri rushed into the headmistresses office in March 2000 and said that a fellow pupil had been transformed into a yam after accepting a sweet from a stranger .
The headmistress found the root tuber and took it to the police station for safe - keeping .
Following local radio reports , hundreds of people flocked to see the yam and police were hunting for the sweet - giver .
What happened next failed to reach the media .

In the Republican primary campaign for the 2008 presidential nomination , the big news for the last week or so has been that TV actor and former US Senator Fred Thompson has become the party 's 11th and most recent candidate for the nomination .
This delights the conservative wing of the party , for two reasons .
For one , at this point they'd be delighted if almost anybody jumped in , if it meant that there would be at least one plausible alternative to having to choose between McCain and Giuliani .
But the bigger reason is that something about Fred Thompson reminds them very much of their nominal figurehead , the former Republican politician that they practically worship as a god , Ronald Reagan .
They 're hoping that nominating a conservative Republican elderly Hollywood actor will bring back the " Reagan magic .
"
Now , leave aside just how " magic " the Reagan years really were n't .
It 's no secret that I despised Ronald Reagan for the treasonous Iran / Contra scandal and for the blot on this country 's economy and its soul that we call Reaganomics .
But that some people want those years back is n't news , is n't interesting enough for me to think about much , let alone write about .
No , the much more fascinating thing for me is that frankly , Republicans are deluding themselves if they think that there 's any way that Fred Thompson could step into Reagan 's shoes , that he could carry on Reagan 's legacy .
And I 'll tell you why : he just does n't have the necessary experience , and even more importantly , he just does n't have the skills .
Fred Thompson in 2008 is n't the Ronald Reagan of 1980 who swept the country , divided the Democratic Party , and built a national ruling coalition so durable that it took George W. Bush to dent it .
He 'sthe Ronald Reagan of 1952 .
And the Ronald Reagan of 1952 knew full well that he was n't even really qualified to be a big - name campaigner for real politicians , let alone to run for any serious office himself .
See , Reagan 's career did n't jump straight from Hollywood to politics , not as such .
There 's an important intermediate step in his biography .
And if there had n't been , nobody alive now would remember Ronald Reagan as anything other than a 2nd - tier or 3rd - tier character actor , because it was that job that gave him the skills that made him the famously Great Communicator .
If you consult any even halfway good biography of Reagan ( I'm partial to Smith & Gebbe'smyself ) , one of the first things they 'll tell you is that up until about 1949 , Ronald Reagan was , like almost everybody in America at that point , a Reform Democrat : that is to say , not interested in fringe candidates like the Republicans , but deeply anti-mafia and anti-communist , so someone who considered America 's most important political issues to be how to force the mafia out of politics and how to keep Russian - backed communists from taking over the Democrats .
But starting in 1949 under the influence of his about - to - be 2nd wife 's father , and then under the influence of his 1952 TV show 's sponsor the CEO of GE , Reagan became an increasingly committed convert to what my private school teachers summed up ( based on the title of a book popular with them ) as the " Clichés of Socialism " world view , the one that says that anything other than totally deregulated unrestricted free market capitalismcommunism , even if you dress it up in " liberal " clothes .
And as the star of GE 's anthology TV series , GE also used him to give a series of public relations speeches to civic groups all up and down the west coast , then across the southwest , about the evils of communism and the need for the US to ramp up the Cold War .
Frankly , they did n't expect much to come of it .
And at first , nothing much did .
But then he underwent this weird transformation .
He got tired of being stumped when people asked him questions after he gave The Speech that GE wrote for him .
So he set out to research the subjects of The Speech , and did it his own way .
He spent the next decade and a half clipping every article out ofthe Boy Scouts ' of America 's semi-official magazine , and out of He taped those articles to 5 " x7 " index cards , labeled them by topic , and spent night after night studying them until he could give an answer , cribbed mostly out ofbut an answer nonetheless , to almost every question that a middle class audience might ask him .
Since at the time that same middle class audience mostly readthemselves , his answers were n't anything they had n't heard already .
But that audience took this as confirmation , not least of which because Reagan brought theview of the world to vibrant life for his audiences .
The speeches became such a hit that GE started sending him out nationwide , at a hefty increase in salary , to spend day after day talking to any non-partisan civic organization that would have him .
And less because he'd been a minor and mediocre Hollywood actor than because it was a really , really entertaining speech , those groups lined up to hear it : PTA , police and firefighters ' charities , Rotary , Toastmasters , Optimists , Masons , Elks , Knights of Columbus , and of course hundreds of churches .
Taking his research fromgave Ronald Reagan something that Fred Thompson does n't have , something we did n't see again until Bill Clinton ran for office in 1992 .
Reagan could get up there and give a barn - burner of a speech that was absolutely strewn with warnings about what mistakes America was making and what was wrong with America , withoutdoubting either of two things : that he loved America nonetheless , and that he had absolute faith that the American people would fix these problems before they became serious .
And those two things are something that the American voters absolutely want to hear from their candidates .
Taking thatinspired speech out on to the road forbefore he made his own first run for office in 1967 gave him several other things that Fred Thompson does n't have , either .
At the top of the list was a level of name recognition not as an actor but as an expert on a critical political issue ( communism ) , the kind of recognition that Al Gore 's similar speech on global warming has given him on that topic .
But it also introduced Ronald Reagan to millions of people , and millions of people to Ronald Reagan , After fifteen years of standing face to face with small to medium groups of American people night after night , Reagan fell in love not just with America , not just withcapitalism , buteven with those who he disagreed with .
According to people who knew the man , even if he felt strongly enough about an issue to send the California state National Guard out to murder them for their politics ( as he did as governor in the dispute over People 's Park in Berkeley ) , it was in no way personal to him ; if he'd met those same protesters he had murdered that same morning in his office , he would have liked them as people , and weirdly , they probably would have liked him too .
And finally , by the end of a decade and a half of seriously researching and studying politicalafter a decade and a half of facing questions about those topics night after night until he'd heard every possible question , unlike Fred Thompson you could n't really stump Ronald Reagan with a question .
Whatever you asked him , he had an answer prepared .
You do n't get those things standing in front of TV cameras on a closed studio stage reciting a script a few lines at a time .
You do n't even get them running a single Senate campaign , and you sure do n't get them inside the mostly snobby elite millionaire 's club that is the US Senate .
I do n't even know where youget that experience any more , since most of the civic organizations that were so eager to book Ronald Reagan ( the semi- successful actor and not - yet politician ) for his famous speech on the evils of communism barely exist any more .
But one thing 's for sure : all of the things that made ReaganFred Thompson does n't have any of them .
From the NYT :
As religious conservatives gather in Washington this weekend for the “ Values Voters Summit , ” Senator Barack Obama ’s campaign announced its latest effort to attract people of faith to the campaign : a gospel concert tour .
All three of the dates of the “ Embrace the Change ” tour are in South Carolina , where Mr. Obama is locked in battle with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for black voters .
Gospel acts including Mary Mary , Donnie McClurkin and Hezekiah Walker , Byron Cage and the Mighty Clouds of Joy are scheduled to appear .
“ This is another example of how Barack Obama is defying conventional wisdom about how politics is done and giving new meaning to meeting people at the grassroots level , ” Joshua DuBois , the campaign ’s religious affairs director , said in a release .
One can generate a lot of heartburn thinking about all of the things that would be better about this country and the world if the Supreme Court had done the right thing and ruled for Al Gore instead of George W. Bush in 2000 .
Mr. Gore certainly has n’t let his disappointment stop him from putting the time since to very good use .
Yesterday , the Nobel committee celebrated that persistence and awarded the Peace Prize to Mr. Gore and a panel of United Nations scientists for their efforts to raise awareness of the clear and present danger of global warming .
The committee said that the former vice president “ is probably the single individual who has done most ” to create worldwide understanding of what needs to be done to halt the damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions .
It credited the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for creating “ an ever - broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming . ”
What the citation did n’t mention but needs to be said is that it should n’t have to be left to a private citizen — even one so well known as Mr. Gore — or a panel of scientists to raise that alarm or prove what is now clearly an undeniable link or champion solutions to a problem that endangers the entire planet .

Superman 's parents say they will still refer to him as 4Real
Pat and Sheena Wheaton have been frustrated by rules in New Zealand banning names that begin with a number .
Mum and Dad decided to call their son 4 Real after seeing an ultrasound image of him .
It was then they realised that their baby was " for real " .
They are considering legal action to force officials to reverse the ruling .
Name game
The name might sound more like a comedian 's catchphrase or a fruit juice , but the Wheatons were deadly serious .
Sadly for them , the authorities in New Zealand did not share their enthusiasm for the unusual - their choice was rejected by the country 's registrar of births , deaths and marriages .
The rules state that first names starting with a number are not allowed .
The law also advises parents to avoid names that could cause their child to be teased or made fun of .
Undeterred , the Wheatons now plan to call their newborn son Superman , but have said they will refer to him as 4 Real .
The baby 's family argues that if people can be known as John Williams III , for example , then why can a number not be used at the beginning of a name ?
Officials in New Zealand have been involved in similar disputes before .
In the past they have had to intervene to stop parents naming their offspring Satan and Adolf Hitler .

The passenger manifest for British South American Airlines ( BSAA ) flight CS - 59 might have made a perfect character list for a murder - mystery .
Aboard were two businessman friends touring South America on the lookout for trade opportunities : a fun-loving Swiss and a self - made English executive .
Also travelling were a Palestinian man who was rumoured to have a diamond stitched into his jacket , and a South American agent of the Dunlop tyre company who had once been the tutor to Prince Michael of Romania .
The oldest passenger was in her seventies , a widow of German extraction returning to her Chilean home after an inconvenient World War had unexpectedly extended her stay abroad .
And to add a whiff of espionage , a member of a select corps of British civil servants known as King ’s Messengers joined the flight , carrying a diplomatic bag bound for the UK embassy across the border .
The date was August 2nd , 1947 , and the flight was scheduled to depart from Buenos Aires , Argentina , bound for Santiago , Chile .
The intrepid voyagers were to fly in the Star Dust , a shiny Lancastrian aircraft derived from the legendary Avro Lancaster World War II bomber .
Its aircrew were ex-Royal Air Force to a chap , and the machine was captained by an experienced and decorated wartime flyer named Reginald Cook .
Traversing the Andes Mountains in atrocious winter weather was an undertaking that would demand all his knowledge and skills , yet the journey should have been well within the capabilities of both man and machine .
The dependable airliner could fly at speeds of 310 miles per hour and at altitudes of well over 20,000 feet⁠⁠— higher than most aircraft of the time and sufficient to clear the tallest peaks in the area .
Reginald Cook had been recruited to the airline from the elite RAF Bomber Command Pathfinder Force , and like all BSAA pilots had received additional navigational training .
The crew maintained Morse - code radio contact with the ground for the duration of the flight , and just before it was scheduled to arrive they signalled their approach .
But then a mysterious signal was received at Santiago airfield ⁠⁠ — comprising the letters “ S - T - E - N - D - E - C ” .
Aware of no such Morse abbreviation , the radioman at Santiago requested a repeat of the signal , and the same cryptic message was received twice more .
This inexplicable message was the last one received from flight CS - 59 ; it answered subsequent signals with silence , and it never arrived at its destination .
Mount Tupungato
An extensive aerial search was mounted , while the Chilean and Argentine armies combed the area on foot .
No trace of Star Dust was found .
For over fifty years the disappearance ranked as one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of the aviation world , and a lively and inventive mythology grew up around the incident .
The Lancastrian ’s vanishing act happened at a time of considerable political turmoil in South America .
Deteriorating Anglo - Argentine relations held intriguing implications for the contents of the diplomatic bag carried by the King ’s Messenger ; sabotage might have been a convenient way to ensure that it never arrived at its destination .
Furthermore , it was hard to ignore the presence of a German - born woman on the flight at a time when American and British authorities were becoming increasingly frustrated with Argentina ’s tendency to welcome Nazi criminals fleeing from war - torn Europe .
There were myriad ways a Palestinian connection could be worked into a decent conspiracy theory ⁠ — and no doubt the Romanian Royal family too⁠ — while the presence of businessmen on the flight raised the spectre of corporate skulduggery .
But the provoking possibilities of the passenger list were never reinforced by any definite facts .
The utter completeness of Star Dust ’s disappearance was so baffling that eventually even alien abduction was invoked ; the 1970s Spanish UFO magazine ‘ Stendek ’ was named in misspelled reference to this theory .
In the nearby Argentine countryside the story took on aspects of an old fashioned tall - tale , with many locals believing that somewhere in them - thar mountains was an aeroplane wreck from whose broken hold gold bullion spilled forth onto the rocky , frozen slopes .
More sober - headed individuals considered the possibility that the aircraft had simply over - flown Chile entirely and ditched in the Pacific Ocean .
In 1998 , two climbers spotted something out - of - place on the lower reaches of a glacier 15,000 feet up on Mount Tupungato , about fifty miles east of Santiago .
A piece of machinery was lying on the ice , engraved with the letters “ OLLS - ROYCE . ”
Lying around were strips of decidedly unfashionable pinstripe cloth , and mangled pieces of metal .
Although the site was remote and inaccessible , there had been previous visitors to the mountain in the last fifty years ⁠ — but no reports of any wreckage like this .
They mentioned the discovery on their return , and others quickly picked up on its significance .
Tantalized by the prospect of solving the Star Dust mystery , a joint military - civilian expedition of local mountaineers tried to re-visit the location the following year .
They were beaten back by a vicious ice storm , so it was n’t until January 2000 that the same team finally returned to the area .
Not long after arriving at the base of Tupungato glacier , Sergeant Cardozo of the Argentine Army , and civilian climber Alejo Moiso , dropped to their knees in prayer .
They had found the evidence they were looking for : aircraft debris and body parts , gruesomely altered by years of exposure to the cold and grinding ice .
Soon they found identifiable wreckage , such as the Rolls - Royce engine and an Avro propeller , and they realized that this was indeed Star Dust ’s final resting place .
The story excited great interest in Argentina , Britain , and across the world .
In the ensuing weeks a much larger expedition was mounted by the Argentine Army with the aim of further documenting the discovery and recovering the human remains .
Myriad journalists and a team of BBC documentary makers went in tow .
Argentina ’s Air Force - led Air Accident Investigation Board also became involved⁠ — in a move smacking of inter-service rivalry , they visited the crash site by helicopter just before the Army team arrived on foot .
The resulting investigations soon began to provide important pieces of the puzzle , and for the first time a reasonable account emerged of Star Dust ’s last hours .
Heading for the seemingly impenetrable barrier of the Andes on a westbound track , Reginald Cook would have seen poor weather ahead .
Confident in his machine , he would have climbed to near the aircraft ’s limit of 24,000 feet to get above both cloud and mountain peaks .
As the unpressurized aircraft gained altitude , Star Dust ’s single flight attendant , ‘ Stargirl ’ Iris Evans , would have demonstrated the use of the cabin ’s oxygen tubes to the varied passengers .
With no fixed ground - based navigational beacons in the area , and of course no satellite navigation , the aircrew relied on compass , stopwatch and forecast wind speeds ( ‘ dead - reckoning ’ ) to estimate their position .
Experienced airmen like ex-Pathfinder
Cook were capable of impressive feats of navigation using these crude tools , even while out of sight of the ground .
Presumably , after droning above the dense blanket of cloud for several hours , Cook ’s calculations told him that they had cleared the Andes and were nearing their destination .
He started a gentle descent .
The aircraft ’s radio operator indicated their imminent arrival at Santiago , estimated at four minutes , and tapped out the mysterious letters ‘ STENDEC ’ .
Santiago ’s radioman had no reason to question Star Dust ’s position , although the meaning of the final signal perplexed him in spite of two clear repetitions .
A good fifty miles from the airfield , Star Dust crashed into the sheer upper section of Tupungato glacier , killing the passengers and crew instantly .
The impact of the collision shook the mountainside , loosening a mighty mound of snow which developed into an avalanche that swallowed the wreckage whole .
Hidden from the gaze of the subsequent searchers , snowfalls in the coming years buried the debris further until eventually Star Dust became part of the glacier , entombed in ice and moving inexorably down the mountain towards warmer air .
With ponderous inevitability , the remains of the Lancastrian and its occupants slowly migrated through the ice over several decades , finally emerging from the glacier ’s melt zone 51 years later .
Old weather charts suggest the most likely cause for Reginald Cook ’s colossal navigational error : they show that at the time of the flight , conditions over that part of South America were perfect for the formation of a high - speed , high - altitude wind known to modern meteorologists as a jet stream .
Jet streams are relatively narrow ‘ rivers ’ of fast - flowing air which meander across the globe in both hemispheres at high altitudes , and it seems that Cook and his crew unwittingly discovered this phenomenon during their ill - fated flight .
Height and speed can vary but the direction is fixed by the Coriolis effect which is caused by the Earth ’s rotation .
The jet stream over the Andes in August 1947 was blowing west - to - east , at a speed of up to 200 mph .
At 24,000 feet , Star Dust would have just penetrated its lower reaches .
Cook would have been totally unaware of this huge headwind ; with the plane ’s ground speed slowed down to a pitiful crawl , flight CS - 59 had not even crested the Andes , let alone got near its destination , at the time of its ‘ dead - reckoned ’ arrival at Santiago .
During the war there were inklings of this meteorological phenomenon .
In Europe high - flying Allied aircraft had occasionally come across inexplicable high - velocity winds , while in the Pacific theatre the effect was better recognized , with the USAAF ’s early efforts to bomb Japan at altitude being foiled by bafflingly brisk west - to - east breezes .
The Japanese themselves made use of those self - same air streams for their little - known balloon - bombing campaign of the American mainland .
But it was to take over a decade for these observations to be drawn together into a coherent theory , capable of successfully predicting the location and characteristics of these powerful globe - spanning forces .
To Captain Reginald Cook and the other occupants of Star Dust , this exotic ‘ jet stream ’ would have been hardly more feasible than spotting a UFO .
It seems that the diverse backgrounds of the passengers on that fateful flight were simply a reflection of South America ’s turbulent post - war era , and nothing more .
Yet there is one final mystery to keep the conspiracy theorists entertained .
Despite numerous conjectures , the meaning of the final ‘ STENDEC ’ transmission has never been satisfactorily explained .
And although the aforementioned account is the most scientifically plausible explanation , nobody knows for certain what happened that cold August afternoon .
Star Dust ’s emergence from the belly of a glacier was unexpected to say the least⁠ — yet some of its secrets are likely to remain buried forever .
Here we go again .
Because " the continuing and immediate threat " of " grave acts of terrorism or threats of terrorism " constitutes " an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security , foreign policy and economy of the United States , " the Bush - Cheney administration intends to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guards a " person " [ as defined by Executive Order 13224 ] who assists , sponsors , provides financial , material or technological support or other services to " terrorists . "
Listing the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group would set in motion a series of automatic sanctions that would make it easier for the United States to block financial accounts and other assets the Guards control .
Why now ?
Perhaps because the National Council of Resistance [ itself already designated a terrorist organization ] recently listed Revolutionary Guards assets , charging that they are , inter alia , " supervising "  though the Center for New Defense Preparedness and Technology , the Headquarters for New Warfare , and the Nuclear Research Division of Imam Hussein University  an Iranian nuclear weapons program .
Now , there is an intense struggle going on within the Bush - Cheney administration how best to ostensibly deprive Iran of its " inalienable " right  recognized in the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and in the enabling statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency  to the peaceful use without discrimination of nuclear energy .
The Cheney Cabal wants ostensibly to deprive Iran of its inalienable rights by an act of war : bombing the geewhiz out of every activity or facility that could conceivably be associated with Irans nuclear program , peaceful or otherwise .
Condi and her munchkins want ostensibly to deprive Iran of its inalienable rights by what only amounts to an act of war  imposing and enforcing crushing economic sanctions on every " person " or activity that could conceivably be associated with any of Irans energy programs , including the proposed Iran - Pakistan - India gas pipeline .
Of course , that s not what either cabal  or a seemingly large majority of our Congresspersons  really wants .
What they all really want  for myriad self - serving reasons  is " regime change " in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
So , why pick on the Revolutionary Guards ?
Well , from December , 2003 , until recently , Iran had been voluntarily adhering to an [ as yet ] unratified Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement .
The original agreement  required of Iran by the NPT , and in force since 1974  was for the " exclusive " purpose of enabling the IAEA to " verify " that no NPT proscribed materials were diverted from a peaceful to a military purpose .
That agreement does not require Iran to even " declare " a facility or activity until 90 - days before NPT - proscribed materials are expected to be introduced .
However , under the Additional Protocol , had it been in force , the Iranians would had to have " declared " their intentions to the IAEA as soon as the decision was made to make a procurement , undertake an activity or construct a facility .
Hence , for more than three years , Iran voluntarily provided ElBaradei all the information still in Irans files , including information on all past procurement activities , going back two decades .
Documentation that Iran had been under no obligation to provide the IAEA at the time , much less obligated to preserve for later inspection by the IAEA .
Nevertheless , as best ElBaradei can determine after more than three years of go - anywhere see - anything inspections , Iran is not now , nor has it ever been , in violation of the NPT .
Now , ElBaradei still has some questions in his own mind about some documents in the Iranian files  and perhaps about some documents that werent .
For example , the Iranians allowed the IAEA to place under seal a brochure found in their files which included , 5 - 6 pages illustrating the casting of hemispherical shells of uranium .
The Iranians claim that someone just gave the brochure to them and never did anything with it except put in their files .
And there is no evidence to the contrary .
Then there were the blueprints the IAEA didnt find .
According to James Risen , in February 2000 , the CIA sent a Russian defector to IAEA headquarters in Vienna , with instructions to give the Iranian delegate authentic " top secret " blueprints for the TBA 480 High - Voltage block , a part of the fire set of an authentic Russian - designed nuclear weapon .
Now , the IAEA found not only blueprints for fire - sets in Iraq in 1991 , but evidence the Iraqis had built and tested prototypes .
The Iraqis claimed they got the know - how from the open literature .
But the IAEA didnt find the 2000 CIA " plant " in Irans files .
Then there was the " smoking laptop . "
According to Dafna Linzer , the CIA had obtained in 2004 a " stolen " laptop computer which allegedly belonged to an Iranian engineer .
It contained mostly engineering notes about the development and testing of ballistic missiles , virtually all of it in English .
In mid-2005 , the CIA briefed the IAEA on the laptops contents , which included this ;
“ In the spring of 2001 , a small design firm opened shop on the outskirts of Tehran to begin work for what appears to have been its only client  the Iranian Republican Guard .
Over the next two years , the staff at Kimeya Madon completed a set of technical drawings for a small uranium - conversion facility , according to four officials who reviewed the documents .
ElBaradei was not impressed .
But , under heavy pressure , he did have his deputy confront the Iranians with this CIA " intelligence " in January , 2006 .
Iran ’s representative to the IAEA , Ali Asghar Soltanieh , dismissed the laptop documents as “ fabricated information , ” especially the " intelligence " that the Republican Guards had secretly been attempting to design a uranium - conversion facility .
You see , Iran had been producing uranium - tetrafluoride  “ green salt ”  at the uranium conversion facility at Esfahan for years , subject to IAEA Safeguards , of course .
“ We are not hiding it .
We make tons of it . "
Earlier this year , IAEA officials complained about the quality of " intelligence " they had been provided over the years , by the CIA , NCR , etc. about Irans nuclear programs .
Quoth a " senior diplomat " at the IAEA , " Since 2002 , pretty much all the intelligence that s come to us has proved to be wrong . "
Of course , that criticism by the IAEA wont prevent the Cheney Cabal effecting regime - change in Iran .
It certainly didnt stop their effecting regime - change in Iraq .
Ronnie Naulls never saw it coming .
The church - going businessman , husband , and father of three young girls knew he was taking a risk when he opened a medical marijuana dispensary in Corona , a suburban community in the high desert of Riverside County east of Los Angeles .
Although he had played by the rules , obeyed all state laws , and successfully battled the city in court to stay open , Naulls knew there was a chance of trouble with law enforcement .
He knew there was a chance of the federal DEA coming down on him , as it has done with at least 40 other dispensaries this year alone .
Naulls family ( courtesy green-aid.com )
But when they did come down on him , it was far worse than he ever imagined .
At 6:00 am on July 17 , the quiet of Naulls ' suburban neighborhood was disrupted by the whir of hovering helicopters as heavily armed DEA agents stormed his home and collective .
They seized cash and marijuana , they seized his property , they seized his personal and business bank accounts .
They arrested him on federal marijuana charges .
But that was n't enough for the DEA .
The raiders also called Child Protective Services ( CPS ) .
With Naulls already hustled off to jail , his wife sitting handcuffed in a police car , and his home in a shambles after being tossed by the DEA , CPS social workers said his three children were endangered and seized them .
Naulls and his wife were also charged with felony child endangerment .
The three girls -- ages 1 , 3 , and 5 -- were held in protective foster care , with Naulls and his wife only able to see them during a one - hour supervised visit a week .
" My oldest girl thought she was being punished for doing something wrong , " he said .
" When we went to visit her , she said , ' Daddy , we 're ready to come home now , we promise to be good . ' "
But the Naulls could n't tell their children the only thing that would comfort them -- that they would be coming home soon .
That would violate CPS regulations because it might not be true .
In fact , it took five weeks of hearings and heartache before a family court judge decided the children would indeed be safe with their parents .
But the child endangerment charges still stand .
" I was numb , totally flabbergasted , outraged , and left speechless , " said Naulls .
" They told my wife we were endangering the kids because of the medicine we had in the house , but we only had some in a refrigerator in the garage that has an alarmed door and my own medicine in a locked container in my office -- the DEA broke that lock .
Would they treat us that way if it had been prescription Xanax ? "
The DEA was not apologetic about its handiwork .
A DEA spokesman confirmed that its people had called CPS .
" Any time we do an operation where children are present , we have a responsibility to call CPS , " said Special Agent Jose Martinez .
" But we do n't make the decision about whether the children are endangered . "
While it would not discuss particulars of the Naulls case , the Children 's Services Division of the Riverside County Department of Public Social Services , of which CPS is a part , denies that medical marijuana use or presence is a reason for removal of children on the filing of endangerment charges .
" Drugs alone does not constitute a reason for removal , " said Susan Lowe , director of the division .
" More relevantly , the issue of medical marijuana does not constitute a reason for us to remove children .
There have to be other issues present that indicate neglect or abuse . "
That claim brought a sharp response from Oakland - based attorney James Anthony , who represented Naulls on land use issues related to his dispensary .
While he supported Lowe 's statement of the Riverside County CPS policy , he said it did n’t reflect reality in the county .
" As a medical cannabis activist attorney and friend of the Naulls family , I would say that is very good news and seems to reflect a change of position -- or a position held at the top that has not filtered down yet to the working staff of CPS , " said Anthony .
" Riverside County CPS has an alarming reputation as quick to take children out of medical cannabis households and to press endangerment charges , " he said .
" The position the director laid out is exactly as it should be : medical cannabis is no more relevant to the best interests of children than any prescription drug -- the California Supreme Court said as much when it said that medical cannabis is as legal as any prescription drug , " Anthony pointed out .
" In the Naulls case , " Anthony continued , " what does the agency allege is the ' neglect or abuse ' ?
Two loving parents ?
A nice middle - class home ?
Parents who care enough to avail themselves of legal , harmless , medicine to keep themselves well ?
The only abuse I 'm aware of at the Naulls home was the abuse done by federal law enforcement when they invaded that home without warning and heavily armed -- terrorizing those poor children for no reason at all .
The DEA could have called me and I would have advised my client to turn himself in -- it 's not like he was hiding .
If CPS wants to charge someone with child abuse , they should start with the DEA .
Under their own standards as described here , there is no basis to prosecute Anisha Naulls for anything . "
If there is any child abuse involved , it is coming from the state , agreed Richard Wexler , executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform , a group concerned with abuses of the child protection system .
" What has been done to these children is government - sanctioned child abuse , " Wexler said .
" Whether one believes what Mr. Naulls did is legal or not , there is not a shred of evidence that running a medical marijuana co-op harms children -- and overwhelming evidence that foster care does children enormous harm , " he said .
" The act of removal from everyone loving and familiar can traumatize a child for life , and the younger the child , the greater the likelihood for such harm , " Wexler continued .
" For a young enough child it 's an experience akin to a kidnapping .
Children often believe that they have done something terribly wrong and now they are being punished .
That 's reflected in one child telling her father ' Daddy , we 're ready to come home now ; we promise to be good . '
All that harm occurs even when the foster home is a good one .
The majority are .
But several studies suggest that at least one in three foster children is abused in foster care .
So these children have gone from a situation where they clearly were not abused , into foster care , where the odds are at least one in three that they will be abused , " Wexler said .
" I warn all my dispensary clients that the federal government will try to capture and imprison you , but it had n't occurred to me that the government will also kidnap your children , " said Anthony .
" It 's just unbelievable , barbaric . "
Anthony also works with Green Aid , a group originally set up to support Ed Rosenthal 's legal battles with the feds in Northern California .
Green
Aid has set up a Naulls Family Defense Fund to aid the now impoverished family in its effort to stay together and out of prison .
Sadly , the Naulls are not alone .
Veteran activists say child removals by CPS or the loss of custody battles in California family courts because of medical marijuana are not uncommon and becoming more frequent .
" Medical cannabis patients and providers getting their kids taken away is , unfortunately not new , " said Angel McLary Raich , who won the first medical cannabis custody case in California in the wake of Proposition 215 .
Despite a variety of debilitating and life - threatening conditions , Raich and her patient outreach group Angel Wings , have since become a resource for other medical cannabis community members facing either the child protection bureaucracy or the vicissitudes of family court in child custody cases .
Raich , who is probably best known as the plaintiff in the Supreme Court 's medical marijuana case , Raich v. Ashcroft , said involvement with medical cannabis as a factor in either child custody or abuse or endangerment cases is a recurring problem .
" I know of many cases where the kids have been taken away permanently , others where they have to have supervised visitation . "
" We think this kind of thing is horrible , " said Noah Mamber , legal coordinator for Americans for Safe Access ( ASA ) , the medical marijuana defense group .
" Even as we are making progress on the criminal front , with the cops becoming better educated , as well as other areas like employment and housing , as the legal intake person for ASA I find myself taking many , many calls where medical cannabis is an issue for CPS or in family court .
I 've probably had 30 or 40 in the last couple of years , and those are just the people who call us . "
That means there is work to do , activists said .
Some are undertaking an educational process with the family courts and CPS , while others are looking to the legislature for relief .
" No one seems to understand medical marijuana in this context , " said Mamber .
" There seems to be an unfortunate bias in CPS workers and family court judges .
There are cases where there are no other issues except medical marijuana , and they will force them to quit taking their medicine if they want their kids .
It is absolutely true that there are cases where patient parents are being treated unfairly by CPS and the family court system . "
" An educational process for the courts and agencies is definitely needed , " said Anthony .
" They can act with the best of intentions , yet wield an incredibly devastating impact on families because of their lack of knowledge . "
Raich pioneered such educational work in Alameda County .
The work continues , she said .
" I 'm working on training law enforcement and dealing with CPS and family court , " she said .
" That 's my real passion .
I cannot tolerate watching other people lose their kids over this stuff .
It is just so wrong . "
If anyone is having problems with CPS or family court over medical marijuana issues , call her , Raich said .
Her number is in the Oakland phone book and contact information is on her web site .
ASA is working to even the playing field for patients through legislative action , Mamber said .
" As it is now , family courts and CPS do n't seem to be aware of Prop. 215 and Senate Bill 420 , so we need legislation to guide them .
We have drafted a bill that would amend the child protection law so that the medical marijuana status of a parent cannot be the sole basis for removal of a child , " he explained .
" They need to quit forcing patients to stop taking their medicine .
This measure wo n't stop CPS from doing its job , but it will stop it from persecuting medical marijuana patients . "
All that is going to take time .
In the meantime , said Raich , medical marijuana patients or providers with children need to play it extremely safe .
" Make sure you 're being a good parent , " she said .
" Make sure your cannabis is out of reach of the children , make sure your house is clean , there are no hazards , always plenty of milk and formula on hand .
Do n't grow in the house , do n't dry in the house , do n't have more pot than food in the refrigerator .
Take a parenting class .
Know what you need to do .
And if the cops come to the door , do n't let them in without a warrant . "
As for Ronald Naulls , he 's still a bit shell - shocked .
" I 'm a businessman and a network engineer .
I do n't have a criminal record and I do n't want to go to jail .
I do n't want to have to fight the state to keep my daughters .
I 'm praying for God 's love , and I ask everyone to pray for me .
But this is more than just about me , this is a fight for the patients and for my family . "
I was reading a story about Iraqi insurgents , and how they often wear ski masks to avoid identification .
This made me wonder , who was the genius entrepreneur who decided to sell ski masks in the desert ?
Man , talk about your “ outside the box ” thinking .
Be honest , how many of you , at the start of the Iraq war , thought “ They ’re going to need a lot of ski gear ” ?
Any time there ’s some huge disaster , my first thought is “ How could I make a fortune off of this ? ”
It ’s more of a thought - hobby than a financial strategy .
I just like thinking about it .
[ At this point , about 30 % of my readers are considering leaving a comment about buying land 100 miles inland and waiting for global warming to turn it into beachfront property .
I ’m saying it first so you do n’t have to . ]
I ’d love to see a web site that tells you what companies to invest in depending on what events you believe will happen in the future .
The web site would provide an ever - growing list of potential future happenings matched with companies that would prosper in those events .
I ’d enjoy watching the news a lot more if I had money riding on every sort of outcome .
For example , I ’d like to know which companies will prosper when Mitt Romney becomes president .
We usually elect the tall guy with the best hair regardless of his experience or policies .
No one ever went broke underestimating the thoughtfulness of the American public .
I ’d like to put some money on that .
I also think the Iraqi civil war will be resolved relatively quickly once America pulls its forces back to protected bases .
I make this prediction because the common wisdom is exactly the opposite .
When was the last time the majority of Americans predicted world events correctly ?
If you ask me whether the stock price of some particular company will increase faster than the S&P 500 , my answer is always “ Uh. . . beats the shit out of me . ”
But if you ask me whether my fellow Americans will make uninformed and irrational decisions , I ’m willing to put some money behind that .
Since the Democratic candidates all said last night that “ the right to privacy ” is a paramount concern of each and every one of them , I ’m sure we ’ll see those same candidates all over this story .
Ha !
Made myself laugh .
Anyway , the Seattle PI has done some great reports on Boeing including whistle - blowers who have felt the full wrath of Boeing .
The latest is a report on spying efforts on employees including reading personal emails and videotaping employees outside of the office .
Part of the problem in Washington is that there are few laws available that protect employees and whistle - blowers .
Within its bowels , The Boeing Co. holds volumes of proprietary information deemed so valuable that the company has entire teams dedicated to making sure that private information stays private .
One such team , dubbed “ enterprise ” investigators , has permission to read the private e-mails of employees , follow them and collect video footage or photos of them .
Investigators can also secretly watch employee computer screens in real time and reproduce every keystroke a worker makes , the Seattle P - I has learned .
Companies have a full right to protect corporate information though this is going much too far .
It also raises the interesting dynamics of the so - called “ Millennials ” as 60 Minutes are others are calling them .
Considering what the incoming generation has witnessed in their own households , is it any wonder they are telling the corporate world that the old rules simply do n’t work for them ?
The Baby Boomers are so full of sour grapes with the young crowd who are demanding balance between work and their personal life and why not ?
If this is the best the corporate world can deliver , why should this new generation knock themselves out ?
Hats off to the Millennials and their attitudes and more power to them .
Last month , Swedish security specialist Dan Egerstad exposed the passwords and login information for 100 e-mail accounts on embassy and government servers .
In a blog entry today , Egerstad disclosed his methodology .
He collected the information by running a specialized packet sniffer on five
Tor exit nodes operated by his organization , Deranged Security .
Tor is an onion routing service that facilitates anonymous Internet communication .
Originally developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory and formerly funded by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , Tor is designed to protect users from traffic analysis and other kinds of network surveillance .
It works by relaying connections through a series of distributed network servers .
When a Tor user visits a web site , the IP address detected and logged by that site will be the IP address of one of the Tor nodes rather than the actual user .
This makes it possible for users to obscure their identity under certain circumstances .
Unfortunately , many
Tor users do not realize that all of their network traffic is being exposed to Tor exit nodes .
Tor users who do not use encryption are broadly exposing themselves to identity theft .
Egerstad was originally doing a study on e-mail encryption , but during the course of the research project , he decided to create the packet sniffer and expose sensitive e-mail login data in order to increase awareness of the fact that Tor exposes sensitive information when not used with encryption .
Egerstad believed that privately disclosing his findings to the organizations whose passwords he obtained would not convince them to change their practices .
He also knew that it was only a matter of time before others with malicious intent would perform the same kind of experiment , so he felt that broad public disclosure was the only way he could generate enough attention to force people to think about the problem .
" Experience tells me that even if I would contact everyone on this list most are not going to listen , " Egerstad wrote when he released the login information last month .
" So f*** it !
Here is everything you need to read classified email and f*** up some serious International business .
Hopefully this will put light on the security problems that are never talked about and get at least this fixed with a speed that you never seen your government work before .
As a Swedish citizen I can't give this information to anyone without getting into trouble , so instead I 'm giving it to everyone . "
After publicly releasing the information , Egerstad 's site was taken down at the request of US law enforcement officials .
After it was brought back earlier this week , Egerstad expressed frustration and pointed out that the information was already spreading across the Internet .
Taking down Egerstad 's site only served to silence his message about security and did not prevent dissemination of the sensitive data .
" I 've seen people saying that the US would be angry now that we forced foreign countries to tighten their security so NSA or whatever can't read their secrets any longer .
To me it sounds like bulls *** taken out of a bad book but after this silly little stunt I 'm reconsidering .
Is there any reason you DO NOT want people to secure their systems ? " asked Egerstad .
According to Egerstad , the information disclosed is only a fraction of what he collected .
He continues to argue that the responsibility for exposing the login information rests on the organizations that failed to use encryption and that he simply drew attention to information that was essentially already public .
" ToR is n't the problem , just use it for what it 's made for , " Egerstad notes .
" [ The system administrators for the organizations whose passwords were exposed ] are responsible for giving away their own countries secrets to foreigners .
I can't call it a mistake , this is pure stupidity and not forgivable ! "
Egerstad also points out that very little is known about the intentions and activity of other Tor exit node operators , some of whom are already known to be associated with malicious hacker groups and foreign governments .
New Yorkers know Rudy Giuliani .
And to a certain extent , they 're astounded that Rudy is doing as well as he is ( as others have noted ) :
Stephen DiBrienza , a former New York City Councilman , captured it best in a New Yorker magazine piece this summer about Giuliani : " All the things that a lot of New Yorkers , myself included , hate about this guy are the things that are actually fueling his campaign . "
They know he 's a hypocrite when it comes to his real record , which includes budget sleight of hand , expansion of SCHIP ( while he runs against it now ) , and 9/11 mistakes that cost lives , such as screwing up the radios that the firemen used as well as putting the emergency command center in WT7 ( once attacked already ) despite the advice of his emergency managers .
Why did he do that ?
Because it was convenient for Rudy to walk there from City Hall .
Here 's Niall Stanage from July ' 07 :
When it comes to one - sentence takedowns of pompous politicians , columnist Jimmy Breslin 's famous description of Rudy Giuliani is perfect : " A small man in search of a balcony . "
Those eight words precisely capture Giuliani 's noxious blend of authoritarianism , egotism and vainglory .
New Yorkers have long been familiar with his unpleasant traits .
But the rest of the US is taking longer to see the reality behind the mask of " America 's mayor . " ...
It is one thing to hear arguments as to why Giuliani may have made bad choices .
It is quite another to hear Rosaleen Tallon , the sister of a fire fighter murdered on 9/11 , say with real loathing of Giuliani : " Whenever I hear him talk , I want to scream out to the world and say , ' God , he is so full of it . "
Also convenient for Rudy , of course , was using obscure city agencies to hide that he was having a love tryst with Judith Nathan on the taxpayer 's dime .
And what 's not surprising to New Yorkers is Rudy lashing out at The Politico , calling it a ' hit job ' by the reporter who got the scoop on Rudy 's hiding of the costs .
We know that Rudy .
You can hear him in this Oliver Willis archive attacking a ferret owner for disagreeing with him .
You can see it in this description by Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden of Rudy 's vindictiveness .
Bob Herbert ( column , April 27 ) ably demonstrates how Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani uses his budget ax to punish his critics inside government .
The fiscal gouging that the office of Alan G. Hevesi , the city comptroller , received in the executive budget is just one example of how the mayor has tried to harm public officials who disagree with him .
The mayor also cut city financing to the Brooklyn borough president 's office by $ 300,000 .
Of New York City 's five borough presidents , I am the only one to suffer such a financing decrease , which punishes the 2.5 million people of Brooklyn .
Mr. Giuliani's maneuvering came only after I opposed both his ill - advised waste - transfer station plans for our city 's garbage and his efforts to use public parkland for private sports teams without required community review .

Does Rudy 's denial end the story ?
No way .
From TPM :
ABC 's got a further run-down on the latest on the Shag Fund .
One nice detail .
They had a conversation with NYC Comptroller Bill Thompson , the first guy to stumble across Rudy 's book keeping shenanigans .
In response to Rudy 's claims that the whole thing was business as usual -- " handled openly , honestly " -- Thompson told ABC : " That 's not the way that we operate these days , and it would not be the preferred way of doing business .
In the end , it 's a very convoluted way of getting things done .
If anyone hoped that no one would notice , they were being foolish . "
From Ben Smith at The Politico :
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and his senior aides Thursday blamed anonymous bookkeepers for his administration 's practice of billing the travel expenses for his personal security detail to obscure city agencies .
But a top aide was unable to say why Giuliani ’s administration and his successor 's rebuffed questions from the city 's top fiscal watchdog in 2001 and 2002 .
City Comptroller William Thompson said Thursday his auditors were " stonewalled " by the Giuliani administration when they inquired about the unusual billing procedures , which he called " disturbing . "
More from Politico ( via E&P ) :
Politico editor - in- chief John F. Harris said in a statement : " This was a fair and carefully reported story .
We gave the Giuliani campaign ample opportunity to dispute the story or comment on our reporting before publishing and they did not do so .
Since the story ran , we have not heard from the campaign disputing any substantive aspect of the story . "
And , of course , ( via TPM ) it turns out that Rudy was providing Judi with taxpayer protection even as he cut back protection for his estranged wife Donna Hanover .
( There 's even a report from ABC that the NYPD was used as a taxi service ) .
This , combined with Politico 's story , reveals just how expensive Rudy 's extramarital trysts really were to New Yorkers -- and adds plausibility to the Politico 's suggestion that tax money funded Rudy 's visits to see Judi in the Hamptons .
That 's the real Rudy we know : an arrogant , self - centered man who is not above using anything and everything around him for his personal convenience .
The funny thing is , he 's running on character as his main vehicle to get to the White House .
He 'd never get there on the votes of New Yorkers :
Michael Bloomberg is not only a better mayor of New York than Rudy Giuliani - he'd make a better President , too .
That 's the result of a Daily News poll released today that asked the voters who know best - New Yorkers - which man belongs in the White House .
City voters overwhelmingly chose Mayor Mike over America 's Mayor as their pick for President , 46 % to 29 % .
No endorsement of Bloomberg is implied ; what the poll shows is what New Yorkers really think of Rudy .
What it will take for the rest of the country to catch on will be the question to ask over the next month , but I can't help but think that his reaction to the Politico story will be an eye opener for many of them .
After all , there 's no way he can refrain from being himself .
Folsom Telegraph
April 3 , 2008
After nearly 20 years of full time research into the true workings of the world , the last few weeks have been real head - shakers for me .
Talk about watching a movie .
And it ’s not even a new movie – just a remake of endless of its kind over hundreds of years .
They were once in silent black and white and now in full - blown computer - enhanced digital colour .
The movie is called ‘ The Banking Crisis ’ and among its many sequels and spin -offs are ‘ The Recession ’ , ‘ The Slump ’ , ‘ The Crash ’ , and , in it ’s latest version , ‘ The Credit Crunch ’ .
All of them star the insider actors and actresses from the same elite families and all have but one prime objective : human control .
Everything else is decoration , diversion and camouflage .
I ’ll summarise first what I have been saying since the early 1990s about the ‘ economic cycle ’ of ‘ boom and bust ’ and then have a look at what is happening today from that perspective .
It is , lest we forget , the private banks that bring ‘ money ’ into circulation by issuing lines of ‘ credit ’ , which is ‘ money ’ that has never , does not , and will never exist .
Money is merely mythical figures on a screen that is only worth anything because we take it seriously and believe it to be worth anything .
It only has purchasing power because the receiver believes it has purchasing power .
It ’s all a mind game .
When you take out a loan from a bank ( put more ‘ money ’ into circulation through accepting credit ) the bank does n’t print any notes , mint any coins or move precious metals anywhere .
It simply types into your computer account the sum of mythical figures - on - a - screen ‘ credit ’ that you have agreed to be ‘ loaned ’ .
In fact , the bank has loaned you nothing except figures on a computer file and yet from that moment you start paying interest on money that has never , does not , and will never exist .
Banking is nothing more than legalised fraud and the biggest organised crime in history .
The Mafia are petty criminals by comparison .
You can symbolise the modus operandi as a fisherman ( the elite Illuminati banking families ) with his rod ( control of the banking system , stock markets , governments , mainstream media and , most crucially , the ‘ creation ’ and distribution of ‘ money ’ or ‘ credit ’ ) .
In stage one , the banking elite cast the fishing line by keeping interest rates low and making it easy for almost anyone to get ‘ credit ’ .
This has the effect of putting lots of ‘ money ’ into circulation and increases the ability of business and people to buy things .
This obviously increases ‘ consumer demand ’ and business takes out more loans for plant , machinery and expansion , and employs more staff , to meet that demand .
We now have what they call ‘ economic prosperity ’ or a ‘ boom ’ , although there is always an underclass that never benefits .
During such ‘ boom times ’ , people , like business , feel more confident and vast numbers buy a bigger house , bigger car and have more expensive holidays – paid for invariably by loans or line of credit .
In short , during a ‘ boom ’ business and people get themselves into more debt and even those who do n’t secure bank loans bash their credit card to increase their purchasing power in the face of mass advertising ( mind control ) to buy , buy , buy .
But this ‘ prosperity ’ is only made possible by the increases in credit ( ‘ money ’ in circulation ) that allows the increase in spending .
And who controls that ?
The banks controlled by the Illuminati banking families like the Rothschilds , Rockefellers and the rest .
When the world is saturated in credit ( debt on ‘ money ’ that does n’t exist ) the banking cartel triggers stage two of what ignorant economists and economic correspondents call the ‘ economic cycle ’ .
Continuing with the fisherman analogy , they reel in the line and net their fish – us .
They do this by reducing the amount of credit they issue and calling in many loans already on their books .
This has the effect of taking ‘ money ’ – purchasing power – out of circulation and transforms the manufactured ‘ boom ’ into a manufactured ‘ bust ’ .
With less money in circulation , people can buy less and so businesses need to produce less .
This leads to big increases in unemployment , bankruptcy and people losing their homes because those businesses and people are no longer able to earn the income necessary to service the loans they took out during the ‘ good times ’ .
But , of course , when they accepted those loans of non-existent ‘ money ’ they had to sign over as security their wealth that did exist – their home , car , business or land – and so when they fail to ‘ repay ’ their ‘ loans ’ of credit the banks seize their wealth that does exist in exchange for not paying back ‘ money ’ that has never existed , except in theory .
Yes , I know it ’s insane to you and me , but from the perspective of an economic system created for the simple purpose of human control and enslavement it is perfectly sane .
To the elite families behind it all , it is sheer genius and a crucial means to their end .
‘ Gotcha . ’
Using the techniques I have described , these interbreeding families have trawled and netted the ‘ physical ’ wealth of the world while giving the masses worthless bits of paper and figures on a screen to make them think they are sharing in the whole deal .
But they are not and , whenever the genetic cartel decrees , the people realise how tenuous their perceived ‘ prosperity ’ really was .
But , come the next ‘ boom ’ , they fall for it all over again .
Ahhhhhhh !
All this manipulation is made possible by allowing private banks , ultimately controlled by the same family bloodlines , to control how much credit or ‘ money ’ is in circulation , and by the mass brainwashing of the population to ‘ spend , spend , spend ’ to seek a lifestyle that the system , again controlled by the same cartel , has told them is the measurement of their ‘ success ’ and ‘ happiness ’ .
As Robert H. Hemphill , a one - time credit manager at the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta once said :
‘ This is a staggering thought .
We are completely dependent on the commercial banks .
Someone has to borrow every dollar we have in circulation , cash or credit .
If the banks create ample synthetic money we are prosperous , if not , we starve .
We are absolutely without a permanent money system .
When one gets a complete grasp of the picture , the tragic absurdity of our hopeless position is almost incredible , but there it is .
It is the most important subject intelligent persons can investigate and reflect upon .
It is so important that our present civilisation may collapse , unless it becomes widely understood and the defects remedied very soon . ’
And so to today ’s ‘ banking crisis ’ .
It ’s a classic .
Since the last ‘ economic downturn ’ ( trawl of the real wealth ) there has been a global orgy in ‘ consumer debt ’ ( we are no longer people , we are ‘ consumers ’ , just a cog in the economic machinery ) .
By last year , Americans owed a staggering $ 16 trillion dollars – that ’s $ 2.4 trillion in personal loans and $ 13.6 trillion borrowed for their homes .
Total US debt in 2007 ( and it ’s bigger now ) : $ 53 trillion .
In the UK , a nation of some 60 million compared with America ’s 300 million , the debt levels have similarly soared to record highs .
Personal debt in Britain passed £ 1 trillion ( $ 2 trillion ) in 2004 , just seven years after it passed through the half a trillion barrier .
It has since expanded by another nearly £ 400 billion and Britain ’s personal debt is increasing by more than £ 1 million every 4 minutes .
The banking cartel has taken the debt to record levels because it is preparing for a record trawl .
It is the vehicle for the Illuminati families to create the chaos from which they can offer their solution – a new global economic system which gives them more control than ever before .
They want this eventually to be administered by a world central bank via a single world currency that would be purely electronic with no cash in circulation at all .
This would give total control ( apart from barter ) over if or what you purchase to a global computer system that would be programmed to decide if it would accept your electronic card or , in time , the microchip under your skin .
Dissidents of the system would soon be off the computer ’s Christmas card list , that ’s for sure .
This is what the current financial mayhem is all about – another massive stepping stone to the control of every man , woman and child on the planet .
Once you know that , the apparently crazy and scandalous decisions made by the banking system to trigger the current crisis take on a new perspective .
These include the high - risk sub - prime mortgage frenzy which made vast numbers of loans to people who were highly likely to default – and have .
It was a disaster waiting to happen – but only for those who lost their homes , not for the families controlling the banking system .
But wait , I can hear people say , banks are going broke and even major players like Bear Stearns have been on the brink .
Surely the Illuminati families would n’t want that ?
Oh , but they would because of the contribution it makes to their overall agenda .
It is important to stress the difference between running a bank within the game and owning the game itself .
Take the symbolic example of the board game called Monopoly .
Different people come and go , playing the game and ‘ winning ’ and ‘ losing ’ .
But the game itself can never ‘ lose ’ because it is the board on which everyone has to play , winners and losers , and it is all the houses , hotels , instruction cards and rules that they have to play with and abide by .
Players of the game may use its board , money and real estate for a while , but the game always gets them back , or the owner of the game does .
Monopoly : he who creates the game controls the rules
Yes , the US bank Bear Stearns saw its share price plummet from more than $ 150 a share down to almost zero .
But who has sought to take advantage of that ?
The notorious Illuminati operation , J P Morgan Chase , which has offered Bear $ 2 a share in its takeover bid – and the Illuminati - created and controlled Federal Reserve , the privately - owned ‘ central bank ’ of America , has made the Morgan takeover virtually risk - free by guaranteeing up to $ 30 billion of Bear ’s mortgages and other assets .
It ’s a stitch - up .
Some banks will go to the wall and either disappear or be absorbed for cents on the dollar by other Illuminati operations and it suits the agenda to install fewer , but bigger , banks because that reduces the number of people with any influence on competition and financial events in general .
It is sobering to read this Internet account of the engineered Wall Street Crash of 1929 which led to the Great depression of the 1930s , a time that some commentators are claiming we may be about to experience again :
‘ Throughout the 1920s a long boom took stock prices to peaks never before seen .
From 1920 to 1929 stocks more than quadrupled in value .
Many investors became convinced that stocks were a sure thing and borrowed heavily to invest more money in the market .
But in 1929 , the bubble burst and stocks started down an ever more precipitous cliff .
In 1932 and 1933 , they hit bottom , down about 80 % from their highs in the late 1920s .
This had sharp effects on the economy .
Demand for goods declined because people felt poor because of their losses in the stock market .
New investment could not be financed through the sale of stock , because no one would buy the new stock .
But perhaps the most important effect was chaos in the banking system as banks tried to collect on loans made to stock market investors whose holdings were now worth little or nothing at all .
Worse , many banks had themselves invested depositors ’ money in the stock market .
When word spread that banks ’ assets contained huge un-collectable loans and almost worthless stock certificates , depositors rushed to withdraw their savings .
Unable to raise fresh funds from the Federal Reserve System , banks began failing by the hundreds in 1932 and 1933 . ’
Those hundreds of failing banks were either absorbed for next to nothing by the big banks , which became even richer and more powerful as a result , or they were left to disappear and reduce the potential competition .
Individual banks may come and go , but the banking system , the game , is always there .
For ‘… chaos in the banking system as banks tried to collect on loans made to stock market investors whose holdings were now worth little or nothing at all ’ , read sub - prime mortgages and such like that we have now .
Imagine the effect of a stock market crash today on top of everything else and it ’s coming , make no mistake .
It ’s all in the script .
America during the banker - created Great Depression
It was no coincidence at all that the crash of the 1930s was unleashed by the Illuminati Federal Reserve making several increases in interest rates to ‘ cool the stock market ’ , nor that the economic collapse brought the Illuminati front man Franklin Roosevelt to the White House with his ‘ New Deal ’ to ‘ solve the crisis ’ .
Instead , he took the United States into World War Two .
What we are seeing is just ‘ history ’ ( the techniques of mass manipulation ) repeating .
After the ‘ boom ’ created by low interest rates and unlimited credit since the 1990s , they are crashing the global economy through what is being called the ‘ Credit Crunch ’ .
Put another way , they put lots of money into circulation ( boom ) and now they are taking it out again ( bust ) .
This means that there comes a moment when there is simply not enough money in circulation for everyone to pay back their outstanding ‘ loans ’ .
Suffering and homelessness are built into the system .
Other aspects of this same agenda include :
The crashing of the US dollar to prepare for its replacement by a ‘ North American Union ’ currency ( working title at least , the Amero ) which would become the currency of the United States , Canada and Mexico with plans to extend it to the whole of the Americas .
Creating such a scale of economic suffering and dependency that people will do anything , at however low the wage , just to survive and with ‘ outsourcing ’ and the massive influx of people from poorer countries into places like North America , the UK and the rest of Western Europe , the competition for this low - paid work is being intensified still more ( see the video sequence after this article ) .
Watching the news as the crisis unfolds is like witnessing a car crash in slow motion , or a replay of one you have seen , or read about , many times before ; and debt has reached such astronomical proportions that we ’re right out of seat belts .
Like I say , in the end it ’s all a mind game based on the manipulation of that mental and emotional state we call ‘ confidence ’ .
When you control the mainstream media and the leading politicians then controlling the level of ‘ confidence ’ is a synch .
When people have confidence in banks , stock markets and the strength of the economy in general , they borrow more money , get into more debt , spend more and invest more in things like stocks and shares .
The result : there is an economic and stock market boom .
When people lose confidence in banks , stock markets and the strength of the economy in general , they borrow less money , spend less and invest less in things like stocks and shares .
The result : there is an economic and stock market ‘ crisis ’ .
So tell them everything is wonderful and give them lots of credit and then tell them everything is in chaos and stop their lines of credit .
It is so easy when you own the game .
Wall Street : A Las Vegas casino
Many years ago I spoke about all this at a financial conference and afterwards a man who speculated for a living on the commodity markets ( deciding if people in ‘ Third World ’ countries ate or not ) came over to speak to me .
He said he did n’t believe what I said about manipulation of the system , but he would keep his eyes open from now on .
A few months later I met him again and he was transformed .
He said he had noticed that three or four days before a state - of - the - economy statement by the then Federal Reserve chief , Alan Greenspan , the big players in the markets would go to work moving their investments around .
Every time , he said , the result of Greenspan ’s words was to increase the value of what the big players had been buying and push down what they had been selling .
The reason does not need a genius to explain :
The big players were colluding in Greenspan ’s statements .
Welcome to the ‘ real ’ world …
But in everything else most people do have a choice not to borrow money for things they do n’t actually need – and that ’s where so much credit ‘ money ’ is spent .
If people ca n’t afford something that is not essential then do n’t buy it if you ca n’t pay cash because otherwise you are mortgaging your life to the banking cartel .
So we do n’t have the latest car , fashion or bit of ‘ bling ’ .
Who gives a @ *&# ^!?
What nonsense it all is .

Mental Health Policy
Mental Health America takes a unique approach to policy .
MHA believes policy should ask people what they need to live the lives they want and support them in getting there .
Recovery is founded on the principle that people can take on meaningful roles in the community despite mental health challenges , when they receive the support they need .
MHA 's goal is recovery for all .
There is nothing more important than allowing everyone , and those they care about , the chance to live the life they want with meaningful roles in the community .
In the history of treatment of people with mental health problems , our system has done a poor job at protecting people .
The story of the Mental Health Bell is a reminder that we cannot return to a system where people are shackled , mistreated , and otherwise forgotten .
Since 1909 , MHA has fought to improve the system for individuals who struggle with mental health problems .
Unfortunately , the fight is not over .
MHA and our affiliates continue to fight to ensure access to treatment ; improve quality of treatment ; reduce homelessness , incarceration , and discrimination ; and ultimately move our system towards a better mode -- one where people are treated with dignity and early intervention and prevention of mental health problems is prioritized .
What We Fight For
Mental Health America ( MHA ) – founded in 1909 – is the nation 's leading community - based nonprofit dedicated to addressing the needs of those living with mental illness and to promoting the overall mental health of all Americans .
Our work is driven by our commitment to promote mental health as a critical part of overall wellness , including prevention services for all , early identification and intervention for those at risk , integrated care , services , and supports for those who need it , with recovery as the goal .
As part of our cohesive effort , MHA staff , Board Members , and Committee Members have researched , written , reviewed , and approved position statements that cover a large number of policy issues that we care about .
The members of our Board and Committees are consumers , family members , advocates , lawyers , scientists , practitioners , and political leaders who bring their vision and expertise to support these efforts .
Each position statement provides an overview of where we stand on each issue , a background of the issue , and a call to action that lists specific changes we want to see .
These position statements provide a foundation by which we fight for a better system .
MHA collaborates with scientists , practitioners , policy experts , advocates , and other community leaders to design policy recommendations that promote :
MHA works to move forward these ideas through activities that include federal and state legislative and regulatory reform , building public understanding of the issues , weighing in on key court cases , and collaboration with other advocates and coalitions to improve our system .

What 's Happening in 2020 : Policy Agenda
Our top priorities this year include :
Financing and Training of the Peer Workforce MHA will work to increase insurance and Medicare coverage of peer services .
We will ensure reciprocity of national certification across states to maximize opportunities and job mobility for peer workers .
We will seek to secure resources and address barriers for training and certifications to lead to increased employment and reimbursement .
Prevention and Early Intervention for Children , Youth and Young Adults , with an emphasis on school - based education and services Much of MHA ’s work is guided by the Before Stage Four philosophy ( B4Stage4 ) - that mental health conditions should be prevented and treated long before they reach the critical points in the disease process .
We will seek to share information on how states are implementing k- 12 school - based education , peer support , and services to prevent and intervene early in mental health conditions .
We will also work to ensure mental health care is available in higher education and that value - based payment and other reimbursement incentives reflect the B4Stage4 philosophy .
Access to Mental Healthcare and Supports , with a focus on integrated primary care Access to mental health care should be easy and affordable .
MHA will work at the national and state level to enforce parity .
We will support Medicaid expansion and fight efforts to restrict access to coverage .
We will partner to develop policy solutions to promoting integrated mental health care in primary care and primary care within mental health services and support the use of digital tools to provide more effective and accessible care .
Suicide Prevention and Access to Crisis Care
As part of our B4Stage4 philosophy , MHA supports alternatives to emergency rooms and criminal justice involvement .
We will support the creation of a new 9 - 8 - 8 number for suicide prevention and mental health crises .
We will also advocate for additional funding for crisis and diversion services , including peer support and respite services .
We will work with police departments , gun shops , firearms owners to do in reach , promote screening and ensure safety in the home .
Workplace Mental Health MHA recognizes the psychological impact that workplaces can have on their employees .
Millions of employees spend a large part of their day , and lifetime , at work , increasing the effect that workplace environments can have on psychological well - being .
This is particularly concerning for law enforcement and first responders and we will work to promote mental health among these workers .
We will develop additional proposals to incentivize workplace wellness activities , improve culture , and increase access to assistance and mental health care .

It was a love story that touched the heart of New Yorkers .
Two gay penguins at Central Park Zoo who - after trying unsuccessfully to hatch a rock - were given a fertilised egg and raised their own little chick called Tango .
The tale of Roy and Silo was even made into a children 's book called And Tango Makes Three .
But , while liberal Manhattanites may have sighed at the sweetness of it all , not every American seems quite so pleased .
The book has caused controversy in a number of small towns in the American heartland , where teachers and parents have complained that it is not suitable for children .
In Shiloh , Illinois , some parents insisted that the village school library restrict access to the cartoon tome .
Shiloh resident Lilly Del Pinto felt upset when her five - year - old daughter brought the book home .
She was reading it to her when she got to a point where the zoo keeper says Roy and Silo must be in love .
Then she realised it was not quite the straightforward animal tale she had expected .
' That 's when I ended the story , ' she said .
Now Del Pinto wants the book kept in a more mature section of the library or for parental permission to be sought for it to be taken out .
So far the requests have not been heeded by the school district , though a panel appointed by Superintendent Jennifer Filyaw did agree with Del Pinto 's suggestions .
However , Filyaw considers the book ' adorable ' and fears censorship issues if any action is taken .
' My feeling is that a library is to serve an entire population , ' she said .
Parents in Missouri had the book moved to the non-fiction section of the school library , arguing that it described a real story and genuine penguin behaviour .
But the twist in the tale - which is not touched on in the book - would please social conservatives who see gay marriage as a threat to society .
In real life the gay penguins of Central Park split up last year after Silo took up with a female penguin called Scrappy .
Staring for the equivalent of every night for two weeks at the same little patch of sky with ESO 's Very Large Telescope , an international team of astronomers has found the extremely faint light from teenage galaxies billions of light years away .
These galaxies , which the research team believes are the building blocks of normal galaxies like our Milky Way , had eluded detection for three decades , despite intensive searches .
The team , led by Martin Haehnelt of the University of Cambridge , UK , Michael Rauch and George Becker of the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution , USA , and Andy Bunker of the Anglo - Australian Observatory , reports their results in the 1 March 2008 issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
" The farther we look back into space the farther we see back in time , " explained Rauch . "
We were actually trying to measure a faint signal from intergalactic gas caused by the cosmic ultraviolet background radiation .
But as often happens in science , we got a surprise and found something we were n't looking for -- dozens of faint , discrete objects emitting radiation from neutral hydrogen in the so - called Lyman alpha line , a fundamental signature of protogalaxies . "
A popular theory of galaxy formation predicts that the gas accreted forming smaller protogalaxies , which then collided and merged to become the massive galaxies seen today .
The new discovery lends strong support to this theory .
During the 1990s there was mounting evidence in favor of this hierarchical picture of galactic evolution , including measurements of distant quasars by Rauch and collaborators that showed how the properties of cosmic gas clouds -- the reservoir of matter for galaxy formation - - fit within that scheme .
" Most of those gas clouds are dark and visible only as foreground objects , which cast something of a shadow against a bright background quasar , " Becker said .
" Intriguingly , one class of these shadows -- known as damped Lyman alpha systems -- was suspected to arise when those small , protogalactic building blocks intersect the line - of - sight to the quasar .
For many years , these shadows were our only hint that a population of numerous early galaxies existed . "
" This is the first time that the sky has been searched to this depth and the unrivalled sensitivity of the picture taken with the VLT was key to succeeding , " says Haehnelt .

" Previous attempts have usually been frustrated by the difficulty of detecting extremely faint objects : the amount of time required even with an 8 - metre class telescope like the VLT considerably exceeds typical observing time awards .
We have thus exploited the periods of less good weather with the FORS2 spectrograph at the VLT , taking advantage of the service observing mode , " says Becker .
In service mode , ESO staff astronomers at Paranal are responsible for carrying out the actual observations , taking all the specific requirements into account .
" We were actually trying to measure a faint signal from intergalactic gas caused by the cosmic ultraviolet background radiation .
But as often happens in science , we got a surprise and found something we were n't looking for -- dozens of faint , discrete objects emitting radiation from neutral hydrogen in the so - called Lyman alpha line , a fundamental signature of protogalaxies , " explains Rauch .
The same small patch of sky , centred on a quasar , was observed between 2004 and 2006 for an unprecedented 92 hours , the equivalent of about 12 complete nights , allowing the astronomers to obtain a spectrum of the Universe when it was only 2 billion years old .
The result of this search is the detection of 27 faint objects .
The weak light signal that the team has detected from these distant objects implies low star formation rates and a small amount of chemical enrichment , suggesting that they are indeed at an early stage of formation .
" The properties of the emitters seem to provide an excellent match to those of ' Damped Lyman Alpha Systems ' , the main reservoir of neutral hydrogen in the far Universe , " says Andy Bunker .
" This suggests that the objects found are the long - sought counterparts of the DLAS in emission .
The new observations confirm theoretical research proposing that galaxies like our own have formed by the amalgamation of small proto - galaxies early on in the history of the Universe , " he adds .
" What makes our discovery particularly exciting is that it opens the route to find large numbers of building blocks of normal galaxies and that we will now be able to study in detail how galaxies like our Milky Way have come together , " says Martin Haehnelt .
The results are reported in a paper in press in the Astrophysical Journal ( " A Population of Faint Extended Line Emitters and the Host Galaxies of Optically Thick QSO Absorption Systems " , by M. Rauch et al . ) .
The team is composed of Michael Rauch and George Becker ( Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington , Pasadena , USA ) , Martin Haehnelt ( Institute of Astronomy , Cambridge , UK ) , Andrew Bunker ( Anglo - Australian Observatory and School of Physics , Exeter , UK ) , Francine Marleau ( Spitzer Science Center , Caltech , USA ) , James Graham ( University of California , Berkeley , USA ) , Stefano Cristiani ( Osservatorio Astronomico di Trieste , INAF , Italy ) , Matt J. Jarvis ( University of Hertfordshire , UK ) , Cedric Lacey , Simon Morris , and Tom Theuns ( Durham University , UK ) , Celine Peroux ( Observatoire Astronomique de Marseille - Provence , France ) , and Huub Röttgering ( Leiden Observatory , The Netherlands )
Ronald Rat Reagan
Snitches like Malkin are the direct result of the Reagan era because it was under Reagan that American children were taught to spy on their parents and turn them over to the police .
Reagan claimed to stand for family values and less government but the facts reveal an entirely different story .
Ronald Reagan promoted the most despicable practice of both NAZISM and COMMUNISM by turning children against their parents in the War on Drugs .
Decades before Reagan used the War on Drugs as a weapon to destroy parental authority and replace it by the state he already was an experienced rat .
In the late 1940 's Reagan was a secret FBI informant whose code name was T - 10 .
Reagan or should I say snitch T - 10 turned over to the FBI the names of his fellow actors and actresses whom he suspected of being Communist sympathizers .
As you can see in the following clip Reagan was n't much of an actor but he made a fine rat for HOOVER .
Below is just a few cases of how the GOP has destroyed families instead of protecting them .
In 1986 after listening to an anti-drug lecture 13 year old Deanna Young , a jr. high school student in Orange County California walked into the police station carrying a trash bag containing an ounce of cocaine , a little stash of marijuana and few pills .
A few hours later her parents were arrested and jailed .
Nancy Reagan herself a prescription drug addict rushed out to California to congratulate the child proclaiming to the press that " 13 year old Deanna Young must have loved her parents a great deal , " .
Nancy Reagan then went back to Washington while the 13 year old who had lived in an upscale suburban Southern California community was sent to a foster home .
A mother who wanted her daughter to enter a drug treatment program turned the daughter in to police .
The daughter received a 7 ½ - year sentence without parole and was ordered to enter treatment upon release .
" Our goal is not to send everybody to jail to hurt them .
Our goal is to help them , " said the drug squad officer who had arrested this young girl .
An eleven - year - old DARE student turned in her parents for using marijuana .
The mother lost both her jobs even though charges against her were dropped , and the father was convicted of cultivation .
Even though the daughter was now living in a drug - free environment , her grades declined and she became unsociable .
Reflecting on how her " help " affected her family , the girl declared , " I would never tell again .
Never . Never . "
In another attack on family integrity , drug police asked the Missouri legislature to make marijuana possession a child abuse felony if the substance were found in a home where a child lived or visited .
With this " investigative tool , " drug squads could threaten to have juvenile authorities take custody of children if parents refused to incriminate themselves .
There are literally hundreds more examples of this type of Police State Drug War tactics in the book where I found these cases at .
DRUG WARRIORS AND THEIR PREY
From Police Power to Police State
RICHARD LAWRENCE MILLER
NOTE : Jay Grodner pled guilty .
An important update is posted here .
This ought to make your blood boil .
And this Marine should receive a commendation for not kicking the living crap out of the guy ... seriously .
Marine Sgt Mike McNulty is on activation orders to Iraq ( second tour ) .
On December 1st , 2007 , Mike went to visit a friend in Chicago before deploying to say goodbye .
In order to get to his friend 's residence , and keep in mind that Chicago is a myriad of diagonal and one - way streets , the front entrance ( right way ) to the one - way street was blocked .
Mike , being a Marine , overcame and adapted by driving around the block to the other end of the street and backing up all the way to his friend 's place .
While saying goodbye , at about 11 am , he noticed a man leaning up against his car .
Mike left his friend 's apartment and caught the man keying his car on multiple sides .
After caught in the process , the man told Mike , " you think you can do whatever you want with Department of Defense license plates and tags " .
( In Illinois you can purchase veteran , Marine , or medal plates .
Mike has Illinois Marine Corps license plates . )
During the exchange , he made additional anti-military comments .
Mike called the Chicago police and had the man arrested .
A citation against the man was issued for misdemeanor criminal damage to private property .
The police report ( and I have copies if needed ) states :
Victim related to P/ O that as he walked back to his vehicle , he observed the offender leaning up against his vehicle and rubbed / dragged his left arm and hand across the passenger side .
As offender walked away from victim 's vehicle , victim observed a scratch along the rear trunk and passenger 's door area where offender dragged his arm and hand over .
Victim and witness stopped offender and confronted him .
Victim has military plates and decals on his vehicle and offender made anti war and military comments to victim .
Upon P / O's arrival to scene , offender denied scratch victim 's vehicle , but did admit to rubbing past it .
Victim at this time did not sign complaint , because he is leaving tour for military duty .
Offender said they accused him of scratching the car because he is Jewish .
Offender 's statements / responses to P/ O's questions unreasonable .
As it turns out , the man is Chicago lawyer Jay R. Grodner , who owns a law firm in the city and has offices in the suburbs .
After sending the car to the body shop , it was determined there is $ 2400 in damage , making this a felony .
Mike went to court Friday morning to collect the damages against Mr. Grodner and file felony charges .
Though the damages are over $ 300 ( the amount which determines felony or misdemeanor ) Grodner offered Mike to pay his deductible , $ 100 , and have Mike 's insurance pay for it .
The Illinois States Attorneys tried to coerce Mike into accepting the offer .
Appalled , Mike said he wanted this to be a felony .
The state told Mike that it was not worth pursuing felony damage against Grodner because they do n't have the time .
In addition , the state prosecutors told him that he would never it ' would be difficult to recover the damages ' from Grodner because he is a lawyer .
Instead , the State asked Mike if he would accept probation for Grodner .
Mike accepted , probation was offered to Grodner , and Grodner declined the offer , saying within ear shot of Mike , " I 'm not going to make it easy on this kid " .
Mike 's next court date is tomorrow , Monday , December 31st , to pursue misdemeanor charges against Grodner .
Mike 's leave is over on January 2nd when he reports to Camp Pendleton before heading to Iraq .
Jay Grodner knows this and is going to file for a continuance until Mike is gone and cannot appear in court .
By account of the Illinois State 's Attorneys , Grodner is likely to get away with defacing Mike 's car with no penalty because , 1 ) Mike is about to deploy to Iraq and will not be available to appear in court , and 2 ) Grodner is a lawyer and can get out of this very easily .
So , does anyone have any ideas about how to proceed ?
All peaceful and rational ideas are welcomed .
We are contacting the media about this , too .
Please pass this story on to anyone you know that might be able to help .
Update 12-31-07 1000 CST : The hearing is today .
After about four hundred emails offering help , I 've taken down the email address for now .
If I have n't sent you a reply , I apologize and hopefully will send one soon .
I will post updates as they occur .
There are several options and we 'll see what happens in court first before Mike decides on the next move .
And , BTW , a sincere thanks to all the Chicago Police Officers for their advice and offers .
Let me be clear .
I do not want anyone to harass the lawyer , threaten him , damage his property or propose any other illegal suggestion .
We can win this one clean and fair - one way or another ...
Update 12-31-07 2000 CST : A Blackfive reader sends this update about the hearing today ...
Attn : Black Five
I am writing to produce an update of the results of Sgt McNulty 's case against Jay R Grodner .
I was present in support of Mike and thought you may be interested in an update for this story .
Sgt McNulty was called forward by the State 's Attorney in order to discuss the case .
I am not sure what transpired behind the closed doors , however , I overheard the State 's Attorney expressing her intent to prosecute this guy to the fullest extent .
It seems as if Black Five is the sole catalyst to this story getting out and I am sure Sgt McNulty has probably heard the effect of yours and other blogs from the results of today 's proceedings to include several Marines and civilians who showed up in his support .
Jay R Grodner was called before court and in his absence , the Judge issued a warrant for his arrest effective immediately .
Sgt McNulty was departing the court when Grodner rolled in to the courtroom more pathetic than anyone I had ever seen .
The Judge had questioned him on his tardiness and he explained that traffic had been busy and he ' made a wrong turn ' .
The Judge chastised him for his tardiness , pathetic excuses , and that he was lucky the warrant had not been executed prior to his arrival .
It seems the blogosphere has put the ball in Sgt McNulty 's court .
Furthermore , it is also apparent that the State 's Attorney 's Office has decided to take this matter on a much more serious level .
A new and very aggressive State 's Attorney seems to have a genuine interest in pursuing this case to the extent that it warrants .
A lot of good people deserve our thanks today .
Thousands responded with emails and phone calls and some even went to support Mike at the hearing .
Thank you .
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again - Blackfive and military blogs have the best readers on the planet - we really are a true community .
And , long time regular TB , sends this link to a Free Republic reader who also attended the hearing and provides a report .
Now , if you 'll excuse me , I 'm going to ring in the New Year .
Twelve years ago , Mrs. Blackfive ( before the " Mrs. " ) and I had our first date , and our first kiss was at midnight .
We have a tradition to maintain .
Thank you !
And have a Happy New Year !
Update 01-03-08 : The Chicago Tribune 's John Kass has a column up about the incident .
* Illustration : Evah Fan *
Let 's say you 're trying to build your own rocket , and the budget gets tight — maybe you fail to win an X Prize , or the dotcom mogul you had in your back pocket suddenly gets bored and takes up yacht racing .
Where can you go for those pricey liquid oxygen valves and titanium fuel tanks ?
Norton Sales .
It 's easy to find — it 's the place with the bomb canisters and missile components in the window .
Since the 1960s , Norton has been the premier US dealer of secondhand spaceship parts .
The salvage company , located in scruffy North Hollywood , does 70 percent of its business with aerospace companies — both established firms and the new crop of private space ventures , like Burt Rutan 's Scaled Composites and Elon Musk 's SpaceX .
On a recent visit , I met owner Carlos Guzman , a solidly built 41 - year - old with close - cropped , reddish hair and a goatee , wearing jeans and a company T - shirt .
From the front of the shop , he guided me through a morass of pipe fittings , motors , compressors , disconnected beer taps , and a plastic alien head to a 6 - foot - high knot of ducts , pipes , and corrugated metal .
It 's one of Guzman 's favorite items — a duplicate of the engine that blasted 10 Apollo missions into space .
" Besides being cool , it 's very historical , " he observes .
The bulk of the Norton collection sits in the warehouse and adjacent outdoor junkyard .
Row after row of shelves strain under masses of metal parts of all sizes and shapes and unguessable utility — some dusty , some grimy , some shiny - new .
" Sometimes we just do n't know where to put everything , " Guzman says .
An 8 - foot prototype engine designed for a Saturn IV rocket squats in a corner , looking like the robot from Lost in Space turned inside out .
A Thiokol solid - state rocket engine sits in the blazing sun .
Guzman figures it cost at least $ 10 million to build ; he 'll sell it to you for $ 50,000 .
Very little of Guzman 's inventory will actually get to space .
He sells a lot of high - grade hydraulics to lowriders and other car obsessives , does a brisk prop business with movie and TV studios , and adapts gadgets for special effects .
And , of course , he serves those new space companies .
He estimates his sales at about $ 50,000 a month .
Having begun his career as a plumber , Guzman became interested in hydraulics and pneumatics .
That led to a job at a small aerospace firm that bought parts from a family business run by retired restaurateur Norton Holstrom , who had started picking up and flipping the cast - offs of Southern California 's then - booming aerospace industry .
Guzman loved Holstrom 's place , and when a position opened up , he went to work for Holstrom 's son .
Eventually , he bought the business .
With the Holstrom family out , the Guzmans are in .
Carlos ' 15 - year - old son , Roman , works afternoons , stocking shelves and cleaning up .
How does the teen feel , surrounded by the machinery that has helped lift humanity to the stars ?
Guzman laughs .
" He 's bored out of his mind . "

Which five apps rule the Facebook universe ?
Earlier this May , Facebook launched an open application platform , enabling anyone to develop applications with the ability to access and use the social networking site 's vast wealth of user data .
Less than two months later , everyone from big companies to regular Joes are building tiny apps and embedding them in users ' profiles .
Some are stellar and some are stinkers , so we asked Wired News readers to vote for the Facebook apps they like the best .
Here , in reverse order , are the results of our reader poll , along with our own take on each of the winners .
You 'll need to be logged in as a Facebook user to access the applications through the links below .
__ Calendar by 30 Boxes__
This offering from makers of the popular calendar web app 30 Boxes lets you manage all your Facebook - related dates right on your profile .
Keep track of birthdays , concerts , assignments and other events relative to your online life , and share those events with your Facebook friends .
If you 're a 30 Boxes user , you can sync your calendars and add events either in Facebook or at the 30 Boxes site .
But it also wins just because the clean , Ajax - powered interface makes for the coolest and easiest to use online calendar for Facebook .
__ iLike__
Track your musical tastes with this app from social - music - discovery site iLike .
Once you add the app , you can add songs and videos from favorite bands to your profile page .
Do n't expect anything too avant garde – iLike is made for the mainstream .
You can also list the concerts you plan to attend , which makes hooking up with friends at shows easier .
But the real draw here is iLike 's musical Challenge game .
It starts playing a clip , and you have to identify the artist or the song title .
Compete for points and show off your score .
Is that Prince or Michael Jackson ?
" Skater Boi " or " Girlfriend " ?
The guessing game alone makes the app worth adding .

Lessons From the Facebook Riots
Czech hackers managed to get access to a webcam and insert realistic footage of nuclear explosion .
The incident was broadcasted on the Czech TV programme Panorama on Sunday .
After an immense interest from both the media and the public , the group that goes by the name Ztohoven released a statement in which they claim they are not terrorists or a political group , they just wanted to see what the reaction would be .
In the movie below you can see how the explosion looked like .

Control the message .
This is arguably the first rule of politics .
Set the terms of the debate .
Stick to your talking points .
Minimize leaks .
Do not let the opposition define you .
Avoid process stories .
Win the news cycle .
Never let them see you sweat .
In the era of the YouTube election , in which every campaign stumble has the potential to become a “ macaca moment , ” the pressure on candidates to keep an iron grip on their image is extreme .
Quirky , let - it - all - hang - out romps like John McCain ’s straight - talking quest for the Republican nomination in 2000 may be charming , but tight - lipped , brutally disciplined efforts like George W. Bush ’s 2000 and 2004 runs are the stuff of which legends — and presidents — are made .
Among the 2008 field , no one recognizes this reality more than Hillary Clinton , whose every word , deed , and hairdo of the past fifteen years has sparked bitter national debate .
Not coincidentally , she has spent this time assembling a network of advisers who share her views on loyalty and discretion .
“ Hillaryland , ” as the members of this mostly female clique call themselves , is less a campaign entity than an extended sisterhood defined by its devotion to its namesake .
Even so , the group ’s protective ethos dominates her presidential campaign , where loyalty is demanded , self - promotion frowned upon , and talking out of school , especially to the press , punishable by death .
( Just kidding — though staffers point out that the campaign ’s Arlington , Virginia , headquarters is in a former INS detention facility that still has cells in the basement . )
If any campaign has a shot at Total Message Control in ’08 , it is Team Hillary .
But is this a good thing ?
Hillary is , after all , a candidate with very particular , personality - driven challenges .
Unlike Bill Clinton or George W. Bush , she lacks the natural ability to make voters feel as though they have a personal sense of her in a 30 - second sound bite .
Polls indicate that even people who like Hillary do n’t necessarily trust her ; she is seen as too cautious , scripted , and opportunistic — in short , too much the slick pol .
Dispelling such concerns is no small challenge for a political team dominated by loyalists who for years now have shared , and even enabled , the candidate ’s obsession with privacy and control .
Hillaryland originally referred to the young , shoestring staff assigned to Mrs. Clinton during her husband ’s 1992 presidential run , but it has expanded and mutated to the point where trying to determine members ’ spheres of influence can seem a little like mapping the human genome .
There ’s Maggie Williams , Hillary ’s first White House chief of staff and now her campaign co-chair , who is the person said to know what keeps Hillary up at night .
Huma Abedin , Hillary ’s beautiful , enigmatic “ body person , ” spends nearly every waking minute with Hillary and so has the best sense of her daily rhythms and routines .
Lissa Muscatine , a former Hillary speechwriter and erstwhile book collaborator , is a walking catalogue of everything the candidate has ever said about anything .
Cheryl Mills , who as deputy White House counsel defended Bill Clinton in his impeachment trial , has returned to the fold as Hillary ’s campaign lawyer .
Some members , like Hillary ’s Senate chief of staff , Tamera Luzzatto , deal with legislative duties ; others , like senior campaign advisers Ann Lewis and Minyon Moore , are focused squarely on ’08 .
“ It ’s concentric circles , ” offers Melanne Verveer , Hillary ’s chief of staff during Bill ’s second term .
At the center of all these circles stands Patti Solis Doyle .
The first person Hillary hired during the ’ 92 race , Patti , as she is universally known , worked as her scheduler for eight years , steadily amassing duties and influence .
At this point , no one embodies the culture of Hillaryland more than Patti , now the campaign manager of Team Hillary .
The 42 - year - old Chicago native is direct , focused , and disciplined .
She has a quick laugh , a sharp , teasing wit , and little patience for any sort of media attention .
( “ I ’m Mexican , for crying out loud , ” quips the first - generation American .
“ I just want to do my job . ” )
Officially , Patti is charged with overseeing every aspect of Hillary Inc. , from hiring to fund - raising to crisis management .
Unofficially , she serves as the eyes , the ears , and the voice of Hillary .
While the campaign has its share of political geniuses who are more seasoned and more famous , Patti ’s authority flows from having achieved a sort of mind meld with her boss .
“ Patti almost channels Hillary , ” says Kim Molstre , Hillary ’s perky and openly starstruck campaign scheduler .
Hillary , in turn , seeks out Patti ’s counsel .
Says policy director Neera Tanden , “ On any major decision , the first and last person Hillary talks to is Patti . ”
Patti is also the chief enforcer of the family code : no leaks , ever .
She expresses admiration for the way George W. Bush ’s campaign team controlled its message , and , given her druthers , would run this race no differently .
“ We are a very disciplined group , and I am very proud of it , ” she says with a defiant edge .
Patti cites as one of her biggest achievements the fact that Hillary ’s campaign launch in January was planned and executed with military precision .
“ There were so many eyes and ears waiting for her to say something about whether she would run .
That what we managed to pull off was a creative , professional rollout of a presidential campaign without anybody really knowing about it [ in advance ] —
I do n’t want to say it was the hardest thing I ’ve done , but it was one of the things I ’m most proud of . ”
And pity the poor wretch whom Patti suspects of violating the code .
Former Hillary press secretary Neel Lattimore ( who is now with the Children ’s Defense Fund but still cherishes his status as “ the first man in Hillaryland ” ) vividly recalls the ass- chewing he received in 1997 , when Patti thought he had leaked news of the First Lady ’s 50th - birthday surprise party to the Chicago media .
“ She was at the airport on the phone screaming at me , and I was screaming back , ” recounts Lattimore .
“ I told her , ‘ Patti , I did n’t do that !’
She was like , ‘ You did !
I know you did !
Just tell me you did it !’ ” Terrified that Patti did n’t believe him , Lattimore phoned the reporter in question , begging him to confirm that Lattimore had n’t been his source .
“ Never cross Patti Solis Doyle , ” Lattimore jokingly cautions .
“ I would rather throw myself in front of an Amtrak train . ”
Of course , the tight - lipped tribalism is n’t Patti ’s doing alone :
It trickles down from the top .
Capricia Marshall , who began working for Hillary in 1992 and now serves as a senior campaign adviser , “ remembers fondly ” a meeting in early 1993 , when the then– First Lady gathered her staff in the correspondence office of the East Wing for a modified pep talk .
“ It was one of those , ‘ Look to your right .
Look to your left .
This is your teammate for the next few years .
We ’re going to back each other up .
We ’re going to help each other out .
The only way we can do this in this pressure cooker of a place is to help each other .
No stabbing each other .
No gossiping . ’ ” The circle - the - wagons mentality was intensified by the barrage of political brawls and scandals and scorching media coverage during the White House years .
( “ Another day , another book , ” quips campaign media guru Mandy Grunwald . )
So protective of the First Lady ’s privacy were her aides that they never referred to her by name in public , recalls Lattimore : “ We referred to her as Herself . ”
There is a significant Go , girl ! aspect to working for Hillary .
She represented a bold new model of First Lady , and many of these women were drawn to her record of advocacy on behalf of women and children .
“ There was the feeling that this was a very new and different kind of person trying to do something more with the position that really spoke to women in a larger sense , ” recalls Muscatine .
“ Suddenly , you were invited to be part of this — this movement . ”
Hillary , in turn , has always taken a close , personal interest in her staff .
With eerie uniformity , Hillarylanders proffer heartwarming anecdotes about how she is there for them during the good ( weddings , births ) , the bad ( illness , deaths ) , and the ugly ( breakups , weight gain ) .
As a small female subculture fighting for its agenda within the male - dominated West Wing , Hillaryland swiftly developed a let ’s - show - ’em attitude .
“ Sometimes we would initiate something and the boys would take credit for it ” even if they had initially fought it , recalls Melanne Verveer with equal parts amusement and annoyance .
She points to Hillary ’s speech at the 1995 U.N. World Conference on Women in Beijing , in which she famously asserted that women ’s rights must no longer be considered separate from human rights .
Coming in the wake of human - rights dissident Harry Wu ’s arrest by Chinese authorities , the First Lady ’s appearance was opposed as politically risky by many in the West Wing .
“ They gave us lots of flak , ” says Verveer .
But in the end , the speech was hailed as a triumph , and Verveer reports that people have since told her that as the president ’s staff watched from the West Wing , “ they were saying , ‘ Oh my God , this is amazing , ’ and then basically saying , ‘ We ’re so glad we told her to go . ’ ”
Whatever the origins of the bond , Democratic observers say that the ring of protectors Hillary enjoys has no analog in party circles .
And opinion differs as to whether this group dynamic is healthy .
From a campaign standpoint , the advantages are clear .
Having a network of loyalists helps avoid the drama and disarray suffered by past nominees such as Al Gore and John Kerry , both of whom had few trusted , longtime advisers who could be counted on to put the candidate ’s interests above all else .
“ There are people who say that the downside is you shut out advice , ” says Carter Eskew , chief strategist for Gore ’s 2000 run .
“ But the problem in a campaign is never a lack of advice .
The problem is too much advice . ”
Mistakes occur in even the best - run race , he notes .
“ If you do n’t have an atmosphere of trust , it makes it difficult for the campaign to recover .
You just eat each other instead of moving on . ”
Thus far , the Hillaryland model appears to be serving its candidate well .
Recent polls show Hillary ’s unfavorable ratings staying flat and her favorables inching upward .
“ She may be managed , but the managing is working , ” says pollster and focus - group guru Frank Luntz .
Luntz ’s research indicates that Hillary ’s image as aloof , prepackaged , and calculating is beginning to fade .
“ She ’s overcome all that , ” he contends .
“ She ’s gotten good .
She has showed a level of humanity that did not exist a year ago , and that ’s why she ’s begun to rise again in most polls . ”
Of course , what serves Hillary ’s electoral prospects does n’t necessarily serve the public interest .
Although Hillarylanders are quick to catalogue their friend ’s acts of kindness , they remain loath to offer deeper insights , such as how she makes decisions , mediates conflicts , handles mistakes , or builds consensus — in other words , how she leads .
The group insists that Hillary demands to hear all sides of an issue and relishes candor , but they remain allergic to sharing specifics .
Moreover , what makes for effective campaigning can prove disastrous for governing — as the Bush - Cheney administration has demonstrated .
“ The insularity is inevitable , ” says Larry Sabato , head of the University of Virginia ’s Center for Politics .
“ There tends to be a kind of groupthink around any high public official .
People know what to say .
None of the people want to lose their status in the circle . ”
Hillaryland ’s history suggests it is not immune to such hazards .
During Hillary ’s years as First Lady , the pride her office took in its unified , leakproof subculture promoted an isolationism , even from the rest of the White House .
“ There certainly was a very distinct and not even particularly cordial relationship between Mrs. Clinton ’s and President Clinton ’s staff , ” understates Harold Ickes , a longtime adviser to both Clintons , who was one of the few to move easily between the two camps .
“ We were bossy , and we were controlling , ” allows Lattimore .
“ There was sort of an air of ‘ We know what ’s best , ’ when you may not always know what ’s best . ”
As a result , he says , “ you shut off access to other ideas , and you do n’t trust others . ”
Certainly , Hillary ’s antagonism toward anyone she viewed as not on her team helped undermine her health - care crusade , during which she declared war on legislators of her own party .
Likewise , her impulse toward secrecy underlay some of the costliest missteps of her husband ’s tenure , including the refusal to release Whitewater documents in that scandal ’s early days .
Hillarylanders , naturally , reject such concerns — or at least insist they are dealing with them .
“ We ’re not stupid , ” says Patti , noting that no inner circle , no matter how “ fabulous , ” can run a presidential campaign alone .
“ We ’re smart enough to know we ’ve got to bring people in , ” agrees Tanden , ticking off a handful of outside hires , including deputy campaign manager Mike Henry .
As for a Hillary administration , the candidate herself has said she made mistakes during her time as First Lady , says Patti .
“ She learned from them .
And when she ’s president , she wo n’t do it again . ”
That said , do n’t look for a cultural overhaul of Hillaryland anytime soon .
Most members dispute the basic premise that their group is secretive — as opposed to “ highly disciplined ” — much less that it needs to loosen up either now or once in the White House .
“ I understand what the read is out there on us , ” says Patti .
But on the whole , she contends , the campaign ’s code of honor “ is for the better , not for the worse . ”

Not every American wears a military uniform .
But every American has a role to play in protecting our homeland –not just from Muslim terrorists , but from their financiers , their public relations machine , their sharia - pimping activists , the anti-war goons , the civil liberties absolutists , and the academic apologists for our enemies .
The Left greets such a commitment with mockery and derision , preferring instead to suck its collective thumb , play the grievance card , and engage in hindsight hypocrisy .
ARISE !
ARISE , WINGNUTTOSPHERE !
YOU HAVE YOUR ENEMIES LIST !
Go out and protect your homeland from the “ Muslim terrorists , but from their financiers , their public relations machine , their sharia - pimping activists , the anti-war goons , the civil liberties absolutists , and the academic apologists for our enemies . ”

CHAPTER 4
Steve Connor
The Independent
April 14 , 2008
A new form of cloning has been developed that is easier to carry out than the technique used to create
Dolly the sheep , raising fears that it may one day be used on human embryos to produce “ designer ” babies .
Scientists who used the procedure to create baby mice from the skin cells of adult animals have found it to be far more efficient than the Dolly technique , with fewer side effects , which makes it more acceptable for human use .
The mice were made by inserting skin cells of an adult animal into early embryos produced by in - vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .
Some of the resulting offspring were partial clones but some were full clones – just like Dolly .
Unlike the Dolly technique , however , the procedure is so simple and efficient that it has raised fears that it will be seized on by IVF doctors to help infertile couples who are eager to have their own biological children .
One scientist said this weekend that a maverick attempt to perform the technique on humans is now too real to ignore .
“ It ’s unethical and unsafe , but someone may be doing it today , ” said Robert Lanza , chief scientific officer of American biotechnology company Advanced Cell Technology .
“ Cloning is n’t here now , but with this new technique we have the technology that can actually produce a child .
If this was applied to humans it would be enormously important and troublesome , ” said Dr Lanza , whose company has pioneered developments in stem cells and cell reprogramming .

You ’d think that if a company treats its employees well ( a lot better than their competitors ) and gets great business results because of it , that this company and it executives would be celebrated and praised for it .
You ’d be wrong .
The New York Times has a great article about Costco , the huge American chain of supermarkets who spend much more on their employees than their main competitors :
Costco ’s average pay , for example , is $ 17 an hour , 42 percent higher than its fiercest rival , Sam ’s Club .
And Costco ’s health plan makes those at many other retailers look Scroogish .
According to Costco ’s CEO Jim Sinegal , this makes good business sense :
Good wages and benefits are why Costco has extremely low rates of turnover and theft by employees , he said .
And Costco ’s customers , who are more affluent than other warehouse store shoppers , stay loyal because they like that low prices do not come at the workers ’ expense .
“ This is not altruistic , ” he said .
“ This is good business . ”
The results are pretty impressive :
Costco ’s stock price has risen more than 10 percent in the last 12 months , while Wal - Mart ’s has slipped 5 percent .
Costco shares sell for almost 23 times expected earnings ; at Wal - Mart the multiple is about 19 .
So how do stock analysts react to this ?
They tell Costco to start treating their employees worse :
Emme Kozloff , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company , faulted Mr. Sinegal as being too generous to employees , noting that when analysts complained that Costco ’s workers were paying just 4 percent toward their health costs , he raised that percentage only to 8 percent , when the retail average is 25 percent .
“ He has been too benevolent , ” she said .
“ He ’s right that a happy employee is a productive long - term employee , but he could force employees to pick up a little more of the burden . ”
This makes zero sense to me – but it illustrates two things perfectly :
Traditional business thinking in some areas still regards employees as resources , that like any other corporate item must be bought as cheaply as possible .
Executives who believe in treating employees well are faced with pressure from analysts and the stock market to stop doing so and start being more like anyone else – regardless of the results their strategy has been getting them so far .
This is partly why Jim Goodnight , the CEO and owner of software company SAS Institute refuses to take his company public ; he knows that it would become much more difficult to keep SAS employees as happy as they currently are ( read about how SAS keep their employees happy ) .
One company did manage to go public and keep their identity : Google .
When they announced their IPO , founders Brinn and Page made it very clear that they would continue to run the company their way .
They promised to go on treating their employees extremely well and making long - term decisions rather than living from quarter to quarter .
If investors didnt care for that , they were kindly requested to take their money elsewhere .
Google being Google , investors flocked to buy the stock anyway – less famous companies might not get away with this approach .
To me , it makes perfect sense that treating employees well makes them happy and that happy companies make more money – and this is backed up by many studies .
To give one example , the 100 best companies to work for in the US , have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of 3 .
It ’s time that investors and stock analysts realized this and started demanding of companies , that they make their employees happy .
This not only increases profits , it ’s one of the best and most efficient ways to do so .
UPDATE : Turns out the highly up - to - date article from the NY times I reference is 2 years old .
So much for my amazing powers of observation :o)
Fortunately the tendency still holds and Costco still treat their people better AND outperform Walmart on the stock market .

Second - grade teacher Diane Arciero waves her hand – draped in a homemade , white bunny puppet – from side to side in time to " If You 're Happy and You Know It " playing on her classroom 's CD player .
As the song reaches its familiar refrain , the 24 students in her class at Boston 's Hugh R. O'Donnell Elementary School join in singing with her and the bunny : " Where do you start your letter ?
At the top ! " they shout , pointing index fingers in the air in unison .
It 's hardly the handwriting instruction most American adults grew up with , but cursive traditionalists are happy to see any type of instruction .
Their revered written art is an endangered species given the rise of computers , the growing proportion of class time spent preparing for standardized tests , and the increasing perception that cursive writing is a difficult and pointless exercise .
Yet new evidence suggests there are benefits to mastering this skill – including higher SAT scores – that do n't appear until long after traditional instruction ends in fifth grade .
It 's a controversial claim .
Cursive 's proponents point to less - practical benefits as well .
The romantic allure , for one .
" When you look in Martha Stewart Weddings magazine , you do n't see printed invitations , " says Janie Cravens , who taught for 25 years in Alabama and Georgia .
" Despite what many people seem to think these days , there 's still demand for calligraphers and people who can write in cursive beautifully . "
She is vice president of the International Association of Master Penmen , Engrossers , and Teachers of Handwriting based in Webster , N.Y .
" You still need to be able to write a signature and a personal thank - you note as well as read cursive , " says Cathy Van Haute , a pediatric occupational consultant .
And " you ca n't tell me everyone has easy access to a computer . "
Robert Martin , principal of O'Donnell Elementary , agrees .
" It 's a dangerous path to go down if the only way you can communicate or record information is electronically or with printed letters .
Cursive teaches things like how letters connect and a different type of hand - eye coordination that 's important . "
Cursive enthusiasts also point to recent College Board data on the new writing section of the SATs , introduced in 2006 .
The data indicate that the 15 percent of students who wrote their essay in cursive did slightly better than those who used some other type of handwriting .
Cursive proponents say this is because those writing in cursive could write faster , allowing them to write longer essays .
Steve Graham is skeptical of such a conclusion .
The special education professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tenn. , says " It 's like saying there 's been a rise in peanut butter sales in New York and a rise in mental illness , therefore peanut butter causes mental illness , " he says .
Professor Graham says the issue is n't what kind of handwriting is taught , but that children learn to be fluent in some type of transcription .
He points to studies where two groups of people were given the same essay to grade .
One group got an essay written in poor , but legible handwriting ; the other , an essay in more attractive handwriting ( not necessarily cursive ) .
The essay with the more attractive handwriting received a better grade .
But the most efficient way for anyone , including children , to record their thoughts , Graham says , is at a keyboard .
He recommends more elementary schools buy computers with keyboards designed for children 's hands .
Typing should be a key way that children communicate .
" Your hands are n't fast enough to keep up with your mind , " Graham says , " especially for a first grader who can write between nine and 18 letters a minute .
Typing uses a different , slightly easier motor skill .
If they spend less time thinking about their handwriting and more time writing , ... they will have longer compositions and better grammar and planning . "
Others share his sentiment that teaching cursive should not be sacrosanct .
" Schools are re­­flective of our society in general , " says Barbara Willer , president of the National Association for the Education of Young Children , an advocacy group in Washington , D.C. " We spend less time doing things like writing notes to each other since there are other tools available to us to communicate , and curriculums need to reflect that . "
Kate Gladstone is a " handwriting repair expert " in New York .
She is not surprised to see cursive going the way of the dinosaur , with only 15 percent of adults using cursive after high school .
She 's not disappointed .
She disagrees with the idea that students should first learn to print and then to write in cursive .
" You do n't teach someone English by first teaching them Chinese , " Ms. Glad­stone says .
" We need to decide what the best way to handwrite is and just teach that . "
That does not sit well with cursive traditionalists .
" Hand­writing is an emotionally charged issue , " Gladstone adds .
" I get letters from people calling me anti-American because I do n't like what they think of as ' proper ' cursive . "
Gladstone promotes italic cursive , which she says is the fastest , most natural , and most easily readable form of handwriting .
It 's also the easiest and quickest to teach children , she says .
She also claims it 's the fastest - growing way to teach handwriting : 7 percent of students are learning this method , compared with 1 percent ten years ago .
For homeschoolers , that number is 1 in 3 , she says .
She recommends traditional cursive be an elective that children could take after elementary school if they wanted to .
That idea has no appeal for O'Donnell Elementary 's Dr. Martin .
Back when he was a middle - school principal , he realized many students could n't read cursive , let alone write it .
" I said , ' If I ever get to be an elementary school principal , I 'm doing something about this , ' " he says .
That 's why he recently introduced Handwriting Without Tears and the " magic bunny " to his school , which he found to be an effective and fun method .
" We 're used to thinking about nuns rapping the knuckles of kids who could n't write the perfectly shaped letter ....
I remember when I was a kid , we had the Palmer Method .... "
He recalls the rote cursive instruction and copying upper - and lower - case letters pinned to a board at the front of the classroom .
The Palmer and Zaner - Bloser penmanship methods ruled the day for decades .
Students spent 45 minutes every day on handwriting .
Penmanship was a separate grade on report cards .
Today , handwriting instruction might get 10 or 15 minutes a few times a week .
Keyboarding skills are taught much earlier , now .
But in this era of standardized testing , Gladstone says , teachers need to train their charges to express themselves quickly with a pen or pencil .
And that means italic cursive , to her .
" Students need to be able to write about 100 letters a minute on these tests , " she says , " but I know a lot of high schoolers can only do 30 per minute . "
It may be too late to halt cursive 's decline .
Fewer and fewer teachers today know how to write cursive themselves .
" I 've actually seen teachers give cursive instruction by saying , ' Just follow the book , ' " Gladstone says .
" And when a child asks the teacher to demonstrate it herself , she 'll say , ' I 'll try , but I 'm really not so good at this . '
How can we expect kids to learn cursive if the teachers have trouble with it ? "
A recent study Graham conducted on handwriting instruction found that only 12 percent of teachers had taken a course in how to teach handwriting .
Instead of focusing on what type of handwriting is best , Graham suggests that schools concentrate on improving students ' handwriting , period , whatever it is .
" Two out of three kids in this country do not write well enough for their classroom work , " he says .
" Handwriting is a small part of the overall writing picture . "

“ The basic goal of the bill is to make sure patients and staff can enter reproductive health facilities without being obstructed , intimidated and harassed , ” said Representative Carl M. Sciortino Jr. , a Democrat who is one of the bill ’s sponsors .
“ Current law is completely unenforceable and did not protect patients and staff the way it intended . ”
Opponents of the new bill say it violates free speech rights .
“ There ’s no question there will be litigation , ” said Marie Sturgis , the executive director of Massachusetts Citizens for Life .
“ This certainly clashes with First Amendment rights , and is something we should all be concerned about . ”
The state ’s Supreme Judicial Court upheld the constitutionality of buffer zones in 2001 after the current law was challenged .
Proponents say the zones are meant to protect patients and staff members from unwanted attention .
“ We ’re trying to have a very small , but important , zone of safety for patients and staff who are entering these facilities , ” said Kelly O’Bryan , the political director for Naral Pro-Choice Massachusetts .
“ We ’re not trying to silence them at all . ”

Despite a new embassy , the Baghdad posting is not popular
About 250 foreign service staff are to be told they are " prime candidates " for nearly 50 jobs , state department human resources director Harry Thomas said .
If too few people volunteer , some will be ordered to go and risk dismissal if they refuse , Mr Thomas said .
Iraq postings have previously been filled on a voluntary basis .
Vietnam precedent
Mr Thomas said he hoped enough diplomats would volunteer to fill the one - year postings but that " we have many options , including dismissal from the foreign service " .
The " prime candidates " will be informed by post on Monday and have 10 days to reply .
To sweeten the deal , an attractive financial package is being offered as well as a generous leave allowance .
The Baghdad embassy is considered a hardship posting by US diplomats because of the security risks and because spouses and children must be left at home .
American diplomats have been forced to work in undesirable postings before .
Some were given no choice but to take postings in some African countries in the 1970s and 1980s and in 1969 an entire class of new foreign service officers was sent to Vietnam .
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) — a pro-gun- rights , anti-abortion , anti-war libertarian presidential candidate — has attracted an almost cultish devotion among his young supporters .

Libertarian Paul wins young minds
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) — a pro-gun- rights , anti-abortion , anti-war libertarian presidential candidate — has attracted an almost cultish devotion among his young supporters .
These are folks who do n’t just show up for Paul .
They show up against everyone else .
Advertisement
Whether in Gainesville , Fla. — where four hardy Paul backers stood outside Fred Thompson ’s campaign bus on a football Saturday , hoisting signs and receiving taunts from inebriated tailgaters — or in Iowa City , where a group of Paul devotees had a shouting contest with Rudy Giuliani backers following a rally at the student union , the congressman ’s believers are nothing if not committed .
Even derisive jeers of “ RuPaul ” from the other Republicans ’ young supporters do n’t lessen their ardor .
Paul , a candidate who proposes eliminating the Federal Reserve and personal income tax — issues widely viewed as settled since their creation in 1913 — would hardly seem the obvious choice for these young voters .
But his cadre of Web - savvy young supporters is intensely dedicated , even if small in numbers — despite the fact that Paul languishes near the bottom of national and early - primary - state polls .
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads among young Republicans in Iowa and New Hampshire , according to those same polls , for example , but Paul matches him in online social networking , college chapters and student fundraising .
Paul ’s biggest Facebook group boasts more than 34,000 members , compared with about 16,000 in Romney ’s largest group .
( Politico asked the four leading Republican presidential campaigns about their youth programs , but only Romney ’s responded in time for this article . )
Paul claims to have 250 campus groups , compared with Romney ’s 200 or so .
And Paul is the only candidate making much use of the online tool Meetup .
( In fact , his enthusiastic online supporters have become so ubiquitous that the popular conservative blog Redstate banned new users from “ shilling ” for him . )
So why has he attracted such passionate young backers ?
“ It ’s his principled politics , ” said Dallas Moorhead , 24 , who quit his job in Indiana and moved cross-country to volunteer full - time at Paul campaign ’s headquarters above a dry cleaner in suburban Virginia .
Moorhead epitomizes the typical young Paul acolyte :
He is disenchanted with the phoniness of conventional politicians and , as a states - rights Goldwater conservative , decries the “ neo- con ” turn of the Bush administration .
“ A lot of students , because of the latest administration , are fed up with talking points , ” he said , ticking off the war in Iraq and spending as his primary policy disappointments .
But Paul ’s campaign has not simply taken an “ if you build it , they will come ” attitude toward young supporters .
His is the only Republican presidential campaign with a full - time national youth outreach director , Jeff Frazee , 24 .
And Moorhead soon will join the staff to assist Frazee in online organizing .
The work has paid off .
Frazee said that of Paul ’s $ 8 million in total donations , $ 100,000 has come from students alone .
That ’s a much higher proportion than the $ 180,000 that Romney raised from students — of about $ 45 million total from outside donors .
Moorhead , like many young Paul supporters , does not define himself as a libertarian .
Rather , he describes himself as “ very conservative ” and , among other things , shares Paul ’s opposition to abortion , preferring ( like Paul ) that it be adjudicated at the state rather than the federal level .
Similarly , Lauren Drew , a 21 - year - old senior at George Washington University who runs Paul ’s Northern Virginia Meetup group , calls herself “ an old - style conservative . ”
Like many Paul supporters , Drew says that she will not vote for a major - party candidate if Paul loses the primary .
She hopes he would run as a third - party candidate — otherwise , she said , she will write him in , if she even votes at all .
Paul told Politico recently that he has “ no intention of running as a third - party candidate ” if he does n’t win the GOP nomination .
( He was the Libertarian Party candidate for president in 1988 . )
Before an appearance at American University in Washington , Paul said he would endorse the candidate who “ promises to get us out of Iraq and support liberty at home . ”
( At the moment , no other Republican candidate has signed up for a withdrawal from Iraq . )
Though Paul defines himself as a libertarian and attributes the dedication of his young supporters to libertarian positions — such as allowing people to opt out of Social Security and Medicare — many libertarian pundits say Paul is n’t in sync with younger , more “ modern ” libertarians .
“ He ’s sort of an old - style , old - right libertarian candidate , ” explained Brink Lindsey , a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute .
Paul departs from younger libertarians with his opposition to abortion rights and free trade agreements , for example , Lindsey said .
But if it ’s not the policies , what is it about Paul that so attracts the young ?
His perceived integrity , said Nick Gillespie , the editor of the libertarian magazine Reason .
“ He has a set of principles applied consistently .
He ’s not a bullshit artist , ” said Gillespie , who contrasted Paul ’s plainspoken approach with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani ’s waffling on abortion .
“ I think that ’s very attractive to younger voters who are too stupid to realize that ’s not how politics works . ”
And being the only Republican presidential candidate to oppose the Iraq war is guaranteed to win him young fans .
“ Wars always affect young people more than old people , ” Gillespie noted .
Some of Paul ’s young right - wing supporters dismiss the idea of voting for Democratic candidates who opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2002 — namely Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois .
But Stephen Rose , a freshman at Metropolitan State College of Denver who belongs to Paul ’s Facebook group , said he might support Obama in the general election if Paul loses the Republican nomination .
Rose considers himself a libertarian and said he supports
Paul because of his positions on the war and personal freedom .
However they label themselves , Paul ’s young supporters who heard him speak at American University in Washington last week were obviously excited to see him .
Applause lines included Iraq , Paul ’s proposal to eliminate the selective service system and thus prevent a draft , and Paul ’s pledge to end federal restrictions on medical marijuana .
Will Haun , president of the College Republicans chapter at American University , observed that Paul ’s supporters there seem more enthusiastic than those of other GOP candidates .
“ You do n’t have to be as enthusiastic about a front - runner .
But Paul is distinctive , ” Haun said .
Picking up on a recent theme of the Republican primary debates , Haun said “ one of the critiques you could make of the front - runners is that they spend all their time criticizing Hillary Clinton , ” the Democratic senator from New York and her party ’s front - runner for the nomination .
“ I need a reason to vote for you , not a reason to vote against her , ” Haun said .
“ Congressman Paul ’s message gives his supporters a reason to vote for him . ”
Oct. 26 , 2007  -- Boston Red Sox and Colorado Rockies fans may be pitted against each other as their teams battle in the 2007 World Series , but for a brief moment Thursday night , all of America was cheering for a stolen base .
The uniting factor ?
Tacos .
In the latest in a long tradition of sports promotions aimed at matching sports fans and brands , fast food giant Taco Bell promised free tacos to everybody in America if a base was stolen during the World Series .
Neither the Red Sox nor Rockies are particularly speedy teams , but the promo was n't much of a gamble .
There has been at least one stolen base in every World Series matchup since 1990 .
Now , thanks to Boston 's rookie center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury , whose second - base theft did n't even draw a throw , next week all of America will get to enjoy " Taco Tuesday . "
The " Steal a Base , Steal a Taco " deal by Taco Bell , part of Yum Brands Inc. , will allow customers at any of the chain 's participating 5,800 outlets to cash in on a free crunchy seasoned beef taco -- valued at 77 cents .
Of course , with any free lunch , there 's a catch : Customers may only collect on the promotion between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. local time .
It 's a window that may benefit the Bell .
" It might cost Taco Bell more if they did it between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. , " one player in the Red Sox bullpen reportedly joked .
Win the Series , Get a Couch
Taco Bell is n't the only company with a promotion tied to the Fall Classic .
Thousands of Red Sox faithful stand to win millions of dollars in free furniture thanks to a promotion by a Boston - area furniture chain .
In March and April , when postseason baseball was just a dream , Jordan 's Furniture ran a promotion offering full refunds to everyone who bought any sofa , dining room table , bed or mattress during a specific time period if the Red Sox win the World Series .
Nearly 30,000 people bought furniture , and now Jordan 's might have to refund millions of dollars .
The company wo n't say how much , but a conservative estimate by ABC News suggests the promotion could be worth $ 15 million in free furniture if the Red Sox come through .
" I 've always been a Red Sox fan , lived in Boston my whole life , " said Eliot Tatelman , president and CEO of Jordan's .
" I said , ' what a great way to support the team , what a great way to tie ourselves in with the Red Sox and what a great way to get everybody rooting for the Red Sox and sell a lot of furniture . ' "
So , with all that money on the line , you would think that Tatelman is rooting for the Colorado Rockies , right ?
No way .
Jordan's — like most companies that run such promotions — has taken out prize indemnification insurance , which covers the payouts if the team wins the World Series .
" We 're rooting for the Red Sox , too , " Tatelman said .
Mark Gilmartin is president of Odds on Promotions , a Reno , Nev. , company that underwrites such insurance policies .
Though he did n't do a policy for Jordan 's , the furniture store sought a quote from him .
Gilmartin would have insured the contest for 30 percent of the value of all the furniture given away .
Using the conservative $ 15 million prize tally , that means the insurance would have cost Jordan 's $ 4.5 million .
Whatever the cost , Tatelman said it was worth it .
Not only did he get customers in the store , but they bought furniture .
And a lot of what they purchased is not covered by the promotion .
If somebody bought a couch and a love seat , only the couch would be free .
If they bought a dining room table , chairs and maybe some china to go with it , only the table would be free .
" The Red Sox winning a world championship , and free furniture — I mean , it does n't get any better , " Tatelman said .
Tanya Kerrigan , of Cohasset , Mass. , is a Yankees fan from New York who married an ardent Red Sox fan .
" Born and Bred in Dorchester , Mass . , " she told ABC News in an e-mail .
" When my husband suggested we buy our couch at Jordan 's and possibly benefit from a freebie if the Red Sox won , I said , ' Sure , we need the couch , but there is n't a snowballs chance in hell that the Red Sox will win the series . '
Well there is only one thing that this Yankees fan is saying now : Let 's go Red Sox . "

INTRODUCTION
The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed HR 1955 , titled the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 .
It was passed with 404 votes in favor .
A close reading within an historical context — keeping especially in mind the Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and Presidential Executive Orders , pursuant to which the government has engaged in massive surveillance of its own citizens , as well as detentions , extraordinary renditions , assassinations , and torture — leads me to the following conclusions :
This is a " Thought Crime " bill of the type so often discussed in an Orwellian context .
It specifically targets the civilian population of the United States .
It defines " Violent Radicalization " as promoting any belief system that the government considers to be extremist .
" Homegrown Terrorism " and " Violent Radicalization " are defined as thought crimes .
Since the bill does not provide a specific definition of extremist belief system , it will be whatever the government at any given time deems it to be .
A few extracts of the Bill are presented below to show you its tone or " flavor . "
" (2 ) VIOLENT RADICALIZATION -
The term `violent radicalization ’ means the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system … to advance political , religious , or social change . "
SECTION 899B .
FINDINGS .
" (3 ) The Internet has aided in facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process in the United States by providing access to broad and constant streams of terrorist - related propaganda to United States citizens . "
" (6 ) The potential rise of self radicalized , unaffiliated terrorists domestically cannot be easily prevented through traditional Federal intelligence or law enforcement efforts , and requires the incorporation of State and local solutions . "
Section 899D of the bill establishes a Center for the Study of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism in the United States .
This will be an institution affiliated with the Department of Homeland Security .
It will study and determine how to detain thought criminals .
THIS LEGISLATION ENDS THE POSSIBILITY OF A CULTURE OF REASON .
It is an attempt at legislative lobotomy of conscience .
It aims to eviscerate ethical sensibilities of an entire culture .
Having usurped the power of war and peace , life and death , the Corporatocracy now bludgeons even the thought of speaking for conscience .
This is State murder of the mind .
It is just too awesomely obscene for words .
It exceeds not only the scope of my vocabulary , but my imagination as well .
The minions and hired agents of politicians are free to murder , rape and pillage on government hire using our money , but to imagine alternatives to them and the degraded , psychopathic political " leaders " who design and perpetrate these atrocities is legislated as a thought crime !
This is the legislated , politically promulgated end of man as a thinking , self - directed being .
Surely this must be the outer limit of " positive law , " that is , statutory laws passed by " Lawmakers . "
It further entrenches the Power Elite as separate from and above their " subjects . "
It clearly demonstrates the paranoid delusions of the Establishment , pursuant to which it legislates a massive defense mechanism to protect itself from the populace that it subjugates .
I use these terms deliberately , because the so - called freedom of the vote has turned out to be a big con game .
It is only the " freedom " to choose one set of thieves over the other .
The blue suits or the red suits … all of them manufactured suits of the corporations .
Following in the train of this legislation will doubtless be internal travel documents , neighborhood snoops and spies , rewards granted for turning in politically incorrect thought criminals , mass civilian detention centers — in short , the whole totalitarian control mechanism that we associate with the SS , KGB and other code words of criminal regimes .
There will be " re- programming / rehabilitation " centers to correct errant free thinkers .
Take note that the Department of Homeland Security already has more than 750,000 persons on its watch list .
For a glimpse of past as prologue , read Solzhenitsyn .
Who Will Be Thought Police and Under What Standards ?
Who will define radical thought , and by what standards ?
For example , how about the reported millions who believe that 9 - 11 was an inside job , citing a mass of evidence from eye witnesses , physicists , engineers , and recorded statements such as " We pulled it , " essentially a confession by the building ’s owner of the planned demolition of Building 7 ?
Will the writings of John Perkins in Confessions of An Economic Hit Man and The Secret History of The American Empire be thought crimes ?
Will this very essay be a thought crime ?
What about Operation Northwoods , pursuant to which the Joint Chiefs of the United States planned for innocent people to be shot on American streets , for boats carrying passengers to be sunk on the high seas , for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched within the country , and for other depraved acts conceived in the minds of government - hired psychopaths ?
Previously top - secret documents about this were released on 18 November 1997 and can be researched at www.wikipedia.org.
Evidently , members of the Establishment will be permitted to engage in thought crime .
Soon enough , we will all be killing each other , and the statement of Mohandas Gandhi will be borne out : " An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind . "
Will thinking about cleansing the national soul of our atrocities — of Iraq , Guantanamo , Abu Gharib , the advanced plans underway to nuke Iran , the crimes of Blackwater murderers , the government ’s domestic coercion and violence — be " Thought Crimes ? "
Will it be thought crime to conceive of a domestic Truth and Reconciliation Commission pursuant to which high government officials are brought to book for crimes against humanity ?
Will it be " radicalization " to think of alternatives to a government of , by , and for the Corporatocracy , which accumulates its vast wealth through the blood money of endless war ?
What about imagination - consideration of a non-coercive society of free individuals acting in voluntary cooperation , what is commonly referred to as anarchy ?
Will it be radical to conceive of preventing the Cheney - Bush cabal from launching WWIII and the incineration of earth through a false flag operation against Iran ?
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF OUR GOVERNMENT
BECAUSE WE PAY FOR IT
It has taken me too many years — and too much income tax — to come to the awful realization that these " public servants " are only hired mouthpieces and puppets of the Money Powers who operate behind the scenes to orchestrate war , to coordinate the Military Industrial Complex , the Homeland Security Complex , the NGO Help - The - Poor Complex , the " Third World Corporate Development " Complex .
In short , the Exploitation Complex .
The roaring inside me is about the self - disgust at living by the whims of Nice Government Men and their intellectual and financial pimps — men who , for just one example , can force starvation upon Indian farmers by their money printing press maneuvers to save their own hides from the overreach of blind greed .
Men like those in Goldman Sachs who have the power to bail out their own companies and pay billions in bonuses while manipulating currencies such that basic food staples become priced out of reach of the rural Indian poor .
Let our excuse for the sorry state in which we find ourselves be not ignorance , for history is quite clear to those who would study .
I quote founding father James Madison , " History records that money changers have used every form of abuse , intrigue , deceit , and violent means possible , to maintain their control over governments , by controlling money and its issuance . "
A more honest excuse would be our own greed and laziness .
The quick buck .
Buy now , pay later .
Statement of Conscientious Objection
HR 1955 as recently passed by the House of Representatives is in effect a Thought Crime Prevention Bill .
This action simply stops my mind .
It can not be absorbed .
This ultimate Police State freezes my imagination .
This newest version of draconian legislation on thought control is where Jeff Knaebel says enough is enough .
Speaking truth to Power , I say , I am not your puppet .
I declare my self - ownership .
Come and get me if you wish .
If you wish to own my body , you will have to imprison it .
I am breaking the paper chains by which I have allowed you to enslave me .
Imagine with me for a moment ( it may not yet be a thought crime ) .
I say to Dick Cheney , " I refuse to obey .
Come and get me , boss .
Come alone —
I ’ll not run , and I am unarmed and harmless .
Meet me in yonder open field . "
Standing in front of him , I remove my shirt , challenging him to do likewise .
To prove his manhood equal , he follows along until we stand facing each other naked in the open field .
I ask , " Now , what is your business with me ? "
You see , it is all a mind game .
The government is powerless before our non-cooperation .
Of course , although an abstraction , it is a heavily armed abstraction .
This argues for the right to bear arms and a well - armed citizenry in the American tradition .
But if the mind behind the gun is cowardly and subdued , the gun is of no use .
I suggest that nonviolent civil disobedience has proven to be a more effective method of regaining control of our lives .
There would be significant loss of life , but much less than with an armed struggle .
Is murder an act that involves the human conscience ?
Can any other hear the voice of my inner conscience ?
Then , how can any such other claim the power to " represent " me in choosing to kill ?
How can such other " represent " me in determining which of my thoughts is criminal ?
To say , or even to imply , that these people " represent " me cannot be described as an obscenity .
It is an absurdity .
Really , I should laugh .
Instead it generates a roaring inside me — the inner roar of a man who would be free .
THIS IS MY PLACE OF " LIVE FREE OR DIE . "
One cannot deal with this except to speak out and be willing to put his life on the line .
One must resist this legislation and this government , or else surrender his humanity and become a dead thing .
This is the place where the soles of my feet meet the path of Liberty .
This is where Jeff Knaebel refuses to renew his " permission to live " identification documents pursuant to which Big Brother tracks him like an owned domestic animal .
Any situation in which I am not free to leave means that my presence is by coercion or threat of coercion .
If one can not leave some " place " except by permission of the " owners " ( passport ) , then he is a slave .
To learn more about issues of expatriation and " man without a country , " visit my website at www.statelessfreedom.org.
I was never the property even of my biological father , leave aside the absurdly stupid abstract concept of Nations — bounded by arbitrary lines drawn on maps — across which opposing armies of blood relations gun down the other .
My body is not the property of the U.S. Government .
I will challenge the U.S. Government for ownership of my body , with my body itself .
My mind will be forever free .
I did not ask for US citizenship , and I will not accept its rules even if forced upon me .
Any situation in which I am not free to leave means that my presence is by coercion or threat of coercion .
If I can not leave some " place " except by permission of the " owners " ( passport ) , then I am a slave .
The US State does not own the land called America , and it does not own anybody who was born there or lives there .
No bureaucrat has the right to define who I am — and the murder of which other person I may be forced to finance — by his stamp upon some arbitrary piece of paper .
I belong to none , other than Almighty Creation .
I claim my freedom to respect the lives of others , as I would be respected .
Freedom to do no harm , and to eschew violence .
Freedom to express compassion in action .
Freedom to support life .
Freedom not to finance murder .
No other can hear the voice of my conscience , let alone " represent " it , or speak for it .
My conscience will be muffled by no person and by no law .
Nor will I ever knowingly aggress against another .
It Is Man ’s Duty To Love .
It now must be of the " tough love " variety .
We must see clearly and face bravely the reality of what we continue to create for ourselves .
We must take up tough ethical positions .
We have proved again and again , over spans of millennia , that any kind of violent revolution will only turn the wheel of violence another revolution , around and around .
If we will but cease to destroy , we may live .
We cannot negotiate with melting glaciers .
Perhaps we can negotiate with the storms of insatiable greed and desire raging within our own minds .
Perhaps we can come out of our addiction to more , more and faster , faster .
The revolution we must undertake to save ourselves is a revolution within our own minds toward loving kindness , truth , and respect for life .
To those who would accept a legislated statutory slavery , I say — may your shackles bind you without too much pain .
May you go quietly into oblivion , and may you not burden me with the memory that you ever stood a watch with me on Spaceship Earth .

The Best of Jeff Knaebel
A grainy video of four masked vandals running through an art gallery in Sweden , smashing sexually explicit photographs with crowbars and axes to the strain of thundering death - metal music , was posted on YouTube Friday night .
This was no joke or acting stunt .
It was what actually happened on a quiet Friday afternoon in Lund , a small university town in southern Sweden where “ The History of Sex , ” an exhibition of photographs by the New York artist Andres Serrano , had opened two weeks earlier .
Around 3:30 , half an hour before closing , four vandals wearing black masks stormed into a space known as the Kulturen Gallery while shouting in Swedish , “ We do n’t support this , ” plus an expletive .
They pushed visitors aside , entered a darkened room where some of the photographs were displayed and began smashing the glass protecting the photographs and then hacking away at the prints .
The bumpy video , evidently shot with a hand - held camera by someone who ran into the gallery with the attackers , intersperses images of the Serrano photographs with lettered commentary in Swedish like “ This is art ? ” before showing the vandals at work .
Howdy …
Let me share with you an important re-discovery I was just bludgeoned with about the nature what is “ true ” , and what is manufactured bullshit .
It ’s a version of “ truth ” I believe is critical for all marketers and seekers of success ( both in life and in biz ) … and yet remains shockingly elusive and hard to nail down .
Why ?
Because some very dedicated people do not want you to get hip about it .
Here ’s the story : Technically , I just got to share a stage with Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines / Virgin Records this past weekend .
Maybe “ virtually ” is the better word , though .
I was in Phoenix , at Joe Polish ’s stunning Super Conference , and I pulled a shift onstage chatting with Joe and then putting the audience of 700 + though their paces writing some headlines .
Branson was “ on ” the following day , via satellite .
Very cool technology — totally live ( well , almost , with a 3 - second delay bouncing the images and sound off the orbiting junkpile up there ) — and amazingly intriguing for a live audience .
I had no idea a real audience could be held captive so effectively by someone ’s huge head on a screen , broadcasting from half a world away .
But it works .
And I gotta tell you : I was prepared to NOT like Branson , and was ready to bolt the room the second he bored me .
Why ?
I ’ll get to that in a moment .
But by the third or fourth minute of his talk , I found myself really liking this guy … and thoroughly enjoying both what he had to say , and how he said it .
By the time he finished his “ speech ” and generously began to answer questions from the audience , I felt bad that he and I would never have the opportunity to hang out together .
I felt that simpatico with him .
Later on , I thought about my prior feelings about him … and how they had been formed .
Bottom line : I was duped .
By the media , and probably also by corporate monsters who hate his message of independence and responsibility for taking care of the world .
The Man ( the icon of the beasts who control this world ) loathes rich people who attain success by alternative means , and then insult the Power Structure by challenging the “ pillage and rape ” methods they use to acquire and hold dominion over markets , populations and the “ reality ” most of us experience through media .
( The beasts really , really , really want us sedated and mollified by the value - less aspects of such things as Youtube and Facebook , which act as opiates to keep the bulk of society from questioning anything The Man is doing . )
( There IS some value to Youtube and Facebook , of course … but they ’re not exactly sterling examples of enlightenment . )
Branson ’s main ventures have all been centered on his experiences in modern life … and how he found them lacking and in dire need of updating or complete revolutions .
Air travel has sucked for several generations , and so he created Virgin Airlines , which apparently rocks .
( I ’ve never had the pleasure , but my partner Stan gives it 10 out of 10 stars . )
He created his record label to fill the huge gap of taste and relevance that the Big Ugly Record Companies left open … and they have despised him for it ever since .
Now , of course , he ’s doing amazing things to try and make the world better … and The Man is apoplectic with rage for the effort .
( Branson had Nelson Mandella and Kofi Anan of the UN ready to go to Iraq and convince Saddam to step down and go live in exile in Liberia — which would have been a bloodless , peaceful coup that accomplished everything the Bush administration said it wanted — but the day they were ready to leave for Iraq , the war started and it was too late .
I remember this getting scant media attention — at least here in the US — and being completely squelched soon after .
The Man hates being second - guessed . )
All this has reminded me , yet again , of the unpleasant responsibility of enjoying the privileges of a free society :
We can NEVER take the word of those in power as gospel … and we are saddled forever with the need to stay vigilant and challenge authority on every major point .
The media has not been totally unkind to Branson … but the general attitude about him ( if you never actually listened to his side of the story ) was skeptical and sneering .
Rich do - gooder guy , who was a self - admitted “ party animal ” , trying to ignore the rules the rest of us have to live by .
Deserves to be taken down a notch or two , the little bastard .
Which , of course , is an ABSURD notion for a guy like me to have in his head at all .
Heck …
I never play by the rules , and I distrust authority with the best of them .
In fact , my entire teaching style is centered on “ waking up ” … ditching the zombie lifestyle The Man prefers you to stumble though life with … and claiming your place at the Feast .
So what I ’ve come away with — from this little exercise in awareness — is the POWER of the media in this regard .
I had n’t bothered to go deep , and get the story myself .
To be fair , I ’m a tad busy to be doing my own research on everybody in the news … but in this case , we have a guy who is knocking himself out trying to do the right thing in many , many ways that require courage , vision and piles of his own money … and I allowed the snarling media to gobble up his basic message and keep the BEST part of it away from me .
Entirely my fault .
I dozed , and got snookered .
The truth will always be slippery , hard to nail down , and subject to misinformation and propaganda .
Still , it ’s worth remembering who ’s in charge of most of the “ news ” you are spoon - fed .
Rich people who have a stake in you NOT becoming rich , too .
They got theirs , and are n’t too happy about you getting yours .
It ’s a good thing to spend just a little more energy to get a better view of any story by uncovering alternative news outlets .
And it ’s also a good thing to remember how nasty The Man can get when riled .
I have zero interest in any kind of “ real ” fame specifically because of this .
I ’m fine with the very minor celebrity status I enjoy on the seminar circuit , and among my subscribers and clients and customers .
It ’s like having a big , raucous , fun and interesting extended family to hang out with .
But the kind of fame that would regularly get you on the front page ?
Forget it .
You instantly become canon fodder for a heartless media that does n’t care a whit about truth or serving the Greater Good .
Me ?
I ’m gonna get Branson ’s book and read it right away .
The dude has me intrigued … and I feel I owe it to him .
Stay frosty , John Carlton

How To Turn $ 60 Into $ 1000 In Three Months With Domain Names
Ex -Wife Accused of Torching Bison Head
Driving With Allah
The 5 inch fossilized tooth above is from a giant prehistoric megalodon shark , which lived between 2 to 25 million years ago , and then went extinct .
Megalodon sharks are likely the largest predatory fish to have ever lived .
The megalodon tooth above just sold on Ebay for $ 560 .
If fossilized sharks ' teeth last for 25 million years , some showing almost no signs of wear like the one above , I think it would be pretty safe to say that " sharks ' teeth are forever , " just like diamonds .
But unlike sharks ' teeth , which are bought and sold according to market conditions of supply and demand on Ebay , the supply and sale of diamonds is tightly controlled by the DeBeers Diamond cartel .
Edward Jay Epstein , wrote in this 1982 Atlantic article " But unlike sharks ' teeth , which are bought and sold according to market conditions of supply and demand on Ebay , the supply and sale of diamonds is tightly controlled by the DeBeers Diamond cartel .
Edward Jay Epstein , wrote in this 1982 Atlantic article " The Marketing of Diamonds : How a Successful Cartel Turned a Worthless Rock into a Priceless Gem " :
De Beers proved to be the most successful cartel arrangement in the annals of modern commerce .
While other commodities , such as gold , silver , copper , rubber , and grains , fluc tuate wildly in response to economic conditions of supply and demand , diamonds have continued , with few exceptions , to advance upward in price every year since the Depression .
The diamond invention is far more than a monopoly for fixing diamond prices ; it is a mechanism for converting tiny crystals of carbon into universally recognized tokens of wealth , power , and romance .
To achieve this goal , De Beers had to control demand as well as supply .
Both women and men had to be made to perceive diamonds not as marketable precious stones but as an inseparable part of courtship and married life .
To stabilize the market , De Beers had to endow these stones with a sentiment that would inhibit the public from ever reselling them .
The illusion had to be created that diamonds were forever — " forever " in the sense that they should never be resold .
Convincing people that diamonds last forever and should never be resold reinforces DeBeers ' monopoly power and helps the cartel restrict the supply of diamonds by keeping diamonds off the secondary market .
The article points out that diamond prices collapsed worldwide during the Great Depression , followed by World War II , which further depressed the diamond market until the mid-1940s .
Following WWII , De Beers needed a new slogan for diamonds , to help revitalize the demand .
It was in the late 1940s that :
A marketing copywriter came up with the caption " A Diamond Is Forever , " which was scrawled on the bottom of a picture of 2 young lovers on a honeymoon .
Even though diamonds can in fact be shattered , chipped , discolored , or incinerated to ash , the concept of eternity perfectly captured the magical qualities that the advertising agency wanted to attribute to diamonds .
Within a year , " A Diamond Is Forever " became the official motto of DeBeers .
" A Diamond Is Forever " has to be one of the most successful and clever marketing scams in the history of commerce .
After all , it 's not just diamonds that are forever : is n't a shark 's tooth forever , is n't a plain rock forever , is n't an emerald forever , are n't the coins in your pockets forever , are n't thousands of museums around the world filled with stuff that has lasted almost forever ?
And as Epstein points out , diamonds are n't really forever anyway - they can be shattered , chipped , etc .
WARSAW ( Reuters ) - News Corp has no plans to pull its television shows from iTunes like NBC Universal , but echoed the media industry ’s calls for Apple to offer more flexible pricing , a top executive said in an interview on Tuesday .

News Corp has no plans to pull its television shows from iTunes like NBC Universal , but echoed the media industry 's calls for Apple to offer more flexible pricing , a top executive said in an interview on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Handout
Many sector watchers expected News Corp and other media groups to follow NBC Universal , which said last month it would not renew a deal to sell shows on iTunes because it wanted more flexibility in offering different packages and pricing .
But Peter Chernin , News Corp ’s president and chief operating officer , said Rupert Murdoch ’s media group was not in a dispute with Apple , though it would like a bigger voice in pricing its shows .
“ Right now we have a perfectly good relationship with Apple , ” Chernin told Reuters .
“ But let me say this , we ’re the ones who should determine what the fair price for our product is , not Apple . ”
Chernin ’s decision to keep popular
Fox shows such as 24 and Prison Break on iTunes should be welcomed by Apple CEO Steve Jobs , who is facing a growing revolt by some media companies over the pricing policies for audio and video downloads .
Earlier this summer , Vivendi ’s Universal Music Group declined to sign a long - term deal , leaving open the possibility of exclusive deals with another services .
An NBC Universal spokesman said it agreed with Chernin .
“ Without question , content companies should set the wholesale price for the content they create , ” he said .
Chernin spoke with Reuters during his visit to Poland , one of Europe ’s fastest - growing media markets , where News Corp is about to relaunch a television channel in which it has a 35 percent stake and managerial control .
“ This is a market with tremendous opportunity for us , ” he said .
“ This is where News Corp tends to thrive .
You have a reasonably entrenched competition that has n’t been challenged as much as it should . ”
EMERGING MARKETS
Chernin declined to say how much News Corp. would invest to modernize Puls , which he expects to become a market leader .
Murdoch said earlier this year it had spent $ 50 million so far .
While blockbuster deals to buy Dow Jones and social networking site MySpace have dominated the headlines , News Corp also has been building its TV presence in Europe ’s emerging markets .
In Turkey , the media conglomerate is considering a bid for broadcaster ATV and Sabah newspaper , which is expected to fetch at least $ 1.1 billion .
ATV and Sabah along with other media assets are set to go on sale in November after being seized from Turkish conglomerate Ciner Group by the state Savings Deposits Insurance Fund ( TMSF ) for alleged irregularities .
“ We will certainly take a look at it ...
Whether or not we will do this ( bid ) , we will decide within a month or so , ” Chernin said .
Chernin , who oversees the operations of News Corp ’s top social networking site MySpace , also does not expect its fast - growing rival Facebook to be put up for sale any time soon .
Facebook , headed by 23 - year - old founder Mark Zuckerberg , has been steadily gaining ground on MySpace , prompting speculation that News Corp. may be interested in combining the two sites .
“ I think Mark Zuckerberg is doing just fine .
I do n’t think he has any intention of selling it , IPO’ing it or anything else , ” Chernin said .
Chernin also denied holding talks with Yahoo about capital ties , despite Murdoch ’s comments that he would consider swapping MySpace for a 25 percent stake in Yahoo .
We are being fed false and misleading information , in matters big and small .
It has come from trusted sources such as established newspapers , experienced journalists , Pulitzer Prize winners and Nobel Peace Prize winners .
It has been going on for a long time , sometimes by carelessness and sometimes by deliberate lying .
I have compiled a list of 101 such incidents .
Did you know that Time magazine and other news organizations had a Vietnamese communist on full - time staff in Viet Nam during that war ?
Do you remember that ABC , CBS and NBC have all rigged cars or trucks with explosives or other devices to make them look dangerous on TV , or that Consumer Reports lied about the Suzuki Samurai enough to put it out of business ?
Do you know that multiple " veterans " of the Viet Nam and Iraq wars who told of atrocities there were never even in the military ?
Did you realize reputable news organizations such as the Boston Globe and Reuters cannot tell the difference between a real soldier and a toy doll , commercial pornography and soldiers committing rape , a burning tire dump and a bombed building , a fired and an unfired rifle round , or footage of the North Pole and a clip from the movie Titanic ?
When it comes to President Bush , the media have lied about his National Guard service , lied about his serving a plastic turkey to troops in Iraq on Thanksgiving and then made a big deal about that phony story , lied about his speeches , quoted him by removing the words he actually used , and admitted they would use a harsher standard with him than his opponent John Kerry .
To this day , they criticize his administration 's handling of the Katrina crisis , which was actually one of the most successful rescue and recovery efforts in history , but barely mention their own huge and egregious mistakes in reporting on that event .
My original lists were published in American Thinker on August 16 and August 20 , 2007 .
Since then I have added several and subtracted a few .
The subject of my list is not just journalism , but any dishonesty as related to the public debate .
For this reason I included more than journalists .
Historians and other " non-fiction " authors especially could be included .
On a case by case basis , people of perceived moral authority and sufficient notoriety were included , such as Martin Luther King , Jr. I also needed a certain amount of clarity and credibility in the offense .
For these reasons , I removed three people from my previous lists .
Maria Bartiromo was removed because her conflict of interest was just not solid enough .
The Citicorp executive she was involved with caught greater grief than she did .
Joe Biden was removed because politicians ' speeches should be out of scope , or else the list would be nearly infinite .
Jacob Epstein was removed because , while he definitely plagiarized , his was a work of fiction with no apparent " public debate " connection .
There are multitudes of plagiarizers .
I did receive a few complaints for not having " conservatives " on the list .
There turns out to be a good reason for that : there just are n't that many who pass the criteria for clear dishonesty in the public debate .
It is probably also related to the fact that so few journalists are conservative .
Some people did send me " conservative " candidates for my list , but they told me more about the submitters than the people on the list .
I suspect Media Matters was the ultimate source of most or all of them .
Also , I just did not vet the list for political leaning ; I have no idea of the leanings of Mitch Albom , Jim Van Vliet , or a host of others on the list .
However , I did add Doug Bandow , Michael Fumento and Armstrong Williams , all for " pay for play " type offenses , and all leaning to the conservative side .
So here is the list , in alphabetical order .
And for those who do n't know , or who would love to accuse me of plagiarism , there is a source for every item in the list , embedded in the name .
Any quotes should be traceable to that source .
( I 've already been accused of plagiarism , but from those who read unauthorized copies that did not include the embedded links , instead of the original American Thinker article .
That 's right : I was accused of plagiarism because I was plagiarized . )
While I provide a source for every item , a single source is not usually sufficient to prove anything .
You might have to do some of your own searching if you remain unconvinced of a party 's guilt .
Space is limited .
The Dishonest 101
In the first commercial , shot last week in New Hampshire , voters present some of the themes of Mr. Paul ’s candidacy , including his opposition to the Iraq war and his past as a doctor in a small Texas town .
Mr. Paul , 72 , may speak like an outsider but he has represented conservative Republican districts in Texas for 10 terms , and he was the Libertarian candidate for president in 1988 .
Still , in the Republican debates , he has stood out with his emphatic antiwar , low - tax , anti-immigration , small - government views — the kind of positions that could appeal to people in a state like New Hampshire , where independent voters make up 45 percent of the electorate .
Dante J. Scala , an associate professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire , said that if the advertisement campaign was effective , it could convince more independents , libertarians and even moderate Republicans to vote for Mr. Paul .
According to a recent Marist College poll , about 15 percent of likely Republican voters in the state were undecided .
A poll released Thursday by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm College in Manchester , put Mr. Paul in fourth place in New Hampshire with 7 percent of the vote , behind Senator John McCain of Arizona ( 15 percent ) , Mr. Giuliani ( 22 percent ) and Mitt Romney ( 32 percent ) , the former governor of Massachusetts .
“ It ’s striking to me that he ’s at 7 percent without running a single TV ad in New Hampshire , ” Mr. Scala said .
“ If he starts to attract significant support among independents , then he could start to hurt Giuliani or McCain . ”
Mr. Paul ’s Republican rivals may already be taking notice of his newfound purchasing power .
During the Oct. 21 Republican debate in Florida , the other candidates treated him more gently than in previous debates , like the one in May when Mr. Giuliani admonished him for suggesting that the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 , were spurred by American policies in the Middle East .
Nick Gillespie , the editor in chief of Reason , the monthly libertarian magazine , called Mr. Paul “ a fly in the ointment ” in the Republican race .
“ Just by being out there and pushing a strict constitutional line , I think he ’s making them sweat a lot , ” Mr. Gillespie said .
“ He ’s highlighting the fact that they will say anything to get elected .
Or at least to get through the primary . ”

Boy dies after being slapped by teacher

A fourteen - year - old boy has died in New Delhi , India , allegedly as the result of having slapped by a teacher .
" Gloom prevails at the residence of Satya Prakash .
It was a kind of death no one would have imagined , " reported IBNLive , India 's English - language news channel .
" My sons fault was that he was scribbling in his notebook and writing over his teachers signature , " Ajay Prakash 's father told the Hindustan Times .
He further told IBN , " His spine snapped because of the blow and he was paralysed . "
However , there are also accounts that the boy was caught trying to forge his teacher 's signature .
The education department has refused to comment on the circumstances .
Ajay Prakesh died on the operating table two weeks after the incident .
His family claims he could have survived if the school had acted in time .
" While the family is still trying to come to terms with what really happened , the police have registered a case of attempt to culpable homicide against the teacher , " IBN reported .
Culpable homicide is roughly equivalent to manslaughter in the US .
" We are awaiting the post mortem and based on that the investigations will be furthered , " said a representative of the New Delhi police .
The following video is from IBNLive.com , broadcast on November 7 , 2007 .
Bethany Hall spotted Molly in the washing machine
Molly was saved when 11 - year - old owner Bethany Hall saw the helpless animal clawing at the inside of the washing machine door at her County Durham home .
The pet , which had crawled into the machine at the Hall family home in Meadomsley , near Consett , suffered eye damage and had breathing difficulties .
But after a course of antibiotics and physiotherapy , Molly recovered .
Bethany 's mother Sonia Hall , said : " I was in a state of panic when I saw her , but thankfully we have one of those machines that switches off easily .
' Bad way '
" Even then I had to wait two to three minutes until it drained , but on touching the glass I found it was warm so I thought she could n't possibly have survived .
" When we were finally able to open the door and move away the laundry she seemed OK as she was sitting up and meowing , but her eyes were closed . "
Molly was taken to the Prince Bishop Veterinary Hospital in nearby Leadgate .
Principal vet Jacqui Molyneux said : " Molly was brought to us in a very bad way and we thought that she would n't pull through .
However , she proved to be a real fighter and responded to the treatment incredibly well . "
Mrs Hall added : " We 'll definitely be watching her more closely after this .
The whole family think she 's a really special and a very lucky little kitten . "
Remember back when the Simpsons was funny ?
If you were n’t around in 1996 , then you do n’t .
Supposing you were , remember the episode where Smithers goes on a gay cruise and Homer takes over as Mr. Burns ’ assistant , then he punches Mr. Burns and Burns decides to take care of business for himself ?
Remember how funny it was to see someone so blinded by their own wealth and status that they had completely missed the world changing around them ?
He was disconnected and irrelevant , almost incapable of functioning in the modern world .
Remember how that was n’t funny at all because it was totally true and just happened for real ?
( DAH DAH DAHHHHNNNNNN !)
Doug Morris is the Chairmen and CEO of Universal Music Group , the largest record company in the world .
It ’s safe to say that he has more than a persuasive voice when it comes to how music is distributed , and how artists are treated .
According to an article in December ’s WIRED magazine , Morris does n’t know shit from shinola when it comes to the interborgz , and iPodz , and digical musics and such .
He seems to view the internet and digital distribution as something to be feared with ones eyes averted , much like a 17th century farmer faced with some sort of vengeful hoofed Goat - God .
The interview reminds me of Ted Stevens when he told a room full of the most powerful people in the nation that the internet was a series of tubes .
At first you ’re all , “ Awwwww , Grampa does n’t understand the internet . ”
Then you ’re all , “ Holy Shit !
“ Grampa Tubes ” is IN CHARGE of the internet !?
OMGWTFINTERNET !? ”
Joco had some thoughts about the story from a troubadour ’s perspective .
He also posted some choice quotes from the article which I will now repost ( but you should still go read them on his site and buy some of his songs . )
“ There ’s no one in the record industry that ’s a technologist , ” Morris explains .
“ That ’s a misconception writers make all the time , that the record industry missed this .
They did n’t .
They just did n’t know what to do .
It ’s like if you were suddenly asked to operate on your dog to remove his kidney .
What would you do ? ”
Personally , I would hire a vet .
But to Morris , even that was n’t an option .
“ We did n’t know who to hire , ” he says , becoming more agitated .
“ I would n’t be able to recognize a good technology person — anyone with a good bullshit story would have gotten past me . ”
It ’s not really fair to poke fun I suppose .
Our kids will laugh when we ’re 60 and we do n’t know which button turns on the garbage disposal and which one vents plasma from the starboard nacelles .
Even if extra homes are built , affordability will remain an issue
The independent body set up to advise ministers on new homes said 270,000 more were needed each year .
The National Housing and Planning Advice Unit said average prices in England were more than seven times average salaries .
And it said they were set to reach nine - and - a- half times this by 2026 .
Bleak outlook
It added that , even if the extra homes were built , they would still be less affordable .
This could have horrendous consequences in terms of environment , landscape and also quality of life
Kate Gordon
Campaign for the Protection of Rural England
Professor Stephen Nickell , who helped write the report , told the BBC : " We built more than that number back in the 1930s in Britain when we had a considerably smaller population .
" And most other countries in the developed world , proportionately speaking , build houses at a faster rate than we do . "
The report comes on the same day as Housing Minister Yvette Cooper unveiled funding to encourage local councils to help create new homes .
She said that some councils were being difficult about building new houses .
" Some of them say they do n't want more homes in their area , and the problem with that argument is that it 's just not fair - every other area needs to do its bit . "
The plans have been criticised by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England ( CPRE ) .
Senior planner Kate Gordon said : " This could have horrendous consequences in terms of environment , landscape and also quality of life - traffic congestion , pollution and the like .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It is not too few houses - it is too many people !
Simon Ward , Watford
Send us your comments
" There are also issues like access to water supply for these homes and the likelihood of them being built in flood - risk areas . "
She said development should not be foisted on the country 's most pressured regions , calling instead for a planned approach which made better use of existing buildings and derelict land .
Empty properties
Ms Cooper said councils intending to build the most new houses would be given £ 1,100 per home , and this may increase to £ 5,000 by 2010 / 11 .
She also said that housing had to be " planned sustainably " .
It 's no good building houses if there 's no roads to get to them
Councillor Paul Bettison
But councillor Paul Bettison , from the Local Government Association , said simply building more homes was not the answer .
" For too long we 've been pushing the simple figure of more and more houses , without thinking about the infrastructure .
" It 's no good building houses if there 's no roads to get to them . "
Also included in the plans is a £ 510 m fund to help bring empty homes back into use .
Councils who aggressively target empty properties , including through compulsory purchase orders , will share in the fund to help pay for the projects .
There are an estimated 670,000 homes and properties currently standing empty , and nearly 300,000 in England that are long - term vacant .
The initiative will funnel extra money to regions where the increase in new homes is more than 0.75 % of the existing stock .
What Science Can't Explain

Science is powerful , but there is much it ca n’t explain .
And when people see , hear or believe something that is not explained , science finds itself trying to prove things do n’t exist , and that ’s truly impossible .
In the following pages , you ’ll learn more about some of the most common inexplicable phenomena — from ghosts to supposed man - like beasts , from incredible experiences at the line between life and death to amazing but unexplained feats of the mind itself .
How much of this is real ?
We ’ll let you decide .
The Taos Hum
Photo ( Image credit : Bobak Ha'Eri )
Some residents and visitors in the small city of Taos , New Mexico , have for years been annoyed and puzzled by a mysterious and faint low - frequency hum in the desert air .
Oddly , only about 2 percent of Taos residents report hearing the sound .
Some believe it is caused by unusual acoustics ; others suspect mass hysteria or some secret , sinister purpose .
Whether described as a whir , hum , or buzz and whether psychological , natural , or supernatural no one has yet been able to locate the sound 's origin .
Thing is , a survey revealed that those who claim to hear the sounds actually hear many different sounds , suggesting the experiences may be subjective , not actually objective sounds ( and pretty certainly not one particular sound ) .
The next item on our list could fill big shoes if it had to .
Guess what it is ?
A frame from the film by Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin .
For decades , large , hairy , manlike beasts called Bigfoot have occasionally been reported by eyewitnesses across America .
Despite the thousands of Bigfoot that must exist for a breeding population , not a single body has been found .
Not one has been killed by a hunter , struck dead by a speeding car , or even died of natural causes .
In the absence of hard evidence like teeth or bones , support comes down to eyewitness sightings and ambiguous photos and films .
Since it is logically impossible to prove a universal negative , science will never be able to prove that creatures like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster do not exist , and it is possible that these mysterious beasts lurk far from prying eyes .
Call us skeptical , and check out our complete story about Bigfoot .
Intuition
( Image credit : © Goldenkb | Dreamstime.com )
Whether we call it gut feelings , a ' sixth sense , ' or something else , we have all experienced intuition at one time or another .
Of course , gut feelings are often wrong ( how many times during aircraft turbulence have you been sure your plane was going down ? ) , but they do seem to be right much of the time .
Psychologists note that people subconsciously pick up information about the world around us , leading us to seemingly sense or know information without knowing exactly how or why we know it .
But cases of intuition are difficult to prove or study , and psychology may only be part of the answer .
If your intuition is telling you that the next slide is about mysterious disappearances , you 're right !
Mysterious Disappearances
Families of missing persons sometimes consult psychics when they feel the police are n't doing enough .
( Image credit : © Benjamin Haas | Dreamstime.com )
People disappear for various reasons .
Most are runaways , some succumb to accident , a few are abducted or killed , but most are eventually found .
Not so with the truly mysterious disappearances .
From the crew of the Marie Celeste to Jimmy Hoffa , Amelia Earhart , and Natalee Holloway , some people seem to have vanished without a trace .
When missing persons are found , it is always through police work , confession , or accident never by ' psychic detectives ' ) .
But when the evidence is lacking and leads are lost , even police and forensic science can't always solve the crime .
One word about our next slide : Boo !
Ghosts

From the Shakespeare play " MacBeth " to the NBC show " Medium , " spirits of the dead have long made an appearance in our culture and folklore .
Many people have reported seeing apparitions of both shadowy strangers and departed loved ones .
Though definitive proof for the existence of ghosts remains elusive , sincere eyewitnesses continue to report seeing , photographing , and even communicating with ghosts .
Ghost investigators hope to one day prove that the dead can contact the living , providing a final answer to the mystery .
Our next mystery is not about ghosts .

Deja vu
A confused man .
The growing complexity of science - and the different levels at which people understand science - may require society to rethink scientific expertise .
( Image credit : dreamstime )
Deja vu is a French phrase meaning ' already seen , ' referring to the distinct , puzzling , and mysterious feeling of having experienced a specific set of circumstances before .
A woman might walk into a building , for example , in a foreign country she 'd never visited , and sense that the setting is eerily and intimately familiar .
Some attribute deja vu to psychic experiences or unbidden glimpses of previous lives .
As with intuition ( see # 3 ) , research into , human psychology can offer more naturalistic explanations , but ultimately the cause and nature of the phenomenon itself remains a mystery .

UFOs
Jerusalem 's dubious UFO .

There is no doubt that UFOs ( Unidentified Flying Objects ) exist — many people see things in the skies that they cannot identify , ranging from aircraft to meteors .
Whether or not any of those objects and lights are alien spacecraft is another matter entirely ; given the fantastic distances and effort involved in just getting to Earth from across the universe , such a scenario seems unlikely .
Still , while careful investigation has revealed known causes for most sighting reports , some UFO incidents will always remain unexplained .

We 're deadly serious .
Near - Death Experiences and Life After Death
Many people report seeing a bright light at the end of a long dark tunnel after a near - death experience .
( Image credit : Dreamstime )
People who were once near death have sometimes reported various mystical experiences ( such as going into a tunnel and emerging in a light , being reunited with loved ones , a sense of peace , etc. ) that may suggest an existence beyond the grave .
While such experiences are profound , no one has returned with proof or verifiable information from " beyond the grave . "
Skeptics suggest that the experiences are explainable as natural and predictable hallucinations of a traumatized brain .
A study of people in cardiac arrest in 2015 found that when the heart is dying , it gets peppered by signals from the brain , which tries to stay active .
The scramble of signals might be responsible for near - death experiences , researchers figure .
Two mysteries to go .
Can you divine what they might be ?
Psychic powers and ESP
This is not our columnist , Benjamin Radford .
But Radford does see the future :
He predicts that predictions for 2009 wo n't be any more accurate than they were in 2008 .
Psychic powers and extra-sensory perception ( ESP ) rank among the top ten unexplained phenomena if for no other reason than that belief in them is so widespread .
Many people believe that intuition ( see # 3 ) is a form of psychic power , a way of accessing arcane or special knowledge about the world or the future .
Researchers have tested people who claim to have psychic powers , though the results under controlled scientific conditions have so far been negative or ambiguous .
Some have argued that psychic powers cannot be tested , or for some reason diminish in the presence of skeptics or scientists .
If this is true , science will never be able to prove or disprove the existence of psychic powers .
The Body / Mind Connection
Medical science is only beginning to understand the ways in which the mind influences the body .
The placebo effect , for example , demonstrates that people can at times cause a relief in medical symptoms or suffering by believing the cures to be effective — whether they actually are or not .
Using processes only poorly understood , the body 's ability to heal itself is far more amazing than anything modern medicine could create .
So while there are many unexplained phenomena , and frankly some of them are dubious , the explainable science of the body and mind , even if we 're still trying to figure much of it out , may be among the most amazing phenomena of all .

Eno najpogostejših vprašanj , ki se nam je tudi samim ves čas motalo po glavi , ko smo se lotevali kakšne nove strani , ko smo iskali blazno hude ključne besede , ki bodo nosile milijone je bilo : “ Kaj za vraga je malo konkurence ?!? ” .
Zakaj malo konkurence ?
Zato da se bomo s svojo stranjo s čim manj truda prebili na prvo stran rezultatv v iskalnikih .
Vsi nasveti so bili polni nasvetov 😀 o tem , da je pametno izbrati nišo z malo konkurence , a definicija “ malo konkurence ” je bila vedno tam nekje v megli ali pa se je od nasveta do nasveta precej razlikovala ( tisti najbolj brihtni so svetovali nekaj v smislu – ko za ključno besedno ni zadetkov v Googlu , a ddd ? ) .
Zato podajamo še svojo ležalniško verzijo – kdaj je za določeno ključno besedo konkurence malo .
Najboljše , da zalaufamo kar sam Google pika
Com in vnesemo vanj ključno besedo , prvič kar samo in drugič obdano z narekovaji .
Potem pa si ogledamo tole sliko v večjem formatu in to je to .
Po naših izkušnjah je tole dobra raven konkurence za nekega povprečnega zelenega začetnika , kot smo mi sami 🙂
Seveda vam nihče ne brani , da se nebi vrgli na kak šno težjo in morda bolj donosno nišo .
Zdaj verjetno pridemo do drugega vprašanje , ki se nam je začelo motati po glavi takoj , ko smo našli odgovor na prvo : “ Kje za vraga najdem dobro ključno besedo z malo konkurence in a mi lahko daš kak primer ? ” .
O tem pa drugič .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Two of the biggest U.S. meat processors on Tuesday defended a packaging technique designed to keep meat looking fresh at grocery stores even as U.S. lawmakers criticized it as unsafe and misleading .
Packers use carbon monoxide to stabilize the color of meat , but some Democrats said the process misleads consumers by making the products look safer than they really are , and puts the public at risk of eating spoiled meat .
Rep. Bart Stupak , Michigan Democrat and chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee , called the practice deceptive and “ a potential health threat , ” and accused U.S. regulators of “ turning a blind eye ” toward health dangers .
Earlier this year , Stupak launched a probe into the practice and has proposed the use of a safety notice on meat and fish products treated with carbon monoxide .
Since then , food retailers Giant , Safeway Inc and Tyson Foods Inc have stopped the practice .
On Tuesday , discount retailer Target Corp asked USDA for approval to add a warning to the label of meat that has been treated with carbon monoxide sold in its stores .
At the hearing , top executives with Hormel Foods Corp and Cargill Inc told lawmakers they supported a product label encouraging consumers to depend on a “ use by ” or “ freeze by ” date rather than color to determine the safety of their meat or fish .
“ Consumers are not eating bad product and are not being deceived by this technology , ” said Hormel Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger .
Some consumer groups have petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw its approval of sealed packaging that uses a higher portion of carbon monoxide -- 0.4 percent -- than exists in air .
Rep. Marsha Blackburn , a Tennessee Republican , defended the practice on grounds that it reduces the need for human handling and limits the chance of adding bacteria to the meat .
“ There is no need for the federal government to implement overzealous regulations that would likely take a step backward and away from safe and efficient meat packaging , ” Blackburn said .
Officials at the Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Agriculture Department said they stand by the safety of the carbon monoxide practice and would revisit the process if new data becomes available .
“ This is not a priority for the agency with regard to public health , ” said Daniel Engeljohn , a deputy assistant administrator with USDA ’s Food Safety Inspection Service .
The FSIS requires use - by / sell - by dates on meats sold in packages containing carbon monoxide .
The hearing on Tuesday comes as the food industry has been hit hard by several recent recalls .
Among them , Cargill earlier this month recalled more than 1 million pounds of ground beef because of possible E. coli .
contamination .
It was the second meat recall by the Minneapolis - based company in about a month .
Consumer groups told lawmakers the use of carbon monoxide makes it difficult for shoppers to gauge product safety .
“ We ’re outraged the FDA put the economic interest of the industry before the health and safety of consumers , ” said Wenonah Hauter , director of Food and Water Watch .
“ At worst ( it ’s ) dangerous , at best it ’s a consumer rip - off . ”
The FDA regulates about 80 percent of the U.S. food supply , mostly fruits and vegetables , and the USDA is responsible for the rest , including meat , poultry and eggs .
Habbo Hotel users create a character and can buy furniture
The 17 - year - old is accused of stealing 4,000 euros ( £ 2,840 ) worth of virtual furniture , bought with real money .
Five 15 - year - olds have also been questioned by police , who were contacted by the website 's owners .
The six teenagers are suspected of moving the stolen furniture into their own Habbo rooms .
A spokesman for Sulake , the company that operates Habbo Hotel , said : " The accused lured victims into handing over their Habbo passwords by creating fake Habbo websites .
" In Habbo , as in many other virtual worlds , scamming for other people 's personal information such as user names has been problematic for quite a while .
It is a theft because the furniture is paid for with real money
Sulake spokesman
" We have had much of this scamming going on in many countries but this is the first case where the police have taken legal action . "
Habbo users can create their own characters , decorate their own rooms and play a number of games , paying with Habbo Credits , which they have to buy with real cash .
" It is a theft because the furniture is paid for with real money .
But the only way to be a thief in Habbo is to get people 's usernames and passwords and then log in and take the furniture .
" We got involved because of an increasing number of sites which are pretending to be Habbo .
People might then try and log in and get their details stolen . "
Six million people in more than 30 countries play Habbo Hotel each month .
Virtual theft is a growing issue in virtual worlds ; in 2005 a Chinese gamer was stabbed to death in a row over a sword in a game .
Shanghai gamer Qiu Chengwei killed player Zhu Caoyuan when he discovered he had sold a " dragon sabre " he had been loaned .

As I was playing with Street View , I wondered what sort of vehicle was used to schlep the camera .
To satisfy my curiosity , I browsed around until I found a shiny building and looked at the vehicle ’s reflection :
Based on those images , I believe that the vehicle is a Chevrolet Express van :
I have no idea about the camera specifications , but it appears to be housed in a large box on the roof of the van .
The next steps : identify the van on the street , do something crazy during a photograph , and have the photograph end up in the tool .

Never underestimate the explanatory power of “ South Park , ” the animated Comedy Central show created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker .
Again and again over the past 11 seasons , “ South Park ” has offered a satiric primer on adult behavior , including notably trenchant , compact analyses of the Mormon faith and whatever you choose to call Scientology .
It would be interesting , now , to see a “ South Park ” episode devoted entirely to the groundbreaking new contract Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker have just signed with Viacom , the parent company of Comedy Central .
The contract creates a new digital hub for all things “ South Park ” and also brings Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker half of the ad revenue their show generates .
Historically , that kind of revenue sharing goes entirely against the principles of Hollywood .
What made this possible was n’t merely the success of “ South Park , ” the show that really got Comedy Central off the ground and is still its most valuable franchise .
It was a clause in the original contract that reserved to the show ’s creators a slice of any revenue generated apart from actual broadcast on Comedy Central .
At the time , it was unclear where any of that extra revenue might come from .
But that clause has essentially kept “ South Park ” clear of Viacom ’s efforts ( not notably successful ) to become an Internet power .
And it has created what may be a new model in the balance of power and money between creative artists and companies like Comedy Central .
So “ South Park , ” which begins its 12th season in October and has been extended to 15 seasons , is no longer merely the crudely animated , rudely scripted tales of Stan , Kyle , Cartman and Kenny .
It is now a studio , a digital hub , a creative powerhouse in its infancy — but with the potential to become the kind of marketing monster that the boys might well find themselves fleeing from , a monster like , say , Mecha - Streisand .

Parisians have been told they are rude AND smelly - by their own tourism chiefs .
Tourist officials in Paris have told the city 's notoriously grumpy waiters , shopkeepers and taxi drivers that their bad manners and poor personal hygiene are driving visitors away .
This week the Paris tourist office launched a major campaign urging all the city 's residents to make tourists feel more welcome in the city .
Hundreds of thousands of brochures containing a " charter " of commitments to be helpful and polite are being handed out to Parisiens and tourists in English and in French .
The charter tells locals , " I will take the time to give information to visitors " .
And it urges them to , " make use of my foreign - language skills to reply to visitors in their own language " .
But it also tells tourists , " I will experience the Parisien lifestyle " and " I will take advantage of my stay to try French products " .
As part of the drive to make visitors feel more welcome , tourist board staff will be sent to the city 's most - visited sites in orange and white T - shirts bearing the slogan " Paris est vous " , meaning Paris is Yours .
A recent global survey ranked Paris as the world 's third most attractive city behind Sydney and London , but it came only 52nd out of 60 for friendliness .
Japanese psychologists have identified what they call " Paris Syndrome " , when polite Japanese tourists suffer mental breakdown at the shock of being treated rudely by Parisian locals .
On average , up to 12 Japanese tourists a year fall victim to it , mainly women in their 30s whose high expectations of their first dream trip abraod are shattered by Parisien arrogance .
The Japanese embassy has a 24 - hour hotline for those suffering from severe culture shock , and provides hospital treatment for anyone in need .
Paris tourist office chairman Jean - Claude Lesourd said : " We have been trying very hard for a number of years to improve the welcome that Parisians offer to visitors .
" And things are getting better .
More and more Parisians can answer questions in English , for example .
The old stereotype of people only speaking French is no longer true . "
He added : " We have made particular efforts with the city 's taxi drivers with workshops to teach them subjects ranging from English speaking to hygiene and how to smile .
Scroll down for more
" We train them to try to be more friendly and I think big progress has been made .
A lot of them can say a few words in English now , and they are cleaner , too . "
Around 16 million people staying in the French capital 's hotels every year , making it the world 's most popular urban tourist destination .
Tourism in Paris is worth more than 10 billion pounds a year and employs 150,000 people , according to the Tourist Office .
The charter of committments for Parisians reads :
• I will take the time to give information to visitors .
• I will make use of my foreign - language skills to reply to them in their language .
• I will recommend to visitors things I appreciate about Paris .
• I am proud of my city , the No 1 tourist destination in the world .
• And the commitments for the visitor are : I will experience the Parisian lifestyle .
• I will take advantage of my stay to try French products .
• I will respect the city and use public transport .
By the time the Nazi party came to prominence by winning 107 seats ( 18.3 % of the votes ) in the Reichstag election of September 14 1930 , British newspapers could not ignore Hitler and his movement .
But , as Brigitte Granzow showed long ago in her book , A mirror of Nazism , the reportage was replete with distortions and misinterpretation .
In an article on September 21 that year , the Observer echoed the widely held belief on the left that Hitler was the creature of big capital .
It saw the real dangerman not as Hitler , but as the media tycoon and leader of the German National People 's party , Alfred Hugenberg .
The " Hugenberg manoeuvres " , it stated , had aimed to promote both Communists and Nazis as a vehicle to weaken the organised working classes .
" Hugenberg , and not Hitler , will ultimately call the Nazi tune . "
A week later , the newspaper dismissed Hitler as " dramatic , violent and shallow " , and " a lightweight " , seeing him as " not a man , but a megaphone " of the prevailing discontent , fronting a militarist reaction , which would mean the destruction of peace .
The newspaper went on to claim , remarkably , that Hitler was " definitely Christian in his ideals " , and , even more strangely , that these matched the ideals of German Catholics .
The Guardian thought on September 25 1930 that the exclusion of the Nazi party from Reich government , given its electoral success , was not in the best interests of German democracy and that their involvement would " in the long run ... help to perpetuate this democracy " .
On the very day that these views were published , Hitler told a court in Leipzig ( where three young army officers with Nazi sympathies were on trial for preparing to commit high treason ) that his movement would come to power legally , but that it would then shape the state as its members wanted it , and that " heads would roll " .
The Guardian maintained its view , however , that Hitler , " while full of the verbiage of revolution " , was " no revolutionary leader " .
It claimed that he lacked courage , and that his baleful threats before the Leipzig court raised unnecessary fears , while his assurances of proceeding legally had hardly been noticed .
It dismissed him on September 29 1930 as " the ranting clown who bangs the drum outside the National Socialist circus " .
Few things , the newspaper had remarked three days earlier , were less likely than that Hitler would gain sole power in Germany .
By 1932 , as the crisis of German democracy deepened , British newspapers devoted far more attention to Nazism .
Even now , however , underestimation of Hitler was commonplace .
The Observer , still on February 21 1932 seeing Hitler as no more than a demagogue propped up by financially powerful nationalists , reversed course following his candidacy for the Reich presidency in March , when it wrote ( March 20 1932 ) that it would be wrong to regard him " as a mere agitator and rank outsider " .
Here , as in the Guardian ( which still implied on March 30 1932 that Hitler was no more than a charlatan ) , the emerging view was that he was a " moderate " , who might possibly develop into a statesman , but could not control his own violent and unruly movement .
This related also to anti-semitism .
The Observer , in its article on March 20 1932 , hinted that attacks on Hitler 's anti-semitism exaggerated the danger , adding : " It must not be forgotten that the major part of the German Republican Press is in Jewish hands . "
As the political violence intensified during the summer and autumn of 1932 , the Guardian persisted in its belief that Hitler was being outflanked by the more radical sections of his movement .
In its article headed Hitler Losing Control on August 10 1932 , Joseph Goebbels , the party 's propaganda leader , was seen as the real radical spearhead of the Nazi aggression .
On August 16 , after Reich president Hindenburg had refused three days earlier to hand the chancellorship to Hitler , the newspaper claimed Hitler had never been the " real master " of the Nazi movement , which had pressed him into demanding that he should be " Germany 's Mussolini against his own better judgment " .
When Hitler overcame the crisis within the Nazi movement in early December 1932 about the party 's strategy , leading to the resignation of one of his chief lieutenants , Gregor Strasser , the Guardian on December 10 curiously interpreted the episode as a victory for Goebbels and the party radicals .
Consistently playing down
Hitler 's importance and viewing him as a reactionary inevitably meant that the final machinations that brought him to power on January 30 1933 were seen as the " victory " of the reactionary forces of German nationalism .
Nevertheless , the next day the Guardian did prophetically comment that " it is by no means certain that the Nazis will be the ' prisoners ' of the Nationalists in this new Government " , and that Hitler 's appointment as Reich chancellor was " an hour which may prove a turning - point in the history of post - war Germany " .

The senators want the Iraqi government to handle security
The Democratic - controlled Senate Foreign Relations Committee dismissed Mr Bush 's policy as " not in the national interest " in a 12 - 9 vote .
It comes a day after the president gave his State of the Union address asking Congress to give it " a chance to work " .
Both votes are non-binding but may put pressure on Mr Bush to reconsider .
The resolution opposes Mr Bush 's plan to send 21,500 additional troops to Iraq , the majority of them to violence - hit Baghdad in an effort to improve security and end sectarian clashes .
President Bush has made his decision on Iraq ; the fact of the matter is we need to get the job done
Vice President Dick Cheney
An advance guard of 3,200 troops arrived in Baghdad on Sunday .
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says if the resolution is supported by key senators from both sides of the aisle , the rebuff suffered by the White House will be all the more visible and difficult to ignore .
' The grinder '
The resolution was proposed earlier this month by three leading senators who said the plan was not in US interests , urging an early transfer of security to Iraqi leaders .
The three senators were Democrats Joseph Biden and Carl Levin , and Republican Chuck Hagel , a long - standing critic of the war .
" We better be damn sure we know what we 're doing , all of us , before we put 22,000 more Americans into that grinder , " said Senator Hagel , the only Republican to support the resolution .
Senator Biden , the panel 's chairman , said the legislation was " not an attempt to embarrass the president " .
" It 's an attempt to save the president from making a significant mistake with regard to our policy in Iraq , " he said .
' In disarray '
Before the resolution goes to the full Senate , Mr Biden has said he is willing to negotiate changes in hope of attracting support from more Republicans .
A growing list of Republican senators - including Gordon Smith , George Voinovich and Sam Brownback - have said they will back the proposals , AP news agency reports .
However , Republican Richard Lugar said the resolution would force nothing on Mr Bush but would confirm to US friends and allies that it was " divided and in disarray " .
The response from Vice - President Dick Cheney was defiant .
" President Bush has made his decision on Iraq ; the fact of the matter is we need to get the job done , " he said .
Mr Cheney described suggestions that the administration 's credibility was on the line as " hogwash " .
Democrats in the House of Representatives intend to hold a vote shortly after the Senate .
Former AT&T technician Mark Klein is the key witness in the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's class - action lawsuit against the telecommunications company , which alleges that AT&T cooperated in an illegal National Security Agency domestic surveillance program .
In a public statement Klein issued last month , he described the NSA 's visit to an AT&T office .
In an older , less - public statement recently acquired by Wired News , Klein goes into additional details of his discovery of an alleged surveillance operation in an AT&T building in San Francisco .
Klein supports his claim by attaching excerpts of three internal company documents : a Dec. 10 , 2002 , manual titled " Study Group 3 , LGX / Splitter Wiring , San Francisco , " a Jan. 13 , 2003 , document titled " SIMS , Splitter Cut - In and Test Procedure " and a second " Cut - In and Test Procedure " dated Jan. 24 , 2003 .
Here we present Klein 's statement in its entirety , with inline links to all of the document excerpts where he cited them .
You can also download the complete file here ( pdf ) .
The full AT&T documents are filed under seal in federal court in San Francisco .
AT&T's Implementation of NSA Spying on American Citizens
31 December 2005
I wrote the following document in 2004 when it became clear to me that AT&T , at the behest of the National Security Agency , had illegally installed secret computer gear designed to spy on internet traffic .
At the time I thought this was an outgrowth of the notorious Total Information Awareness program , which was attacked by defenders of civil liberties .
But now it 's been revealed by The New York Times that the spying program is vastly bigger and was directly authorized by President Bush , as he himself has now admitted , in flagrant violation of specific statutes and constitutional protections for civil liberties .
I am presenting this information to facilitate the dismantling of this dangerous Orwellian project .
AT&T Deploys Government Spy Gear on WorldNet Network
\– 16 January , 2004
In 2003 AT&T built " secret rooms " hidden deep in the bowels of its central offices in various cities , housing computer gear for a government spy operation which taps into the company 's popular WorldNet service and the entire internet .
These installations enable the government to look at every individual message on the internet and analyze exactly what people are doing .
Documents showing the hardwire installation in San Francisco suggest that there are similar locations being installed in numerous other cities .
The physical arrangement , the timing of its construction , the government - imposed secrecy surrounding it and other factors all strongly suggest that its origins are rooted in the Defense Department 's Total Information Awareness ( TIA ) program which brought forth vigorous protests from defenders of constitutionally protected civil liberties last year :
" As the director of the effort , Vice Adm . John M. Poindexter , has described the system in Pentagon documents and in speeches , it will provide intelligence analysts and law enforcement officials with instant access to information from internet mail and calling records to credit card and banking transactions and travel documents , without a search warrant . "
The New York Times , 9 November 2002
To mollify critics , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Darpa ) spokesmen have repeatedly asserted that they are only conducting " research " using " artificial synthetic data " or information from " normal DOD intelligence channels " and hence there are " no U.S. citizen privacy implications " ( Department of Defense , Office of the Inspector General report on TIA , December 12 , 2003 ) .
They also changed the name of the program to " Terrorism Information Awareness " to make it more politically palatable .
But feeling the heat , Congress made a big show of allegedly cutting off funding for TIA in late 2003 , and the political fallout resulted in Adm .
Poindexter 's abrupt resignation last August .
However , the fine print reveals that Congress eliminated funding only for " the majority of the TIA components , " allowing several " components " to continue ( DOD , ibid ) .
The essential hardware elements of a TIA - type spy program are being surreptitiously slipped into " real world " telecommunications offices .
In San Francisco the " secret room " is Room 641A at 611 Folsom Street , the site of a large SBC phone building , three floors of which are occupied by AT&T .
High - speed fiber - optic circuits come in on the 8th floor and run down to the 7th floor where they connect to routers for AT&T 's WorldNet service , part of the latter 's vital " Common Backbone . "
In order to snoop on these circuits , a special cabinet was installed and cabled to the " secret room " on the 6th floor to monitor the information going through the circuits .
( The location code of the cabinet is 070177.04 , which denotes the 7th floor , aisle 177 and bay 04 . )
The " secret room " itself is roughly 24 - by - 48 feet , containing perhaps a dozen cabinets including such equipment as Sun servers and two Juniper routers , plus an industrial - size air conditioner .
The normal work force of unionized technicians in the office are forbidden to enter the " secret room , " which has a special combination lock on the main door .
The telltale sign of an illicit government spy operation is the fact that only people with security clearance from the National Security Agency can enter this room .
In practice this has meant that only one management - level technician works in there .
Ironically , the one who set up the room was laid off in late 2003 in one of the company 's endless " downsizings , " but he was quickly replaced by another .
Plans for the " secret room " were fully drawn up by December 2002 , curiously only four months after Darpa started awarding contracts for TIA .
One 60 - page document , identified as coming from " AT&T Labs Connectivity & Net Services " and authored by the labs ' consultant Mathew F. Casamassima , is titled Study Group 3 , LGX / Splitter Wiring , San Francisco and dated 12/10/02 .
This document addresses the special problem of trying to spy on fiber - optic circuits .
Unlike copper wire circuits which emit electromagnetic fields that can be tapped into without disturbing the circuits , fiber - optic circuits do not " leak " their light signals .
In order to monitor such communications , one has to physically cut into the fiber somehow and divert a portion of the light signal to see the information .
This problem is solved with " splitters " which literally split off a percentage of the light signal so it can be examined .
This is the purpose of the special cabinet referred to above : Circuits are connected into it , the light signal is split into two signals , one of which is diverted to the " secret room . "
The cabinet is totally unnecessary for the circuit to perform – in fact it introduces problems since the signal level is reduced by the splitter – its only purpose is to enable a third party to examine the data flowing between sender and recipient on the internet .
The above - referenced document includes a diagram showing the splitting of the light signal , a portion of which is diverted to " SG3 Secure Room , " i.e. , the so - called " Study Group " spy room .
Another page headlined " Cabinet Naming " lists not only the " splitter " cabinet but also the equipment installed in the " SG3 " room , including various Sun devices , and Juniper M40e and M160 " backbone " routers .
PDF file 4 shows one of many tables detailing the connections between the " splitter " cabinet on the 7th floor ( location 070177.04 ) and a cabinet in the " secret room " on the 6th floor ( location 060903.01 ) .
Since the San Francisco " secret room " is numbered 3 , the implication is that there are at least several more in other cities ( Seattle , San Jose , Los Angeles and San Diego are some of the rumored locations ) , which likely are spread across the United States .
One of the devices in the " Cabinet Naming " list is particularly revealing as to the purpose of the " secret room " : a Narus STA 6400 .
Narus is a 7 - year - old company which , because of its particular niche , appeals not only to businessmen ( it is backed by AT&T , JP Morgan and Intel , among others ) but also to police , military and intelligence officials .
Last November 13 - 14 , for instance , Narus was the " Lead Sponsor " for a technical conference held in McLean , Virginia , titled " Intelligence Support Systems for Lawful Interception and Internet Surveillance . "
Police officials , FBI and DEA agents , and major telecommunications companies eager to cash in on the " war on terror " had gathered in the hometown of the CIA to discuss their special problems .
Among the attendees were AT&T , BellSouth , MCI , Sprint and Verizon .
Narus founder , Dr. Ori Cohen , gave a keynote speech .
So what does the Narus STA 6400 do ?
" The ( Narus ) STA Platform consists of standalone traffic analyzers that collect network and customer usage information in real time directly from the message ....
These analyzers sit on the message pipe into the ISP ( internet service provider ) cloud rather than tap into each router or ISP device " ( Telecommunications magazine , April 2000 ) .
A Narus press release ( 1 Dec. , 1999 ) also boasts that its Semantic Traffic Analysis ( STA ) technology " captures comprehensive customer usage data ... and transforms it into actionable information .... ( It ) is the only technology that provides complete visibility for all internet applications . "
To implement this scheme , WorldNet 's high - speed data circuits already in service had to be rerouted to go through the special " splitter " cabinet .
This was addressed in another document of 44 pages from AT&T Labs , titled SIMS , Splitter Cut - In and Test Procedure , dated 01/13/03 .
" SIMS " is an unexplained reference to the secret room .
Part of this reads as follows :
__ __" A WMS ( work ) Ticket will be issued by the AT&T Bridgeton Network Operation Center ( NOC ) to charge time for performing the work described in this procedure document .... _ _" This procedure covers the steps required to insert optical splitters into select live Common Backbone ( CBB ) OC3 , OC12 and OC48 optical circuits . "
__
The NOC referred to is in Bridgeton , Missouri , and controls WorldNet operations .
( As a sign that government spying goes hand - in - hand with union - busting , the entire ( Communication Workers of America ) Local 6377 which had jurisdiction over the Bridgeton NOC was wiped out in early 2002 when AT&T fired the union work force and later rehired them as nonunion " management " employees . )
The cut - in work was performed in 2003 , and since then new circuits are connected through the " splitter " cabinet .
Another Cut - In and Test Procedure document dated January 24 , 2003 , provides diagrams of how AT&T Core Network circuits were to be run through the " splitter " cabinet .
One page lists the circuit IDs of key Peering Links which were " cut-in " in February 2003 , including ConXion , Verio , XO , Genuity , Qwest , PAIX , Allegiance , AboveNet , Global Crossing , C&W , UUNET , Level 3 , Sprint , Telia , PSINet and Mae West .
By the way , Mae West is one of two key internet nodal points in the United States ( the other , Mae East , is in Vienna , Virginia ) .
It 's not just WorldNet customers who are being spied on – it's the entire internet .
The next logical question is , what central command is collecting the data sent by the various " secret rooms " ?
One can only make educated guesses , but perhaps the answer was inadvertently given in the DOD Inspector General 's report ( cited above ) :
" For testing TIA capabilities , Darpa and the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command ( INSCOM ) created an operational research and development environment that uses real - time feedback .
The main node of TIA is located at INSCOM ( in Fort Belvoir , Virginia ) . "
Among the agencies participating or planning to participate in the INSCOM " testing " are the " National Security Agency , the Defense Intelligence Agency , the Central Intelligence Agency , the DOD Counterintelligence Field Activity , the U.S. Strategic Command , the Special Operations Command , the Joint Forces Command and the Joint Warfare Analysis Center . "
There are also " discussions " going on to bring in " non-DOD federal agencies " such as the FBI .
This is the infrastructure for an Orwellian police state .
It must be shut down !

He loves her .
She loves him .
Initially they were all over each other , but now things have changed .
Absolutely : it might happen to both partners , but in women is more common .
I have personally experienced this problem and I know how helpless a man can feel in the face of a partner constantly rejecting his sexual approaches .
As a counselor , I have also helped clients to overcome this challenge : the good news is that you can make things work .
The first step is to get a sense of what might be happening : why does a woman stop wanting her man ?
the first thing to check with blood analysis .
and lack of sleep .such as endometriosis fibroids and many others : check with your doctor .
there might be things you need to work out .
it has a devastating effect on sexual desire .
relocating , getting married , new job , or simply too much work .
Women are more capable than men of using their raw sexual energy to fuel their every day tasks and passions : they could become so immersed in what they love doing , that the energy previously available for sex becomes now dedicated to a new passion only .
So after discovering that her loss of desire is not due to a sudden fall of your sexual skills , what can you do , as a man , to make her want you again ?
In our fast - paced life , sex might become just another item on a busy diary : ‘ I have got half an hour on Sunday so we can fit a quickie there . ’
How much time do you spend with you partner free of chores and interruptions ?
Create daily or at least weekly occasions in which you can simply stay together .
Create opportunities to feel a special sense of connection with you partner .
It might be a romantic dinner , a walk in the park , or any other activity you both like .
It must be very clear that such pleasant activity is not some kind of extended foreplay which will see you trying to approach her sexually in the end …
There is much more to sex than penetration .
Discovering other ways to enjoy each other is fun and it also reduces everyone ’s performance anxiety .
The fantasy model of sex dictates that we should be able to function and presumably enjoy sex without any special requirements .
The reality is that we all have conditions which need to be met in order to have good sex .
For example , you probably need to be rested , maybe you prefer to have the light off , and possibly immediately after dinner you are not in the mood .
Give it a good thought , find out your very own conditions for great sex , and then discuss the topic with your partner .
An excessive focus on pleasing others might inhibit sexual pleasure first and sexual desire later .
An orgasm is all about a woman being attentive to her own needs : encourage her selfishness in bed .
A woman might experience vaginal dryness even if she is interested in sex .
So go to a good sex shop and buy a good lubricant , but remember : she is the only one able to decide if it ’s ok to use it or not .
In fact , she has also the right to simply throw it in the bin .
After all , it ’s her body we are talking about .
On the other hand , maybe she is n’t wet because she does not feel like having sex : if that is the case , using a lubricant might be a recipe for disaster .
If you have been using a lubricant for some time , stop it for a while and see what happens .
Routine is a libido killer , avoid it at all cost .
Do you know what your woman enjoys in bed ?
Make sure you do , down to tiny details such as the preferred way of licking .
Does she know what you like ?
Go ahead and tell her : your pleasure might feed her lust .
Tough questions time : have an open discussion with your partner and prepare yourself to hearing a few unpleasant truth .
No , it ’s not about your penis size - that 's perfectly ok - but it might be about your hygiene habits …
HERE’S one popular vision for saving the planet : Roll out from under the sumptuous hemp - fiber sheets on your bed in the morning and pull on a pair of $ 245 organic cotton Levi’s and an Armani biodegradable knit shirt .
Stroll from the bedroom in your eco-McMansion , with its photovoltaic solar panels , into the kitchen remodeled with reclaimed lumber .
Enter the three - car garage lighted by energy - sipping fluorescent bulbs and slip behind the wheel of your $ 104,000 Lexus hybrid .
Drive to the airport , where you settle in for an 8,000 - mile flight — careful to buy carbon offsets beforehand — and spend a week driving golf balls made from compacted fish food at an eco-resort in the Maldives .
That vision of an eco-sensitive life as a series of choices about what to buy appeals to millions of consumers and arguably defines the current environmental movement as equal parts concern for the earth and for making a stylish statement .
If George W. Bush ’s " freedom agenda " is to be his presidential legacy , then his six - year " global war on terror " has been his own worst enemy .
As lawyers in Pakistan are being beaten and arrested by authorities for protesting against the imposition of de facto martial law , Bush has opted to set aside his campaign for democratic reforms in favor of combating terrorism  an effort with questionable results .
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf effectively placed himself at the head of a military dictatorship on Saturday when he suspended the constitution , disbanded the Supreme Court and declared a state of emergency throughout the country .
Musharraf made the announcement ahead of what was expected to be an unfavorable decision from the high court invalidating his latest election victory because he campaigned in his dual role as president and as head of Pakistan ’s armed forces .
Protests and anger have continued throughout the week in the South Asian country of 164 million , with the legal establishment especially reeling from the repression .
The US had strong words for Musharraf , calling on him to restore the constitution , but two members of the Bush cabinet signaled that Washington was unlikely to withhold any of the substantial military aid given to Pakistan  a figure reported at 10 billion dollars .
" We have to be very cognizant of the fact that some of the assistance that has been going to Pakistan is directly related to the counterterrorism mission , " said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her trip to the Middle East this weekend .
" I would be very surprised if anyone wants the president to ignore or set aside our concerns about terrorism and protecting the American people . "
" We are reviewing all of our assistance programs , " echoed Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in China on Monday , " although we are mindful not to do anything that would undermine ongoing counterterrorism efforts . "
The strong reservations of the administration to take decisive steps to punish Musharraf and help end the crisis is Pakistan stand in stark contrast to its declared foreign policy principles  the so - called freedom agenda .
Initially used as a secondary justification for the invasion of Iraq  after the since - debunked imminent threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction  the worldwide promotion of democracy and freedoms pushed by the administration has become ever present in Bush ’s rhetoric as the best way to quell violent radicalism .
" We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people , " Bush said in his 2004 inauguration address .
Speaking directly to the downtrodden , he said , " All who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know : The United States will not ignore your oppression , or excuse your oppressors . "
But measured by its inaction in Pakistan , critics say that ignoring the oppression and excusing the oppressor is exactly what the administration is doing  and doing so in defense of the selfsame fight against radical terrorism that the " freedom agenda " is supposed to address .
" We have backed away from the push for democratic reform because people argue that the push for democratic reform encourages radical Islamists , " said Georgetown government professor Daniel Brumberg .
" The elections in Palestine and the events in Iraq have undermined the freedom agenda . "
The continued support of regimes with despotic tendencies despite contradictions with a platform of broad democratic reform is nothing new for the Bush administration .
In announcing a 20 - billion - dollar arms agreement package to Saudi Arabia and five other Gulf states in July , Rice said , " We are working with these states to fight back extremism and to give a chance to the forces of moderation and reform . "
However , in a meeting on reform in the region last week , Stephen McInerney of the Project on Middle East Democracy called the area " the highest concentration of authoritarian monarchies in the world . "
While the details of the deal have not been publicly released , McInerney expressed doubt that any benchmarks for reform would be included .
" Most of the opposition to the deal is about Gulf states ’ support for terrorism , and not about democratic reform , " he told IPS .
" The rulers of the Gulf states are not benign rulers .
They are absolute dictators , " said Ali Alyami of the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Saudi Arabia .
" Without international pressure , these rulers have no reason to reform . "
President Bush has called the US relationship with Saudi Arabia a " personal friendship " , citing the close ally ’s support for the war on terror .
But the Saudi failure to prosecute any of the terrorism financiers named by the State Department and a lack of evidence that conventional military might can subdue terrorism is indicative of the most troubling problem with the shift in policy .
The strategy of simultaneously pushing the " freedom agenda " and the " war on terror " fails because the latter also has massive shortcomings in dealing with the threat of radical Islam .
" The war on terror has not helped because when you have massive military operations which are totally indiscriminate you tend to victimize entire populations , " said Frederic Grare , a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
This can force people into choosing the protection that local Islamists can provide .
Pakistan had presented a unique opportunity in this respect because the country has a viable democratic - minded center that could have brought Muslim parties into mainstream politics .
" Do n’t confuse the institutional religious parties  who do have an ideology that we do n’t really share  and the militants , " said Grare .
" Links may exist , but you can still establish a clear distinction .
Eventually , one may be the best defense against the other . "
That democratic center in Pakistan , however , was ignored by the Bush administration in favor of Musharraf because military might was needed to fight armed extremists .
" The basic objective is the war on terror , so they need strong relations with the army and everything else is contingent , " said Grare .
" Support for democracy was pretty far down the list .
There is no abandonment , it ’s just never been there . "
" One consequence of this crisis is that Bush ’s ‘ freedom agenda ’ is finally bankrupt , " said Fred Kaplan in his Slate.com column .
" He will never again be able to invoke it , even as a rhetorical ploy , without evoking winces or laughter . "
Not to be outdone by any “ War on Christmas , ” Congressman Steve King ( R - IA ) introduced a House Resolution ( # 847 ) which would recognize “ the importance of Christmas and the Christian faith . ”
No , really .
Not kidding .
It ’s not a parody .
Just a guy wasting our time with this worse - than - symbolic piece of legislation .
Here ’s the text :
RESOLUTION
Recognizing the importance of Christmas and the Christian faith .
Whereas Christmas , a holiday of great significance to Americans and many other cultures and nationalities , is celebrated annually by Christians throughout the United States and the world ;
Whereas there are approximately 225,000,000 Christians in the United States , making Christianity the religion of over three - fourths of the American population ;
Whereas there are approximately 2,000,000,000 Christians throughout the world , making Christianity the largest religion in the world and the religion of about one - third of the world population ; Whereas Christians identify themselves as those who believe in the salvation from sin offered to them through the sacrifice of their savior , Jesus Christ , the Son of God , and who , out of gratitude for the gift of salvation , commit themselves to living their lives in accordance with the teachings of the Holy Bible ; Whereas Christians and Christianity have contributed greatly to the development of western civilization ;
Whereas the United States , being founded as a constitutional republic in the traditions of western civilization , finds much in its history that points observers back to its roots in Christianity ; Whereas on December 25 of each calendar year , American Christians observe Christmas , the holiday celebrating the birth of their savior , Jesus Christ ; Whereas for Christians , Christmas is celebrated as a recognition of God ’s redemption , mercy , and Grace ; and Whereas many Christians and non-Christians throughout the United States and the rest of the world , celebrate Christmas as a time to serve others : Now , therefore be it Resolved , That the House of Representatives– ( 1 ) recognizes the Christian faith as one of the great religions of the world ; ( 2 ) expresses continued support for Christians in the United States and worldwide ; ( 3 ) acknowledges the international religious and historical importance of Christmas and the Christian faith ; ( 4 ) acknowledges and supports the role played by Christians and Christianity in the founding of the United States and in the formation of the western civilization ; ( 5 ) rejects bigotry and persecution directed against Christians , both in the United States and worldwide ; and ( 6 ) expresses its deepest respect to American Christians and Christians throughout the world .
The House voted on it today .
It passed , 372 – 9 .
( Many congresspeople were present and took no position on the bill or were absent from voting altogether . )
More Democrats ( 195 ) voted for the bill than Republicans ( 177 ) .
Who in their right mind would vote against such a pro-Christian bill ?
The usual good guys :
Gary Ackerman ( D - NY )
( D - NY ) Yvette Clarke ( D - NY )
( D - NY ) Diana DeGette ( D - CO )
( D - CO ) Alcee Hastings ( D - FL )
( D- FL ) Barbara Lee ( D - CA )
( D - CA ) Jim McDermott ( D - WA )
( D- WA ) Bobby Scott ( D - VA )
( D- VA ) Lynn Woolsey ( D - CA )
( D- CA ) And the non-theistic hero : Pete Stark ( D - CA )
Said John Bresnahan at Politico ( before the vote ) :
As someone with a Christian background , I can safely say this may be the silliest resolution ever introduced by , or voted upon , by Congress , although I am a little curious to see if anyone will vote against it .
Do we really need Congress to say Christmas and the Christian faith are important ?
Is n’t that pretty self evident by now ?
Do n’t Christians already pretty much run everything in this country , except for the mainstream media , which is of course controlled by a Jewish - Illuminati - Bill Gates cabal ?
Do n’t we already get Dec. 25 off ?
Was n’t I forced to shell out $ 65 for a scrawny Christmas tree this weekend ?
Wo n’t I have to go to Pentagon City or some other godforsaken place and spend more money in the next couple weeks as part of this strange ritual ?
What about the terrible songs that get endlessly recycled year after stinking year ?
And the useless catalogs that clog my mailbox , despite my efforts to get off mailing lists ?
Where will the horror end ?

Beat Detection Algorithm
We adapted a beat detection algorithm from the MIT Media Lab to Matlab for our project .
Although the algorithm is quite mathematically involved , it basically amounts to emphasizing the sudden impulses of sound in the song and then finding the fundamental period at which these impulses appear .
This is done by breaking the signal into frequency bands , extracting the envelope of these frequency - banded signals , differentiating them to emphasize sudden changes in sound , and running the signals through a comb - filterbank and choosing the highest energy result as our tempo .
Our algorithm does not account for the possibility of a varying tempo in a piece of music .
It extracts 2.2 seconds of music from the middle of a song , tempo- analyzes it , and assumes that the tempo found is associated with the entire piece of music .
The sample length , 2.2 seconds , is the minimal amount of information we can work with to have at least two beats for the slowest tempo we are allowing for , 60 bpm .
We are choosing 2.2 seconds rather than 2 seconds to ensure that the tempo-choosing processing does not exagerrate the energy of 60 bpm .
A two second sample could have its beginning and end perceived as beats by a 60 bpm search process .
Since 60 bpm is our lowest search tempo , any sample longer than two seconds works fine .
Step 1 : Filterbank
The signal is divided up into six separate signals , each consisting of the frequency content of the original signal from a certain range .
This has the general effect of separating " notes " from different instrument groups and allowing them to be analyzed separately .
Tempo- analyzing the original signal could be error - prone due to conflicting downbeats of different instruments .
This separation is performed by taking the FFT of the signal and then taking appropriate sized chunks of the FFT and assigning them to their frequency bands .
( Chunk length is dependent on both the sampling frequency and the signal length . )
We chose to follow the method outlined in Scheirer , 1998 and broke our signal into the bands 0 - 200 Hz , 200- 400 Hz , 400 - 800 Hz , 800 - 1600 Hz , 1600 - 3200 Hz , and finally 3200 Hz - Sampling Frequency .
This gave us a total of six bands to work with .
The inverse FFT of these signals is taken and their time domain representation is sent to the smoothing function .
Step 2 : Smoothing
Since we are only looking for the tempo of our signal , we need to reduce it to a form where we can see sudden changes in sound .
This is done by reducing the signal down to its envelope , which can be though of as the overall trend in sound amplitude , not the frequencies it carries .
Essentially , we take each of our six frequency - banded signals and lowpass filter them .
To accomplish this we first full - wave rectified our signals in order to decrease high - frequency content and so that we would only have to deal with the positive side of the envelope we were searching for .
We then convolved each of our signals by the right half of a Hanning window with a length of .4 seconds .
Again , we chose to do this operation in the by transforming to the frequency domain , multiplying , and inverse transforming to decrease computation time .
The resulting plots of the frequency - banded signals definitely correspond to the envelopes of the original signals .
Step 3 : Diff - Rect
Now that we have the signals in an enveloped form , we can simply differentiate them to accentuate when the sound amplitude changes .
The largest changes should correspond to beats since the beat is just a periodic emphasis of sound .
The six frequency - banded signals are differentiated in time and then half - wave rectified so we can only see increases in sound .
The signals are now ready to be tempo-analyzed .
Step 4 : Comb Filter
This is the most computationally intensive step .
We need to convolve the differentiated frequency - banded signals with various comb filters to determine which yields the highest energy .
A comb filter is basically a series of impulses that occur periodically , at the tempo you specify .
Convolving a comb filter with a total of three impulses with our signal should give an output that has a higher energy when the tempo of the comb filter is close to a multiple of that of the song .
This is because the convolving with the three impulse comb filter just results in an output vector made up of an echoed version of our original signal .
This echoed output will have a higher energy if the tempo of the signal and comb filter match because it will result in there being higher peaks ( overlap from echo ) in the output which when squared will give a higher energy .
We implemented the comb filter by specifying a range of tempos we wanted to search for and the resolution or spacing between them .
This established a set of comb filters to convolve with our signal .
The FFT of each frequency - banded signal was multipled by the FFT of each comb filter and the energy of each of these was taken .
Then the energies of the frequency - bands were summed so that we were left with a vector of energies of tempos .
This output takes the form of a peak at the fundamental tempo of the song followed by smaller , wider peaks at multiples of this tempo .
We then choose the maximum value of these energies to be the fundamental tempo of our piece .

And they blame Mr. Bush and Republicans for Congress ’s low approval ratings , which they say will only help the Democrats expand their majority in 2008 .
“ Certainly , it has been a sprint and a marathon at the same time this year , ” said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
“ We have accomplished a lot , especially on the domestic front . ”
Mr. Van Hollen said he was not worried about Congress ’s low approval ratings .
“ Every one of those polls also shows much stronger support for Democratic leadership than Republican leadership , ” he said .
“ The president is lashing out because he recognizes that people see the White House as an obstacle to change . ”
Still , Democrats conceded that the hectic pace had taken a toll , especially on lawmakers who must travel long distances home and who have small children .
And members of Congress have not gotten a raise or cost - of - living increase this year .
On Wednesday , the House cast its one - thousandth roll - call vote of the year , the first time that it reached that mark since the Constitution was ratified .
Democrats hailed the occasion , while Republicans sniped that only 106 of the votes were on bills ultimately signed into law , and that 45 of those bestowed names on post offices or other property .
“ Unlike Congress , the American people do not mistake motion for progress , ” said Representative Thaddeus G. McCotter , Republican of Michigan .
“ They want results .
And given the approval ratings , they are certainly convinced they are n’t getting them . ”
Mr. McCotter said changing the schedule was an example of Democrats ’ breaking promises .
“ They said ‘ five - day weeks , ’ ” he said .
And he scoffed at the notion that Mr. Hoyer was also responding to Republicans who wanted more time in their home districts .
J. Craig Venter is famous within the biological community for both his development of the " shotgun " method of genome sequencing and behavior that some view as egomaniacal .
In a number of cases , he 's partially sequenced his own genome ( or his pet 's ) , declared victory over public sequencing efforts , and moved on to other projects , leaving others to finish off the work .
In recent years , his focus has shifted to synthetic life — cells directed by simplified genomes engineered to perform useful tasks such as fuel production or drug synthesis .
But , in pursuing that goal , he 's accumulating a patent portfolio that may inhibit biotech research in general .
The concept of synthetic life may be a bit of a misnomer .
Venter 's approach has involved characterizing bacteria that have radically reduced genome sizes in order to determine the minimum set of genes necessary to support life in a favorable environment .
With that list of genes in hand , researchers could then create DNA encoding them from scratch , using machines that can chemically manufacture short stretches of DNA .
Those stretches can be assembled into longer pieces ( Venter 's coworkers have patented an assembly method ) , eventually producing a genome that 's never actually seen a living organism .
DNA on its own can't accomplish much ; it needs to be processed by proteins , supported by a variety of chemical compounds , and separated from the environment by a membrane .
All of those could possibly be arranged , but it 's far simpler to just take an existing cell , wipe out its genome , and replace it with the synthesized one .
Whether this represents synthetic life or an engineered variation of existing life is largely a matter of philosophy and public relations .
In either case , rumors have circulated that Venter 's group has already achieved this , but are awaiting the publication of a scientific paper before formally announcing it .
If there were any doubts regarding these rumors , patent applications by Venter and his associates should put them to rest .
In November , applications were filed , entitled Synthetic genomes and Installation of genomes or partial genomes into cells or cell - like systems , that describe this process in detail .
But , in typical patent fashion , they also generalize the process in such a way that it applies to a wide variety of other potentially useful processes .
The latter claims a patent on , " obtaining a genome that is not within a cell ; and introducing the genome into a cell or cell - like system . "
A further 17 clauses expand that claim to nearly every potentially imaginable form of DNA or membrane - contained space .
The former spends five clauses just to expand the claim about DNA to a huge range different sized DNA molecules , including just about any size that 's convenient for biologists to work with .
The ETC Group , which has been agitating against Venter , suggests that this is an attempt to dominate synthetic life , calling it an attempt to create a " Microbesoft " like monopoly .
" It appears that Craig Venter 's lawyers have constructed a legal rats ' nest of monopoly claims that may entangle the entire field of synthetic biology , " ETC's Jim Thomas said in a statement .
The key question will be whether these new applications will survive the more stringent test of obviousness that resulted from a recent Supreme Court decision .
Although the patents suggest a few clever twists on work that 's already being done in many labs , most of what 's described appears to be an extension of commonly utilized lab techniques to organismal genomes ( researchers commonly do this work with viral genomes already ) .
In fact , due to the vague phrasing , the patents would actually cover somatic cell nuclear transplant , a technique for creating embryonic stem cells that 's been in the news recently .
Given the overlap with existing work , it seems doubtful that these patents would survive the barrage of lawyers that universities and the biotech industry could subject them to if those groups run afoul of licensing issues .
If you ’ve ever visited Oxford , chances are that you ’ll spend some time in Radcliffe Square , admiring the University Library and the round Radcliffe Camera building .
Along the east side of the the square is a long wall with a black metal gate set into it ; people often poke their heads in to see an immaculate yet strangely deserted quadrangle .
This is All Souls college .
Unlike most colleges in Oxford , All Souls does not admit undergraduates .
It currently has 76 fellows , as well as a number of visiting fellows .
For a college that has an endowment of around £ 144 m , this is a small group indeed .
Depending on their status and , for example , whether they teach at Oxford , fellows of All Souls receive a certain stipend and rooms ; nothing huge , but enough for them to pursue whatever line of research they might want .
This alone would be an attractive prospect for any academic , but the reputation of the college and fellows both current and past ( e.g. Isaiah Berlin , Christopher Wren , Amartya Sen ) including elevates the college into a realm that is occupied by , arguably , none other than itself .
All Souls holds a particular fascination for Oxford students .
While most fellows who join the college are postdocs and are elected by its current members , every year , two graduate students – who might be as young as 21 – are admitted as Prize Fellows .
The way these two people are chosen is through a famous exam .
The exam consists of five papers .
Two are on general topics ( PDF ) , such as :
Can terrorism be justified ?
Would you have burned Franz Kafka ’s manuscripts , as he requested in his will ?
If the Greeks invented democracy , what is it ?
Is Amazon.com good for literature ?
Is China overrated ?
What can we learn from Las Vegas ?
Is Dark Energy more interesting than Dark Matter ?
These two general papers have around 30 - 40 questions each , and candidates have to answer three questions on each , with three hours per paper ( i.e. one hour per question ) .
Two more papers are based on the candidate ’s field of study , and cover Classics , Economics , English , History , Law , Philosophy and Politics ( all PDFs ) .
These subject - specific papers have fewer questions per paper , and while they are relatively general questions , e.g. :
Whither social democracy after Tony Blair ?
( Politics )
Can animals think ?
( Philosophy )
Why was resistance to the Mongols so seldom successful ?
( History )
Write on any one of the following : games , food , body parts ( English )
you clearly have to have a good grasp of the subjects ; or at the very least , you would gain a real advantage from having studied them at the degree level .
In other words , it would be difficult to wing it ; there just are n’t enough ‘ really general ’ questions on the subject papers to make that possible .
These questions are all very interesting and I know that candidates enjoy being able to tackle such broad issues .
Even so , the exam would n’t have its legendary status if it was n’t for the fifth paper .
Here is a question from last year ’s fifth paper :
Water
That ’s it .
You have three hours to write an essay on ‘ water ’ .
You can do pretty much whatever you want , although they do discourage ‘ verse , stories or autobiographical accounts ’ .
Here are other questions :
Style
Integrity
Bias
Value
It is n’t hard to see why this is so fascinating for Oxford students ; it ’s an almost pure test of imagination , intelligence and knowledge .
You ca n’t cheat , you ca n’t waffle , you ca n’t data - dump – you have to write something good , something better than the 59 other people also taking the exam .
Many of the candidates for the exam are invited , by virtue of gaining the ‘ top first ’ in their subject or excelling in some other way .
However , most students are n’t aware that practically anyone may enter the exam ; if you have graduated from Oxford in the last three years , or you have been a grad student for under two and a half years , you ’re eligible .
In fact , you might have been a terrible student and you can still enter – and be accepted , as a New Statesmen article about the experiences of a candidate reveals :
David Gilmour , in Curzon , his life of Lord Curzon , viceroy of India and almost prime minister in the 1920s , describes how upset Curzon was on getting a Second in his classics finals .
He “ thought a Second would be so humiliating and make his life so insupportable that he would have to retire somewhere and hide his face from the world ” .
Curzon wrote that he would devote his future to “ showing the examiners that they had made a mistake ” .
The best way of showing them was to win the All Souls fellowship which , after a year ’s study , including a volume of Gibbon every two days , he duly did .
You may have noticed that there are no papers for any of the sciences .
All Souls does count scientists among its fellows , and Prof. V. S. Ramachandran , a neuroscientist I studied under , was a visiting fellow , which demonstrates that they do n’t have any intrinsic objection to science .
However , I still found it a little odd ; presumably they had a good reason for omitting the sciences , but what was it ?
I emailed the Warden ’s Secretary and received this answer :
Science subjects have not been one of the traditional subjects of the Prize Fellowship Examination , and the reason for maintaining this is that young scientists on the whole are well looked after in other colleges and universities .
This is basically true ; it is much easier for young scientists to find funding from not only colleges and universities but also government and NGO funding bodies like the BBSRC and the Wellcome Trust .
However , I would argue that this is n’t the whole story .
Anyone smart enough to win a Prize Fellowship at All Souls is smart enough to get plenty of funding from anywhere in the world ; their reason would make sense if they were offering dozens of fellowships , but not only two .
The reason why graduates want to join All Souls is not merely receive funding , but for the prestige , company and freedom that it entails ; something that scientists equally prize and cannot be obtained from other sources .
All Souls is a private institution and it can do as it pleases .
I do n’t think it ’s hard to imagine that the criteria which the college selects Prize Fellows also includes how interesting they are , and whether they are good conversationalists ( hence the viva and ‘ dinner test ’ for shortlisted candidates ) ; and as a former scientist , I would be forced to concede that we are generally not as good in those areas as others .
Even so , I can’t but help think that All Souls is missing out on some excellent scientists who can match any arts or humanities students blow for blow .
Aside from the issue of science , I find that the All Souls exam is a refreshingly tough yet interesting test for which it is impossible to prepare .
Its generality and openendedness allows candidates to shine , instead of being confined by narrowly - defined questions , and as such I imagine it ’s a very good way to discover smart and interesting people .
Such tests are sadly rare these days .
( I ’m inclined to pose some of the questions on the After Our Time forum when it gets a bit busier ; they make particularly good discussion topics )

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
At least three major companies want their ads pulled from Ann Coulter 's Web site , following customer complaints about the right - wing commentator referring to Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards as a " faggot . "
Verizon , Sallie Mae and Georgia - based NetBank each said they did n't know their ads were on AnnCoulter.com until they received the complaints .
A diarist at the liberal blog DailyKos.com posted contact information for dozens of companies with ads on Coulter 's site after the commentator made her remarks about Edwards at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington on Friday .
( Full story )
" One of the best ways to communicate one 's distaste for Coulter 's repeated incidents of hate speech is to respectfully but firmly let her advertisers know you are deeply troubled by their indirect support of bigotry through their advertising on Coulter 's Web site , " the blogger VolvoDrivingLiberal wrote on DailyKos.com on Sunday .
Verizon , Sallie Mae and NetBank said the ads were put on a variety of sites by a third party company .
In many cases , advertisers do not know which sites feature their ads .
" Per our policy , the networked Web site ad purchases are supposed to be stripped of certain kinds of Web sites , " said a Verizon spokesperson .
" This one could be considered an extreme political Web site , should be off the list , and now it is off the list . "
A Sallie Mae spokesperson said the company was only testing an online advertising agency , and that their ads were not meant to show up on Coulter 's site .
The company said they planned to pull ads from other political and religious Web sites as well .
A spokesperson for NetBank said Coulter 's page " is not the kind of site we want to be on . "
Coulter did not respond to CNN 's request for comment .

Top 10 Big Stories Censored By US Media Posted by Pile ( 21359 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Activists ]
Project Censored is a media research group out of Sonoma State University which tracks the news published in independent journals and newsletters .
From these , Project Censored compiles an annual list of top news stories of social significance that have been overlooked , under - reported or self - censored by the country 's major national news media .
Between 700 and 1000 stories are submitted to Project Censored each year from journalists , scholars , librarians , and concerned citizens around the world .
With the help of more than 200 Sonoma State University faculty , students , and community members , Project Censored reviews the story submissions for coverage , content , reliability of sources and national significance .
The university community selects 25 stories to submit to the Project Censored panel of judges who then rank them in order of importance .
Current or previous national judges include : Noam Chomsky , Susan Faludi , George Gerbner , Sut Jhally , Frances Moore Lappe , Norman Solomon , Michael Parenti , Herbert I. Schiller , Barbara Seaman , Erna Smith , Mike Wallace and Howard Zinn .
All 25 stories are featured in the yearbook , Censored : The News That Did n't Make the News .
1. GOOD - BYE , HABEAS CORPUS
The Military Commissions Act , passed in September 2006 as a last gasp of the Republican - controlled Congress and signed into law by Bush that Oct. 17 , made significant changes to the nation 's judicial system .
The law allows the president to designate any person an " alien unlawful enemy combatant , " shunting that individual into an alternative court system in which the writ of habeas corpus no longer applies , the right to a speedy trial is gone , and justice is meted out by a military tribunal that can admit evidence obtained through coercion and presented without the accused in the courtroom , all under the guise of preserving national security .
Habeas corpus , a constitutional right cribbed from the Magna Carta , protects against arbitrary imprisonment .
Alexander Hamilton , writing in the Federalist Papers , called it the greatest defense against " the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny . "
The Military Commissions
Act has been seen mostly as a method for dealing with Guantánamo Bay detainees , and most journalists have reported that it does n't have any impact on Americans .
On Oct. 19 , 2006 , editors at the New York Times wrote , in quite definitive language , " this law does not apply to American citizens . "
Investigative journalist Robert Parry disagrees .
The right of habeas corpus no longer exists for any of us , he wrote in the online journal Consortium .
Deep down in the lower sections of the act , the language shifts from the very specific " alien unlawful enemy combatant " to the vague " any person subject to this chapter . "
" Why does it contain language referring to ' any person ' and then adding in an adjacent context a reference to people acting ' in breach of allegiance or duty to the United States ' ? "
Parry wrote .
" Who has 'an allegiance or duty to the United States ' if not an American citizen ? "
Reached by phone , Parry told the Guardian that " this loose phraseology could be interpreted very narrowly or very broadly . "
He said he 's consulted with lawyers who are experienced in drafting federal security legislation , and they agreed that the " any person " terminology is troubling .
" It could be fixed very simply , but the Bush administration put through this very vaguely worded law , and now there are a lot of differences of opinion on how it could be interpreted , " Parry said .
Though US Sens. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) and Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) moved quickly to remedy the situation with the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act , that legislation has yet to pass Congress , which some suspect is because too many Democrats do n't want to seem soft on terrorism .
Until tested by time , exactly how much the language of the Military Commissions
Act may be manipulated will remain to be seen .

2. MARTIAL LAW : COMING TO A TOWN NEAR YOU
The Military Commissions
Act was part of a one - two punch to civil liberties .
While the first blow to habeas corpus received some attention , there was almost no media coverage of a private Oval Office ceremony held the same day the military act was signed at which Bush signed the John Warner Defense Authorization Act , a $ 532 billion catchall bill for defense spending .
Tucked away in the deeper recesses of that act , section 1076 allows the president to declare a public emergency and dispatch federal troops to take over National Guard units and local police if he determines them unfit for maintaining order .
This is essentially a revival of the Insurrection Act , which was repealed by Congress in 1878 , when it passed the Posse Comitatus Act in response to Northern troops overstaying their welcome in the reconstructed South .
That act wiped out a potentially tyrannical amount of power by reinforcing the idea that the federal government should patrol the nation 's borders and let the states take care of their own territories .
The Warner act defines a public emergency as a " natural disaster , epidemic , or other serious public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident , or other condition in any state or possession of the United States " and extends its provisions to any place where " the president determines that domestic violence has occurred to such an extent that the constituted authorities of the state or possession are incapable of maintaining public order . "
On top of that , federal troops can be dispatched to " suppress , in a state , any insurrection , domestic violence , unlawful combination , or conspiracy . "
So everything from a West Nile virus outbreak to a political protest could fall into the president 's personal definition of mayhem .
That 's right — put your picket signs away .
The Warner act passed with 90 percent of the votes in the House and cleared the Senate unanimously .
Months after its passage , Leahy was the only elected official to have publicly expressed concern about section 1076 , warning his peers Sept. 19 , 2006 , that " we certainly do not need to make it easier for presidents to declare martial law .
Invoking the Insurrection Act and using the military for law enforcement activities goes against some of the central tenets of our democracy .
One can easily envision governors and mayors in charge of an emergency having to constantly look over their shoulders while someone who has never visited their communities gives the orders . "
In February , Leahy introduced Senate Bill 513 to repeal section 1076 .
It 's currently in the Armed Services Committee .

3. AFRICOM
President Jimmy Carter was the first to draw a clear line between America 's foreign policy and its concurrent " vital interest " in oil .
During his 1980 State of the Union address , he said , " An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America , and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary , including military force . "
Under what became the Carter Doctrine , an outpost of the Pentagon , called the United States Central Command , or CENTCOM , was established to ensure the uninterrupted flow of that slick " vital interest . "
The United States is now constructing a similar permanent base in Africa , an area traditionally patrolled by more remote commands in Europe and the Pacific .
No details have been released about exactly what AFRICOM 's operations and responsibilities will be or where troops will be located , though government spokespeople have vaguely stated that the mission is to establish order and keep peace for volatile governments — that just happen to be in oil - rich areas .
Though the official objective may be peace , some say the real desire is crude .
" A new cold war is under way in Africa , and AFRICOM will be at the dark heart of it , " Bryan Hunt wrote on the Moon of Alabama blog , which covers politics , economics , and philosophy .
Most US oil imports come from African countries — in particular , Nigeria .
According to the 2007 Congressional Budget Justification for Foreign Operations , " disruption of supply from Nigeria would represent a major blow to US oil - security strategy . "
Though details of the AFRICOM strategy remain secret , Hunt has surveyed past governmental statements and reports by other independent journalists to draw parallels between AFRICOM and CENTCOM , making the case that the United States sees Africa as another " vital interest . "

4. SECRET TRADE AGREEMENTS
As disappointing as the World Trade Organization has been , it has provided something of an open forum in which smaller countries can work together to demand concessions from larger , developed nations when brokering multilateral agreements .
At least in theory .
The 2006 negotiations crumbled when the United States , the European Union , and Australia refused to heed India 's and Brazil 's demands for fair farm tariffs .
In the wake of that disaster , bilateral agreements have become the tactic of choice .
These one - on - one negotiations , designed by the US and the EU , are cut like backroom deals , with the larger country bullying the smaller into agreements that could n't be reached through the WTO .
Bush administration officials , always quick with a charming moniker , are calling these free - trade agreements " competitive liberalization , " and the EU considers them essential to negotiating future multilateral agreements .
But critics see them as fast tracks to increased foreign control of local resources in poor communities .
" The overall effect of these changes in the rules is to progressively undermine economic governance , transferring power from governments to largely unaccountable multinational firms , robbing developing countries of the tools they need to develop their economies and gain a favorable foothold in global markets , " states a report by Oxfam International , the antipoverty activist group .

5. SHANGHAIED SLAVES CONSTRUCT US EMBASSY IN IRAQ
Part of the permanent infrastructure the United States is erecting in Iraq includes the world 's largest embassy , built on Green Zone acreage equal to that of Vatican City .
The $ 592 million job was awarded in 2005 to First Kuwaiti Trading and Contracting .
Though much of the project 's management is staffed by Americans , most of the workers are from small or developing countries like the Philippines , India , and Pakistan and , according to David Phinney of CorpWatch — a Bay Area organization that investigates and exposes corporate environmental crimes , fraud , corruption , and violations of human rights — are recruited under false pretenses .
At the airport , their boarding passes read Dubai .
Their passports are stamped Dubai .
But when they get off the plane , they 're in Baghdad .
Once on site , they 're often beaten and paid as little as $ 10 to $ 30 a day , CorpWatch concludes .
Injured workers are dosed with heavy - duty painkillers and sent back on the job .
Lodging is crowded , and food is substandard .
One ex-foreman , who 's worked on five other US embassies around the world , said , " I 've never seen a project more f*cked up .
Every US labor law was broken . "
These workers have often been banned by their home countries from working in Baghdad because of unsafe conditions and flagging support for the war , but once they 're on Iraqi soil , protections are few .
First , Kuwaiti managers take their passports , which is a violation of US labor laws .
" If you do n't have a passport or an embassy to go to , what do you do to get out of a bad situation ? " asked Rory Mayberry , a former medic for one of First Kuwaiti's subcontractors , who blew the whistle on the squalid living conditions , medical malpractice , and general abuse he witnessed at the site .
The Pentagon has been investigating the slavelike conditions but has not released the names of any violating contractors or announced penalties .
In the meantime , billions of dollars in contracts continue to be awarded to First Kuwaiti and other companies at which little accountability exists .
As Phinney reported , " No journalist has ever been allowed access to the sprawling 104 - acre site . "

6. FALCON'S TALONS
Operation FALCON , or Federal and Local Cops Organized Nationally , is , in many ways , the manifestation of martial law forewarned by Frank Morales ( see story 2 ) .
In an unprecedented partnership , more than 960 federal , state , and local police agencies teamed up in 2005 and 2006 to conduct the largest dragnet raids in US history .
Armed with fistfuls of arrest warrants , they ran three separate raids around the country that netted 30,110 criminal arrests .
The Justice Department claimed the agents were targeting the " worst of the worst " criminals , and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said , " Operation FALCON is an excellent example of President Bush 's direction and the Justice Department 's dedication to deal both with the terrorist threat and traditional violent crime . "
However , as writer Mike Whitney points out on Uruknet . info , none of the suspects has been charged with anything related to terrorism .
Additionally , while 30,110 individuals were arrested , only 586 firearms were found .
That does n't sound very violent either .
Though the US Marshals Service has been quick to tally the offenses , Whitney says the numbers just do n't add up .
For example , FALCON in 2006 captured 462 violent sex-crime suspects , 1,094 registered sex offenders , and 9,037 fugitives .
What about the other 7,481 people ?
" Who are they , and have they been charged with a crime ? "
Whitney asked .
The Marshals Service remains silent about these arrests .
Whitney suggests those detainees may have been illegal immigrants and may be bound for border prisons currently being constructed by Halliburton ( see last year 's Project Censored ) .
As an added bonus of complicity , the Justice Department supplied local news outlets with stock footage of the raids , which some TV stations ran accompanied by stories sourced from the Department of Justice 's news releases without any critical coverage of who exactly was swept up in the dragnets and where they are now .

7. BLACKWATER
The outsourcing of war has served two purposes for the Bush administration , which has given powerful corporations and private companies lucrative contracts supplying goods and services to American military operations overseas and quietly achieved an escalation of troops beyond what the public has been told or understands .
Without actually deploying more military forces , the federal government instead contracts with private security firms like Blackwater to provide heavily armed details for US diplomats in Iraq , Afghanistan , and other countries where the nation is currently engaged in conflicts .
Blackwater is one of the more successful and well connected of the private companies profiting from the business of war .
Started in 1996 by an ex–Navy Seal named Erik Prince , the North Carolina company employs 20,000 hired guns , training them on the world 's largest private military base .
" It 's become nothing short of the Praetorian Guard for the Bush administration 's so - called global war on terror , " author Jeremy Scahill said on the Jan. 26 broadcast of the TV and radio news program Democracy Now !
Scahill 's Blackwater : The Rise of the World 's Most Powerful Mercenary Army was published this year by Nation Books .

8. KIA : THE NEOLIBERAL INVASION OF INDIA
A March 2006 pact under which the United States agreed to supply nuclear fuel to India for the production of electric power also included a less - publicized corollary — the Knowledge Initiative on Agriculture .
While it 's purportedly a deal to assist Indian farmers and liberalize trade ( see story 4 ) , critics say the initiative is destroying India 's local agrarian economy by encouraging the use of genetically modified seeds , which in turn is creating a new market for pesticides and driving up the overall cost of producing crops .
The deal provides a captive customer base for genetically modified seed maker Monsanto and a market for cheap goods to supply Wal - Mart , whose plans for 500 stores in the country could wipe out the livelihoods of 14 million small vendors .
Monsanto's hybrid
Bt cotton has already edged out local strains , and India is currently suffering an infestation of mealy bugs , which have proven immune to the pesticides the chemical companies have made available .
Additionally , the sowing of crops has shifted from the traditional to the trade friendly .
Farmers accustomed to cultivating mustard , a sacred local crop , are now producing soy , a plant foreign to India .
Though many farmers are seeing the folly of these deals , it 's often too late .
Suicide has become a popular final act of opposition to what 's occurring in their country .
Vandana Shiva , who for 10 years has been studying the effects of bad trade deals on India , has published a report titled Seeds of Suicide , which recounts the deaths of more than 28,000 farmers who killed themselves in despair over the debts brought on them by binding agreements ultimately favoring corporations .
Hope comes in the form of a growing cadre of farmers hip to the flawed deals .
They 've organized into local sanghams , 72 of which now exist as small community networks that save and share seeds , skills , and assistance during the good times of harvest and the hard times of crop failure .

9. THE PRIVATIZATION OF AMERICA'S INFRASTRUCTURE
In 1956 , President Dwight D. Eisenhower ushered through legislation for the greatest public works project in human history — the interstate highway system , 41,000 miles of roads funded almost entirely by the federal government .
Fifty years later many of those roads are in need of repair or replacement , but the federal government has not exactly risen to the challenge .
Instead , more than 20 states have set up financial deals leasing the roads to private companies in exchange for repairs .
These public - private partnerships are being lauded by politicians as the only credible financial solution to providing the public with improved services .
But opponents of all political stripes are criticizing the deals as theft of public property .
They point out that the bulk of benefits is actually going to the private side of the equation — in many cases , to foreign companies with considerable experience building private roads in developing countries .
In the United States these companies are entering into long - term leases of infrastructure like roads and bridges , for a low amount .
They work out tax breaks to finance the repairs , raise tolls to cover the costs , and start realizing profits for their shareholders in as little as 10 years .
As Daniel Schulman and James Ridgeway reported in Mother Jones , " the Federal Highway Administration estimates that it will cost $ 50 billion a year above current levels of federal , state , and local highway funding to rehab existing bridges and roads over the next 16 years .
Where to get that money , without raising taxes ?
Privatization promises a quick fix — and a way to outsource difficult decisions , like raising tolls , to entities that do n't have to worry about getting reelected . "
The Indiana Toll Road , the Chicago Skyway , Virginia 's Pocahontas Parkway , and many other stretches of the nation 's public pavement have succumbed to these private deals .
Cheerleaders for privatization are deeply embedded in the Bush administration ( see story 7 ) , where they 've been secretly fostering plans for a North American Free Trade Agreement superhighway , a 10 - lane route set to run through the heart of the country and connect the Mexican and Canadian borders .
It 's specifically designed to plug into the Mexican port of Lázaro Cárdenas , taking advantage of cheap labor by avoiding the International Longshore and Warehouse Union , whose members are traditionally tasked with unloading cargo , and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , whose members transport that cargo that around the country .

10 . VULTURE FUNDS : DEVOURING THE DESPERATE
Named for a bird that picks offal from a carcass , this financial scheme could n't be more aptly described .
Well - endowed companies swoop in and purchase the debt owed by a third world country , then turn around and sue the country for the full amount — plus interest .
In most courts , they win .
Recently , Donegal International spent $ 3 million for $ 40 million worth of debt Zambia owed Romania , then sued for $ 55 million .
In February an English court ruled that Zambia had to pay $ 15 million .
Often these countries are on the brink of having their debt relieved by the lenders in exchange for putting the owed money toward necessary goods and services for their citizens .
But the vultures effectively initiate another round of deprivation for the impoverished countries by demanding full payment , and a loophole makes it legal .
Investigative reporter Greg Palast broke the story for the BBC's Newsnight , saying that " the vultures have already sucked up about $ 1 billion in aid meant for the poorest nations , according to the World Bank in Washington . "
With the exception of the BBC and Democracy Now ! , no major news source has touched the story , though it 's incensed several members of Britain 's Parliament as well as the new prime minister , Gordon Brown .
US Reps .
John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) and Donald Payne ( D - N.J. ) lobbied Bush to take action as well , but political will may be elsewhere .
Debt Advisory International , an investment consulting firm that 's been involved in several vulture funds that have generated millions in profits , is run by Paul Singer — the largest fundraiser for the Republican Party in the state of New York .
He 's donated $ 1.7 million to Bush 's campaigns .

Functional Languages seem to be pushing for the title of the next cool thing .
Talks and tutorials about them are starting to show up in conferences and conventions , books about them are hitting the shelves , people are even asking about talking about them in blogs and mailing lists devoted to some of the current hot languages .
Does this mean you ’ll be using one next year ?
Maybe , but probably not .
Does it mean you might want to spend some time learning one ?
Absolutely .
Brief description of functional languages .
Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt the Pragmatic Programmers recommend learning a new language every year , calling it a LOTY ( Language of the Year ) .
In his book ‘ My Job Went To India ’ , Chad Fowler complains about programmers who say things like : ‘ No I have n’t been given the opportunity to work with language Foo , or framework Bar . ’
This is a great chance to look at something that ’s very different from the way you ’re programming today , something that could change the way you think about programming challenges .
So , what are functional programming languages ?
At the core , they ’re languages that carefully follow mathematical concepts .
Variables are n’t , at least not as most programmers think of them
They ’re more like a variable in algebra — once you ’ve found the value of X in a problem , it ’s not going to change on you .
Functional languages also avoid ‘ side effects ’.
That is , if you pass a value into a function it will not be changed and the function will not cause other changes somewhere else in your data ( there ’s a formal method for getting around this to do things like output … I ’m not planning on getting into that here though ) .
Meta -programming , lazy evaluation , and type safety are much more common idioms in the functional languages I ’ve seen too .
These differences mean that doing simple things like iterating over a loop and incrementing a counter as you do just do n’t work in functional programming .
Recursion , list mapping , accumulation , and the like are much more common in the functional world .
This might sound a little strange — I mean , how can you program without loops , or variables that can vary ?
In truth , functional programmers seem to be doing very well .
They seem to be over - represented in the top finishers in programming competitions .
Their code tremendously terse , and often scarily efficient .
It ’s just not mainstream ( yet ) .
Functional Languages seem to get a lot more traction in Europe and academia right now .
Over the last couple of years , they ’ve been making up ground in that group Tim O’Reilly likes to call ‘ the Alpha - geeks ’ .
Whether or not functional languages are poised to take the next step into wide spread adoption is anybody ’s guess , but it ’s certainly a possibility .
Recently , three different publishers have release books about different functional programming languages .
First , Apress put out Practical OCaml , which did n’t go over very well in the community — I know they ’re looking at what they can do to ‘ get back on the horse ’ and get a really successful functional language book out the door .
Next up was Cambridge University Press was next with Programming in Haskell .
This looks like a very solid book , and I ’ve heard other people say good things about it too .
I have to admit that I ’m put off by the use of special characters in program listings , where the actual code would use a normal ascii symbol ( for example , the greek lambda character in place of an / ) .
Most recently , the Pragmatic Programmers have launched a beta of Programming Erlang by Joe Armstrong ( the creator of Erlang ) .

The combination of functional programming , a tremendous level of concurrency baked into the language , and a great book from Joe Armstrong and the prags has sold me .
I ’m looking forward to starting in the second half of May .

The stirring debut reflects voracious appetite for China - related stocks , as investors , many of whom received far fewer IPO shares than they wanted , shrugged off the Hong Kong market ’s sharp drop on Monday and what several observers consider to be a sky - high valuation to buy Alibaba.com shares .
" I 'm not convinced , " said Andrew Clarke , a trader at Societe Generale Securities in Hong Kong .
" It 's massively overpriced .
I 'd rather go buy Exxon XOM .N at 15 times earnings . "
Shares in Alibaba.com , in which Internet giant Yahoo Inc YHOO.
O is a key investor , traded as high as HK$ 39.95 , compared with an IPO price of HK $ 13.50 , which was at the top of an indicated range after the company 's share sale drew record demand from Hong Kong retail investors .
The stock rose steadily through the day despite a see- sawing broader market and closed at HK$ 39.50 for a gain of nearly 193 percent , valuing Alibaba.com at roughly US $ 25.6 billion and ranking it fifth among global Internet firms and top in Asia outside Japan .
Trading in Hong Kong was so frenetic that the Stock Exchange took calls from brokers asking whether there were slowdowns in the order - placing system .
“ It ’s helped by the recent strength of tech stocks in the U.S. , ” said Louis Wong , research director at Phillip Securities .
" Baidu BIDU.O has risen above $ 400 and Google GOOG .
O has held well above $ 700 , " he said , referring to the Chinese and U.S. - based Internet search firms , respectively .
With more than 162 million Web users , China is the world ’s second - largest Internet market after the United States .
“ Because China is such a large , fragmented economy , the Internet is an attractive tool , ” said Robert James Horrocks , head of research at Mirae Asset Global Investments in Hong Kong .
Alibaba.com , an online business - to - business site connecting companies looking to import and export Chinese goods , was founded in 1999 as a bulletin board for businesses to post trade leads .
The company says that at end - June its online marketplaces had more than 24 million members .
The Hang Seng Index .HSI ended 1.7 percent higher after dropping 5 percent on Monday in its sharpest one - day fall since September 2001 , which had led many observers to lower their expectations for Alibaba.com 's trading debut .
HIGH VALUATION
Investors clamored for Alibaba.com shares even though its IPO price valued the company at more than 106 times forecast 2007 earnings -- a premium to most of its peers -- and its Tuesday performance lifted its valuation to a stratospheric 316 times .
“ For global funds , it ’s the only type of e-commerce service sector stock in the region .
For e-commerce , it ’s the Asian proxy , ” said Andrew Sullivan , sales trading director at Daiwa Securities .
By comparison , Baidu.com
Inc trades at 170 times 2007 forecast earnings , while Google Inc is at 46 times and eBay Inc EBAY .O at 23.5 times .
Trade media company Global Sources Ltd GSOL.O trades at 47 times , while Hong Kong- listed Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700 .
HK trades at 77 times prospective earnings .
“ The price set is reasonable .
I said it two weeks ago , and today ’s performance has proven me right , ” said Alibaba.com Chairman Jack Ma , who founded the company in the eastern city of Hangzhou and is one of China ’s highest - profile entrepreneurs .
Money has poured into Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong , partly on expectations that investors in mainland China , where stocks are among the world ’s most expensive , will eventually be able to buy stocks listed in Hong Kong .
On Monday , PetroChina 601857 .SS shares more than doubled on their debut in Shanghai , making China 's top oil producer by far the world 's biggest listed company by market value at around $ 1 trillion .
The HSCE Index .HSCE of Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong was up nearly 79 percent in 2007 through Tuesday , while the Shanghai benchmark .
SSEC has more than doubled .
HEAVY DEMAND
Alibaba.com sold 858.9 million IPO shares , or 17 percent of its enlarged share capital , in a deal handled by Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE , Goldman Sachs GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N .
The company generated orders worth HK $ 447.5 billion ( US $ 57.4 billion ) from Hong Kong retail investors alone , making it the most popular IPO in the city , beating share sales by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China 1398 .
HK601398.SS and Belle International 1880 .HK .
Yahoo holds a 1.2 percent stake in Alibaba.com , as well as a 39 percent stake in Alibaba.com ’s parent firm , which holds 75 percent of the listing company .
Other investors in the IPO included Cisco Systems CSCO.O and Taiwan 's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co 2317 .

The ability to create flexible , transparent electronics could lead to a host of novel applications , such as e-paper and electronic car windshields .
Now , scientists have constructed a transistor made of a network of nanotubes that may serve as an essential component in a trans - flex device .
Such devices require two main components : light displays and current - controlling transistors .
While scientists have found that OLEDs and LCDs work well as light displays , finding a truly transparent and flexible transistor material is still an open area .
Usually , these transistors consist of metallic nanowires .
Recently , researchers from Hanyang University in Seoul have constructed a thin film transistor made of networked single - walled carbon nanotubes ( SWNTs ) on a glass substrate .
While it ’s not the first thin film transistor made of SWNTs , it has the advantage of allowing a high density of SWNTs to be grown under lower temperatures than normally required .
Most significantly , the method shows that nanotubes can offer a practical choice for fabricating transparent , thin film electronics such as flat - panel displays and future opto-electronics devices .
“ This works shows that we are able to build a transistor with thin films of SWNTs , rather than with single SWNTs , ” coauthor Wanjun Park told PhysOrg.com .
“ It means that we have an easier fabrication method for building electronic devices made of nanotubes , without the need to individually control each single tube . ”
In a recent issue of Nanotechnology , the researchers explained how the SWNT network can be arranged through a technique called chemical vapor deposition .
In this method , the substrate is pre-patterned with catalysts to avoid the need for etching , and the nanotubes can be directly deposited on the substrate .
By enhancing this technique with the use of a water plasma , the scientists were able to grow the nanotubes at significantly lower temperatures than in previous methods .
Due to the high SWNT density on the substrate , the nanotubes intersected with each other to form a continuous conductive path .
However , for nanotubes above a critical percolation threshold ( a measure of connectivity ) , there was no conductance .
In this way , the SWNTs act like semiconductors , providing the basis for the on - off switching in the transistor .
In the future , the scientists plan to make improvements to the nanotube transistors by increasing their mobility and further understanding the complex configuration of the nanotube networks .
“ These results are just the beginning , ” Park said .
“ The technology needs lower temperatures for semiconducting SWNT growth , as well as higher transistor performance for real applications .
But SWNT is a very robust material with outstanding electrical properties .
It can be expected to be one of the candidates for a future electronic material . ”

" We need to have a mayor who can speak , a mayor who can think on his feet a mayor who can change course in this city , " said Mr. Giuliani , the Republican - Liberal candidate , in a speech to some of his staunchest supporters at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers .
Yesterday , one day after he released an ad criticizing Mr. Giuliani on the abortion issue , the Mayor began broadcasting another commercial that accused his rival of waffling on gun control and of being linked to the Reagan Justice Department that tried to " turn back the clock on civil rights . "
Mr. Giuliani condemned the ads as " nasty personal attacks " and pledged to his supporters to keep his campaign focused on issues and management style .
Responding to the Opposition
The Mayor 's aides say their latest ad is part of their deliberate effort to counter weeks of commercials in which Mr. Giuliani attacked conditions in the city -- and thus implicitly the Mayor -- without naming him .
They want to frame the election as a contest between Democrats and Republicans , something they contend President Clinton was also trying to do last weekend in his speech supporting the Mayor , in which Mr. Clinton worried that too many New York Democrats might be unwilling to support the Mayor in part because of his race .
Asked why the Mayor should be so strongly on the offensive if they believe the latest polls that show him even or ahead , mayoral advisers said they believed they have scored so far by chipping away at Mr. Giuliani 's record and intend to continue .
They vowed not to make " personal attacks , " saying the Mayor would not allow that .
Norman Swan : Good morning and welcome to the program .
Today on the Health Report a theory with scientific evidence behind it as to why the obesity epidemic is perhaps worse than it should be .
The food industry , especially in the United States , hates the message you 're about to hear and while certain manufacturing practices mentioned do n't happen in Australia , as you 'll hear , some in fact do .
The question is whether there 's stuff in our food which makes us even fatter than our calorie excess would suggest .
It 's about how a carbohydrate may be behaving like a dietary fat .
One of the key people pushing this idea is Dr Robert Lustig who 's Professor of Pediatric Endocrinology at the University of California , San Francisco .
Robert Lustig : I 'm very interested in what 's happened over the last 30 years that has fomented this obesity epidemic .
And of course everyone says well , that 's because you 're eating too much , and you 're exercising too little and of course that 's true .
But the question is what about our physiology allows this to happen , we have some built - in negative feedback mechanisms that are supposed to stop us from gaining too much weight but clearly they are not working .
The question I 've been interested in now for the last ten years is what is actually blocking that signal to the brain to tell our bodies to eat less and exercise more ?
Clearly something is getting in its way .
Over the course of those ten years I 've done numerous experiments in people and have come up with the notion that this is actually one of the main functions of the hormone insulin .
Insulin's job is to store energy , insulin's job is to make you gain weight .
Norman Swan : Transports sugar from the blood into cells .
Robert Lustig : Exactly , that 's insulin's job .
Let 's take a diabetic off the street , blood sugar is 300 -- in Australian terms that would probably be something in the order of 15 .
We give them a shot of insulin , the blood sugar goes down to 100 , that would be something like 4 or 5 , the question is where did the sugar go ?
It went to the fat for storage .
That 's insulin's job , insulin's job is to take sugar from the blood and put it into fat for storage , more insulin -- more fat .
Well all these kids who are walking around who are massively obese now have extraordinarily high insulins .
The question is when your insulin is high and you 're storing energy you make another hormone , and that hormone is called leptin , and leptin is supposed to go to your brain and tell your brain that you 've eaten enough .
Norman Swan :
It 's produced by fat cells in fact .
Robert Lustig :
That 's right , it 's produced by fat cells , it circulates in the bloodstream , binds to specific receptors in the hypothalamus , the area of the brain that controls energy balance and it 's supposed to turn eating off .
In addition it also raises the tone of an area of your brain called the sympathetic nervous system which is designed to actually help you burn energy .
So by reducing food intake and by increasing the burning of energy you 're supposed to stay in balance -- but clearly these kids are not in balance .
So the question is , could insulin actually be interfering with that leptin signal , and that 's what we 've ultimately shown by actually suppressing insulin with a drug .
Norman Swan :
So what have you done ?
Robert Lustig :
We took these kids who developed massive obesity after brain tumours ; these kids have a tumour in the area of the brain which controls energy balance , the most common of which is called a cranial pharyngioma , and once these kids are treated , that area of the brain is now dead , it can not see leptin .
When you can't see leptin your brain is starving , and so what it does is it increases your food intake because you need to eat more -- even though there 's plenty of leptin , you can't see it , so it 's like it was n't there -- and it also reduces your sympathetic nervous system in order to actually make you feel lousy and to burn less energy .
Because energy expenditure , energy burning and quality of life are the same thing , anything that raises your energy expenditure makes you feel good ; for instance coffee , for two hours , and then you need another one .
Anything that reduces your energy expenditure , like for instance hypo thyroidism as an example , makes you feel lousy .
So when you can't see your leptin your brain thinks you 're starving , you feel crappy , you certainly do n't want to exercise and you 're going to eat more .
So we see these children with brain tumours who can't see their leptin and we asked the question -- could we somehow influence this disastrous feedback cycle ?
What we did is we gave a drug called Octreotide and we knocked down their insulin levels with this medicine and all of a sudden , not only did these kids stop eating , they started exercising spontaneously , they just did it .
Two kids started lifting weights at home , one kid became a competitive swimmer , one kid became a manager of his high school basketball team , running around collecting all the basket balls .
Norman Swan :
So you 're postulating that insulin was having an influence on the brain itself .
Robert Lustig : Right , by getting the insulin down instead of the energy that they were eating being forced to fat , the energy that they were eating could now be burned by muscle , could now be burned by the rest of the body , made them feel better .
Norman Swan :
It could help to explain why leptin has been such a disappointing hormone , that in fact it 's much more complicated than leptin , if only it was just leptin but in fact leptin's pretty lousy at controlling appetite itself , even when you 've got it .
Robert Lustig :
That 's right , all the studies giving leptin to obese people have basically been failures , and the reason is because you have this thing called leptin - resistance , you can't see your leptin .
If you could see your leptin you would n't be fat , in fact leptin resistance and obesity are actually the same thing .
So the question is , what causes the leptin resistance , what causes you to not be able to see your leptin ?
Well these brain tumour kids , we know what it is , they 've got death of that area of the brain .
The question is what 's wrong with the rest of us ?
What we did was we actually dropped insulin in otherwise normal , healthy obese people , using the same mechanism .
Norman Swan : Adults or children ?
Robert Lustig :
This was adults , and we ended up with the same answer , we were able to get them to stop eating , in fact they stopped eating carbohydrate on a dime , they went from 900 calories a day in carbohydrate intake to 350 calories a day in carbohydrate intake , they stopped snacking between meals , they stopped drinking soft drinks .
We did n't tell them to do this , they just did it , they did n't need to do it .
Their insulins went down , they felt better , they started exercising and they lost weight and continued and kept losing weight .
If you look at all of the drugs that are out on the market today , they all cause some weight loss and then at the four month time point that 's it , you can't lose any more , you hit the negative plateau and you can't go any further .
And the reason that you hit this negative plateau is because your leptin has finally gotten down to a point where your brain is now starving .
When we got the insulin down not only did the leptin keep going down but it kept going down even further .
They kept losing more weight , they kept feeling better , they kept exercising and we were able to not have a negative plateau , we lost even more weight over the course of the year .
Norman Swan :
So how come anti-diabetic drugs which effectively do that , they reduce insulin resistance , get your insulin levels down -- how come they do n't universally cause weight loss , in fact some of them can cause weight gain ?
Robert Lustig :
It depends on which one , in fact Metformin is an insulin sensitiser , it does get insulin levels down and we 've shown that it 's actually a very good promoter of weight loss , especially in insulin - resistant children .
If you look at the adult data it 's a relatively mediocre respons .
The question is why does it work in some patients to cause weight loss and not in others , and that 's a very complicated answer .
I think it has to do with how insulin resistant you are when you take the medicine .
It is true that there are some anti-diabetic drugs that cause you to gain weight , they are called the glitazones one is called rosiglitazone or piaglitazone .
Norman Swan :
They are the new generation of anti-diabetic drugs ?
Robert Lustig :
That 's right and the reason they cause weight gain is because they actually cause pre-adipocytes , that is fibroblasts that are not adipocytes themselves yet ...
Norman Swan :
So actually these are the cells that become fat cells ?
Robert Lustig :
Yes , almost adipocyte stem cells if you will , and they actually cause them to differentiate into adipocytes giving you a larger tank to store energy , and when you do that you actually can clear energy better and that makes you insulin - sensitive for a time .
But only at the expense of increasing the size of the tank .
Norman Swan :
So why are people still searching for weight - loss drugs if what you 're saying is all you need to do is to depress insulin and the technology exists to do that ?
Robert Lustig :
Well it 's not that easy .
It 's actually quite difficult .
Not everybody has a disorder that 's amenable to an insulin antagonist .
Only about 20 % of adults have the disorder called insulin hyper secretion that is responsive to this drug called Octreotide .
80 % are insulin - resistant and Octreotide does not work in them at all .
Metformin will work in them but only to a certain point because it's not the perfect drug either and it has other side effects .
Norman Swan :
There 's a non drug that does it which is exercise , particularly resistance exercise , building up your muscles .
Robert Lustig : Exactly , in fact exercise is the best treatment .
The question is why does exercise work in obesity ?
Because it burns calories ?
That 's ridiculous .
Twenty minutes of jogging is one chocolate chip cookie , I mean you can't do it .
One Big Mac requires three hours of vigorous exercise to work that off , that 's not the reason that exercise is important , exercise is important for three reasons exclusive of the fact that it burns calories .
The first is it increases skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity , in other words it makes your muscle more insulin sensitive , therefore your pancreas can make less , therefore your levels can drop , therefore there 's less insulin in your blood to shunt sugar to fat .
That 's probably the main reason that exercise is important and I 'm totally for it .
The second reason that exercise is important is because it 's the single best treatment to get your cortisol down .
Cortisol is your stress hormone , it 's the hormone that goes up when you are mega - stressed , it 's the hormone that basically causes visceral fat deposition which is the bad fat and it has been tied to the metabolic syndrome .
So by getting your cortisol down you 're actually reducing the amount of fat deposited and it also reduces food intake .
People think that somehow exercise increases food intake , it does not , it reduces food intake .
And then the third reason that exercise is important , which is somewhat not well known , but I 'm trying to evaluate this at the present time , is that it actually helps detoxify the sugar fructose .
Fructose actually is a hepato - toxin ; now fructose is fruit sugar but we were never designed to take in so much fructose .
Our consumption of fructose has gone from less than half a pound per year in 1970 to 56 pounds per year in 2003 .
Norman Swan :
It 's the dominant sugar in these so - called sugar free jams for example that you buy , these sort of natural fruit jams .
Robert Lustig : Right , originally it was used because since it's not regulated by insulin it was thought to be the perfect sugar for diabetics and so it got introduced as that .
Then of course high fructose corn syrup came on the market after it was invented in Japan in 1966 , and started finding its way into American foods in 1975 .
In 1980 the soft drink companies started introducing it into soft drinks and you can actually trace the prevalence of childhood obesity , and the rise , to 1980 when this change was made .
Norman Swan :
What is it about this , it 's got more calories than ordinary sugar weight for weight has n't it ?
Robert Lustig :
No , actually it's not the calories that are different it 's the fact that the only organ in your body that can take up fructose is your liver .
Glucose , the standard sugar , can be taken up by every organ in the body , only 20 % of glucose load ends up at your liver .
So let 's take 120 calories of glucose , that 's two slices of white bread as an example , only 24 of those 120 calories will be metabolised by the liver , the rest of it will be metabolised by your muscles , by your brain , by your kidneys , by your heart etc. directly with no interference .
Now let 's take 120 calories of orange juice .
Same 120 calories but now 60 of those calories are going to be fructose because fructose is half of sucrose and sucrose is what 's in orange juice .
So it 's going to be all the fructose , that 's 60 calories , plus 20 % of the glucose , so that 's another 12 out of 60 -- so in other words 72 out of the 120 calories will hit the liver , three times the substrate as when it was just glucose alone .
That bolus of extra substrate to your liver does some very bad things to it .
Norman Swan : Dr Robert Lustig who 's Professor of Pediatric Endocrinology at the University of California , San Francisco .
And you 're listening to a Health Report special here on ABC Radio National on how food manufacturers by adding fructose to our foods , either from corn syrup as in the United States or added sucrose as in Australia , may actually be making the obesity epidemic even worse , starting with damage to our liver cells , the hepatocytes .
Robert Lustig :
The first thing it does is it increases the phosphate depletion of the hepatocyte which ultimately causes an increase in uric acid .
Uric acid is an inhibitor of nitric oxide , nitric oxide is your naturally occurring blood pressure lowerer .
And so fructose is famous for causing hypertension .
Norman Swan : High blood pressure .
And what you 're saying here is that the liver cell itself gets depleted of this phosphate and then you 've got this downstream reaction .
Robert Lustig :
That 's right .
And so when you have excess uric acid you 're going to end up with increased blood pressure and we actually have data from the NHANES study in America , the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey in America which actually shows that the most obese hypertensive kids are making more uric acid and have an increased percentage of their calories coming from fructose .
Norman Swan :
Are they getting gout as well ?
Robert Lustig :
Well not yet .
They will .
Norman Swan :
So what you 're saying in fact is that whilst we are clearly eating too much , we 're passively eating too much of the wrong thing , that the food manufacturing industry is putting stuff in which is fuelling the epidemic ?
Robert Lustig : Absolutely , we 're being poisoned to death , that 's a very strong statement but I think we can back it up with very clear scientific evidence .
Norman Swan :
There 's clear scientific evidence on this fructose pathway in the liver ?
Robert Lustig :
There 's clear scientific evidence on the fructose doing three things that are particularly bad in the liver .
The first is this uric acid pathway that I just mentioned , the second is that fructose initiates what 's known as de novo lipogenesis .
Norman Swan :
Which is fat production .
Robert Lustig : Excess fat production and so VLDL , very low density lipoproteins end up being manufactured when you consume this large bolus of fructose in a way that glucose does not , and so that leads to dyslipidaemia .
Norman Swan :
And that 's the bad form of cholesterol .
Robert Lustig :
That 's correct .
And then the last thing that fructose does in the liver is it initiates an enzyme called Junk one , and Junk one has been shown by investigators at Harvard Medical School basically is the inflammation pathway and when you initiate Junk one what happens is that your insulin receptor in your liver stops working .
It 's phosphorylated in a way that basically inactivates it , serum phosphorylation it 's called and when your insulin receptor does n't work in your liver that means your insulin levels all over your body have to rise .
And when that happens basically you 're going to interfere with normal brain metabolism of the insulin signal which is part of this leptin phenomenon I mentioned before .
It 's also going to increase the amount of insulin at the adipocyte storing more energy .
And you put all of this together and basically you 've got a feed forward system of increased insulin , increased liver fat , liver deposition of fat , increased inflammation -- you end up with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .
You end up with your inability to see your leptin and so you consume more fructose and you 've now got a viscious cycle out of control .
In fact fructose , because of the way it 's metabolised , is actually damaging your liver the same way alcohol is .
In fact it 's the exact same pathway , in fact fructose is alcohol without the buzz .
Norman Swan :
So this is the obesity related fatty liver disease that people talk about ?
Robert Lustig : Exactly .
Norman Swan :
Some people say , I 've heard obesity experts say , well it 's surprising that will all the ready availability of food that we 're not fatter .
In other words that we are actually controlling our appetite pretty well given that we 've probably been evolutionary designed to eat anything that goes , and there 's anything that goes all around us , so why are n't we actually fatter ?
It 's not so much why is there an obesity epidemic , why is n't is worse , is what people say and therefore you do n't need to postulate fructose , it 's just the fact that we 've evolved in the Savannah to eat in times of plenty .
Robert Lustig : I 've heard those same concerns you know , why , if we have so many calories why are n't we fatter .
Well there are a few reasons why that might be .
I do want to mention that the American food industry produces 3,900 calories per capita per day .
We can only eat 1,800 calories per capita per day .
In other words the American food industry makes double the amount of food that we can actually use .
Who eats the rest ?
We do , through this mechanism , they actually know that by putting fructose into the foods that we eat , for instance pretzels -- why do you need fructose in pretzels , why do we need fructose in hamburger buns ?
Norman Swan :
Are you postulating here a fructose conspiracy , the way the tobacco industry had a nicotine conspiracy ?
Robert Lustig : Well I can't call it a conspiracy per se .
I certainly know , and they certainly know that they sell more of it when they add the fructose to it .
That 's why it's in there , otherwise why would it be in there ?
Do they know that this is actually harmful ?
That 's what I do n't know .
There 's no smoking gun , ultimately we found the smoking gun for smoking , you know we found the documents .
I 'm not prepared to say that about the food companies .
I do not know that they know that they are hurting us .
However , they definitely know they sell more , and it temporarily coincides with the advent of fructose being added to our diet .
Norman Swan :
And of course you could argue that it 's going up because they are responding to the market and they 've got sugar - free , fat - free etc. etc .
Robert Lustig :
Well in fact fat - free does n't help , if anything as the fat content of our foods has gone down , and it has gone down , it 's gone from 40 % to 30 % , in fact our obesity prevalence has gone way up .
So that 's not the answer .
Norman Swan :
This is because they 're adding carbohydrates and sugars to it to replace the fat .
Robert Lustig : Absolutely , in fact fat does not raise your insulin but certainly sugar does .
And fructose has been bandied about ... because after all it does n't raise your insulin directly because there 's no fructose receptor on your beta cell in your pancreas .
So people say well it does n't raise your insulin , but in fact it does because it 's a chronic effect not an acute effect .
This has nothing to do with one fructose meal , this has to do with a year 's worth of fructose meals , or a lifetime 's worth of fructose meals , because as you become insulin resistant , which fructose clearly does and has been shown by many investigators not just me -- that interferes with that leptin signal which causes you to eat more .
Norman Swan : Insulin - resistance increases your insulin levels because your pancreas pumps out more to get the insulin working .
Robert Lustig : Exactly , especially since your liver is not responding to it because of that effect on the serum phosphorylation of the insulin receptor .
So that 's going to cause you to make a whole lot more insulin , that 's going to interfere with your leptin , that 's going to make you eat more so the whole thing just keeps going out of control .
Norman Swan :
One way of proving this would be to put you on a fructose free diet , has anybody done that ?
Robert Lustig :
Well no one 's done it yet .
In fact we 're trying to do that , in fact we 're actually going to be working with the Atkins Foundation here in America to actually do a fructose withdrawal experiment to try to actually answer that question directly .
Norman Swan :
Well given that you 're not going to come to harm by reducing the fructose in your diet -- somebody who 's listening to this -- what 's the ingredient on the packet , or the jar , or the back of the tin that tells you there 's fructose in there because it wo n't always say fructose will it ?
Robert Lustig :
Well high fructose corn syrup , it should say that , now in Australia for instance the sodas do n't have high fructose corn syrup they have sucrose .
Well sucrose is half fructose .
You know a lot has been made over this high fructose corn syrup being particularly evil .
In fact high fructose corn syrup is either 42 % or 55 % fructose , the rest is glucose .
Well sucrose is 50 % fructose the rest is glucose .
In fact high fructose corn syrup and sucrose are equally problematic .
Norman Swan : Basically table sugar .
Robert Lustig : Table sugar -- that 's right .
We were not designed to eat all of this sugar , we 're supposed to be eating our carbohydrate , particularly our fructose , with high fibre .
Well the fact is we have 100 pound bags of sugar that go into the cakes , and the donuts .
Norman Swan :
So we do n't need to get obsessed on fruit sugars , it 's sugar itself , sucrose .
Robert Lustig : Absolutely , it 's sugar in general .
So people say oh does that mean I can't eat fruit ?
No , let 's take an orange -- an orange has 20 calories , 10 of which are fructose and has high fibre .
A glass of orange juice has 120 calories , it takes 6 oranges to make that glass of orange juice and there 's no fibre .
You tell me which is better for you , so by all means eat the fruit , just do n't drink the juice .
Juice is part of the problem and there 's plenty of data , not just mine .
Miles Faith had an article in Pediatrics , December 2006 showing that in toddlers , in inner city Harlem in New York , in toddlers the number of juice servings correlated with the degree of BMI increase .
Norman Swan :
Where does this fit , I mean people at the University of Sydney who 've pioneered the glycaemic index , the idea that you get some foods which actually boost your blood sugar very quickly and some which are slow .
They kind of argue that it does n't actually matter terribly much what kind of sugar it is , it just depends on how fast your insulin is going to go up .
Where does what you 're saying fit into the glycaemic index story ?
Robert Lustig :
In fact glycaemic index is half the story , the other half of the story is the fibre .
Here 's the way it works -- carrots , let 's talk about carrots for a minute .
Carrots are very high glycaemic index , what is the definition of glycaemic index ?
It 's how high your blood sugar goes if you eat 50 grams of carbohydrate in that food , that 's what glycaemic index is .
So if you eat 50 grams of carbohydrate in carrots your blood sugar goes up very high and so that would be a high glycaemic index food .
Fructose is a low glycaemic index food because fructose does not stimulate insulin , it 's all of these calories but it does n't stimulate insulin .
So in fact a soda has a glycaemic index of 53 which is low .
So you 'd say oh wait a second , carrots are bad for you and a soda is good for you ?
Because glycaemic index is not the whole story , in fact what you really want to talk about is a related concept called glycaemic load .
Glycaemic load is glycaemic index times the amount of food you 'd actually have to eat to get the 50 grams of carbohydrate , so in carrots you 'd have to eat the entire truck in order to get that .
Well you can't do that , you would n't do that , so in fact carrots , even though they are high glycaemic index are actually low glycaemic load .
Carrots are fine , there 's nothing wrong with carrots .
On the other hand fructose , I mean a soda , there 's a lot wrong with it but you would n't see it in just looking at glycaemic index .
Norman Swan :
So glycaemic index plus common sense ?
Robert Lustig :
Well it 's glycaemic index plus fibre .
Fibre turns any food into a low glycaemic load food .
In fact we are supposed to eat our carbohydrate with fibre , that 's the key .
Processed wheat is white , when you go out into the field it 's brown but by the time it gets to your bakery it 's white .
What happened ?
Well the bran was stripped off , well the bran is the good part , the bran is what we 're supposed to be eating .
Norman Swan : I 've often wondered , I 've heard of some processed stuff and the evil of the food industry etc . but explain to me a conundrum -- why Asians are thin , or have been traditionally thin and for centuries they 've eaten processed rice , they 've eaten white rice , they do n't like brown rice and I do n't blame them .
Robert Lustig :
Not a problem , I can explain it very simply .
If you look at the Atkins diet , the Atkins diet was no -carb , high - fat , no - carb and it worked .
We look at the Japanese diet , high - carb , no - fat , it also worked .
When you put them together you get something called McDonalds and clearly that does n't work .
So the question is what is it about the Japanese diet , even though they eat all of this white rice , that still allows this phenomenon to be OK ?
And the answer is very simple -- it 's called fructose , because fructose is really not a carbohydrate .
If you look at the metabolism , the liver metabolism of fructose it is just like a fat , it does n't stimulate insulin , just like fat .
It causes all this de novo lipogenesis .
Norman Swan : Fat production
Robert Lustig : Fat production within the liver , it causes deposition of fat within the liver , it 's actually like alcohol and alcohol is like a fat .
So here 's a carbohydrate that 's acting like a fat .
So outside of the Japanese diet , when you eat a low fat diet what are you eating ?
Snackwell -- and what did they do ?
They added sugar because otherwise it would be unpalatable .
So in fact a low fat diet 's not really a low fat diet , a low fat diet containing fructose is really a high fat diet and that explains what 's going on .
So a Japanese diet yes , they 're eating a lot of white rice but they are also eating a lot of fibre in all of their vegetables and they are not consuming any fructose .
There is no fructose in the Japanese diet whatsoever , but there is now , and childhood obesity has doubled in Japan in the last ten years whereas adult obesity has n't moved .
Norman Swan :
And the reasons ?
Robert Lustig : Because the adults are eating like they used to and the children are eating like we do in America .
Norman Swan :
So do you check your home garage floor for brake fluid every morning , I mean you can't be the most popular person with the food industry ?
Robert Lustig : Well I 'm not , I am not , very much so .
The Corn Refiners Association and the Juice Products Association have been on my tail , but the fact of the matter is the science is clear , the science is there and the science has to drive the policy .
Norman Swan :
So what about the regulators ?
Robert Lustig :
Well we 're trying to work with them , we are trying to do something about it .
They are not moving very fast .
In fact you may be aware of the International Obesity Task Force that met at the Sydney meeting in October and they came out with something which they called the Sydney principles .
The Sydney principles involved marketing and advertising to children and trying to get rid of that , and they basically said that you have to do something about this and it has to be statutory in nature , it has to be regulated , it has to be a law .
In fact in Europe 52 health ministers from the World Health Organisation from all the different European countries got together in Istanbul in August and agreed that marketing to children had to stop .
Well in fact that is not happening in America .
Norman Swan : Nor is it in Australia .
Robert Llustig :
Well probably not , but I just met with the commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission , Miss Deborah Taylor Tait , and she mentioned that she expected that the food companies would police themselves , that regulation would not be necessary .
In fact I said , excuse me but I disagree .
In fact in 1978 the US Federal Trade Commission had an entire congressional hearings on marketing and advertising to children and the food companies actually lobbied congress to actually have that killed .
And they knew why , they knew what they were doing then , and they are going to do it again because it 's not in their best interest .
They could n't increase their profits by 5 % a year if they did n't advertise and market to children .

My new colleague Steven Forth , who is CTO of eMonitor ( the content technology arm of Monitor Group ) referred me last night to Many Eyes ( http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home), which is a social data visualization and interpretation service developed by the Collaborative User Experience ( CUE ) Research Group at IBM 's Watson Research Center .
As the intersection of social software and content analysis is currently a high - priority professional interest , I decided to try it out .
Among other visualization approaches to structured data sets , Many Eyes generates tag clouds from free text files .
Steven noted that in particular , the two - word view seems like a very powerful 80 - 20 cut at inferring predominant meaning in a body of text .
I experimented by exporting the contents of this blog as a text file , progressively scrubbing useless Typepad artifact words and html tags that appear frequently ( like " title " , " breaks " , " comments " , and my name ) out of the source file -- to do this I simply ran " edit / replace / ' word ' , ' [ ] ' " in Windows Notepad -- and then publishing the file on Many Eyes .
Here 's the result ( click on the image to manipulate the cloud on Many Eyes ) :
The two - word view does a pretty decent job of communicating the themes I write about , I think .
Unintended side benefit : highlights recurring cliches and verbal tics I need to purge from my writing , like " drive higher " ( argh ) .
This whole effort took about 30 minutes , from registration to pasting the syndication html into this post .
Two - thirds of that time was spent scrubbing the data iteratively .
This could have gone faster in one of two ways .
First , Many Eyes could provide a custom scrubbing interface where I could register multiple words to be eliminated or replaced from a text file .
Second , and better , they could allow users to share not only comments , but scrubbing filters that would be applicable to data sets coming from common sources with common problems , such as Typepad exports , or government information .
Beyond this , I can imagine a thematic matching capability -- " based on two - word ' keyphrase ' frequencies , this data set seems to have lots in common with these other ones ... "
Such a capability could be further enhanced by ex-post user rating , so people could confirm whether , for any given algorithmically - suggested match , the result was actually good , a la " was this useful to you ? "
This , like the " Graphic Friendships " idea I wrote about a while back , could help to make the web browsing experience more productive .
Nice job guys !

When asked her opinion of the winners and losers of the final GOP debate in Iowa before the Iowa caucus , Rachel picked surprise upset Alan Keyes for at least having the intellectual honesty of displaying just how crazy the Republican platform is without all the euphemisms to make it palatable .
I do n't think host Chris Matthews appreciated Rachel 's sense of humor all that much :
You are causing trouble here .
Because you are …
I would like to put you on …I would like to waterboard you right now , because there ’s no way on God ’s earth you believe that .
Oh , Tweety , has it really come to this ??
Now waterboarding is a joke to threaten guests with whom you disagree ?
Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Iran 's navy commander said on Saturday that his forces will launch military maneuvers in Hormuz Strait and Gulf of Oman in February to exercise their naval capabilities , the official IRNA news agency reported .
Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari told reporters that the military exercises , code named , " Ettehad 86 , " or " Unity 86 , " will continue for a week .
The war games aim to exercise technical tactics , test the navy 's equipment and promote power of the naval forces in the field of different surface - to - surface and air - to - sea operations , he said .
The navy personnel will also launch different missiles during the military exercises , the Iranian rear admiral added .
According to local Fars news agency , Sayyari also said that Iran has no plans to block the Straits of Hormuz amid fears it could use the strategic oil passage as a weapon in its nuclear standoff with the West .
" We are prepared to defend the interests of the Islamic Republic against any kind of threat , but we have not made any such claim about closing the Strait of Hormoz , " he said .
" Yet , we are ready to take action to preserve our interests , " Sayyari said .
" Our missile unit is equipped with different kinds of missiles and they meet the ranges that are required . "
He also said that two Iran - made warships -- a destroyer called " Jamaran " and a submarine of " Ghadir " class -- will be launched on Nov. 28 .
Sayyari further stressed that his troops are closely monitoring military moves of foreign powers in the region .
" The naval force is in full control over the region and monitors all the military moves of the enemies in the region , " he said .
Iran has regularly launched large - scale war games since the nuclear issue became the spotlight in the world more than three years ago .

Head - hopping : I 'm a fundamentalist bible - thumper when it comes to picking a point of view for a scene or a chapter and sticking to it .
So many people send me stuff that seems to be in one character 's point - of - view , then another character will have a brief thought about the first character , then we go right back to the first .
[ Sidebar : Dragon Strike will mark the first time since the Lara Croft media novel that I 've written from more than one POV in a novel ( I do n't count my little VE scene setters or the opening paragraphs of Thunderbolt ) ]
That , or it's written in a nebulous 3rd person omniscient that flirts with locking down into a POV but never quite gets there .
Boy is that frustrating .
Let me feel , hear , smell , and taste what your characters are experiencing , please !
Sensory detail is one of the best ways to draw a reader into the world .
Logorrhea : Having something between two and a dozen words pull the weight of one .
I can't tell you how often I read stuff like " Thinking back on her past , she remembered her childhood of twenty years ago , when as a six - year - old ... "
The Joker : Smiling , and its evil cousin , the grin .
I 've read entire chapters where characters do nothing but smile and grin at each other , as though they 're living in the Treehouse of Horror Simpson 's vignette where Bart has mental powers like the kid in the Twilight Zone episode " It 's a Good Life " and everyone has to keep on a happy face .
Marcia ! Marcia !
Marcia !
- characters who always have their emotions dialed up to " 11 . "
They laugh " uproariously " at stuff that 's worth a mild snigger , fight to keep from screaming when they 're third in line at the ATM , agonize over whether to have the vinegarette or ranch .
Can we save the " I 'll never be hungry again ! " fist - shaking for something more important that a checkout line , please ?
Non-comedy of manners : Commonplaces substituted for dialog .
Polite interchanges , greetings , exchanges of compliments , goodbyes ( unless it 's the villain saying goodbye to James Bond as he 's strapped under the laser ) -- usually these can be discarded .
Now sometimes you can get some characterization out of it , as with Leeland Gaunt 's charm and elaborate pleasantries to his customers in King 's Needful Things , but if you 've already got King 's chops you 're probably only reading this blog to snicker at me .
Then there 's # 5 's corollary , meaningless action .
Mystery Science
Theater is fond of making fun of directors who always show their actors pulling into a driveway , parking their car , getting out of the car , going to the door ... same thing appears in flabby writing .
Unless there 's something interesting going on in the character 's head , or there 's a zombie apocalypse raging on in the street and the character is too hung - over to notice ( stole that from Shaun of the Dead ) , or we know there 's a crazed killer waiting inside the now lightbulb - free house , do n't weigh me down with this .
Waking - up scenes :
Please limit them to one per novel .
And books that begin with someone waking up , well , I no longer just put them down -- I hurl them and try for distance .
Go to sleep , sheeple !
Long , rambling political digressions are almost guaranteed to anesthetize your audience unless they agree with you jot and tittle .
College students and guys who 've put their twenty or thirty in in the service seem to love writing these .
Your thoughts on Big Oil or the pinkos running the network news are spoiling your tight little thriller , bud .
Save it for Daily Kos and talk radio .
By the time your novel is published , we might be arguing over President Chelsea .
Pain do n't hurt :
Flat descriptions about someone 's emotional state bring tears from editors , not readers .
Now , do n't look to me for fixes on this , I 'm not the best with emotion , but I do know you can't just say " His accusation made her feel bad . "
Describe the feeling bad through images or actions .
Did her face heat up with shame , or did it cause ice to form in her gut , or did she flee to the bathroom and sob into her scarf ?
Weasel words : Adverbs and quantifiers need to to be kept on a three - inch leash .
I was always doing this ; if I could n't think of anything else I called an object " large . "
Freudian much ?
Watch for " almost " especially .
I hate reading about what almost happened .
It 's better to write positively -- i.e. talk about what did happen .
" He almost screamed " does n't tell me what he did do .
Did he choke back a scream , bite it off , or did the scream come out as manic laughter ?
Beaming in : I get confused when characters , gear , and important features suddenly appear mid-scene .
It 's one thing for Sam Spade to reach into his bottom desk drawer and pull out a cached bottle of whiskey , you 're showing where the object came from .
It 's quite another for you to suddenly mention that there was a German bayonet war trophy in plain view atop the filing cabinet in the middle of a fist fight .
So that 's why you wrote this : I 've read stories where the most precise language and evocative imagery is saved for the all - important pudenda - shaving scene as the heroine gets ready to go to the library .
I 'm not knocking your kink , I 'm just wondering why so much word - weight is put into a personal hygiene choice in a story about tracking down Shoggoths .
Do n't open the airlock !
Another thing that bugs me is a scene that seems to take place in a vacuum .
No sense of time , place , no indication that anyone has a history or is concerned with anything other than what 's on the protagonist 's mind that very second .
Please , establish a time and place , even if it 's just " midnight at the oasis , " before or as you start the action !
And remember , everyone in the story has problems of their own .
Mary Sues : I rarely come across these , but I thought I should add them to the list just in case .
I think word has gotten out .
We probably have fanfiction sites and editorial blogs to thank for that .
But if you do n't know what a " Mary Sue " is , you can educate yourself here .
I 'm not against wish - fulfillment in writing , a lot of story magic is fueled by " would n't it be cool if ... "
You just do n't want to make it easy for your characters .
Strange days .
Stranger names : I get sf / fantasy stories about orc-tribes where there 's Bolk , Gurg , and Fred .
Which would be funny , I suppose , if it was n't a straight - faced quest fantasy .
A name from our time can carry lots of associations with it , so do n't go calling your dark elf capital city San Diego or putting your ranger hero in lederhosen .
Also , chances are they do n't celebrate Christmas on Planet Mongo .
In taberna quando sumus : - it 's often because we 're too hidebound to think of anywhere else for the action to take place but a bar or inn .
Tavern scenes are n't one of my bugbears , but my friend Howard who edits Black Gate says that he sees entirely too many from amateur fantasists .
Liven things up by having people meet and talk business at sporting events , religious rites or festivals , public baths , market days , weddings , theatricals , readings of edicts , auctions . . .
Plot on rails :
Too often amateur writing sets up what the protagonist has to accomplish at the beginning of the story and sticks to that right to the end .
That may work for some shorts , but in a novel you want events to move the goalposts .
It allows the character to discover what she or the world really needs , rather than what was thought at the beginning .
Remember , Frodo did n't set out from Bag End thinking he'd have to go to Mount Doom , he was just trying to get the ring out of the Shire and meet Gandalf .
A story is not a baseball game , objectives and rewards can change with the character and situation .
Go watch Run Lola Run if you do n't believe me .
It 's not an essay :
There 's no need to elaborate on what an action or a scene means .
This is a story , not English homework , and if you 're doing something experimental and meta , send it to someone smarter than me .
Having the author 's analysis intrude like the Voice of God takes all the fun out of me figuring things out for myself .
More is Less : Quality , not quantity .
A single arresting image can be more horrifying than a page full of splatter .
This also goes for heroics , landscaping , and descriptions of boobs .
Catalog Copy :
Do n't weigh me down with laundry lists of clothing and so much description I feel like a police sketch artist .
Use language that allows me to summon an image from my own experiences .

If you were good enough that people wanted to steal your prose , you 'd have sold it by now .
I believe in paying it forward , so sometimes I take a look at amateur manuscripts .
I imagine I 'll keep doing it until some ballsack Balzac sues me for having a character named Tom when they also had a character named Tom .
It 's amazing how many of the same mistakes you see over and over again .
Different authors , same flaws .
Anyway , here 's a list of errors I ( and some editors I know ) see over , and over , and over again , .
Plus a few that maybe just bug me .

The report from Consumers International ( CI ) says that self - regulation by the multinational drug giants has failed , citing drug adverts by companies such as Glaxo - SmithKline , Wyeth , Novartis and Pfizer that would be considered misleading in Europe , as well as the heavy promotion by all companies of products to doctors .
The impact on patients is serious , the report says .
" Up to 50 % of medicines in developing countries are inappropriately prescribed , dispensed or sold , " it says .
Drug company gifts to doctors include air conditioners , laptops , club membership , domestic cattle , foreign conferences at five - star hotels , brand new cars and school tuition fees , the report says .
In the UK only gifts of minimal value , such as pens and mouse mats , are allowed .
But Murad M Khan , professor and chairman of the department of psychiatry at Aga Khan University , told researchers that in Pakistan " for writing 200 prescriptions of the company 's high priced drug , a doctor is rewarded with the down payment of a brand new car " .
CI 's member organisation in Pakistan , TheNetwork , surveyed doctors , sales reps and medical store personnel .
An unnamed Indian doctor told researchers : " ' Gifting ' of air conditioners , washing machines , microwaves , cameras , televisions , and expensive crystals is an accepted norm nowadays .
So are frequent pampering in the form of CMEs [ continuing medical education meetings ] and lectures in star hotels followed by lavish dinners and cocktails . "
Similar reports came from Venezuela , Indonesia and Malaysia .
Richard Lloyd , director general of CI , a London - based federation of consumer groups from 113 countries , called for a ban on all gifts to doctors .
" The pharma industry sees the developing world as a trillion - dollar opportunity to secure profits over the next 40 years .
Weak regulation makes these markets an easy target for the marketing techniques of multinational drug companies , but consumer health expenditure in these countries can ill afford to be squandered on irrational drug use . "
The report is also critical of drug advertisements in developing countries which , it claims , sometimes promote a drug without mentioning the side effects or the restrictions on its use - for instance that it works in women but not men .
Regulatory authorities in developing countries are slow to protect people from drugs that have been banned or withdrawn in other countries .
Vioxx for arthritis was officially banned in India in October 2004 , the month after manufacturers Merck withdrew it in the US , but it was still on sale in India the following year .
The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations ( IFPMA ) , the global trade body , said it would take time to get its code of conduct adopted everywhere .
" I think it is not something that is achievable overnight , " said spokesman Guy Willis .
" The issue is how do we get there . "
But he called on CI to lodge complaints where it had evidence of any breach of the IFPMA 's code of practice .

When I was very young — I think thirteen or maybe fourteen — I thought I had found a disproof of Cantor ’s Diagonal Argument , a famous theorem which demonstrates that the real numbers outnumber the rational numbers .
Ah , the dreams of fame and glory that danced in my head !
My idea was that since each whole number can be decomposed into a bag of powers of 2 , it was possible to map the whole numbers onto the set of subsets of whole numbers simply by writing out the binary expansion .
The number 13 , for example , 1101 , would map onto {0 , 2 , 3} .
It took a whole week before it occurred to me that perhaps I should apply Cantor ’s Diagonal Argument to my clever construction , and of course it found a counterexample — the binary number (. . . 1111 ) , which does not correspond to any finite whole number .
So I found this counterexample , and saw that my attempted disproof was false , along with my dreams of fame and glory .
I was initially a bit disappointed .
The thought went through my mind : “ I ’ll get that theorem eventually !
Someday I ’ll disprove Cantor ’s Diagonal Argument , even though my first try failed ! ”
I resented the theorem for being obstinately true , for depriving me of my fame and fortune , and I began to look for other disproofs .
And then I realized something .
I realized that I had made a mistake , and that , now that I ’d spotted my mistake , there was absolutely no reason to suspect the strength of Cantor ’s Diagonal Argument any more than other major theorems of mathematics .
I saw then very clearly that I was being offered the opportunity to become a math crank , and to spend the rest of my life writing angry letters in green ink to math professors .
( I ’d read a book once about math cranks . )
I did not wish this to be my future , so I gave a small laugh , and let it go .
I waved Cantor ’s Diagonal Argument on with all good wishes , and I did not question it again .
And I do n’t remember , now , if I thought this at the time , or if I thought it afterward . . . but what a terribly unfair test to visit upon a child of thirteen .
That I had to be that rational , already , at that age , or fail .
The smarter you are , the younger you may be , the first time you have what looks to you like a really revolutionary idea .
I was lucky in that I saw the mistake myself ; that it did not take another mathematician to point it out to me , and perhaps give me an outside source to blame .
I was lucky in that the disproof was simple enough for me to understand .
Maybe I would have recovered eventually , otherwise .
I ’ve recovered from much worse , as an adult .
But if I had gone wrong that early , would I ever have developed that skill ?
I wonder how many people writing angry letters in green ink were thirteen when they made that first fatal misstep .
I wonder how many were promising minds before then .
I made a mistake .
That was all .
I was not really right , deep down ; I did not win a moral victory ; I was not displaying ambition or skepticism or any other wondrous virtue ; it was not a reasonable error ; I was not half right or even the tiniest fraction right .
I thought a thought I would never have thought if I had been wiser , and that was all there ever was to it .
If I had been unable to admit this to myself , if I had reinterpreted my mistake as virtuous , if I had insisted on being at least a little right for the sake of pride , then I would not have let go .
I would have gone on looking for a flaw in the Diagonal Argument .
And , sooner or later , I might have found one .
Until you admit you were wrong , you can not get on with your life ; your self - image will still be bound to the old mistake .
Whenever you are tempted to hold on to a thought you would never have thought if you had been wiser , you are being offered the opportunity to become a crackpot — even if you never write any angry letters in green ink .
If no one bothers to argue with you , or if you never tell anyone your idea , you may still be a crackpot .
It ’s the clinging that defines it .
It ’s not true .
It ’s not true deep down .
It ’s not half - true or even a little true .
It ’s nothing but a thought you should never have thought .
Not every cloud has a silver lining .
Human beings make mistakes , and not all of them are disguised successes .
Human beings make mistakes ; it happens , that ’s all .
Say “ oops , ” and get on with your life .
I can often predict a person ’s destiny by his or her appearance .
For example , if a regular photograph of you looks exactly like a DUI mug shot , the police will eventually arrest you .
Here ’s a perfect example :

I can also tell by your weight whether you are likely to have a job that involves frequent travel on commercial flights .
You rarely see obese people flying for business .
If you walk down any sidewalk in America , every fourth person is so large he ’s keeping an entire village in Pakistan employed just making his pants .
But when you board a commercial flight , you rarely see people that large .
And if you do , they ’re heading to Disneyland .
It ’s a similar situation with unusually attractive women .
If you see an unusually attractive woman on a commercial flight , she ’s either traveling with an unusually attractive lover , or meeting one at the other end .
She ’s the one touching up her makeup before landing .
People who have bad eyesight when they are kids , including me , rule out all careers that require vigorous physical activity , especially ones involving the outdoors .
By the age of eleven I had ruled out football , professional modeling , and the lifeguard arts .
I focused my attention on math , and doodling insulting pictures of my peers .
I figured one of those two things would pay off .
I also ruled out any profession that involved risking my life to save other people .
I ask too many questions for those sorts of jobs .
For example , before I rush into a burning building to save someone , I want to know if that person is more deserving of life than me .
If not , there ’s no point in getting incinerated just to make the world a worse place .
Recently I gave a talk to a classroom of 9 - year olds .
It was n’t hard to identify the ones who would do a cost - benefit analysis before rushing into the burning building .
That shit starts early .
Hair and height are great predictors of future careers .
If you ’re a guy with a good head of hair , and you ’re over 6 ’ 4 ” , you ’ll probably have a career in upper management .
The universe will also allow you to be an entrepreneur , lawyer , or doctor .
You are not allowed to work in a toll booth .
If you ’re unusually good looking , you ’re not allowed to perform any job that ’s unpleasant .
The exception is that you can wait tables in a nice restaurant until someone either proposes or offers you a lucrative contract .
Question of the day :
Do you look suspiciously similar to other people who have jobs like yours ?

As the Iraq war ripens into the largest strategic catastrophe in our nation ’s history , dead - enders among the Bu’ushist faithful confront a sobering question .
No , that question is not how to extricate our nation from the Mesopotamian morass , but rather how to deal with internal dissent .
It ’s really quite simple , sighed 35 - year - old Hillary - Ann , a professional woman from California with sufficient disposable income to drop at least $ 1,200 to spend a week confined on a cruise ship with the editorial staff of National Review .
" Of course , we need to execute some of these people … [ a ] few of these prominent people who are trying to demoralize the country , " she commented with languid indifference as she waded waist - deep in the Pacific .
" Just take a couple of these anti-war people off to the gas chamber for treason to show , if you try to bring down America at a time of war , that ’s what you ’ll get .
Then things ’ll change . "
There ’s nothing novel about the kind of " change " desired by this fully indoctrinated member of the Reich Wing :
For devotees of a certain variant of statist conservatism , seizing dissenters and shipping them off to gas chambers is old hat .
What makes this off - hand expression of an authentically fascist sentiment so remarkable is the fact that it was typical conversational chatter among the 500 or so National Review groupies who took part in the cruise , according to British journalist Johann Hari , who tagged along incognito .
I would be inclined to dismiss Hari ’s account as the dishonest fantasy of a Euro - Trash bien - pensant were it not for the fact that such sentiments are readily on display practically everywhere Bush - aligned conservatives feel comfortable to give expression to their deepest sentiments .
It is difficult to predict what will be the most significant " legacy " left by George W. Bush , assuming that word can be properly applied to the accumulated residue of lawless violence and official corruption that have typified his reign .
Will it be metastasizing foreign hostility , and proliferating foreign conflicts ?
Will it be the collapse of the economy beneath the weight of profligate spending ?
Will it be the official adoption of such malapropisms as " terrists " and " nukular " as part of our long - suffering language ?
My suspicion is that Bush ’s most important and lasting contribution has been the creation of a purely limbic form of conservatism , in which the amygdala ( that portion of the brain focusing on fear and related base emotions ) plays the defining role in interpreting reality .
The movement has succeeded in validating the worst caricatures concocted by the likes of Theodor Adorno and Daniel Bell by reducing itself into an authoritarian cult .
Obsessive fear and reflexive , tribal loyalty to the Leader / Protector are the defining impulses of contemporary conservatism .
And until — perhaps I should say " unless " — President Bush and Crypto-President Cheney leave office in 2009 , things will grow progressively worse as the regime over which they preside makes increasingly extravagant claims of extra-constitutional power .
Yesterday ( July 19 ) , the Bush - Cheney regime informed Congress that " A U.S. attorney would not be permitted to bring contempt charges or convene a grand jury in an executive privilege case . "
What this means is that Bush will forbid the Justice Department to pursue criminal contempt of Congress charges against four current or former White House officials who defied congressional subpoenas , as Bush instructed them .
Neither Richard Nixon nor Bill Clinton — nor King George III , for that matter — ever ventured such a claim to complete immunity from legislative oversight , although Saddam Hussein probably did .
More frightening still is an executive order issued three days ago ( July 17 ) in which Bush claimed the power to confiscate the property of political dissidents .
No , that is not how the order ’s provisions were described , but the powers adumbrated in that decree would permit such whole - scale expropriations .
Entitled " Blocking Property of Certain Persons Who Threaten Stabilization Efforts in Iraq , " the order asserts that the president can seize control of financial assets and other property belonging to " any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury , in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense … to have committed , or to pose a significant risk of committing , an act or acts of violence that have the purpose and effect of … threatening the peace or stability of Iraq or the Government of Iraq ; or … undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq … [ or ] to have materially assisted … such an act or acts of violence … . "
Let ’s leave aside , for now , the Soviet - style cant about " peace [ and ] stability " in occupied Iraq , a land where neither can be found .
What this executive order means , in principle , is that the property of anyone who materially " undermines " the war and occupation can be seized , without a trial or due process of any kind , on presidential order with the approval of three cabinet officials .
Yes , the order supposedly applies to those who would be providing direct material or financial aid to guerrilla fighters in Iraq , whether they are partisan patriots fighting to expel foreign invaders , sectarian fanatics , or opportunistic foreign terrorists .
But pay careful attention to the phrase applying those sanctions to those found guilty — once again , by presidential decree — of " undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq … . "
Would n’t this apply to people who participate in organized efforts to end the occupation ?
Yes , expropriating anti-war activists would n’t provide the same visceral thrill that would result from the spectacle of a few of them led away in chains to the gas chamber .
But the Reich Wing can console itself in the knowledge that those whom the State would annihilate , it first expropriates .

Airline 's ' MILF ' Promo Not What You Think Spirit Airlines claims ignorance of acronym , but look carefully at the islands .
Dec. 3 , 2007  --
Act fast and you too can cash in on the " MILF " promotion .
The fire sale by Fort Lauderdale , Fla. - based Spirit Airlines promises " Many Islands , Low Fares " deals as low as $ 9 for future travel dates between Fort Lauderdale and the Bahamas .
While the prices may be right , it 's that promotional acronym that 's raised eyebrows among customers and now has the company feeling " uncomfortable . "
Before MILF became shorthand for a Spirit Airlines promotion , the acronym hit the mainstream as an obscene descriptor of a mother considered to be sexy .
The term was popularized in the raunchy 1999 feature film " American Pie , " in which Jennifer Coolidge plays Stifler 's Mom , an attractive , voluptuous woman who ultimately seduces a high school adversary of her son Steve , played by Seann William Scott .
In 2003 , the band Fountains of Wayne released the song " Stacy 's Mom , " which ultimately peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard charts and became the No. 1 most downloaded song for iTunes .
The song and accompanying video , which features an adolescent boy fantasizing about his mother 's friend , rose to No. 1 on MTV's " TRL . "
It 's impossible to know exactly what percentage of Americans are familiar with the slang acronym , but Spirit Airlines maintains that the executive who authorized the MILF promotion did not know the connection .
" Not at all , " Juan Arbelaez , the director of communications for the company 's Latin American market , told ABC News when asked whether the airline was aware of the racy implications .
" We started receiving some e-mails today . "
Arbelaez said that Spirit 's senior vice president of pricing is a British citizen who was unfamiliar with the MILF terminology and that the airline is not trying to offend customers .
" The most obscene thing we 've noticed , " Arbelaez said , " is what other carriers have charged to fly the Caribbean before Spirit 's $ 9 fares . "
The airline has no intention of pulling the promotion , which runs until midnight today , he added .
Still , some observers wonder about the airline 's claimed ignorance .
A careful look at the Spirit 's online ad shows a cluster of islands that appear to form a woman lounging in a pinup pose .
This is not the first marketing campaign by Spirit to attract attention some may consider dubious .
In 2006 , after receiving dozens of complaints , Spirit scrapped an online promotional game called " The Hunt for Hoffa " that offered low fares and poked fun at the FBI 's hunt for Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa , USA Today reported at the time .
The promotion made a CNN list of dumbest business moments , but according to the company was the most successful in the airline 's history .
While Arbelaez acknowledged receiving e-mails from customers regarding the airline 's MILF campaign , he said that most found the connection amusing rather than offensive and that customers are responding to the airfare deals .
Tobe Berkovitz , the dean of the Communications College at Boston University and a marketing professor , said it 's really " irrelevant " if the company knew about the connection or not .
" Maybe these guys crossed the line , but what most people are going to think is , ' Cheap flights , warm islands , count me in , ' " Berkovitz said .
" Maybe the thought police wo n't buy tickets , but the target audience will . "
Berkovitz said that it's a great example of a marketing campaign that will generate buzz as the " hipster " demographic takes notice and influences the " mainstream . "
" The young , the hip , they get it and then they tell the mainstream media , ' Yo dudes , this is a hot slogan , ' " Berkovitz said .
" It 's the media food chain here . "

Dare To Compare - Israel
By Ghali Hassan
25 September , 2007
Countercurrents.org
F ew days ago , I had a long e-mail message from someone with the “ Jews for Peace ” group .
The message starts : “ I am very annoyed by your comparison of Israel with Nazi Germany …
There is no Auschwitz in Palestine , and the Palestinians have not experienced a holocaust .
Palestinians are free to leave any time they wish . ”
I do not know anything about the group , but a response is in order :
Thank you for your e-mail .
I take it you have never been in Occupied Palestine to see the facts on the ground .
Or you are ignorant of Israel ’s policies against innocent and virtually defenceless Palestinians with nowhere to go to .
I do not compare Israel with Nazi Germany .
Israel is a Zionist settlers ’ colony founded on land theft and terror against the Palestinian people ; Nazi Germany was not .
However , I do – like most people – compare Israeli policies in Palestine with those of the Nazis .
If you deny what happened in Palestine in 1948 ( Nakba ) when thousands of Palestinians were murdered , and an estimated 800,000 Palestinians were terrorised and ethnically cleansed from their homeland in a deliberate and systematic policy of mass expulsion by Jewish terrorist organisations , you deny “ the holocaust ” ever took place .
Honest Jews who experienced and survived the holocaust have often made the comparison between Israel ’s brutal treatment of the Palestinian people and the Nazis ’ brutal treatments of Jews and others .
I am reminded of a letter to the Israeli Press twenty - five years ago in which Shlomo Shmelzman wrote : “ In my childhood I have suffered fear , hunger and humiliation when I passed from the Warsaw Ghetto , through labour camps , to Buchenwald .
I hear too many familiar sounds today , sounds which are being amplified by the war .
I hear about ‘ closed areas ’ and I remember ghettos and camps .
I hear ‘ two - legged beasts ’ and I remember ‘ Untermenschen ’ [ subhumans ] .
I hear about tightening the siege , clearing the area , pounding the city into submission , and I remember suffering , destruction , death , blood and murder …
Too many things in Israel remind me of too many things from my childhood ” .
( Ha’aretz , August 11 , 1982 ) .
Israel is consciously matching all of Hitler ’s crimes , killing and depriving Palestinians of basic human rights .
Only the methods are different .
Furthermore , various Israeli politicians today , including the hardcore Fascist Deputy Prime Minister Avigdor Lieberman , who migrated from Moldova to Israel in 1978 are advocating a harsher policy of ethnic cleansing and mass murder of Arabs in Palestine as a conclusion to Israel ’s conquest of Palestine .
In fact , a majority of Israeli Jews ( 64 % ) advocates this Fascist form of thinking .
( Ha’aretz , 22 June 2004 ) .
You write : “ Gaza is free ” .
I am sure you learned this fraud from at least four sources of Zionist propaganda : the pro-Israel Jewish Lobby ; the deranged ignoramus American Zionist , Alan Dershowitz ; U.S. mainstream media ; and the BBC .
Gaza is not “ free ” .
Gaza is a large fortified Concentration Camp .
Since 2000 , the entire population of Gaza ( 1.5 million ) has been under total blockade with disastrous consequences .
Anyone who tries to get out risks being murdered .
As a result of this premeditated collective punishment , Gaza has run out of food and medicine .
Palestinians , children and infants in particular , are dying of starvation , malnutrition and preventable diseases .
Without electricity , hospital and emergency centres operate infrequently , depriving the sick and injured of medical care .
So , Gaza is a Camp not much different from the Nazi ’s Camps .
Indeed , Israelis have started to call Gaza the “ Ghetto ” .
The criminal blockade of Gaza was tightened after the democratic elections of January 2006 .
The Islamic Resistance Movement ( HAMAS ) won the elections in exactly the manner U.S. and the EU ( the West ) had called upon them to do – free and fair democratic voting .
Unfortunately , “ democracy ” for the U.S. is only if the elected government serves U.S. interests .
The criminal blockade is tightened on daily basis in violation of international law and civilised norms .
You are being naïve about the hyped evacuation of a few thousand illegal Jewish settlers from Gaza .
I repeat :
This was another Israeli fraud designed for mass propaganda aimed at diverting public attention away from Israel ’s terror .
As one Israeli Labor politician wrote recently : " The goal is to perpetuate Israeli control in most of the West Bank , and to repel any internal or external pressure for a different political solution .
The Palestinians will be left with seven enclaves connected by special highways for their use . "
The building of illegal colonies ( the so - called " settlements " ) has accelerated dramatically , along with the illegal Apartheid Wall – described by some as ‘ much worse ’ than the Berlin Wall – confiscating Palestinian land and water resources and tearing Palestinian communities into small enclaves , dividing them from each other .
With the completion of the Wall , some 1.6 million Palestinians will have access to no more than 12 per cent of historic Palestine which makes it impossible to establish a viable Palestinian state .
In addition , the Israeli Occupation Force ( IOF ) is carrying out Israel ’s policy of ethnic cleansing , emptying Hebron of its original Arab inhabitants and Judaising the Jordan Valley , building illegal colonies , and making the so - called “ Two - State ” solution impossible .
( See : Régis Debray , Le Monde Diplomatique , August 2007 ) .
Take a look at the new map of the Palestinian Occupied Territories produced by the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( UNOCHA ) .
More than 45 per cent of the West Bank is now off limits to Palestinians .
East Jerusalem has been systematically Judaised , its borders inflated , and the Arab Palestinians there have become prisoners in their homes .
They are harassed on a daily basis by illegal armed extremist settlers and the IOF .
According to IMEMC
News , some 1,835 Palestinian families have been forced to move from their homes and at least 15 , 000 Palestinians will be denied access to the City when the illegal Wall is completed .
All over the Occupied Territories , ethnic cleansing of Palestinians “ is in progress ” and has been since 1948 .
( See : Victoria Buch , Occupation Magazine , September 2007 ) .
The Occupied Territories of the West Bank , including major population centres such as Nablus and Jericho , are split into enclaves .
Palestinians ’ movement between them is restricted by more than 572 roadblocks , an increase of 52 per cent compared to 376 in August 2005 .
These include 96 manned Israeli checkpoints and 476 unmanned barriers ( OCHA ) .
At these roadblocks , increasing numbers of desperately ill Palestinians and newborn babies have died because Israeli soldiers and armed settlers prevent people from reaching hospitals .
Israel has already formalised the de facto Ghettoisation of the West Bank through a network of Jews - only highways that bypass and isolate Palestinian towns and villages .
Israel has created a system of control the Nazis could only dream of .
You allege that : “ Israel offered the Palestinians ‘ land for peace ’ and a separate state , but the Palestinians refused the offer ” .
First , peace for Israel , writes Henry Siegman , is a “ cover for [ Israel ’s ] systematic confiscation of Palestinian land ” and premeditated violence against defenceless Palestinians .
Peace without justice is an empty rhetoric .
That is why Israeli leaders love all these countless “ peace ” conferences .
That was what the Oslo “ Peace Process ” was for .
( Henry Siegman , LRB , 16 August 2007 ) .
That is why Israeli leaders love all these countless “ peace ” conferences .
Second , you are being very naïve to believe Israel ’s manufactured propaganda .
The “ offer ” was a scam .
Israel offered the Palestinians nothing .
In fact most of Israel ’s criminal policies are designed to destroy any chance of a viable Palestinian state .
The opportunity of a viable Palestinian state has passed and it is no longer a possibility unless Israel completely withdraws to pre-1967 boarders and implements all UN Security Council resolutions .
( See : Hussein Agha & Robert Malley , NYR Books , 09 August 2001 ) .
You also wrote : “ Palestinians are free to leave any time they wish ” .
Where to ?
Israelis can go where they come from , and most Israelis are dual citizens , and have no problem returning to their homes in the U.S. and Europe .
Palestinians have nowhere to go except to their homes in Palestine .
Remember the common saying : ‘ Jews have always demanded rights when they were in the minority , but they denied others the rights when they are in the majority and exercise power ’ .
Palestinians have an inalienable right to return to their homeland .
Furthermore , you ignored the numerous diplomatic options offered by Arab nations and rebuffed by Israel .
Indeed , all Muslim nations have offered Israel peace and recognition if Israel will renounce violence and accept a just peace .
Instead , Israel has rejected every peace offer and continues to perpetuate violence , because violence is the foundation of the “ State of Israel ” .
According to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights , PCHR , Israeli Occupation Forces ( the Israeli Army ) crimes against the Palestinians during the period of 16 - 22 August , 2007 were :
· 16 Palestinians , including 3 children , were murdered by IOF in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank .
· 10 of the victims were extra-judicially executed by IOF .
· 18 Palestinians were wounded by IOF gunfire in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
· IOF conducted 30 incursions into Palestinian communities in the West Bank and two ones into the Gaza Strip .
· IOF arrested 44 Palestinian civilians , including a child , in the West Bank .
· IOF shelled fishing boats and arrested 8 Palestinian fishermen in Rafah .
Of course , Israel ’s terror and war crimes continue uninterrupted .
Innocent Palestinian civilians , including children , are murdered every day .
Israel ’s blockade of Gaza ( as mentioned above ) continues with an international flavour that is causing a humanitarian crisis .
The Palestinians are defenceless and unable to effectively retaliate against illegal and brutal occupiers .
It ’s preposterous to compare Palestinian “ violence ” with Israeli violence .
Israeli Gestapo - like death squads are murdering innocent Palestinian civilians and prominent politicians with ease and impunity .
Israeli war planes continue to fly ‘ sonic boom ’ raids , terrorising the civilian population and causing mental damage to children and infants , and premature birth and miscarriage among pregnant women .
The deliberate murder of Palestinian children ( with impunity ) for sport , and the use of Palestinian children as human shields by the Israeli soldiers , is war crimes worse than the Nazis ’ crimes .
As I write these words , Israeli soldiers killed five Palestinian boys and girls , aged between 10 and 12 , in cold blood .
The children had only been playing ‘ tag ’ in the backyard of their home .
Two days earlier , Israeli soldiers killed three boys while they were collecting carob fruits .
The Israeli alleged : “ the children approached the security fence ” , Israel ’s routine pretext to justify murder .
Then the Israeli Army admitted that the killing occurred “ by mistake ” .
Do you remember ; when was the last Israeli killed by Palestinians ?
Furthermore , at least 11,000 Palestinians , including women and children , are imprisoned without charge or due process in notorious Israeli prisons .
Palestinian prisoners are enduring torture and abuse – justified by the Israeli Supreme Court as a ‘ necessity ’ – not dissimilar from those practiced by the Nazis with complete disregard to human rights and human dignity .
Israel has used , and continues to use , all kinds of weapons to kill Palestinians , including cluster bombs , napalms , and a new “ super - weapon ” that uses heat and pressure to kill people targeted across a wide area by sucking the air out of people ’s lungs and rupturing their internal organs .
In addition , Israel ’s uninterrupted house demolitions of Palestinian homes and destruction of agricultural land constitute war crimes .
It ’s worth noting that Israel ’s violence found unconditional military support within the U.S. and European power establishments .
The recent $ 30 billion “ aid package ” to Israel – paid by U.S. taxpayers – is a case in point , although “ Washington ’s blind support for Israel exceeds by many times the amount of direct U.S. aid to Israel ” ( Shirl McArthur , WRMEA , July 2006 ) .
Israel ’s usefulness is that it justifies U.S. violence and military presence in the region .
Let ’s not forget that Israel is a rogue state in possession of the fourth largest military force in the world .
Israel amasses an arsenal that includes biological and chemical weapons and more than 200 nuclear warheads .
Israel is rightly considered by the overwhelming majority of people around the world as the biggest threat to world peace .
All the above mentioned Israeli war crimes against the Palestinian people are so horrendous that they could be easily pass for Nazis ’ war crimes against Jews .
The whole idea of purely “ Jewish State ” in Palestine is based on the concept of the “ Master Race ” adopted in the Nazis ’ ideology of Herrenvolk .
Indeed , Jews consider non-Jews ( Gentiles ) as Untermenschen , or lesser humans .
In Israel , the 20 per cent Palestinians are despised and denied equal rights in a deliberate discriminatory policy considered worse than South Africa ’s Apartheid .
Unlike South Africa ’s Apartheid , Israel ’s Apartheid is a real Apartheid .
( See : Chris McGreal , Guardian , 16 February 2006 ) .
This racist policy led some Jews to stop associating themselves with Israel in order to deflect criticism away from Jews .
Despite the criminal nature of Israel ’s policies , few people dare criticise Israel for fear of being labelled “ anti-Semitists ” .
Israel uses the cliché of “ anti-Semitism ” and the holocaust to silence its critics .
People who are falsely accused of “ anti-Semitism ” pay dearly , losing their jobs and livelihoods for daring to legitimately criticise Israel .
Indeed , anyone who criticises Israel 's terror or rationally argues that the pro-Israel Jewish Lobby in the U.S. has a significant influence over U.S. policy is automatically labelled “ anti-Semitic ” .
The holocaust has been turned from a human tragedy into a political tool and a multi- business industry .
In addition , Zionist Jews have succeeded in making the holocaust unique and exclusive , belittling countless other genocide .
Zionist Jews have mastered the art of ‘ religion manipulation ’ to justify violence and perpetuate a slow genocide in Palestine .
It should be acknowledged that there is a widespread anti-Semitism campaign directed not against Jews , but against Arabs and Muslims .
Pro-Israel Christian Zionists , including the Christian Right and pro-Israel lobbies in the U.S. and Europe , have declared war not only on the Palestinians and Arabs in the Middle East , but also on all Arabs and Muslims around the world .
With the bulk of Western media inherently pro-Israel and anti-Muslim , Israel is portrayed as a “ victim ” defending itself from the Palestinians who are often depicted as “ militants ” and “ terrorists ” .
In reality , the opposite is true .
In his last article in the Los Angeles Times ( 16 July 2007 ) , the deputy of HAMAS political bureau , Mousa Abu Marzook , put the Movement ’s view like this : “ Why should anyone concede Israel ’s ‘ right ’ to exist , when it has never even acknowledged the foundational crimes of murder and ethnic cleansing by means of which Israel to our towns and villages , our farms and orchards , and made us a nation of refugees ? …
I look forward to the day when Israel can say to me , and millions of other Palestinians : ‘ Here , here is your family 's house by the sea , here are your lemon trees , the olive grove your father tended : Come home and be whole again ’ .
Then we can speak of a future together . ”
Finally , Israel ’s existence as a “ civilised ” nation depends on Israel ’s willingness to renounce violence , stop dispossessing and murdering Palestinians , and resume the path of a peaceful democratic coexistence .
I encourage you to carefully read the sources I refer to in this letter and reflect on the long history of Israel ’s crimes against the Palestinian people before you blindly attack me again for daring to compare Israel ’s policies in Palestine with those of the Nazis .

WASHINGTON , Dec. 3 — A new assessment by American intelligence agencies concludes that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and that the program remains frozen , contradicting judgment two years ago that Tehran was working relentlessly toward building a nuclear bomb .
The conclusions of the new assessment are likely to reshape the final year of the Bush administration , which has made halting Iran ’s nuclear program a cornerstone of its foreign policy .
The assessment , a National Intelligence Estimate that represents the consensus view of all 16 American spy agencies , states that Tehran is likely keeping its options open with respect to building a weapon , but that intelligence agencies “ do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons . ”
Iran is continuing to produce enriched uranium , a program that the Tehran government has said is designed for civilian purposes .
The new estimate says that enrichment program could still provide Iran with enough raw material to produce a nuclear weapon sometime by the middle of next decade , a timetable essentially unchanged from previous estimates .

Oct. 10 , 2007  -- New York police are investigating a possible hate crime at Columbia University Tuesday after a hangman 's noose was tied to the door of a black professor at Columbia 's Teachers College .
The noose was discovered on the door of Teachers College professor Dr. Madonna Constantine , shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday , according to WABC .
Constantine is a professor of psychology and education and is the director of the Cultural Winter Roundtable in psychology and education at the Teachers College .
She has written broadly on themes of multiculturalism , racism and ethnicity , according to a list of publications on her online faculty bio .
At a demonstration this afternoon outside the Teachers College , Constantine challenged the person or persons who hanged the hateful symbol .
" Pinning a noose on my door reeks of cowardice and fear on many , many levels , " Constantine said to applause .
" I would like the perpetrator to know I will not be silent . "
Teachers College President Susan Furhman sent an e-mail to students and faculty Tuesday afternoon explaining why police from the city 's hate crimes task force were on the campus .
" The TC community and I deplore this hateful act , which violates every Teachers College and societal norm , " the e-mail read , which was released to ABC News .
Columbia University President Lee Bollinger also took on the incident in a written statement released to the Columbia Spectator , the campus newspaper .
" This is an assault on African - Americans and therefore is an assault on every one of us , " Bollinger said in the statement .
Police were checking campus security cameras to determine whether the act was caught on tape .
They were also considering the possibility that the noose may have been placed by another faculty member as part of an ongoing dispute with Constantine , WABC reported .
A Spate of Racial Episodes
The suspected hate crime comes less than two weeks after a highly controversial appearance at Columbia by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the discovery of racist and Islamophobic graffiti at the Teachers College , ranked the best graduate school education program in the country .
The Columbia incident is the latest in a spate of racial episodes following the hanging of several nooses from a tree on a high school campus in Jena , La. , about a year ago .
In that highly publicized case , six black students who came to be known as the " Jena 6 " were charged in the beating of a white student .
The severity of the charges against them prompted a 20,000 person demonstration in the small Louisiana town in September .
Also last month , a noose was found hanging outside a black cultural studies building on the University of Maryland campus in College Park , Md .
The president of Grambling State University said last week that he would seek sanctions against teachers at a university - run elementary school who were photographed re-enacting hangings in a lesson tied to the ongoing Jena 6 controversy .
At a secondary school of Gallaudet University , a college for deaf students in Washington , seven students -- six white and one black -- assaulted a black student and scrawled " KKK " and swastikas all over his body with a marker .
The head of the U.S. Coast Guard is investigating a July incident at the Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut in which two small nooses were found inside the sea bag of a black cadet aboard a tall ship .
Rising prices and surging demand for the crops that supply half of the world 's calories are producing the biggest changes in global food markets in 30 years , altering the economic landscape for everyone from consumers and farmers to corporate giants and the world 's poor .
" The days of cheap grain are gone , " says Dan Basse , president of AgResource Co. , a Chicago commodity forecasting concern .
This year the prices of Illinois corn and soybeans are up 40 % and 75 % , respectively , from a year ago .
Kansas wheat is up 70 % or more .
And a growing number of economists and agribusiness executives think the run-ups could last as long as a decade , raising the cost of all kinds of food .
In the past , such increases have been caused by temporary supply disruptions .
Following a poor harvest , farmers would rush to capitalize on higher crop prices by planting more of that crop the next season , sending prices back down .
But the current rally , which started a year ago in the corn-futures trading pit at the Chicago Board of Trade , is different .
Not only have prices remained high , but the rally has swept up other commodities such as barley , sorghum , eggs , cheese , oats , rice , peas , sunflower and lentils .
In Georgia , the nation 's No. 1 poultry - producing state , slaughterhouses are charging a record wholesale price for three - pound chickens , up 15 % from a year ago .

I ’m surprised we have n’t heard much in the news about this but as of March 23rd 2006 the government will no longer be publishing the M3 money supply data .
Most people probably say “ Who Cares ? ” Right ?
But you should care !
And here ’s why :
“ The Federal Reserve tracks and publishes the money supply measured three different ways– M1 , M2 , and M3 .
These three money supply measures track slightly different views of the money supply .
The most restrictive , M1 , only measures the most liquid forms of money ; it is limited to currency actually in the hands of the public .
This includes travelers checks , demand deposits ( checking accounts ) , and other deposits against which checks can be written .
M2 includes all of M1 , plus savings accounts , time deposits of under $ 100,000 , and balances in retail money market mutual funds .
But that is all small potatoes , M3 includes all of M2 ( which includes M1 ) plus large - denomination ( $ 100,000 or more ) time deposits , balances in institutional money funds , repurchase liabilities issued by depository institutions , and Eurodollars held by U.S. residents at foreign branches of U.S. banks and at all banks in the United Kingdom and Canada . ”
In other words , M3 tracks what the big boys are doing with the money .
This includes US dollars held in banks in Canada and the UK ( called Eurodollars ) not to be confused with the Euro which is the standard currency of Europe .
So the question immediately arises why would the FED stop tracking this ?
The reason they give is that :
1 ) it will save money
2 ) That all the money that it tracks is tracked by other indicators .
First of all , since when is the government interested in saving money ?
I ’ve never heard of a government program being cut once it is on the books .
There are stories of government offices being created for the purpose of WWII and continuing on for decades even though the employees had absolutely nothing to do !
If they were eliminating M1 they could say the money is included in other indicators because M1 is included in M2 and M3 .
If they eliminated M2 it would be included in M3 but what is M3 included in ?
So , perhaps I ’m just suspicious by nature but it begs the question , what are they trying to hide ?
Well , if you ’ve read any of our other articles you will know that inflation and the money supply are very tightly integrated .
Increases in the money supply are the direct cause of inflation .
( See Inflation - Cause and effect and Inflation Definition ) .
With all its efforts at “ Tracking Inflation ” most everyone agrees that the last thing the Government really wants is for the general public to know how much it is stealing out of your pockets through inflation .
Inflation has been called “ the hidden tax ” and that is exactly what it is .
When the Government “ prints ” extra money what do you think it does with it ?
It spends it of course !
What would happen if you started writing checks ( creating money ) from an account that was empty ?
You ’d end up in jail !
But that is exactly what the government is doing when it creates money out of thin air .
Enron is n’t the only one who knows how to cook the books !
For years now in an effort to hide the actual amount of inflation , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( who tracks the inflation rate ) has been erasing inflation through a trick called “ hedonics ” .
Basically they say since a new computer is faster than an old one you get more for your money , so they adjust the price down .
So even though a new computer might cost you $ 500 they say since it is twice as fast , it is really only costing you $ 250 .
But try to explain that to “ Best Buy ” when you want to pick one up and see how far you get .
They use the same logic for cars and other things .
Everyone who studies it knows the Government is fudging the numbers , but it has gotten so bad that now they have to hide the M3 altogether .
Again I ask why ?
Well , I have a theory .
The U.S. trade deficit is running at an annual rate of about $ 800 billion .
That means we are spending $ 800 billion more than we are earning in the world markets .
Basically , we are sending dollars overseas ( primarily to China ) and they are sending us stuff .
Well , what are the Chinese doing with all that money we are sending them ?
Are they buying our stuff ?
Nope !
That would reduce our trade deficit .
They are actually saving about 50 % of their Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
In other words , as a Nation , they save half of what they make or about 1.1 Trillion Dollars a year .
On a nationwide basis ( this includes Government , Business and personal ) the U.S. only saves 13 % of its GDP .
But on a personal level the picture is much worse .
Chinese households save 30 % of what they earn while U.S. households save less than Zero !
On average , we actually spend .4 % more than we earn every year .
It is hard to imagine but it is true .
So what are the Chinese doing with all that extra money ?
They ca n’t just pile it up in their garage ( if they had one ) .
So what are they doing with it ?
Buying back our debt .
The Chinese are huge buyers of U.S. Government Treasury securities .
“ One spends money it has n’t got and the other sells to people who ca n’t pay . ”
Someone said recently that it ’s hard to tell who ’s crazier .
“ The one who spends money it has n’t got or the one who sells to people who ca n’t pay . ”
Basically , by buying U.S. Treasury Notes , the Chinese are loaning us the money to buy their stuff .
And the Government is printing the money to do it .
So my theory is that in order to hide all the money that is being created and sent to China the government is going to stop tracking M3 .
The Smoking Gun
It is no coincidence that the M3 went up an annualized 9.4 % in the last three months and an annualized 17.2 % in December alone and now the FED wants to stop tracking it !
Why bother tackling a problem of this magnitude when you can just bury the evidence ?
Who wants to leave a “ smoking gun ” laying around ?
A 9.4 % increase in money supply should translate into a 9.4 % inflation rate ( if GDP produces exactly enough to counteract obsolescence ) .
Even if there is a 1 % increase in the supply of goods , that still means that we really have 8.4 % inflation rather than the 3.6 % the BLS is telling us .
In order for the 3.6 % number to be true– we would have to have 5.8 % more stuff than last year ( 9.4 % – 3.6 % = 5.8 % ) .
Do you have 5.8 % more stuff than last year ?
I did n’t think so .
The writing is on the wall .
When the Government starts hiding data the problem is big !
If this trend continues , inflation is going to come roaring back big time .
We will see the late 70 ’s all over again .
The war is Iraq and the Billions in Hurricane damage have to be paid for somehow and the “ hidden tax of inflation ” is the easy way out .
Now is the time to begin stocking up on inflation hedges .

From walking to zipping , Part 2 : Down and up
The first post in this series showed what walks are and how to walk right through a value .
This second post will add walking down into and up out of a value .
Again , you can download this post as a program .

There are two ways to visualize a traversal .
The local way is to show the incoming and outgoing directions for a single step .
So far we have just one incoming direction , Before , and just one outgoing direction , After .
The global way to visualize a traversal is to show how its steps connect parts of a whole .
So far all we can do is to forge right .
To traverse a value with hierarchical structure , we want to descend from a parent part to visit its children , and to ascend from a child part to admire its parent .
Therefore , locally speaking , we add one incoming direction and one outgoing direction .
This way we connect a parent with its children as shown in the following global picture .
In the top row are the parent and its siblings .
In the bottom row are the children .
The ellipses indicate the children ’s cousins and own children .
The first time we visit a parent , we come in from its left .
We can choose to skip the children by moving right or to visit the children by moving down .
If we choose the latter , then after visiting all the children , we return to the parent from below , and can choose to move right or descend again .
This loop is shaded in the global picture above .
As the local picture above shows , we rename the old directions as we add the new directions .
Each incoming direction from — there is only one so far , namely Before — becomes two incoming directions , Exit False from and Exit True from .
The latter direction means that we just emerged from visiting the last child in a horizontal sequence .
data Exit from = Exit Bool from deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show )
Each outgoing direction to — there is only one so far , namely After — becomes an outgoing direction
To to alongside the new outgoing direction Enter , which means to descend to the first child of the current part .
data Enter to = Enter |
To to deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show )
Every time a visitor arrives at a part , the walk orients the visitor by passing an incoming direction .
Every time a visitor departs from a part , the visitor directs the walk by returning an outgoing direction .
In particular , if the visitor says to go down ( Enter ) but there is no child to visit , the walk stays at the same location and tells the visitor that there is no child to visit by passing the incoming direction Exit True Before .
Indeed , as the last picture indicates , the way to go up is to keep going right until you arrive at a part from below .
That ’s the plan .
Let ’s code it up .
First we lift the incoming direction before from any type from to the type Exit from .
instance ( From from ) =>
From ( Exit from ) where before = Exit False before
We also lift the outgoing direction after from any type to to the type Enter to .
instance ( To to ) =>
To ( Enter to ) where after = To after
To conduct recursive tourism , we define next to descend once into everything .
That is , descend when we arrive at a part from the left , but continue to the right when we arrive at a part from below .
instance ( Next Before to ) => Next ( Exit Before ) ( Enter to ) where next ( Exit False Before ) = Enter next ( Exit True Before ) =
To after
We now build a walk combinator around , of the following type .
around ::
Walk from to part whole ->
Walk ( Exit from ) ( Enter to ) part part ->
Walk ( Exit from ) ( Enter to ) part whole
This combinator takes two walks walkOuter and walkInner as argument and produces a new walk .
In the last picture , the top row corresponds to walkOuter and the bottom row corresponds to walkInner .
Whereas walkOuter steps through parts of a whole , walk Inner steps through ( sub ) parts of a part .
The new walk is like walkOuter , except at any step the visitor can Enter an inner walk to inspect the current part .
The code for around is straightforward .
The boring part is how it uses the helper functions scavenge ( from last time ) and pollute ( below ) to do the dirty work of preserving sharing .
The interesting part is how it builds a visitor visit ' for the outer walk by wrapping around an inner walk that uses the original visitor visit .
around walkOuter walkInner visit = walkOuter ( visit ' False False ) where visit ' dirty around from part = do ( part1_ , to ) <- visit ( Exit around from ) part let ( dirty1 , part1 ) = pollute dirty part part1_ case to of Enter -> do part2 _ <- walkInner visit part1 let ( dirty2 , part2 ) = pollute dirty1 part1 part2_ visit ' dirty 2
True from part2
To to -> return ( scavenge dirty 1 part1 , to ) pollute :: Bool -> a ->
Maybe a -> ( Bool , a ) pollute dirty a Nothing = ( dirty , a ) pollute _ _ ( Just a ) = ( True , a )
To try this out , let me first define a New York walk .
A New York walk makes no stop s , not even one .
newYork ::
Walk from to part whole newYork _ _ = return Nothing
The New York walk is so brisk , no tourist gets to see anything or touch any button .
* WalkZip2 > ( newYork :: Walk Before After Term Term ) tourist term Nothing * WalkZip2 > ( newYork :: Walk Before After Term Term ) tourist ' term Nothing
If we use the New York walk as the inner walk in around , then no part has any subpart , so a visitor who tries to enter a part is whisked right out .
* WalkZip2 > ( stop Before `around` newYork ) tourist term Exit False Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) Exit True Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) )
Nothing
But if we put this walk in an inner walk , then a part can have subparts , though a subpart cannot have subsubparts , so a visitor who tries to enter a subpart is whisked out .
* WalkZip2 > ( stop Before `around` gwalk ( stop Before `around` newYork ) ) tourist term Exit False Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit True Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit True Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit True Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) )
Nothing
To go one level further into the term , we can put this last walk in an inner walk , so that only a subsubpart cannot have subsubsubparts .
* WalkZip2 > ( stop Before `around` gwalk ( stop Before `around` gwalk ( stop Before `around` newYork ) ) ) tourist term Exit False Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit False Before : A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) Exit True Before : A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) Exit True Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit False Before : A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) Exit True Before : A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) Exit True Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit True Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) )
Nothing
To walk through all nodes of a tree , we take the fixpoint of this process .
throughout :: ( Data a ) =>
Walk from to a a ->
Walk ( Exit from ) ( Enter to ) a a throughout level = level `around` gwalk ( throughout level )
Whee !
* WalkZip2 > throughout ( stop Before ) tourist term Exit False Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit False Before : A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) Exit False Before : V " x " Exit True Before : V " x " Exit False Before : V " x " Exit True Before : V " x " Exit True Before : A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) Exit True Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit False Before : A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) Exit False Before : V " x " Exit True Before : V " x " Exit False Before : V " x " Exit True Before : V " x " Exit True Before : A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) Exit True Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) Exit True Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) )
Nothing
You might be tired of all this recursive tourism where the visitor just follows a predetermined route and makes no choice .
I certainly much prefer interactive decision - making over horseback flower - watching !
To finish up this post , let ’s control a walk from the keyboard .
The following visitor is convenient for that : it prompts us at each step for what to return .
A blank line means to take the next step without making any changes .
keyboard :: ( Next from to , Show a , Read a ) => from -> a ->
IO ( Maybe a , to ) keyboard from x = do putStr ( show from ++ " : " ++ show x ++ "
? " ) line <- getLine return ( if all isSpace line then ( Nothing , next from ) else read line )
Let ’s stroll through the term ( λx.xx ) ( λx.xx ) and change its second part to ( λx.x ) , then double back to review the new term ( λx.xx ) ( λx.x ) .
* WalkZip2 > throughout ( stop Before ) keyboard term Exit False Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ?
Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
( Nothing , To After ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
Exit False Before : A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ?
( Just ( V " x " ) , Enter ) Exit True Before : V " x " ? Exit True Before : L " x " ( V " x " ) ?
Exit True Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( V " x " ) ) ?
( Nothing , Enter ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
Exit False Before : A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ?
( Nothing , To After ) Exit True Before : L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ?
( Nothing , To After ) Exit False Before : L " x " ( V " x " ) ?
( Nothing , To After ) Exit True Before : A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( V " x " ) ) ?
( Nothing , To After ) Just ( A ( L " x " ( A ( V " x " ) ( V " x " ) ) ) ( L " x " ( V " x " ) ) )
Ms Sithole may be asked to compete in men's events in future
Samukeliso Sithole , 17 , has been charged with impersonation .
At her court appearance , she insisted that she was a woman , despite a doctor 's report to the contrary .
Ms Sithole said she was born with both male and female sexual organs and a traditional healer had made the penis disappear but it had since regrown .
She told the court that the penis had returned because the healer had not been fully paid for his services .
She said that she had already arranged to pay the healer on 3 March , the day her trial is set to start , and so she expected her penis to disappear once more , according to the state - run Herald newspaper .
Multi-talented
The state prosecutor said he was n't sure whether to keep Ms Sithole in men's or women 's remand cells .
The BBC's Steve Vickers in Harare says that there has been a great deal of interest in the case with radio phone - ins full of speculation .
One caller said that Ms Sithole had won gold medals for Zimbabwe and so should not be punished .
The case came to light when somebody told one of Ms Sithole 's friends and fellow athletes , Melita Mudondiro , that she was really a man .
Ms Mudondiro had undressed in front of Ms Sithole in the belief that she was a woman and lodged a formal complaint to the police .
The multi-talented athlete has competed in regional tournaments in triple jump , javelin and shot - putt , winning several gold medals .
The National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe is yet to comment on the matter .

Girls get extra school help while boys get Ritalin
At last June 's graduation at Franklin High School just outside of Milwaukee , three of the four students who tied for valedictorian were girls .
Among the National Honor Society members , 76 % were girls .
And girls comprised 85 % of the students on Franklin 's 4.0 honor roll .
The superintendent of schools for this upper - middle - class suburb , Gerald Freitag , investigated those numbers after the parents of a boy filed a complaint .
He found that the skewed performances by gender at Franklin pretty much mirror the imbalances across the state — and the nation .
This week , teachers at the middle school feeding into Franklin received training on how to reach out to boys .
And high school teachers will continue the gender - sensitivity classes they began last school year .
But reversing the trend will not be easy .
In classrooms nationwide , girls are pulling ahead of boys academically .
Recent federal testing data show that what starts out as a modest gap in elementary - level reading scores turns into a yawning divide by high school .
In 12th grade , 44 % of girls rate as proficient readers on federal tests , compared with 28 % of boys .
And while boys still score slightly higher on federal math and science exams , their advantage is slipping .
Most startling is that little is being done to correct the imbalances .
All of the major players — schools , education colleges and researchers — largely ignore the gender gap .
Instead of pursuing sound solutions , many educators merely advocate prescribing more attention - focusing Ritalin for the boys , who receive the drug at four to eight times the rate of girls , according to different estimates .
" Too often the first reaction to an attention problem is ' Let 's medicate , ' " says Rockville , Md. , child psychologist Neil Hoffman .
" Some schools are quick to recommend solutions before they 've fully evaluated the problem . "
Playing to girls ' strengths
One reason boys are losing academic ground to girls appears linked to a shift by schools to more word - based learning for which girls ' brains are believed to have an advantage .
Over the years , even math problems have become more word oriented , according to education researchers .
But because schools are doing little to help boys adjust , males risk becoming second - class academic citizens .
Already the academic success girls enjoy in high school translates into more college acceptances — 56 % of the students on campuses are female .
The full impact from this shift is something society has yet to discover .
But a drop in earnings for males is one likely result .
Workers with only a high school diploma earn $ 20,000 a year less than those with a bachelor 's degree .
One fact explains why educators are ignoring boys ' needs :
You can't address a problem that you do n't admit exists .
The U.S. Department of Education concedes that no serious research is available comparing different instructional methods that might help boys .
In fact , many education researchers are hostile toward research aimed at exploring gender differences in learning .
Last April , when Kenneth Dragseth , superintendent of schools in Edina , Minn. , presented a paper describing his district 's gender gap at the American Educational Research Association 's annual meeting in Chicago , he says the reception ranged from chilly to hostile .
Female education researchers in the audience questioned whether helping boys would mean hurting girls .
Their attitude follows years of lobbying by groups such as the American Association of University Women , which alerted educators to the fact that girls were being shortchanged academically in the fields of math and science .
The extra attention helped focus schools on girls ' difficulties , but it has made it too easy for educators to overlook the problems of boys .
Among them : • Boys and girls learn differently .
The best research on boy - girl learning differences is produced more by accident than by design .
The lack of data in this field can hurt girls as much as boys .
For instance , as part of an ongoing 20 - year dyslexia study focusing on Connecticut schools , Yale neuroscientist and pediatrician Sally Shaywitz discovered that schools were identifying four times as many dyslexic boys as girls .
Yet when her team entered schools to screen children , it diagnosed just as many dyslexic girls as boys .
Shaywitz found that the mostly female teaching staff was quicker to identify rambunctious boys than quiet girls .
The results are just one example of what might be learned about the role gender plays in education , especially in elementary school , where 85 % of teachers are women .
•
Future teachers are n't trained to deal with learning differences .
Therapist Michael Gurian , author of Boys and Girls Learn Differently ! , has visited more than 100 education colleges .
But he has not found one that offers courses on male - female brain differences .
His discovery explains why many new teachers arrive in classrooms clueless about what teaching techniques might work best for boys ' learning styles .
•
Boys lack advocates .
The special efforts made by schools to steer more girls into advanced math and science classes came after powerful advocacy groups embraced the problem .
But Gurian and other advocates for boys say they run into resistance from educators who point to males ' success in the workforce as proof that advocacy for boys is unnecessary .
In spite of the lack of research , anecdotal evidence shows that far more effective strategies are available for teaching boys than plying them with Ritalin .
Patricia Henley runs a boy - friendly charter school in Kansas that hires many male teachers .
It also recognizes boys ' natural tendency to favor active learning by conducting more class work on the chalkboard and allowing more student movement within the classroom .
And the school trains teachers to deal with boys ' particular styles .
For instance , because boys volunteer answers more slowly than girls do , teachers are told to count to 10 before calling on a student .
Beginning in the early 1990s , groups such as the American Association of University Women performed an important service by alerting the public to an educational failing .
Their persistence helped convince educators that schools were ignoring important problems plaguing girls , such as the loss of self - esteem among middle school girls who had been successful students throughout elementary school .
Today 's education system fails many boys .
They deserve the same kind of attention to address why they are losing ground .
For decades , Hispanics have existed mainly in the shadows of the American dream .
Now they 're taking to the streets in their millions , in the biggest march for equality since the Civil Rights movement .
And with $ 1 trillion to spend , millions ready to vote and their own candidate for President , Hispanics hold the key to the new American century .
Paul Harris reports
Eddie ' El Piolin ' Sotelo does not look like a revolutionary threat to America .
He is short , stocky , with neat dark hair and a broad smile .
His nickname means simply ' Tweety Bird ' in Spanish .
Until 18 months ago , Sotelo was virtually unknown .
Though more than a million listeners tuned into his radio show , the majority of America was blissfully unaware of his championing of the rights of illegal immigrants - simply because he did it in Spanish .
Then , one day , he publicised protests against a draft law to classify undocumented migrants as felons .
Sotelo urged his Hispanic listeners to take to the streets .
They answered his call in their millions .
In Los Angeles , 400,000 marchers streamed through downtown .
A similar number jammed Chicago .
In dozens of cities , millions of people were suddenly protesting against a law few other Americans even knew about .
And ' El Piolin ' was at the front of the marchers .
' More than two million marched .
And I am proud that we were peaceful , ' he tells The Observer
The demonstrators left a stunned America asking one question : who are these people ?
The answer , it seems , is simple : they are America 's future .
The US is currently in the grip of a demographic change the like of which has not been seen since the 19th century .
A mass immigration is taking place that dwarfs the flow of Irish , Germans , Jews and Italians that , 100 years ago , saw America rise to a superpower .
It is a movement of Hispanic immigrants - legal and illegal - and the explosive growth of their descendants .
In 1950 there were just 4 m Spanish - speaking Americans , and the word Hispanic had not even been coined .
Now their number stands at 44 m , and they have surpassed blacks as the country 's largest minority .
By 2050 there will be 103 m Hispanics - or a quarter of all Americans .
That change has had a huge impact on what it means to be American .
From politics to the economy , sport and the arts , the US is changing .
Spanish is becoming the nation 's second language .
A Hispanic , Bill Richardson , is running for President .
Their spending power is nearly $ 1 trillion , which , if Hispanic America were a separate country , would give it the ninth largest economy on earth .
' What is happening now is one of the most important moments in American history , ' says Professor Ruben Rumbaut , a sociologist at the University of California .
This is a second American revolution .
Every immigrant has a story .
Rodolfo Acevedo left Argentina in 1990 for the same reason most other migrants come to America : opportunity .
' Argentina had just gone through hyperinflation .
It was a chance to get a better life , ' he says .
Acevedo wanted to be an architect , but on arrival in Boca Raton , Florida , the only job he could get was at a restaurant .
But as the diner was popular with architects , Acevedo brought in his drawings .
Eventually he got an entry - level job and by 2002 was a partner .
Last August he took up American citizenship .
Acevedo's voice trembles as he recalls the ceremony : ' It was unreal .
The culmination of a dream . '
Acevedo took a legal route , following a relative already living in the US .
Such kinship networks stretch out from every city in America down through Mexico and Latin America to the Spanish - speaking Caribbean .
Many follow Acevedo's path of taking any job and working their way up .
They see America as classless , a place where hard work brings just rewards .
' In Argentina it was about who you were and where you came from .
In America that is less true , ' Acevedo says .
But there is another side of the Hispanic wave - the illegal immigrants , who likely measure some 12 m or so .
These are the ' wetbacks ' who cross the border with Mexico , risking their lives .
These are the people whose bodies are found in the desert and who are at the bottom of America 's low - wage economy : working the nation 's kitchens and harvesting its crops .
They harbour the same dreams as Acevedo and some have similar success .
Amazingly , Eddie Sotelo is one of their number .
He entered the US illegally on a forged green card .
Now he is a famous DJ .
No wonder so many answered his call .
' I am one of them , ' Sotelo says .
' I am just like my listeners . '
But the Hispanic revolution is not simply a story of migrants .
If immigration stopped tomorrow , the massive growth of the Hispanic population would continue apace .
Hispanic America is younger than the rest of America and it has more children .
The average non-Hispanic family has 1.8 children ; for Hispanics it is 2.8 .
Some 15 per cent of non-Hispanics are over 65 , but the figure for Hispanics is just 5 per cent .
' Stopping immigration would not change a thing .
Most of them are born here , ' says Nestor Rodriguez , a professor at the University of Houston .
Hispanics are firmly entrenched in everyday American life .
You can see that reality on the streets of New York , in areas that have always played host to the latest wave of hopeful immigrants .
The South Bronx has been home to Irish , Jews and Italians .
Now it is Hispanic .
On a walk down Third Avenue , the streets are full of Hispanic life .
The shops sell Latin American food ; a family sits on the pavement playing loud Spanish rap ; a van drives by with a Dominican flag flying from its windows .
It is in this hardscrabble place that Jorge Medina was born .
And when he grew up and became a success , he built a factory here .
Hailing from a poor Puerto Rican family , Medina 's identity as both Puerto Rican and American sits easily with him .
His firm , which he started in his Bronx apartment , now has sales of more than $ 1 m .
It supplies sporting equipment to some of the most famous names in baseball , such as Carlos Beltran , who reflect the dominance Hispanic players now have in America 's national game .
' I am proud to be American .
I am proud to be of Puerto Rican descent , ' Medina says .
' I do n't distinguish between the two . '
He stands in front of a rack of baseball bats : the perfect image of Americana .
Then he reaches up and plucks a T - shirt from the shelves .
He grins as he shows off the logo : ' Viva la revolucion ' .
The impact of the Hispanic revolution is being felt across American society .
Often , nuances show profound changes .
Dial any helpline and you hear the message : ' Press one to continue in English .
Oprima el dos para continuar en espanol . '
It is there in the national palate : sales of taco chips are growing two - and - a - half times faster than crisps ; sales of white bread are declining while tortillas are flying off the shelves .
Mexico 's independence day festival of Cinco de Mayo is now a national celebration on a par with St Patrick 's Day .
The traditional coming - of - age celebration for Hispanic women - known as quinceanera - is replacing ' sweet 16 ' parties .
The chain Pizza Patron even accepts Mexican pesos .
Sitting in the rarefied atmosphere of the Conde Nast building in Manhattan , Luzmery Amador shows how far it is possible to come .
The daughter of poor , working - class immigrants from Colombia , Amador works as an art director .
In a slinky black dress and killer heels , she relaxes in the cafeteria , a New York hotspot where the fashion tastes of the world are decided .
' Who would have thought that I would go to Florence and Paris to see the latest shows ? ' she says .
' My parents still do n't speak any English . '
That is no surprise : in many areas of America it is possible to get by entirely in Spanish .
A staggering 28 m Americans now speak Spanish at home .
( The next largest non-English language is Chinese , with just 2 m speakers . )
This has created a vibrant Spanish - language market in America .
The country 's top 500 companies spend more than $ 5bn on Spanish advertising each year .
' It is a critical mass , ' says Cristina Benitez , author of Latinization : How Latino Culture is Transforming the US .
Benitez advises large companies such as Kraft and Pepsi how to deal with these changes .
But the changes have had a personal impact too .
As a child she remembers cringing at her Hispanic name in school .
' I used to have to spell my name for people .
Now I do n't have to do that , ' she says .
Part of the reason why so much Hispanic culture is becoming mainstream is that it largely travels over a land border , not an ocean .
This means the most Hispanic parts of the US - California , Texas , Arizona - sit next to the Spanish - speaking world .
Cross - border media , business ( and crime ) all flourish in ways they could not with previous immigrant waves from Europe .
But cities such as New York and Chicago now have huge Hispanic populations too .
Indeed , the Hispanic revolution is changing unexpected parts of the country beyond recognition .
Take New Orleans .
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , it required a cheap army of labourers to rebuild the city .
Enter the Hispanics .
Now , in a city once known for its Cajun food and French influences , there are more than 100,000 Hispanics .
The first shop to re-open in the ruined Lower Ninth Ward was a ' tienda Latina ' selling Hispanic groceries .
Myelita Melton was among the first to notice the change .
She sells Spanish language courses and attended the first post - Katrina business conference in the city .
She was surprised to notice her taxi driver was a psychiatrist from Nicaragua .
Then she realised her hotel maid was Honduran .
' Walking down Bourbon Street I heard so much Spanish .
Those people are putting down roots , ' she says .
She is bombarded with requests for Spanish courses from New Orleans city officials .
But perhaps the most surprising outpost of the Hispanic revolution is the Deep South .
The region has been defined by black and white racial conflict , yet now a third group has arrived , and the results have been shocking .
The conventional wisdom holds that blacks and Hispanics would likely seek common ground , as both are ethnic minorities .
Yet the two groups are clashing over access to healthcare , benefits and school places .
' There are rising tensions .
There is a clash of interests , or the perception of one , ' says Paula McClain , a professor at Duke University and one of the few academics doing research in the area .
Most surprising of all have been surveys showing that southern blacks and whites feel far closer to each other than either does to Hispanics .
The Hispanic immigration could transform the South 's ancient racial wounds .
' This new population is blurring the racial divide .
Black and white southerners feel they know each other and they do n't know these other people , ' says McClain .
But she does n't see that as a recipe for racial harmony .
' There is a potential for backlash against the Hispanics .
It is not going to be a feelgood story . '
It is not just a cultural transformation - a political earthquake is brewing .
The explosion of the Hispanic population has huge ramifications for Republicans and Democrats as they face a fundamental truth : whichever party captures the Hispanic vote will capture the White House .
The signs of this growing political power are most obvious in Texas , a state which has already ushered in one political revolution in the shape of President George W Bush and his evangelical Christian backers .
Now , a different political wind is blowing through the Lone Star state .
Texas will soon be a state in which the majority of people are from a minority , and most will be Hispanic .
By 2040 , for every white Texan there will be two Hispanics .
You can see the changes already in a city like San Antonio .
This is the home of the Alamo , where Davy Crockett 's army lost a battle to Mexico but triggered a war that eventually saw Texas join America .
Now San Antonio , the US 's seventh largest city , is 60 per cent Hispanic .
Just yards from the Alamo sits the newly - opened Museum of Hispanic America .
But it is not just Texas .
The whole south west - the fastest - growing region in America - is turning Hispanic : they make up 28 per cent of Arizona , 25 per cent of Nevada , 20 per cent of Colorado and 43 per cent of New Mexico .
That brings political power .
Across America there are 5,129 elected Hispanic officials , a rise of 40 per cent in 10 years .
One , former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson , is running for president .
The Hispanic community has become a battleground for Democrats and Republicans , and it is a battle the Republicans are beginning to lose .
The reason is simple : immigration .
In 2000 , the Republicans and Democrats almost split the Hispanic vote .
But as a national backlash against illegal immigration has swept white America , the Republican party has been carried along by its grass roots .
Earlier this year Bush attempted to pass an immigration law that would have allowed millions of illegals a path to citizenship .
It was destroyed by a Republican rebellion that devastated the party 's chances of winning the Hispanic vote .
That could turn the future of American politics a deep blue .
It is happening in Texas already .
Democrats have n't won a state - wide contest here since 1994 , yet the state 's Republican governor , Rick Perry , only survived last year because the opposition split between three candidates .
In Dallas , a local paper recently heralded a ' Democrat deluge ' after the party won an astounding 41 of 42 local judicial elections .
Elsewhere , two Republican senators in Arizona were swept out of office after taking an ultra- hard line on immigration , which was popular with Republican whites .
Then they found out Hispanics voted too .
America's 44 m Hispanics have the potential to wield enormous power , yet 60 per cent of them do not vote : either they are too young or ineligible , or afraid of government .
But that is changing .
Political activists are out urging the community to go to the polls .
And ' El Piolin ' has turned his attentions to the cause , using his radio show to emphasise the importance of the vote .
That , he believes , is the true cutting edge of the Hispanic revolution , and his listeners hear it every day .
Soon the rest of America will hear it too .
' At the next election they are going to find out : we know how to vote , ' he laughs .
But for every wave of change there is always a backlash .
The fight against the Hispanic revolution is gathering momentum in small towns across America .
None is more on the frontline than the seemingly sleepy Illinois village of Carpentersville , one of a string of towns hereabouts that were founded by Irish and Polish immigrants , thrived on trade and factories , and have now hit harder times .
The Fox River cuts through Carpentersville , and is proving a very real division .
On the west side the town is mainly white ; on the poorer eastern side it is Hispanic .
A steady influx has turned a once homogeneous community into one that is 40 per cent Hispanic .
The east side is now full of Spanish - speaking hair salons , Mexican markets and day labourers gathering for work .
Now , like scores of other towns across America , Carpentersville has drawn up laws promoting English - only rules and is cracking down on companies that hire illegals and fining landlords who rent rooms to them .
The public face of the backlash is Paul Humpfer , an accountant who wrote the anti-illegal immigrant measures .
For him , it is simple : ' People just do n't think it 's their own town any more . '
Critics say such moves are resonant of the laws of the racially - segregated South , as people single out one ethnic group for different treatment .
The agitators say their communities are drowning under a wave of crime and that they simply want to see the law upheld .
In Carpentersville , the twice - monthly meetings of the village board have assumed epic proportions .
As many as 2,000 people show up .
Elections have taken on a strident tone .
Humpfer and his anti-illegal immigrant colleagues ran for office as the All America Team .
They distributed a flyer that listed grievances against illegals .
' Are you tired of seeing the Mexican flag flown above our flag ? ' it asked .
Humpfer denies being racist : ' It hurts .
That could not be further from the truth . '
The list of towns like Carpentersville is long .
It includes Farmers Branch in Texas , where residents oppose the opening of a Hispanic supermarket , and Hazleton , Pennsylvania , where anti-immigrant laws were overturned in court .
It stretches from Prince William County in Virginia to South Carolina 's Beaufort County , where all non-English language on official signs has been removed .
' Carpentersville is all of our towns .
We are a nation of immigrants , but also a nation of xenophobes and nativists , ' says Professor Rumbaut .
The power of the backlash was most keenly felt in the defeat of Bush 's immigration bill .
Tens of thousands of activists rallied against it , sending literally millions of faxes to politicians that scared them into voting down the law .
The main group behind the protest , Numbers USA , had just 55,000 members three years ago .
Now it has more than half a million .
Much of their distress over immigration is based on a simple fear of difference .
' They come here to work but they make no effort to integrate .
They do not want to , ' says Edwin Rubenstein , an economics consultant and commentator on anti-immigration issues .
The hero of the anti-immigration backlash is Harvard professor Samuel Huntington , whose 2004 book Who Are We? : America 's Great Debate postulated that Hispanic immigration would destroy America 's protestant Anglo - Saxon character .
' He was right , ' says Rubenstein , whose own ancestors were Russian Jews .
' They keep their culture and customs .
When other immigrants arrived they had to break their bonds and commit themselves to the US for better or worse . '
But behind the cultural and political arguments lies a more powerful economic phenomenon .
Hispanic migration is also driven by the desire of major corporations to create a low - wage workforce .
The fear of the American middle class is not just over Spanish or a brown skin ; it is also a more justifiable anxiety that jobs are disappearing and wages being lowered .
Much of the rhetoric of the right attacks big business .
' It is a betrayal .
The corporate elites have hijacked government on behalf of business interests and profits , ' says Rubenstein .
That may be true .
But the backlash is having an impact on ordinary Hispanics , not big business .
There are regular round - ups of illegal immigrants .
Often parents are deported while their American - born children , who are citizens , remain .
There are an estimated 3.1 m children at risk of being in such a parentless situation .
Many towns which have passed anti-immigrant laws have sparked an exodus of their Hispanic residents , illegal or not .
' These are a kind of pogrom , ' says Rumbaut .
Yet the fears of ' nativists ' seem to have been blown out of all proportion .
America is transforming , but the more it changes , the more it looks the same .
In interview after interview , Hispanic Americans show that - as with those other waves of Italians , Irish and Jews - the power of assimilation is strong .
Take George Torres .
He grew up the son of Cuban immigrants in south Florida and loved sport .
But he eschewed traditional Hispanic games like soccer .
Instead , his childhood played out in the shadow of the Miami Dolphins ' American football stadium .
Now he is a director of the club .
' Many Hispanics embrace [ American ] football as a form of cultural assimilation .
There is no football in Colombia or Mexico .
It is an American tradition and they want to be at the heart of it , ' Torres says .
And there 's Flaco Navaja .
He is a poet , singer and actor in New York City and the son of a Puerto Rican nationalist father .
Sitting in a swanky cafe on Manhattan 's Upper West Side , he talks of a poor childhood growing up in the South Bronx and his pride in his Hispanic identity .
' My dad refused to speak English to us , ' he says .
Yet the story of Navaja 's family is a classic American tale .
His parents , once poor and struggling , have retired and own their own home .
Navaja will soon appear in films with Sigourney Weaver and Ed Norton .
' Yeah , I guess that is the American dream , ' he laughs .
' But we can maintain our own identity . '
Then he laughs and tells me about his young daughter .
She is 10 years old and her native language is English .
' She 's learning Spanish .
I 'm teaching her , ' he shrugs and smiles .
But the fact is that while the Hispanicisation of America is strong , so is the Americanisation of its Hispanics .
Academic studies have shown that Spanish is only spreading so fast because of new immigrants .
Among Hispanics born and bred in America , it almost always dies out .
' It is unmistakeable , ' says Nestor Rodriguez at the University of Houston .
' By the third generation , English is dominant in 95 per cent of families . '
You can see that in the personal stories of those who chart the assimilation .
When Professor Rumbaut 's Cuban - born father spoke English , his strong accent marked him out as ' other ' .
Yet Rumbaut himself became an academic who testified before Congress on immigration issues .
And Rumbaut 's 10 - year - old son ?
' When I speak to him in Spanish , he answers in English .
I have not just studied this experience , ' Rumbaut says .
' I have lived it . '
As with all revolutions , the Hispanic immigration will leave untouched as much as it alters .
A Hispanic America will still be America .
Perhaps that is because it is a fundamentally human story whose emphasis on language , skin colour and cultural differences masks the universal desire to make a better life .
That is also why it is impossible to stop .
When Rodolfo Acevedo , the Florida waiter turned architect , arrived from Argentina he brought not just his language and culture but his drive and ambition .
' I never lost sight of my dream , ' he said .
His new career is going well .
Acevedo recently won a huge new project .
Soon his buildings will start popping up across Florida .
He has made them pleasant , light and eco-friendly .
He has ensured they are as welcoming as possible to those who will use them .
For he has designed Florida 's new immigration centres .
Activists said the celebrity endorsement would raise awareness of the plight of pachyderms that got drunk on farmers ' homemade rice beer and went on the rampage .
Last month , six wild elephants that broke into a farm in the state of Meghalaya were electrocuted after discovering and drinking the potent brew before uprooting an electricity pylon .
" There would have been more casualties if the villagers had n't chased them away , " Hilton was quoted as saying in Tokyo last week according to a report posted on the World Entertainment News Network website .
" And four elephants died in a similar way three years ago .
It is just so sad .
" The elephants get drunk all the time .
It is becoming really dangerous .
We need to stop making alcohol available to them . "
Sangeeta Goswami , who heads the animal rights group People for Animals , said : " I am indeed happy Hilton has taken note of recent incidents of wild elephants in north - east India going berserk after drinking homemade rice beer and getting killed .
" As part of her global elephant campaign , Hilton should , in fact , think of visiting this region [ which is ] literally infested with elephants . "
While welcoming Hilton 's interest , another conservationist said elephant alcohol abuse was just a symptom of a larger problem .
" Elephants appear on human settlements ... because they have no habitat left due to wanton destruction of forests , " Soumyadeep Dutta , who heads Nature 's Beckon , a regional conservation group , said .
" A celebrity like Hilton must focus her attention on this fact . "
Hilton 's publicist could not be reached for comment .
The heiress promised to improve her bad girl image when she completed a three - week jail sentence in June for violating probation in an alcohol - related reckless driving case .
She announced plans to do charity work in Rwanda for the Playing for Good Foundation , but the trip was postponed until next year .
“ He was there for peaceful negotiation , ” said Munaza Hashmi , a local lawyer .
“ Not agitation . ”
With hundreds of lawyers and human rights activists already in jail , protests were smaller on Tuesday than on the previous day .
At least 2,000 people have been rounded up by the authorities , among them 500 to 700 or more lawyers , according to lawyers and political officials .
It was unclear how Mr. Chaudhry , who was fired on Saturday and is under house arrest , was able to gain access to a cellphone .
In addition to the call to the lawyers , he has been surreptitiously calling Pakistani newspaper journalists , who are defying an emergency order that prohibits coverage that “ brings into ridicule or disrepute ” General Musharraf and other officials .
Mr. Chaudhry and other lawyers said they hoped to re-create the protest campaign they carried out this spring when the lawyers mounted rallies in major cities after General Musharraf removed Mr. Chaudhry from the Supreme Court bench the first time .
General Musharraf ’s popularity dropped , and Mr. Chaudhry was reinstated after four months , invigorating the Supreme Court and the general ’s opponents .
On Saturday , days before the Supreme Court was expected to declare him ineligible for another term in office , General Musharraf suspended the Constitution , dissolved the Supreme Court , and blacked out all independent and international television news channels in Pakistan .
Supreme Court judges , like Mr. Chaudhry , who refused to declare the general ’s move legal were placed under house arrest .
On Monday , President Bush personally urged General Musharraf to end emergency rule and carry out nationwide elections , previously scheduled for mid-January .
On Tuesday , a close aide to General Musharraf said no decision had been made .

Edd a few things to note :
1 . Go back to second grade and learn how to spell .
Some grammar lessons might help too .
2. 2 . OR go back to the sixth grade and learn how to type .
3 . If you are so in to GOD why are you wasting your time online ?
Should n’t you be out praying for yourself and us or reading your precious book or something ?
Dan .
Leave your creationism at the door please .
You , a designer , of all people , should know that your designs are based on something else .
You probably use basic design principals that you EVOLVE into your own work .
When people believe in the crap you spew out it makes me sick .
In my opinion you are a cowered if you believe in GOD or creationism or intelligent design .
You are a cowered because you do n’t want to take the time or effort to answer the questions of the universe , So you give up and say , “ oh it ’s because god intended for it to be this way . ”
Or “ Oh it ’s written in the bible that is should be like this . ”
Wussy !!!
There is only one thing in your whole statement that I agree with and that is “ there are too many unknowns . ”
But that does not mean there is a god .
If you do n’t understand something then spend the time to figure it out .
Pansy !!!
And I have read about many of these experiments that support creation and as soon as it gets tough or has any resemblance to what ’s in the bible I hear “ oh I give up because this defiantly proves god did it , screw further testing , mystery solved by god again . ”
You ’re like a little child who believes in anything someone tells them because they do n’t take the time to question .
You ’re still a little boy Dan .
Grow up

I think you need to spend some more time in the Word , you will not be on the right hand of the throne god judging people .
everyone will be judged the exact same way .
And if you truly are a Christian you would realize that loving your enemies is not telling them that you will be proud when they get sent to hell .
I pray you are not this cold in real life .

micmad
You misspelled " coward " and " principles " .
Also , your post is excellent proof of my point .
" There are too many unknowns . "
We agree on that .
You , however propose that I look into it further , and not cop out by saying " God did it " .
The fact of the matter is : no one knows these " unknowns " .
Not even scientists .
That 's why it 's called evolutionary theory .
So , it 's not a matter of just studying it a little more .
If I did that , ( which I said I do in my post ) I would just be taking some guy 's word for it who has a " theory " .
So , in a round about way , your confusing post supports my idea that we can't know scientifically .
If we can't know scientifically ( there is no experiment that can prove the big - bang or any other theory of origin ) then it makes more sense to look into this issue on a heart level .
So , we are beings with feelings and souls .
We are each more than equipped to give credit where credit is due .
We look at a computer and say someone designed that .
We look at a brain and say that someone designed that a lot better than whoever designed a computer .
Also , you did an excellent job of articulating my point about being a designer .
You said : " You probably use basic design principals that you EVOLVE into your own work . "
This statement implies an individual with intent causing something to happen .
I 'm not nothing .
I 'm a person with a brain who has learned some tools that I put to use to design something visually .
This model works as a metaphor for a creator a million times better than Evolution .
So good job .

The yellow lizard is n't even camo , it 's coincidence .
Roads with yellow lines have only been around for about 100 years , not long enough for a lizard to evolve camo for a road , and besides , a road is not an ideal habitat for any animal ( except maybe crows and buzzards )
This is probably a poisoness lizard .

I do n't claim to be an expert in Evolution .
I have studied it growing up as much as anyone else has .
I have had a one key observation about this subject .
Both Evolution and Creation require a guiding force .
I understand the theory of natural selection , but there is a disconnect in reasoning .
If there is no supreme being , then why are there people saying this : " natural selection decided that they could . "
A scientific theory cannot decide anything .
That is an intelligent characteristic .
kodijack may have mis-spoke , I 'm not sure .
But I think we all know deep down that this world has been designed at an incredible level of detail .
Edd , is unfortunately being very judgmental .
This frustrates me to no end .
He will not be sitting at the right hand of God.
That 's Jesus ' seat .
I apologize on his behalf .
I think all of you are really intelligent people .
I 'm not going to join the argument here , there are too many unknowns .
I just believe that if you approach the subject with an open mind , you will know that there is a creator .
That feeling you get when you see something breathtaking in nature is all the evidence you need .
The Bible talks about how we are made in God 's image .
I am a designer .
I love being creative , I think everyone does , in some way .
This is a characteristic we acquired from God .
I 'm not saying I have n't seen any scientific evidence .
There have been plenty of scientific experiments that support creation .
But there 's no sense in having the debate there because you have just as many studies that support forms of evolution .
I encourage you to pull back and really investigate creation as a possibility .
If you really do that completely , and with an open mind to it , you may believe that there is a loving God who created us in his image .
And he 's always wanted nothing more than to have a relationship with us , which he made possible through his son , Jesus Christ .
You may choose to not believe it .
But at least you 'd feel like you know what you believe , and what you do n't .
I 'm really impressed with the intensity of the conversation .
I think that comes from people who take ownership of what they believe .
I do not fault you for that .
Too many people go through life without ever investigating these things .

When animals change to adapt to to their environment , that is called micro evolution , which is just natural selection and adaptation .
This is fine for me as a Christian .
But macro-evolution has nothing to do with animals changing the way they look , because in the end they are the same animal .
Macro-evolution is what 's stupid , stating that one animal evolved into another .

Think about it .
maybe you have no science in your schools !
Rocks are always teh same , but youa re trying to say that lkizards ' evolve '- CHANGING when rocks are STILL THE SAME .
these things are timeless like G - d 's love for earth , I am not saying tehy arent amazing , just no that it means that we are from monkeys - or is that also a camouflage ?
fitting in with MODERN CITIES ?
you people criticise but do n;t think about why you are here at all .

What I do n't get is how God gets all the credit when everything is peachy , but none of the negative press by Christians ?
Or that God loves you unconditionally , yet I will burn in a lake of fire for not believing in him ?
Never cured an amputee in the history of mankind .
Always needs lots of money to spend on lavish churches and cathederals , all to glorify Himself while his worshippers around the world starve to death for lack of money .
I have lots of questions , but no one seems to have a proper answer .
Why is that ' edd ' ?
I guess we believe what we want to believe , I believe I 'll live a full and joyous life in the recognition that it 's the only one I get .
Beats the hell out of listening to the heavenly chorus for etnerity .

ok Edd that was --------- only if there is a way i can say something about what you said in a nice way .
since i cant ill leave it .
I believe in god and Darwin 's theory of evolution more than makes sense to me i do n't understand the people getting mad .
How can you not see that thing evolve to fit their surroundings .
and for humans i thinks we do n't evolve because we do NOT need to fit our surroundings .... we make our surroundings fit us so no need for evolving .
and just because evolution is real it does n't mean god dose not exist .
479 diggs micmad 2007-09-24 12:18:37
No Dan ,
Science , not YET proving something , does not mean that it has to be God .
Again what you are saying is that if something gets too complicated for you to understand you give up and say “ It must be because of God . ”
You are right .
We ca n’t fully answer many of the theories that have been developed , but if you take the time to focus your efforts on one theory , what you learn may be passed on to others who will take up where you left off .
One day we as a human group WILL have the answers .
Its people like you , who give up , do us the most harm .
You do not contribute to societies learning for our future .
Your holding us back Dan .
Stop while you still can .
Feelings are the words we use to describe our particular mind set at a given time .
A mind set is developed by an individual ’s collective experiences .
What do feelings have to do with God ?
The word “ souls , ” used as you use it , is a man -made word that means nothing if you do n’t believe in it .
In fact I always looked at that word as something someone says to another for the purpose of selling Christianity , because if you do n’t believe in a soul how can you believe in heaven or hell ?
So to scare people into Christianity you have to convince them there is a heaven and hell and the belief in a soul is the hook line and sinker .
Dan NO SALE .
You did a good job of pointing out the obvious METAPHOR in the evolution designer example I created , but one thing Dan .
You are human living creature , not a super all knowing all seeing being who resides over heaven .
And if you believe in creation then I would ask you who created the creator ?
And then who crated that creator and so forth .
If you really believe in creationism then the buck does not stop at god .
But again you give up soon as it gets too complicated .
Man you are a weakling .
And I am sorry I do n’t spell well Mr. anal

DINOSAWS ?
Unbelievable .
Ok .
1 ) genetic mutations / combinations create different characteristics within a species .
2 ) advantages charateristics survive , disadvantageous ones do n't
3 ) the advantageous characteristics are passed on to the children .
4 ) over time a species ' adaptation to an evironment improves .
I mean seriously .
What 's not to understand ?
The mechinism is simple and irrefuteable .
There is a vast amount of mutually reinforcing evidence to confirm that over the millena , this is exactly what has happened ....
But religious people ( rather than looking at the evidence ) prefer to believe this stunted cabal of child - molesters and AIDS - encouragers ... based on the theories in a book written back in the Bronze Age .

I do n't claim to be an expert in Evolution .
I have studied it growing up as much as anyone else has .
I have had a one key observation about this subject .
Both Evolution and Creation require a guiding force .
I understand the theory of natural selection , but there is a disconnect in reasoning .
If there is no supreme being , then why are there people saying this : " natural selection decided that they could . "
A scientific theory cannot decide anything .
That is an intelligent characteristic .
kodijack may have mis-spoke , I 'm not sure .
But I think we all know deep down that this world has been designed at an incredible level of detail .
Edd , is unfortunately being very judgmental .
This frustrates me to no end .
He will not be sitting at the right hand of God.
That 's Jesus ' seat .
I apologize on his behalf .
I think all of you are really intelligent people .
I 'm not going to join the argument here , there are too many unknowns .
I just believe that if you approach the subject with an open mind , you will know that there is a creator .
That feeling you get when you see something breathtaking in nature is all the evidence you need .
The Bible talks about how we are made in God 's image .
I am a designer .
I love being creative , I think everyone does , in some way .
This is a characteristic we acquired from God .
I 'm not saying I have n't seen any scientific evidence .
There have been plenty of scientific experiments that support creation .
But there 's no sense in having the debate there because you have just as many studies that support forms of evolution .
I encourage you to pull back and really investigate creation as a possibility .
If you really do that completely , and with an open mind to it , you may believe that there is a loving God who created us in his image .
And he 's always wanted nothing more than to have a relationship with us , which he made possible through his son , Jesus Christ .
You may choose to not believe it .
But at least you 'd feel like you know what you believe , and what you do n't .
I 'm really impressed with the intensity of the conversation .
I think that comes from people who take ownership of what they believe .
I do not fault you for that .
Too many people go through life without ever investigating these things .

evolution is the best working theory for what is out there , god is a hypothesis , one man created in his own image many years ago when people were confused about the bright ball rising every morning .
telescopes and microscopes have shed some light and led to the current theories .
that is the scientific method .
form a hypothesis and test it .
all my tests on the god hypothesis have failed .
miserably i might add .

secondly , i never suggested ROCKS evolved , the opposite that they so it is stupiod to think that lizrds living among them need to .

You misspelled " coward " and " principles " .
Also , your post is excellent proof of my point .
" There are too many unknowns . "
We agree on that .
You , however propose that I look into it further , and not cop out by saying " God did it " .
The fact of the matter is : no one knows these " unknowns " .
Not even scientists .
That 's why it 's called evolutionary theory .
So , it 's not a matter of just studying it a little more .
If I did that , ( which I said I do in my post ) I would just be taking some guy 's word for it who has a " theory " .
So , in a round about way , your confusing post supports my idea that we can't know scientifically .
If we can't know scientifically ( there is no experiment that can prove the big - bang or any other theory of origin ) then it makes more sense to look into this issue on a heart level .
So , we are beings with feelings and souls .
We are each more than equipped to give credit where credit is due .
We look at a computer and say someone designed that .
We look at a brain and say that someone designed that a lot better than whoever designed a computer .
Also , you did an excellent job of articulating my point about being a designer .
You said : " You probably use basic design principals that you EVOLVE into your own work . "
This statement implies an individual with intent causing something to happen .
I 'm not nothing .
I 'm a person with a brain who has learned some tools that I put to use to design something visually .
This model works as a metaphor for a creator a million times better than Evolution .
So good job .

Munan -
God used clay to create us , however we were not made human and did not come to life until God breathed the breath of life into us .
Hence man became at that point a living soul .
If anyone wants to talk biology or science thats easy , pick up any biology book and the first thing they teach you is about the law of bio genesis - life cannot come from non living matter .
This is n't saying that it is n't likely it is saying it cannot happen period .
All I am saying is know what you believe , do n't just take what people teach you with a grain of salt and think you are more intellectual than someone who has different beliefs .
Learn both sides before taking one .

Rather than feeding the frenzy I 'll give you some new thoughts worth chewing .
Many creatures are n't aware that they blend into their environments .
Is n't that cool ?
They just do what they are supposed to .
Inanimate objects experience a form of perception too .
Humans perceive primarily using their senses filtered into meaning by the brain .
You can change this by meditating .
Other creatures communicate even more clearly than humans .
Consider a hive of bees or a school of dolphins .
God loves , creates , sustains and evolves life constantly .
The universe is full of life .
God evolved life on earth because he enjoys being alive in all the forms available .
God even enjoys being inanimate because even as a stone there is a challenge .
Jesus was and is the perfect human .
Jesus was completely in control of his challenges although totally human .
He controlled his human animal self with perfection and elegance .
He assumed his role and lived it until he actively and voluntarily gave it away .
He has the high score in the Game of Life .
We will always exist and return into an infinite number of forms .
It is pleasing to share these few moments of my human life with reading your pointless dialog .
Thanks !

" G- d " ?
Jesus , pal .
If you can't even type the name of your deity , then you 're nothing but a bullied little child .
And since when do rocks need to evolve to prove or disprove evolution ?
Rocks do n't meet any of the criteria for life ( do n't eat , procreate , do n't attempt to protect themselves , etc. ) .
The argument is idiotic on the face of it .
And , of course , Darwin NEVER claimed that humans evolved from apes .
He said only that we shared a common ancestor , way back in the day .
Something that probably resembled a tree sloth .
Try to get the facts straight , ya friggin ' moron .

Filthy bl00dy creationists .
There 's a post in there that is completely correct - you 're all cowards .
You all cower away from the size and scope of the universe , cowering away from the unknown .
Instead of formulating theories and striving to find out the actual answer you all just revert to the useless " it is because it is " or " because God made it that way " .
Learning scares you all , just like it scared others hundreds of years ago .
A good example is the flat - earth crap .
You all believed that back in the day eh ? and science proved you wrong .
But you 're really holding onto this evolution one because you 're all terrified that if you evolved , if you have common ancestry with other animals , then that means that you 're not " special " anymore .
It means that God did n't create YOU specifically , and you 're terrified of being normal .
With the size of the universe and all the stars out there why is it that you even think you WOULD be special , if if " He / She / It " did create you specifically ?
With all the room out there why would n't a God create more ?
And what makes you think humans would even be his favourites anyway ?
If there was a God then He / She / It would most likely have THOUSANDS of races on different planets , because if something is good enough to be able to create the universe , why the hell would they spend the rest of their time with a lowly single species ?
Creationists need to face FACTS not hide in the corner .
And new - earth - creationists should move away from their Russells Teapot beliefs and realise that even if there WAS a God , He / she / It 's probably not even interested in you .
Why would he be when there 's a whole Universe to explore ?

So I know of this Book , its Called The Holy Bible , Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth , King James Version has 774,746 words , 1188 chapters , and 31,103 versus .
In the Middle of the 1188 chapters is Psalms 118:8
It is better to trust in the Lord than to put comfidence in man .
Divide 1188 by 2 and you get 594 Pages.
592 , ( blank ) 593 , ( The New Testament ) , 594 ( Blank ) 595 ( The Gospel According to S. Matthew .
First Chapter is ...
" The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham . "
Its the second book of these instructions and all I used was a Little math by twos ....
Oh and Computers can only multiply by 2s as well Oh and life and death .
Mom and dad , ummm ...
Boy and Girl , two lungs two eyes , two ears , two hands ... ok im done with that , we were made from dirt , and our main life support is blood , which is high in iron .
Ev ev ev Evolution ...( scoffs ) I laugh at you , if that was true then this universe would not be .
Somthing Created us ,
Or shall I say some one , and this some one was Always , ( He ) Created , Us nothing created him .
God Is Just ,
Im not to question him on asking Who created you ?
But as any Soul
It takes a while to know who you are .
The First Sprit Ever Was GOD .
He said let there be light , and there was light .
Oh and if you dont belive life after death , Its imposible to not be .
Just take a while to ponder , get out of this " Oh , we are of nothing ! " or " what is real ? " " time is nothing . "
There is a Start and Finish .
And God Is forever
But warning you .
Try to see past that you will get lost in your own mind .
We are in Union With God .
Take care

I 've read a lot of good points on this site about creation and evolution .
I am Christian but I am also a firm believer in Evolution .
Science can provide me with answers , hard written fact , as to why a lizard looks the way it does , or why a certain species of animal has a form of communication .
The Bible does not provide me with the hard fact or science to back up some of their accusations .
I had a diehard Christian tell me everything about science was wrong .
When I asked him " Why ? " he replied , " Well , do you believe everything you read in a book ? "
I guess the answer would be yes , for both of us .
If he can preach the Bible to me , then I can believe in Evolution .
I also see a lot of the line , " God created man in his image . "
What if Man created God in his image ?
Humans are very basic in certain ways .
Humans need a guiding force or something to govern them , or they are lost .
It 's true in every circumstance .
That 's very basic psycolohgy .
I believe that men , women , and children developed God through stories and these grand dreams so as to have someone to fall back on when something went wrong , or just to have someone to follow in general .
God does get a lot of credit for wonderous happenings all over the world , but , what do people get when they do something great ?
Just seems a little suspicious that God would create such a flawed being in his image .
Men break commandments all the time and God is perfect .
How is it that we were created as imperfect ?
Just me .

G-D is the Jewish way of saying God .
The name of G - D is too holy to write out in full .
Doing so would be a desecration of his name .
But I would n't expect you to know that , with your nose stuck so far into the Bible .

BUT u all can feel it and u all know its there when the wind blowing and u know its give effect to thing around u.. this is same with Evolution ..u can see the animals changing in colour and shape .. this is show that how powerful is GOD ..
i know , i wont win u all but this is life ..GOD give us the power to choose , God give human a right to choose and he never force us , that is why Adam n Eve can and did the mistake ... if GOD want
He can just simply make the tree vanish and he can just make Adam n Eve to be away from doing the sin ..
But he did n't do that because compared to angel we have the power of choose what we want ... That is why there are so many religions in this world and not Christianity only ..
Because people choosing to go away from GOD and create new religion ... so choose rightly people ..

Gentleman some dignity .
We may not agree with each other , but by shouting tiles as if they were obscenities at each other we do n't make anybodies point any stronger or any more believable .
The reality is that it takes just as much faith to believe evolution than it does to believe creation .
I choose to believe creation because I see daily evidence of God in the " mysteries " of life and nature .

Woot a religious discussion ?!?
I 'm in !
Organized religion is a joke , and usually a scam .
Anybody who does a critical analysis could tell you that .
However , there is nothing wrong with faith .
I believe in God .
God clearly exists all around us , all the time .
He talks to us ( in the form of our conscious ) and he directs us ( in the form of fate ) .
You can argue until you are blue in the face but the simple fact is that God is not some omniscient being sitting on a cloud in heaven .
God is an idea and a moral guide for every single human being .
Call your conscious whatever you want .
I will call it God .
Both sides of this argument are so sick of having their beliefs attacked that you can't possibly blame them for being defensive .
Maybe you religious and non-religious folks should learn to just accept that different people have different views on faith .
I am happy with my beliefs .
I do n't pay an organization to tell me what I believe , because they could n't possibly begin to understand an individual 's mind with their strict edicts and teachings .
And I pity the poor child who has no God to direct their life .
God is just a symbol for good , and by outright stating that you do n't believe in God , you are simply telling us that you have no morals .
Must suck living in your shoes .
If you 're going to tell me there is no God , but " you know what is right " , or " you do n't need God for morals " then not only are you saying you do n't believe in right or wrong , you just know it and follow it ( or do n't ) , you are just as much a sheep in the masses as the religious zealot who blindly follows others teachings without asking questions .

LEAVE A MESSAGE Name : ( * optional ) Message :
Cologne 's Stadt - Anzeiger ( KSTA ) and the national tageszeitung ( taz ) newspapers reported Wednesday that Germany 's interior ministry wants to employ fake e-mails to allow agents to search private computers .
According to a 22 - page paper from the interior ministry ( a copy of which KSTA obtained ) , the plan would involve sending e-mails attached with Trojan horse malware to suspected terrorists .
The paper said that " sending e-mails under the names of other government authorities " could be employed in justified , exceptional cases .
The interior ministry distinguished between two types of searches : a one - time " perusal " of a computer , or long - term " surveillance . "
Tiny bits of information
Spying software has to be " customized "
The spying software would install itself onto a private computer and search for particular data , which would then be sent to criminal police computers as soon as the user goes online .
Only minimal data would be transmitted so as not to arouse the user 's suspicion .
Also , entries made onto keyboards could be monitored , which would allow agents to track passwords used to call up information on external servers .
Tageszeitung reported that the spying software could slip past anti-virus programs and firewalls used on private computers .
Tagesschau.de , the online portal of Germany 's ARD broadcaster , reported that in the 22 - page paper , the interior ministry answered questions posed by the justice ministry about searching computers linked to the Internet .
Apparently , the paper was intended as a basis for a technical discussion on Friday between experts from Germany 's ruling coalition of Social Democrats ( SPD ) and Christian Democrats ( CDU ) .
Warnings
BKA agent at anti-terror center in Berlin
The justice ministry has warned the interior ministry against implementing such a plan .
According to tagesschau.de , the justice ministry said that " manipulating mails from German government agencies could put general correspondence from those institutions at risk . "
Jörg Ziercke , the president of the Federal Criminal Police Office ( BKA ) , has downplayed concerns about Internet monitoring .
He said that the debate was intended to " instill fear " among the public .
He told German weekly magazine Stern that such " online monitoring " of terrorist suspects would only involve five to ten cases a year .
More , he said , would not be possible because the efforts involved in surveillance of one suspect were intense as " software must be customized for each case . "
German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble , who is a member of the conservative CDU , has pressed for new laws to combat terrorism .
Politicians are set to discuss legal questions surrounding such proposals this Friday .
The center - left SPD has meanwhile voiced criticism of Schäuble 's e-mail - Trojan surveillance plan .
Preparing for transfer :
The painful process begins Microsoft make it unnecessarily difficult to upgrade from an Xbox 360 to the Elite , says Bill Thompson .
I 'm an indulgent father , as any of my friends will attest , and I 'm also a bit of a gadget freak , so it is little surprise that my son was the lucky recipient of a cool black Xbox 360 Elite on his recent birthday .
He has been an Xbox user since the original console launched in 2002 , moving to the much more powerful 360 when it came out last year , enjoying games like Oblivion and Halo 3 and spending a lot of time on the online service , Xbox Live .
Now that Microsoft has started offering full game and film downloads from the Live Marketplace it seemed like a good idea to upgrade , since the Elite sports a reasonably sized 120 Gb hard drive compared to the frankly embarrassing 20 Gb of the original .
Having two consoles means that multi-player games will be a lot more fun when his friends come over , and may even give me a chance to improve my own rather minimal Halo skills and attempt the game in something other than " dorky dad " mode .
Unfortunately we have n't yet been able to experience the new console in all its HD glory because we 're waiting to transfer the game save files , themes , arcade games , episodes of Red v Blue and all the other stuff that Max has accumulated on the hard drive of his old console .
t trashes it , just in case you might be evil enough to want to keep it as a safe backup or access a saved game on the old console
Bill Thompson
There 's little point in setting up the new one without all of this stuff , and no point transferring Max's Xbox Live account onto the bigger machine until he can use it fully .
We can't just get on with the job because despite the fact that the Xbox 360 is bristling with USB sockets - you can even plug your iPod into the thing - and has an Ethernet port for network connectivity there is no way to get the two machines to talk to each other without a " magic " cable .
This is a special cable that you have to send away for by printing off a form and posting a letter .
It is n't even just a simple connection cable :
You have to remove your 20 Gb drive from your old Xbox , take the 120 Gb drive from your new Xbox , plug the 20 Gb drive into your new Xbox , plug the cable into the back - but not in the front - port on your new Xbox , plug the cable ?
it goes on and on and on .
And the process can take an hour or more , warns the Microsoft website , even for a paltry 20 Gb of data .
Let 's compare the process with buying a new Macintosh computer to replace an existing Mac .
When you turn on your new purchase it asks you if you 've got a Mac already and offers to clone it , copying files and settings simply , easily and quickly .
It is simple - when my friend Isabel dropped her Macbook and cracked the screen the day before a trip to China she managed to copy the whole system onto a new computer while we ate pizza together .
Transfer process
And if you copy your Mac then the old one is unchanged , so as long as you follow software licensing terms you can carry on using it .
Not the Xbox 360 , though , because once your data has been copied from the old to the new drive the transfer process erases the contents of your old drive .
That 's right .
It trashes it , just in case you might be evil enough to want to keep it as a safe backup or access a saved game on the old console .
Microsoft has decided not to allow you to do this , so you had better hope that your new drive does n't have a manufacturing fault .
Even when you 've done the transfer a lot of the stuff you copy will not work properly .
Arcade games and TV shows are transferred , but the licenses that allow you to play them are apparently associated with the serial number of the console , so they wo n't play on your new machine unless you are actually online and connected to Xbox Live .
And any film rentals will simply not be moved .
Oh , and there 's one last insult ; the cable you get has been specially designed for the purpose , so you 're supposed to use it once and then throw it away - or rather , dispose of it " in accordance with the Disposal of Waste and Electronic Equipment Guidelines " .
The simple fact is that the process could have been made simple and easy if Microsoft had chosen to do so .
The Xbox 360 is a computer , and they could write software that would let two consoles talk to each other over USB or Ethernet and copy files across .
But doing that would have created a way for owners to get direct access to the hard drives of the machines , and they might possibly have used that access to take control of the computer , something Microsoft cannot countenance .
Abuse possibility
They could have written a tool to let you de-authorise one Xbox from playing your content and authorising your new console , but that would have created a possibility of abuse and they would rather not bother and leave it to their customers to sort out the ensuing mess .
A console is a locked - down system , and the price of playing is to cede all control to the manufacturer , to accept the limitations they have put in place and to put up with the inconvenience and irritation of having to wait a week before you let your son play with his birthday present .
Microsoft are n't alone , of course .
Sony and Nintendo make strenuous efforts to keep their games systems closed , Apple has put a vast amount of effort into locking and relocking the iPhone , and we recently heard how Western Digital hard drives will refuse to share video or audio files over a network just in case doing so would breach copyright .
But the confusion , complication , waste and simple stupidity that Microsoft have introduced into what should be a straightforward upgrade process is the clearest possible demonstration of just what we lose when we cede control to the content owners .
I do n't think Max will be moving up to the next generation of Microsoft consoles when they emerge .
I do n't need the hassle .

Testimony the Senate Judiciary Committee Refused to Hear A male domestic violence victim asked to present testimony at the July 19 , 2005 Senate Judiciary Committee Hearings on reauthorizing VAWA .
If he had been permitted to testify , he would have discussed his experience of being excluded from services funded by the Violence Against Women
Act on the basis of his gender .
On the advice of his attorney , this individual has requested to remain anonymous for purposes of this on - line posting .
I am a heterosexual male victim of repeated female - perpetrated domestic violence .
All the incidents involve the same woman .
I first met the woman who committed repeated acts of domestic violence against me at our church .
Shortly after I married her I became a victim of her verbal and physical abuse .
Every loving kindness I showed to her was rewarded with scorn and derision .
During the first week of our marriage she began calling me names and using profanities against me .
She went into rages on a daily basis .
While enraged , she took on a stalking and hulking appearance .
She yelled and used profanity , and became entirely irrational .
She repeatedly damaged my property due to her violence and incessant slamming of doors and throwing my belongings around the house .
Living with her was unbearable .
I had to tiptoe around the house and try to stay out of her range since the first week of our marriage .
The most serious incident left me with a permanent injury to my left knee ( torn cartilage ) .
On that occasion , she threw things that were on top of my entertainment center onto the floor , and then she kept pummeling me with her fists on my arms and shoulders .
She then threw a wire basket and pan and several sharp long knives onto the floor .
She stormed into the dinning room and threw the telephone and an antique cigar box on the floor and then began banging a pewter dish repeatedly onto the floor .
I had been in the bedroom trying to stay away from her .
When I went into the living room she picked up a heavy book stand and hurled it at me with great force striking me in the knee .
The force of the blow swept my leg out from under me , and I fell on the floor .
I later required medical attention and got x-rays and crutches .
The left side of my left knee was swollen for over a month .
If any Senator or Congressman wishes to see proof of these injuries , I will be glad to provide a copy of the doctor 's report .
As I lay on the floor in agony , I told her that I was not going to take her abusive conduct any longer and that she had to clam down .
She then went to the kitchen and began sawing ( lightly dragging ) a steak knife across her wrist , while telling me that I was going to burn in hell .
I went to work on crutches for a week , but after no improvement I went to my medical provider to have my injury evaluated .
The doctor asked my how I had received the injuries and I told her I had been hit by a board .
The doctor never once asked if I had been hit by my wife , and never once mentioned the subject of domestic violence .
The doctor did ask a second time how I had received the injury and I told her I had been hit by a board , not wanting to get my wife in trouble .
The Violence Against Women
Act provides funding for trainings , which teach hospital personnel to ask injured women whether they were injured by a husband or boyfriend , and to probe further if they suspect a woman may be lying so as not to get her husband or boyfriend in trouble .
Clearly the doctor who treated me had been trained to be blind to the possibility that a man 's injuries could have been caused by his wife .
On another occasion , when I had an earache , my wife squirted a water bottle of chilled water at me , striking me in the ear .
On still another occasion , she struck me in the groin area with a bouquet of roses I 'd given her .
Another time when I 'd taken refuge in my station wagon in the back yard so I could get some sleep before going to work , she followed screaming and shouting , disturbing the entire neighborhood and causing me personal embarrassment .
On the one year anniversary of my mother 's death , she screamed at me , " Your parents are sh*t , " and then grabbed a 60 lb. wooden coffee table and flipped it over .
She then called the police and falsely accused me of having sprained her wrist .
My Pastor testified in a City Attorney hearing to how she had told him two versions of a story about about how her wrist had been injured .
Both versions were lies .
As a result of her phony report , I was falsely arrested and imprisoned .
The truth is I have never hurt her or threatened to hurt her , and never would .
The bruises she falsely swore to have been caused by me were yellow and obviously several days or weeks old , but the police did not arrest her for filing a false police report .
Would a man who made such an obviously false accusation have been given a free pass by the police , as she was ?
A mutual restraining order was later issued .
She violated this restraining order five times , and the police have done nothing .
I am quite certain that if I were to violate the restraining order even once , the police would arrest and incarcerate me .
Most male victims are conditioned , as I was , to “ take it like a man . ”
Indeed , when I served my country in Vietnam , an oft - repeated phrase bantered back and forth amongst the Marines on my ship was , “ Get tough or die . ”
It 's appalling to find that advice , which was intended to help our boys survive a war with the Viet Cong and NVA , is now also the best advice for any male victim of domestic violence who expects help under the current biased and discriminatory Violence Against Women Act .
After my wife threw the bookstand at me and caused permanent damage to my knee , I began to look everywhere I could think of for help .
I searched the web for any information I could find on domestic violence .
But every organization I found that said they help victims had a website explaining that domestic violence is caused by men exercising their “ male privilege ” in our “ patriarchal society ” .
So I did n't think they 'd believe me or want to help me if I told them my story .
I 've since heard battered women 's shelters claim that there 's no need for services for men because hardly any men approach them for help .
Perhaps my reaction to what I read on their websites and in their literature may help you understand why they 're the last place in the world that any man in need of help would want to approach .
A few years later , when I was no longer in such dire straits , I began to wonder whether it was really true that federally - funded domestic violence agencies were allowed to discriminate against men .
So I contacted 10 different VAWA - funded battered women 's shelters in and around Los Angeles to find out whether an abused man could find help there .
Each one treated me as if I were a perpetrator rather than a victim , and all admitted they did not provide services for men .
The abuse I suffered at my wife 's hands was bad enough .
But knowing that the system is not set up to help male victims , but rather is set up to re-victimize them , has left me psychologically devastated .
The fact of the matter is , that the system intended to help victims of domestic violence is badly broken .
It can only be fixed by changing the discriminatory Violence Against Women
Act into a gender inclusive Family Violence
Act which specifically states that funding shall be provided to programs primarily focused on helping male victims in an amount equal to any funding provided to programs primarily focused on helping female victims .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The cash registers were ringing on Black Friday , but make no mistake : American consumers are jittery , and seem all but certain to push the U.S. economy into recession .
After years of living happily beyond their means , Americans are finally facing financial reality .
A persistent rise in energy prices will mean bigger heating bills this winter and heftier tabs at the gas pump .
Job growth is slowing and wage gains have been anemic .
House prices are sliding , diminishing the value of the asset that 's the biggest factor in Americans ' personal wealth .
Even the stock market , which has been resilient for so long in the face of eroding consumer sentiment , has begun pulling back amid signs of deep distress in the financial sector .
The latest evidence of the long - awaited consumer retrenchment : Chic discounter Target ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) last week reported a weaker - than - expected third quarter , as sales of higher - margin apparel and home goods slowed .
Starbucks ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) reported for the first time that customer traffic in its stores declined in its latest quarter compared to a year earlier .
Wal - Mart ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) shares hit a six - year low in September after the retail giant posted another wan sales increase .
With consumer spending accounting for about three - quarters of U.S. economic activity , some economists say it is inevitable that the economy will stop growing at some point in the coming year , for the first time since the mild recession of 2001 .
" Right now , the question is how bad it 's going to get , " said David Rosenberg , chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch .
" The question is one of magnitude . "
Not everyone agrees .
Many economists believe the Federal Reserve will steer the economy into a period of slow growth but avoid a recession , which is typically defined as two or more consecutive quarters of economic contraction .
Indeed , the Fed already has twice cut its overnight interest - rate target , and options markets show investors expect the Fed to cut by another quarter - point at its Dec. 11 meeting , taking the Fed funds bank - lending rate down to 4.25 % .
Government officials have steered well clear of recession talk , with recent Fed documents citing instead the risk of " an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity . "
But Rosenberg and others are skeptical of the Fed 's influence on an economy staggering under a mountain of personal , corporate and government debt .
The economic recovery underway in 2002 was driven by low interest rates and abundant credit availability -- helped along by then - Fed chief Alan Greenspan 's decision to cut interest rates as low as 1 % in 2003 .
Rosenberg said the low rates and easy underwriting meant loans were available to just about anyone with a pulse , so recent economic gains were more credit - induced " by a factor of four " than any other U.S. expansion on record .
Now many of those loans are going bad , which is why investors are fleeing any debt riskier than U.S. Treasury securities .
Making matters worse , the banking system is coming under severe strain .
Wall Street has recognized more than $ 40 billion in losses this year on souring subprime mortgages and a related problem , the toxic debt known as collateralized debt obligations .
The losses could constrain the economy by forcing banks and brokerages to sock money away rather than lending it out to businesses and individuals .
Freddie Mac ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the big government - sponsored mortgage investor , provided some insight into that dynamic last week , when it said a $ 2 billion third - quarter loss had wiped away two - thirds of its regulatory capital surplus -- raising the prospect that the company will have to become a seller of mortgages at a time when the limping housing market desperately needs Freddie to be a buyer .
" The infection that started in housing is spreading , " said Northern Trust chief economist Paul Kasriel .
He says banks are extremely vulnerable to the defaults and foreclosures now sweeping American neighborhoods , with mortgage exposure amounting to 63 % of U.S. banks ' earning assets .
As a result of that exposure - and the hefty losses that financial institutions are going to have to take as more loans go bad -- Kasriel believes Fed chief Ben Bernanke is in a very different position than Greenspan was seven years ago , when the economy last showed signs of heading into recession .
" I'm wondering if Bernanke will have the same latitude " to cut rates , Kasriel said , referring both to the uncertain health of the banking system and the persistent weakness of the U.S. dollar , which is trading at lows unseen since the end of the gold standard in 1971 .
When Greenspan slashed U.S. interest rates in the early part of the decade , " the financial system was intact , " Kasriel said .
" Banks were able to extend cheap credit . "
But with banks choking on bad loans , Kasriel does n't expect to see the return of the easy lending standards that fueled the housing boom .
Instead , he expects to see " greater risk aversion " that will slow credit growth and reduce the value of assets like property .
He says the median U.S. house price would need to fall 17 % to return to its 2001 level , which he notes was hardly at the bottom of the house - price cycle .
A decline of that magnitude will further erode home - equity borrowing by Americans and , presumably , deliver one more blow to consumers ' wallets .
The American consumer seems to grasp the risks .
A growing number of Americans expect the economy to tip into recession in the next year -- 40 % last week , up from 31 % in October , going by a Reuters / Zogby poll released last week .
Rosenberg said government statistics show that 500,000 self - employed workers have lost their jobs since July -- a greater loss than was seen in all of 2001 .
Reported unemployment figures remain low , but Kasriel says those numbers " smell worse than a week - old fish . "
The combination of an emerging consumer recession and a heavily stressed financial system has some experts suggesting that a financial meltdown looms .
" In short , the financial markets are at a critical point , " fund manager John Hussman of the Hussman Funds wrote last week in a Web site post devoted to discussing a possible financial crisis .
" It 's possible that investors will somehow adopt a fresh willingness to speculate , but my impression is that in the weeks ahead , investors will be forced to recognize that the recession risk has tipped . "
Others are more direct .
Nouriel Roubini , an economics professor at New York University who has been predicting the collapse of the housing bubble for years , wrote recently that not only is a recession inevitable , he also sees " the risk of a severe and worsening liquidity and credit crunch leading to a generalized meltdown of the financial system of a severity and magnitude like we have never observed before . "
Such a meltdown , he writes , would include bank runs such as the one seen earlier this year at Britain 's Northern Rock and the bankruptcy of some broker - dealer firms .
That view is n't widely shared , of course .
Few expect Americans to find themselves out on the street corner soon selling apples .
Jim Griffin , an economist who writes for ING Investment Weekly in Hartford , Conn. , shuns recession forecasts as unreliable and believes worries about the nation and the financial system are mostly overstated .
Griffin sees this fall 's turmoil as " part of the next historical phase " in the global economy , as the U.S. shifts from driving world growth to riding behind developing nations .
He expects U.S. export growth to help cushion the blows dealt by the housing bust and related bad debt .
Merrill Lynch 's Rosenberg is less sanguine than Griffin , but he too discounts the voices of doom .
" We 've had consumer recessions before , " Rosenberg said .
" The world does n't end . "
Let 's hope not .
As I watched the debate on Mukasey 's confirmation Last night on CSPAN and listend to Schumer equivocate and listened to the Republicans praise a man who says he does n't know if multiple repetitions of artificially induced drowning is torture , I thought ... it's over ... The United States Senate has formally endorsed torture .
There is no more moral high ground .
Through all the searing revelations about Abu Ghraib prison ... and the tales of extraordinary renditions and all of it , there was , in my mind , a spark of hope that our elected representatives would rebuke these practices and start us back on the road to once again being a beacon of morality .
Not perfect ... but at least committed to the just and moral path in the treatment of our fellow human beings .
Last night ,
The US Senate flushed America down the toilet and invited all the world to the ceremony .
And , we gave our enemies carte blanche to treat our loved ones , civilian or military , like pieces of meat if they are captured or taken hostage .
All Republicans present for the vote voted to confirm ... no surprise .
Here are the Democrats who voted YEA for Mukasey :
Bayh ( D - IN )
Carper ( D - DE )
Feinstein ( D - CA )
Landrieu ( D - LA )
Nelson ( D - NE )
Schumer ( D - NY )
And here are the wimps who chose not to vote :
Alexander ( R - TN )
Biden ( D - DE )
Clinton ( D - NY )
Cornyn ( R - TX )
Dodd ( D - CT ) McCain ( R - AZ )
Obama ( D - IL )
All I could think of while I watched these folks mill around on the floor of the Senate smiling and laughing while the votes were called , was House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Lantos '( D - CA ) recent remarks to the CEO of YAHOO regarding their collaboration in the jailing of Chinese journalists .
Lantos angrily said
" While technologically and financially you are giants , morally you are pygmies . "
Everyone who voted to confirm Mukasey is just that ... a moral pygmy .
And those who chose not to vote ... including CLINTON , DODD , OBAMA , BIDEN and McCain ( can you believe it ) ... You 're not just moral pygmies , you 're gutless moral pygmies .
And you want to be OUR president ?
Take a hike ... all of you !
Suppose that human beings had absolutely no idea how they performed arithmetic .
Imagine that human beings had evolved , rather than having learned , the ability to count sheep and add sheep .
People using this built - in ability have no idea how it worked , the way Aristotle had no idea how his visual cortex supported his ability to see things .
Peano Arithmetic as we know it has not been invented .
There are philosophers working to formalize numerical intuitions , but they employ notations such as
Plus - Of ( Seven , Six ) = Thirteen
to formalize the intuitively obvious fact that when you add " seven " plus " six " , of course you get " thirteen " .
In this world , pocket calculators work by storing a giant lookup table of arithmetical facts , entered manually by a team of expert Artificial Arithmeticians , for starting values that range between zero and one hundred .
While these calculators may be helpful in a pragmatic sense , many philosophers argue that they 're only simulating addition , rather than really adding .
No machine can really count - that 's why humans have to count thirteen sheep before typing " thirteen " into the calculator .
Calculators can recite back stored facts , but they can never know what the statements mean - if you type in " two hundred plus two hundred " the calculator says " Error : Outrange " , when it 's intuitively obvious , if you know what the words mean , that the answer is " four hundred " .
Philosophers , of course , are not so naive as to be taken in by these intuitions .
Numbers are really a purely formal system - the label " thirty - seven " is meaningful , not because of any inherent property of the words themselves , but because the label refers to thirty - seven sheep in the external world .
A number is given this referential property by its semantic network of relations to other numbers .
That 's why , in computer programs , the LISP token for " thirty - seven " does n't need any internal structure - it 's only meaningful because of reference and relation , not some computational property of " thirty - seven " itself .
No one has ever developed an Artificial General Arithmetician , though of course there are plenty of domain - specific , narrow Artificial Arithmeticians that work on numbers between " twenty " and " thirty " , and so on .
And if you look at how slow progress has been on numbers in the range of " two hundred " , then it becomes clear that we 're not going to get Artificial General Arithmetic any time soon .
The best experts in the field estimate it will be at least a hundred years before calculators can add as well as a human twelve - year - old .
But not everyone agrees with this estimate , or with merely conventional beliefs about Artificial Arithmetic .
It 's common to hear statements such as the following :
" It 's a framing problem - what ' twenty - one plus ' equals depends on whether it's ' plus three ' or ' plus four ' .
If we can just get enough arithmetical facts stored to cover the common - sense truths that everyone knows , we 'll start to see real addition in the network . "
" But you 'll never be able to program in that many arithmetical facts by hiring experts to enter them manually .
What we need is an Artificial Arithmetician that can learn the vast network of relations between numbers that humans acquire during their childhood by observing sets of apples . "
" No , what we really need is an Artificial Arithmetician that can understand natural language , so that instead of having to be explicitly told that twenty - one plus sixteen equals thirty - seven , it can get the knowledge by exploring the Web . "
" Frankly , it seems to me that you 're just trying to convince yourselves that you can solve the problem .
None of you really know what arithmetic is , so you 're floundering around with these generic sorts of arguments .
' We need an AA that can learn X ' , ' We need an AA that can extract X from the Internet ' .
I mean , it sounds good , it sounds like you 're making progress , and it 's even good for public relations , because everyone thinks they understand the proposed solution - but it does n't really get you any closer to general addition , as opposed to domain - specific addition .
Probably we will never know the fundamental nature of arithmetic .
The problem is just too hard for humans to solve . "
" That 's why we need to develop a general arithmetician the same way Nature did - evolution . "
" Top - down approaches have clearly failed to produce arithmetic .
We need a bottom - up approach , some way to make arithmetic emerge .
We have to acknowledge the basic unpredictability of complex systems . "
" You 're all wrong .
Past efforts to create machine arithmetic were futile from the start , because they just did n't have enough computing power .
If you look at how many trillions of synapses there are in the human brain , it 's clear that calculators do n't have lookup tables anywhere near that large .
We need calculators as powerful as a human brain .
According to Moore 's Law , this will occur in the year 2031 on April 27 between 4:00 and 4:30 in the morning . "
" I believe that machine arithmetic will be developed when researchers scan each neuron of a complete human brain into a computer , so that we can simulate the biological circuitry that performs addition in humans . "
" I do n't think we have to wait to scan a whole brain .
Neural networks are just like the human brain , and you can train them to do things without knowing how they do them .
We 'll create programs that will do arithmetic without we , our creators , ever understanding how they do arithmetic . "
" But Gödel 's Theorem shows that no formal system can ever capture the basic properties of arithmetic .
Classical physics is formalizable , so to add two and two , the brain must take advantage of quantum physics . "
" Hey , if human arithmetic were simple enough that we could reproduce it in a computer , we would n't be able to count high enough to build computers . "
" Have n't you heard of John Searle 's Chinese Calculator Experiment ?
Even if you did have a huge set of rules that would let you add ' twenty - one ' and ' sixteen ' , just imagine translating all the words into Chinese , and you can see that there 's no genuine addition going on .
There are no real numbers anywhere in the system , just labels that humans use for numbers ... "
There is more than one moral to this parable , and I have told it with different morals in different contexts .
It illustrates the idea of levels of organization , for example - a CPU can add two large numbers because the numbers are n't black - box opaque objects , they 're ordered structures of 32 bits .
But for purposes of overcoming bias , let us draw two morals :
First , the danger of believing assertions you can't regenerate from your own knowledge .
Second , the danger of trying to dance around basic confusions .
Lest anyone accuse me of generalizing from fictional evidence , both lessons may be drawn from the real history of Artificial Intelligence as well .
The first danger is the object - level problem that the AA devices ran into : they functioned as tape recorders playing back " knowledge " generated from outside the system , using a process they could n't capture internally .
A human could tell the AA device that " twenty - one plus sixteen equals thirty - seven " , and the AA devices could record this sentence and play it back , or even pattern - match " twenty - one plus sixteen " to output " thirty - seven ! " , but the AA devices could n't generate such knowledge for themselves .
Which is strongly reminiscent of believing a physicist who tells you " Light is waves " , recording the fascinating words and playing them back when someone asks " What is light made of ? " , without being able to generate the knowledge for yourself .
More on this theme tomorrow .
The second moral is the meta - level danger that consumed the Artificial Arithmetic researchers and opinionated bystanders - the danger of dancing around confusing gaps in your knowledge .
The tendency to do just about anything except grit your teeth and buckle down and fill in the damn gap .
Whether you say , " It is emergent ! " , or whether you say , " It is unknowable ! " , in neither case are you acknowledging that there is a basic insight required which is possessable , but unpossessed by you .
How can you know when you 'll have a new basic insight ?
And there 's no way to get one except by banging your head against the problem , learning everything you can about it , studying it from as many angles as possible , perhaps for years .
It 's not a pursuit that academia is set up to permit , when you need to publish at least one paper per month .
It 's certainly not something that venture capitalists will fund .
You want to either go ahead and build the system now , or give up and do something else instead .
Look at the comments above : none are aimed at setting out on a quest for the missing insight which would make numbers no longer mysterious , make " twenty - seven " more than a black box .
None of the commenters realized that their difficulties arose from ignorance or confusion in their own minds , rather than an inherent property of arithmetic .
They were not trying to achieve a state where the confusing thing ceased to be confusing .
If you read Judea Pearl 's " Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems : Networks of Plausible Inference " then you will see that the basic insight behind graphical models is indispensable to problems that require it .
( It 's not something that fits on a T - Shirt , I 'm afraid , so you 'll have to go and read the book yourself .
I have n't seen any online popularizations of Bayesian networks that adequately convey the reasons behind the principles , or the importance of the math being exactly the way it is , but Pearl 's book is wonderful . )
There were once dozens of " non-monotonic logics " awkwardly trying to capture intuitions such as " If my burglar alarm goes off , there was probably a burglar , but if I then learn that there was a small earthquake near my home , there was probably not a burglar . "
With the graphical - model insight in hand , you can give a mathematical explanation of exactly why first - order logic has the wrong properties for the job , and express the correct solution in a compact way that captures all the common - sense details in one elegant swoop .
Until you have that insight , you 'll go on patching the logic here , patching it there , adding more and more hacks to force it into correspondence with everything that seems " obviously true " .
You wo n't know the Artificial Arithmetic problem is unsolvable without its key .
If you do n't know the rules , you do n't know the rule that says you need to know the rules to do anything .
And so there will be all sorts of clever ideas that seem like they might work , like building an Artificial Arithmetician that can read natural language and download millions of arithmetical assertions from the Internet .
And yet somehow the clever ideas never work .
Somehow it always turns out that you " could n't see any reason it would n't work " because you were ignorant of the obstacles , not because no obstacles existed .
Like shooting blindfolded at a distant target - you can fire blind shot after blind shot , crying , " You ca n't prove to me that I wo n't hit the center ! "
But until you take off the blindfold , you 're not even in the aiming game .
When " no one can prove to you " that your precious idea is n't right , it means you do n't have enough information to strike a small target in a vast answer space .
Until you know your idea will work , it wo n't .
From the history of previous key insights in Artificial Intelligence , and the grand messes which were proposed prior to those insights , I derive an important real - life lesson :
When the basic problem is your ignorance , clever strategies for bypassing your ignorance lead to shooting yourself in the foot .
